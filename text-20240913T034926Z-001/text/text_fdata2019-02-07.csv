update on economic and monetary developments summary the incoming information that has become available since the governing council s decision to end net asset purchases in december 2018 has continued to be weaker than expected on account of softer external demand and some country and sector specific factors in particular the persistence of uncertainties relating to geopolitical factors and the threat of protectionism is weighing on economic sentiment at the same time supportive financing conditions favourable labour market dynamics and rising wage growth continue to underpin the euro area expansion and gradually rising inflation pressures this underlying strength of the economy supports the governing council s confidence in the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below but close to 2 over the medium term nevertheless significant monetary policy stimulus remains essential to support the further build up of domestic price pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term this will be provided by the governing council s forward guidance on the key ecb interest rates reinforced by the reinvestments of the sizeable stock of acquired assets the governing council confirmed that it stands ready to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate to ensure that inflation continues to move towards the governing council s inflation aim in a sustained manner the global economic growth momentum has slowed recently amid geopolitical uncertainties and vulnerabilities in emerging markets global trade decelerated towards the end of 2018 as downside risks related to unresolved trade disputes remained prominent and growth in emerging markets slowed down while financial conditions are favourable overall the weaker global growth momentum has fuelled stock market volatility a more accommodative monetary policy stance has been taken in china in the light of the slowing growth momentum euro area government bond yields declined somewhat as global risk free rates decreased and sovereign bond spreads in the euro area remained stable despite heightened intra period volatility equity prices in the euro area stayed overall broadly unchanged similarly yield spreads on corporate bonds increased only modestly in foreign exchange markets the euro depreciated in trade weighted terms euro area real gdp increased by 0 2 quarter on quarter in the third quarter of 2018 following growth of 0 4 in the previous two quarters incoming data have continued to be weaker than expected resulting from a slowdown in external demand which was compounded by several country and sector specific factors while the impact of some of these factors is expected to fade the near term growth momentum is likely to be weaker than previously anticipated looking ahead the euro area expansion will continue to be supported by favourable financing conditions further employment gains and rising wages lower energy prices and the ongoing albeit somewhat slower expansion in global activity euro area annual hicp inflation declined to 1 6 in december 2018 from 1 9 in november reflecting mainly lower energy price inflation on the basis of current futures prices for oil headline inflation is likely to decline further over the coming months measures of underlying inflation remain generally muted but labour cost pressures are continuing to strengthen and broaden amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets looking ahead underlying inflation is expected to increase over the medium term supported by the ecb s monetary policy measures the ongoing economic expansion and rising wage growth overall the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook have moved to the downside on account of the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors and the threat of protectionism vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility the monetary analysis shows that broad money m3 growth decreased to 3 7 in november 2018 after 3 9 in october m3 growth continues to be backed by bank credit creation the narrow monetary aggregate m1 remained the main contributor to broad money growth the annual growth rate of loans to non financial corporations stood at 4 0 in november 2018 after 3 9 in october while the annual growth rate of loans to households remained broadly unchanged at 3 3 the euro area bank lending survey for the fourth quarter of 2018 suggests that overall bank lending conditions remained favourable following an extended period of net easing and demand for bank credit continued to rise thereby underpinning loan growth the outcome of the economic analysis and the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is still necessary for the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below but close to 2 over the medium term based on this assessment the governing council decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged and continues to expect them to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019 and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below but close to 2 over the medium term regarding non standard monetary policy measures the governing council confirmed that the eurosystem will continue to reinvest in full the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme for an extended period of time past the date when the governing council starts raising the key ecb interest rates and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation external environment economic indicators signal a moderation in global growth momentum the global composite output purchasing managers index pmi excluding the euro area weakened in late 2018 see chart 1 mainly owing to a continued deceleration in global manufacturing activity the services sector remained more resilient than manufacturing notwithstanding some volatility in the figures consumer confidence has declined recently albeit from high levels chart 1 global composite output pmi diffusion index sources haver analytics markit and ecb calculations notes the latest observations are for december 2018 long term average refers to the period from january 1999 to december 2018 downside risks to global activity have been increasing and a further escalation of trade disputes could weigh on global growth while the postponement of further tariff increases by the united states and china has sent a positive signal considerable uncertainty remains as to whether the negotiations will lead to a significant de escalation of us chinese trade tensions other downside risks relate to a faster tightening of global financial conditions and broader stress in emerging markets uncertainties regarding china s economic prospects as well as political and geopolitical uncertainties including risks related to brexit financial conditions remain accommodative overall while concerns over us and global economic activity have fuelled stock market volatility in china fiscal policy and monetary policy have eased in response to a weakening in particular of the manufacturing sector market expectations of further interest rate increases in the united states have eased somewhat amid a further decline in treasury yields partly reflecting developments in term premia looking ahead the federal open market committee fomc is proceeding with its gradual policy normalisation albeit against a more cautious economic outlook and a slightly lower interest rate path projection global trade momentum decelerated towards the end of 2018 global merchandise imports weakened in october while in december the global pmi for new export orders pointed for the fourth consecutive month to a contraction see chart 2 high frequency trade data for china weakened considerably towards the end of 2018 possibly signalling that the trade tensions between the united states and china are affecting manufacturing sentiment in both economies and are adversely impacting global trade growth chart 2 surveys and global trade in goods left hand scale three month on three month percentage changes right hand scale diffusion index sources markit cpb netherlands bureau for economic policy analysis and ecb calculations note the latest observations are for october 2018 for global merchandise imports and december 2018 for the pmis global inflation slowed in november annual consumer price inflation in the countries of the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd moderated to 2 7 in november largely as a result of easing energy prices while inflation excluding food and energy decreased marginally to 2 2 global inflationary pressures are expected to remain contained wage growth in advanced economies continues to be moderate despite a tightening of labour markets and rising capacity constraints oil markets have remained broadly stable oil prices declined in the fourth quarter of 2018 mainly on account of oversupply fears related to the waivers on the us sanctions on iranian oil exports coupled with continued high production growth in the united states these effects initially outweighed the possible price effects of production cuts by opec and a group of allied oil producing nations particularly because market uncertainty persisted regarding the cuts agreed on 7 december 2018 however prices recovered after data releases indicated lower than expected production levels and brent crude oil prices stood at usd 61 per barrel on 22 january non oil commodity prices have increased slightly mainly on the back of food price increases the us economy recorded strong growth in 2018 in the context of a pro cyclical fiscal stimulus but lower confidence and weaker than expected data have clouded the growth outlook real gdp growth expanded at an annualised rate of 3 4 in the third quarter of 2018 well above potential albeit slowing from 4 2 in the previous quarter on the back of declining net exports and decelerating private fixed investment the us government shutdown has added to the uncertainty generated by us trade policy in respect of china and is temporarily weighing on us economic activity in the near term headline consumer price inflation declined to 1 9 in november due to a sharp deceleration in energy prices while average hourly earnings remained strong against this background the fomc raised the federal funds rate target range at its december 2018 meeting by 25 basis points as expected and slightly lowered its projections for gdp growth and core inflation for the next years in japan real gdp for the fourth quarter of 2018 is set to return to positive growth but inflation remains weak volatility in gdp in 2018 was mainly due to the impact of natural disasters and extreme weather conditions looking ahead the economy is expected to remain on a moderate growth path supported by highly accommodative monetary policy and the domestic capital expenditure cycle the reflation momentum in the economy has weakened with inflation excluding energy and food declining marginally due to the recent softening of oil prices and the appreciation of the yen in the united kingdom growth looks set to decline after a robust outturn in the third quarter of 2018 the strong quarter on quarter growth of 0 6 in the third quarter reflected a temporary boost to consumption and public investment as well as a strong rebound in exports however business investment fell for the third consecutive quarter overall activity is expected to remain muted in the medium term annual cpi inflation decreased slightly to 2 1 in december resulting in a fourth quarter average of 2 3 following strong declines in previous months the chinese economy is losing growth momentum with the manufacturing sector in particular showing signs of weakening in december 2018 the manufacturing pmi dropped below 50 for the first time since 2017 while the services sector less exposed to the us trade tensions was more resilient the people s bank of china enacted new policies to cushion the slowdown including a 100 basis point reduction in the required reserve ratio in early january and a new lending facility to support small firms in december new fiscal policy measures are also expected although fiscal spending by local governments may face constraints annual headline cpi inflation fell to 1 9 in december reflecting a lower contribution from non food items while core inflation remained steady producer price index inflation decelerated sharply to 0 9 in the same month in response to lower oil and commodity prices and also to the slowdown in chinese manufacturing activity financial developments long term yields have declined in the euro area and in the united states during the period under review from 13 december 2018 to 23 january 2019 the gdp weighted euro area ten year sovereign bond yield fell to 0 98 down 9 basis points as global risk free rates

spreads for spanish and portuguese sovereign bonds were broadly unchanged during the review period at 72 basis points and 100 basis points respectively italian spreads decreased by 8 basis points but remained at elevated levels around 2 17 german spreads increased by 6 basis points to 0 37 and french spreads increased by 1 basis point to 0 04 broad indices of euro area equity prices are overall broadly unchanged despite heightened market volatility around the turn of the year over the review period equity prices of euro area banks and non financial corporations increased by around 1 elevated levels of global uncertainty coupled with negative macroeconomic surprises led to a broad based sell off across jurisdictions and a heightened level of volatility exacerbated by temporarily low liquidity around the turn of the year thereafter equity markets partly recovered from earlier losses and volatility became more muted euro area corporate bond spreads widened somewhat over the review period since december the spread on investment grade nfc bonds relative to the risk free rate has increased by around 2 basis points to stand at 95 basis points yields on financial sector debt have also increased slightly resulting in a widening of the spread of around 2 basis points to 120 basis points overall despite a gradual increase in 2018 corporate bond spreads still remain below the levels observed in march 2016 prior to the announcement and subsequent launch of the corporate sector purchase programme the euro overnight index average eonia was on average 36 basis points over the review period excess liquidity declined by around 43 billion to around 1 847 billion this decline was mainly driven by an increase in net autonomous factors and to a lesser extent early repayments in the second series of targeted longer term refinancing operations tltro ii the eonia forward curve shifted downwards somewhat over the review period the curve remains below zero for horizons prior to 2021 reflecting market expectations of a prolonged period of negative interest rates in foreign exchange markets the euro has depreciated in trade weighted terms see chart 4 over the review period the nominal effective exchange rate of the euro measured against the currencies of 38 of the euro area s most important trading partners depreciated by 1 0 this resulted from a broad based depreciation of the euro against most major currencies in particular the euro depreciated against the japanese yen by 3 4 and the british pound by 2 9 while it was broadly unchanged against the us dollar the euro also weakened against the chinese renminbi by 1 4 and the currencies of other major emerging economies including the turkish lira the brazilian real and the russian rouble which continued to recover

headline unemployment rate declined to 7 9 in november the lowest level seen since october 2008 after being flat for three months see chart 6 survey indicators weakened in the last quarter of 2018 and

household income and consumer spending private consumption rose by 0 1 quarter on quarter in the third quarter of 2018 following a similar rate of expansion in the previous quarter temporary bottlenecks in car production following the introduction of the new worldwide harmonised light vehicle test procedure wltp had an adverse impact on economic activity and in particular the consumption of durable goods growth of consumption of non durable goods i e food and energy also slowed down as this component of consumer spending has arguably been more sensitive to past increases in oil prices and oil prices weakened in the fourth quarter its weakness is also to some extent of a more temporary nature by contrast in line with strong growth in the real compensation of employees consumption of services the largest component of consumer spending remained robust despite the recent deceleration in growth private consumption is expected to regain momentum going forward recent data on the volume of retail sales and new passenger car registrations point to slow but steady growth in consumer spending in the fourth quarter of 2018 other indicators however support the picture of more resilient consumption dynamics the latest survey results signal further labour market improvements which should continue to support household income and consumer spending moreover households net worth continued to increase at robust rates in the third quarter although consumer confidence has been on a broadly declining trend since the end of 2017 it still stands above its long term average following a strong second quarter in 2018 investment growth slowed in the third quarter following a rate of 1 8 quarter on quarter in the second quarter non construction investment grew by 1 2 in the third quarter driven by machinery and equipment intellectual property products ipp and transport equipment the decline in growth would have been stronger had it not been for a special effect associated with r d and ipp investment in ireland quarterly growth in construction investment moderated to 0 2 supported by dynamic residential investment growth at 0 7 for the fourth quarter of 2018 short term indicators point to continued growth in october and november monthly data on capital goods production stood on average at the same level as in the third quarter when growth was 0 9 on a quarterly basis which points to a further slowdown in non construction growth indicators such as capacity utilisation confidence and new orders are also consistent with slower growth in the fourth quarter with regard to construction investment construction production contracted in october and november while pmi and confidence indices for the construction sector up to december still pointed to continued but moderating growth in the fourth quarter of 2018 investment is expected to continue to grow though at a slowing pace the slightly declining path expected for non construction investment growth will be driven by weakening domestic and foreign demand as well as decreasingly favourable financial conditions also profits which are firms main source of funding for investment seem to be growing at a declining rate according to the euro area sectoral accounts for the third quarter of 2018 non financial corporations gross operating surplus slowed strongly in year on year terms moreover uncertainties surrounding brexit trade protectionism and the general outlook for global growth inter alia may already be proving unfavourable to investment decisions as regards construction investment households increasing intentions to buy or renovate constructors buoyant price and employment expectations and stable issuance of building permits amid persistent limits from labour shortages and insufficient demand point to a positive but softening momentum in the construction sector going forward after disappointing in the third quarter growth in euro area foreign trade appears set to decline further in the fourth quarter of 2018 the pace of euro area export growth slowed down substantially to 0 1 in the third quarter whereas growth in imports eased to 1 0 as a result net trade exerted a drag on economic activity with a large negative contribution to gdp growth of 0 4 percentage point based on information up to november euro area foreign trade is assessed as having further weakened in the fourth quarter reflecting a moderation in growth in intra euro area trade amid weak foreign demand the expansion of export volumes of goods obtained by deflating trade values by producer price indices remained very moderate at 0 8 quarter on quarter while import growth is likely to have undergone a correction to 0 8 in the fourth quarter survey indicators with leading properties for trade such as the purchasing managers index pmi for new manufacturing export orders and the european commission s assessment of export order book levels also anticipate a gloomier outlook towards the end of the year incoming data have been weaker than expected reflecting a diminishing contribution from external demand and some country and sector specific factors while some of these factors are likely to unwind this may suggest some slower growth momentum ahead following growth of close to zero in october industrial production excluding construction declined by 1 7 month on month in november as a result on average over these two months production stood 0 7 below the level seen in the third quarter of 2018 when it declined by 0 1 on a quarterly basis the weak november outcome was broadly based across the main industrial groupings as well as the largest euro area countries more timely survey data signal continued moderate growth but at rates lower than those seen during the first half of last year the composite output pmi averaged 52 3 in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared with 54 3 in the third quarter while the european commission s economic sentiment indicator esi eased to 108 8 from 111 5 between the same quarters see chart 5 while the esi has continued to stand above its long term average the pmi is now below its historical average looking ahead the euro area expansion will continue to be supported by favourable financing conditions in addition growth should also be underpinned by further employment gains and rising wages lower energy prices and the ongoing albeit somewhat slower expansion in global activity box 2 elaborates further on factors that are expected to either underpin or adversely affect domestic activity going forward the results of the latest round of the ecb survey of professional forecasters conducted in early january show that the gdp growth forecasts made by the private sector were revised downwards for 2019 and 2020 compared with the previous round conducted in early october the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook have moved to the downside the more negative risk assessment reflects the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors and the threat of protectionism vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility prices and costs euro area annual hicp inflation was 1 6 in december 2018 down from 1 9 in november see chart 7 this decrease mainly reflected lower energy price inflation and also to a lesser extent lower food price inflation the decline in headline inflation since its peak in october 2018 was largely due to energy inflation which was pushed down by a base effect and the impact of recent declines in oil prices the decline in oil prices and the corresponding futures prices after mid november was more substantial than had been expected in the december 2018 eurosystem staff projections this mechanically implies a weaker short run outlook for headline inflation see the box entitled the mechanical impact of changes in oil price assumptions on projections for euro area hicp energy inflation in this issue of the economic bulletin chart 7 contributions of components of euro area headline hicp inflation annual percentage changes percentage point contributions sources eurostat and ecb calculations note the latest observations are for december 2018 measures of underlying inflation have been moving sideways recently but stand above earlier lows hicp inflation excluding energy and food was 1 0 in december unchanged from november the same holds for hicp inflation excluding energy food and highly volatile components such as travel related items clothing and footwear in recent months broadly sideways developments were also evident in two model based measures of underlying inflation the persistent and common component of inflation indicator and the supercore indicator nonetheless each of the statistical and model based measures remained higher than their respective lows in 2016 supply chain price pressures for hicp non energy industrial goods remained resilient despite further weakness in the early stages of the chain price pressures in the early stages continued to weaken the annual rate of change of oil prices in euro was 4 9 in december down from 9 7 in november and 43 8 in october and the annual rate of change of raw material prices was 0 4 in december down from 4 8 and 6 2 the previous two months in the later stages of the supply chain import price inflation for non food consumer goods continued to strengthen in november and so remained substantially higher than its lows in early 2018 domestic producer price inflation for non food consumer goods increased further to 0 9 in november its highest rate since april 2012 and above its long term average of 0 6 overall price pressures in the later stages of the supply chain for industrial goods remained steady albeit with a risk of the continued weakness in the early stages filtering through rising labour cost pressures did not translate into further increases in overall domestic price pressures recently as they were buffered by profit margins price pressures from labour costs continued to intensify in the third quarter of 2018 due to higher growth in compensation per employee as well as weaker growth in productivity still the annual percentage change in the gdp deflator remained stable at 1 4 in the first three quarters of 2018 as the overall weakening in the cyclical momentum of the economy together with deteriorations in the terms of trade related particularly to the past increases in oil prices weighed on profit margin developments these latest developments in the gdp deflator and its decomposition are characteristic of a more mature phase of a demand driven recovery both market based and survey based measures of longer term inflation expectations declined the five year forward inflation linked swap rate five years ahead stood at 1 54 on 23 january 2019 around 9 basis points lower than the level that prevailed in mid december the forward profile of market based measures of inflation expectations continues to point towards a prolonged period of low inflation with a very gradual return to inflation levels below but close to 2 see chart 8 the risk neutral probability of negative average inflation over the next five years implied by inflation options markets remains negligible which suggests that markets currently consider the risk of deflation to be very low the results of the ecb survey of professional forecasters spf for the first quarter of 2019 show average headline inflation expectations for the euro area of 1 5 in 2019 1 6 in 2020 and 1 7 in 2021 this represents downward revisions of 0 2 and 0 1 percentage point to 2019 and 2020 respectively compared with the previous survey mainly attributable to oil price developments according to the spf average longer term inflation expectations were 1 8 a downward revision of 0 1 percentage point chart 8 market and survey based measures of inflation expectations annual percentage changes sources ecb survey of professional forecasters spf eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area and consensus economics notes the spf survey for the first quarter of 2019 was conducted between 7 and 11 january 2019 the market implied curve is based on the one year spot inflation rate and the one year forward rate one year ahead the one year forward rate two years ahead the one year forward rate three years ahead and the one year forward rate four years ahead the latest observations for market implied inflation are for 23 january 2019 residential property prices in the euro area continued to rise in the third quarter of 2018 according to the ecb s residential property price indicator prices for houses and flats in the euro area increased by 4 3 year on year in the third quarter of 2018 compared with 4 2 and 4 3 in the second and first quarters of 2018 respectively the data for the first three quarters of 2018 thus imply a sideways movement at robust rates of growth money and credit broad money growth moderated in november the annual growth rate of m3 decreased to 3 7 in november from 3 9 in october see chart 9 the reduction in net asset purchases from 80 billion to 60 billion in april 2017 to 30 billion in january 2018 and then to 15 billion in october 2018 has led to a smaller positive impact of the app on m3 growth the annual growth rate of m1 which again made a significant contribution to broad money growth decreased to 6 7 in november down from 6 8 in october money growth continued to be bolstered by sustained economic expansion and the low opportunity cost of holding the most liquid instruments in an environment of very low interest rates chart 9 m3 and its counterparts annual percentage changes contributions in percentage points adjusted for seasonal and calendar effects source ecb notes credit to the private sector includes mfi loans to the private sector and mfi holdings of securities issued by the euro area private non mfi sector as such it also covers the eurosystem s purchases of non mfi debt securities under the corporate sector purchase programme the latest observation is for november 2018 credit to the private sector remained the largest driver of broad money growth from a counterpart perspective the positive contribution to m3 growth from general government securities held by the eurosystem decreased further see the red bars in chart 9 in the context of the aforementioned reduction in monthly net purchases under the app it has been largely offset by a moderate increase in the contribution from credit to the private sector since late 2017 see the blue bars in chart 9 this marks an ongoing shift towards more self sustained sources of money creation with credit to the private sector surpassing eurosystem purchases of general government debt securities as the largest contributor to m3 growth since october 2018 by contrast government bond sales by euro area monetary financial institutions mfis excluding the eurosystem dampened m3 growth see the light green bars in chart 9 finally the contribution from net external assets see the yellow bars in chart 9 was again positive in november the annual growth of loans to the private sector remained stable in november the annual growth rate of mfi loans to the private sector adjusted for loan sales securitisation and notional cash pooling was unchanged in november at 3 3 see chart 10 it benefited from increases in the annual growth rate of loans to nfcs which increased from 3 9 in october to 4 0 in november and of loans to households which increased from 3 2 in october to 3 3 in november these slight increases in loans to nfcs and households were offset by a decrease in the annual growth rate of loans to financial intermediaries leading to no change in the growth rate of loans to the private sector overall while the annual growth rate of loans to households for house purchase remained moderate from a historical perspective loan origination was strong the recovery in loan growth has been supported by the significant decline in bank lending rates across the euro area since mid 2014 notably owing to the ecb s non standard monetary policy measures and by overall improvements in the supply of and demand for bank loans in addition banks have made progress in consolidating their balance sheets although the volume of non performing loans npls remains high in some countries and may constrain financial intermediation chart 10 loans to the private sector annual growth rate source ecb notes loans are adjusted for loan sales securitisation and notional cash pooling the latest observation is for november 2018 loan growth continued to be supported by favourable bank lending conditions and increasing loan demand across all loan categories according to the january 2019 euro area bank lending survey credit standards for loans to enterprises and loans to households for house purchase remained broadly unchanged in the fourth quarter of 2018 these developments follow a considerable overall net easing of credit standards since 2014 competitive pressures continued to contribute to an easing of credit standards for loans to enterprises and housing loans while lower risk perceptions only contributed to an easing of credit standards for housing loans increasing net loan demand is largely due to the low general level of interest rates fixed investment inventories and working capital merger and acquisition activity favourable housing market prospects and consumer confidence euro area banks also reported that regulatory or supervisory actions led to a further strengthening of their capital positions in the second half of 2018 and a tightening of their credit standards across all loan categories with regard to the impact of npl ratios on lending policies euro area banks reported that these ratios had a tightening impact on their credit standards for loans to enterprises and housing loans over the past six months which is expected to persist and to affect all loan categories very favourable lending rates continued to support euro area economic growth in november 2018 the composite bank lending rate for loans to nfcs remained broadly stable at 1 66 which is close to its historical low in may 2018 the composite bank lending rate for housing loans remained stable in november at 1 81 also close to its historical low in december 2016 see chart 11 composite bank lending rates for loans to nfcs and households have fallen significantly and by more than market reference rates since the ecb s credit easing measures were announced in june 2014 the reduction in bank lending rates for loans to nfcs as well as for loans to small firms assuming that very small loans of up to 0 25 million are primarily granted to small firms was particularly significant in those euro area countries that were most exposed to the financial crisis this indicates a more uniform transmission of monetary policy to bank lending rates across euro area countries and firm sizes chart 11 composite bank lending rates for nfcs and households percentages per annum source ecb notes composite bank lending rates are calculated by aggregating short and long term rates using a 24 month moving average of new business volumes the latest observation is for november 2018 net issuance of debt securities by euro area nfcs decreased slightly in the first two months of the fourth quarter of 2018 after increasing moderately in the same months of the previous quarter the latest ecb data indicate that on a net basis the total flow of debt securities issued by nfcs in october and november 2018 was marginally negative this contrasts with the typical seasonal patterns observed over the last few years in which weakness in issuance has tended to be concentrated in the last month of the fourth quarter from a more medium term perspective see chart 12 the annual flows of debt securities continued to decrease they reached 44 billion in november 2018 following a drop of 30 billion over the previous 12 months available market data suggest that net debt securities issuance remained weak in december 2018 but eventually recovered somewhat at the beginning of january 2019 in october and november 2018 total net issuance of quoted shares by nfcs was quite robust improving from the slightly negative figure recorded in the first two months of the third quarter of 2018 in terms of annual flows net issuance of quoted shares remained close to the highest levels recorded since 2012 chart 12 net issuance of debt securities and quoted shares by euro area nfcs annual flows in eur billions source ecb notes monthly figures based on a 12 month rolling period the latest observation is for november 2018 despite edging up in recent months financing costs for euro area nfcs remained favourable overall the overall nominal cost of external financing for nfcs comprising bank lending debt issuance in the market and equity finance remained at around 4 7 in november and is projected to have increased further in december 2018 and january 2019 although the cost of financing is currently estimated to be around 54 basis points above the historical low of august 2016 it is still below the levels observed in the summer of 2014 the increase in the cost of financing since the end of the third quarter of 2018 reflects an increase in both the cost of equity and in the cost of market based debt the cost of both short and long term bank lending remained relatively stable over the same period boxes recent developments in oil prices prepared by dominic quint against the background of large swings in oil prices in recent months this box assesses the key drivers of oil market developments while demand has been relatively stable supply factors have been the main driving force behind recent oil price volatility driving factors of and risks to domestic demand in the euro area prepared by malin andersson and benjamin mosk activity in the euro area is expected to continue to expand at a moderate pace while more elevated uncertainty points to intensified downside risks to the growth outlook heightened uncertainties at the global level the prospect of brexit escalating protectionism volatility in emerging market economies emes and policy uncertainty in some parts of the euro area pose major challenges to the sustainability of domestic demand going forward according to the december 2018 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections the growth outlook is expected to be underpinned by sustained growth in domestic demand over the next few years notwithstanding a very limited contribution from net exports and inventories see chart a even though growth is expected to slow which is consistent with a maturing business cycle in which labour supply shortages increase in some countries and saving ratios recover from their low levels activity is expected to be relatively resilient owing to a number of factors including the expected continued expansion of global activity the accommodative monetary policy stance supporting financing conditions improving labour markets rising wages and some fiscal loosening this box reviews the factors underpinning domestic expenditure and assesses the potential adverse effects on domestic activity of heightened global uncertainty the mechanical impact of changes in oil price assumptions on projections for euro area hicp energy inflation prepared by mario porqueddu inflation projections are based on models assumptions and expert judgement these include assumptions regarding the future evolution of oil prices in the case of the eurosystem ecb projection exercises the inflation projections are based on the assumption that oil prices will evolve in line with the average futures prices observed over a two week period prior to the projection cut off date using the oil price futures has an important bearing on the projections for hicp energy inflation for instance the pattern of hicp inflation in the december 2018 eurosystem staff projections entailed among other things a strong decline in the contribution of energy inflation from 0 6 percentage point in 2018 to 0 2 percentage point in 2019 and 0 1 percentage point in 2020 and 2021 see chart a however the cut off date for the assumptions underlying these projections was 21 november 2018 and oil prices and their corresponding futures paths fell significantly after this date while they have recovered somewhat lately compared with the end of 2018 they remain on balance substantially below the levels on the cut off date this box documents the mechanical implications of a shift in the oil price assumptions for the projections of the energy component of hicp inflation articles twenty years of the ecb survey of professional forecasters prepared by rupert de vincent humphreys ivelina dimitrova elisabeth falck and lukas henkel it is twenty years since the ecb first launched its survey of professional forecasters spf the survey asks for point forecasts and probability distributions for hicp inflation hicp inflation excluding energy food alcohol and tobacco real gdp growth and the unemployment rate at six horizons as well as point forecasts for wage growth the exchange rate the oil price and the ecb s policy rate all quantitative data collected in the survey are systematically published shortly after the completion of the survey this makes the spf the most long standing comprehensive and transparent survey of the aggregate euro area economy the past twenty years have seen a wide variety of economic conditions including the great moderation with relatively high economic growth and stable inflation the financial crisis and more recently a prolonged period of subdued inflationary pressures this article documents the evolution of the spf through this changing economic landscape and what we have learned from it the spf remains as useful for economic analysis and as relevant to the monetary policy debate today as it was when it was first launched fiscal spillovers in a monetary union prepared by mario alloza bogdan cozmanca marien ferdinandusse and pascal jacquinot the article describes the main transmission channels of the spillovers of national fiscal policies to other countries within a monetary union and investigates their magnitude using different models in the context of economic and monetary union emu fiscal spillovers are relevant for the accurate assessment of the cyclical outlook in euro area countries as well as in the debates on a coordinated change in the euro area fiscal stance and on euro area fiscal capacity the article focuses on spillovers from expenditure based expansions in the larger euro area countries by presenting two complementary exercises the first is an empirical investigation of spillovers based on a new long dataset for the largest euro area countries while the second uses a multi country general equilibrium model with a rich fiscal specification and the capacity to analyse trade spillovers fiscal spillovers are found to be heterogeneous but generally positive among the larger euro area countries the reaction of interest rates to fiscal expansion is an important determinant for the magnitude of spillovers statistics

by egon von greyerz the statement above is of course totally accurate for a country running budget and trade deficits for over half a century with a total debt including unfunded liabilities in the hundreds of trillions of dollars it could have been said today but it actually dates back to august 1971 when the people s daily in china declared the beginning of the end for the monetary system of the capitalist world this prescient statement certainly has cassandra characteristics cassandra was the princess of troy who was given the gift to make prophecies that were true but no one believed the chinese government saw already 48 years ago that nixon s decision to end the gold backing of the dollar would be the end of the dollar and the western monetary system no one believed their prophecy at the time but they are being proven right the chinese predicted the dollar fall starting my working life in a swiss bank in geneva two years before nixon s fatal decision i have experience of that fall of the dollar that the chinese predicted in 1970 there were 4 30 swiss francs to the dollar today you get just under one franc for one us that is a catastrophic collapse of 77 of the world s reserve currency in almost 50 years if we look at the graph of the dollar against the swiss franc below we can see that this currency pair has been in a long consolidation at the bottom since 1987 the next leg down in the dollar is not far away and the target over the next few years could be anywhere between 0 40 and 0 00 swiss francs this means a further fall of 60 to 100 could take place making the dollar worthless this confirms voltaire s statement that all currencies eventually reach their intrinsic value of zero we know that this move to zero is virtually guaranteed measured against gold but more surprising is that it could also happen against the swiss currency the swiss banking system and the swiss national bank also have serious problems so eventually the franc is likely to reach almost zero against gold too but the dollar will win that race china predicted in 1971 the decline of the capitalist system the people s daily is the most influential and authoritative newspaper in china it has been the official voice of the central government of the people s republic of china for the last 71 years the paper declared in 1971 when nixon closed the gold window these unpopular measures reflect the seriousness of the us economic crisis and the decay and decline of the entire capitalist system the paper further stated that the measures mark the collapse of capitalist monetary system with the us dollar as its prop and that nixon s new economic policy cannot extricate the us from financial and economic crisis the article predicted instead that the measures would intensify the crisis nixon declared in 1971 the time has now come for a new economic policy in the united states its targets are unemployment inflation and international speculation and this is how we are going to attack those targets the time has come for decisive action action that will break the vicious circle of spiralling prices and costs nixon s fatal decision the chinese understood already in 1971 that nixon s decision would have disastrous consequences contrary to what nixon declared so here we are today with galloping inflation including asset prices collapsing currencies and exploding debts all the things that nixon said he would prevent nixon stated further in his speech we must protect the position of the american dollar as a pillar of monetary stability around the world i am determined that the american dollar must never again be a hostage in the hands of international speculators little did he understand that his decision would have the opposite effect without gold backing the dollar was not in the hands of speculators but instead in the hands of the us government and the federal reserve and that is why the dollar has since 1971 lost 97 against real money which is gold 57 against the dmark euro and 77 against the swiss franc chinese wisdom vs western madness the wise chinese predicted all this 48 years ago virtually no one in the west had a clue that nixon s catastrophic decision would be the beginning of the end for the us and western economy and currencies and before that create the mother of all bubbles the 1971 article in the people s daily also saw the consequences of the us actions for the rest of the world the policy is meant to fleece the american working people and to shift the worsening of the us financial and monetary as economic crisis onto other countries this is of course what has happened the disastrous us monetary policies has spread like the pest to most countries in the world with exploding debts falling currencies and massive inflation we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us the united states has forced other countries into accepting the primacy of the dollar and used power politics to maintain its privileged position said the people s daily in 1971 in the meantime the dollar s real value has been undermined by the erosion of us gold reserves brought on by the us imperialist policy of aggression and war is the us gold gone subscribe to suspend the convertibility will eventually bring unprecedented destructive blows to the faith in the dollar because this is tantamount to an open admission by the us government to the whole world that the value of the dollar has no guarantee whatsoever there we have it china s ability to analyse the world around them and the weakness of the us and western policies has enabled them to create the second biggest economy in the world or on a purchasing power parity ppp the number one economy china s gdp was 100 billion in 1971 and is today over 12 trillion or on a ppp basis 23 trillion but this rapid growth has not happened without major risk china is today in a precarious position with total debt having grown from 2 trillion to 40 trillion since 2000 as long as china can avoid a disorderly debt collapse and a revolution it is likely to be the number one economy in the world on any measure in coming years but the next few years will be tumultuous for both china the us and the rest of the world as the world economy suffers from the coming economic downturn or collapse markets my views on long term market developments in the next few years have not altered for a very long time we will see a much lower dollar collapsing stock and bond markets and much higher gold and silver prices it won t all happen at once bonds could easily pause their long term uptrend for a while before moving up strongly again short term the dollar looks weak and will soon resume its strong long term downtrend so time to get out of dollars before it falls dramatically and the us implements exchange controls us stocks are now at a decision point by far the most likely is that the downtrend which started in the autumn of 2018 will soon resume in earnest with a big drop next the much less likely alternative is a final hurrah to new highs before the collapse other stock markets will follow the same pattern gold and the other precious metals are on the way to new highs there are two different paths for gold one which is favoured by some market experts is a reset orchestrated by the imf and the world bank leading to a gold backed sdr that would involve gold trading ceasing for a limited time starting one weekend when the market opens again gold will be revalued to a much higher level which in us dollar terms could be 5 000 10 000 or higher the other alternative is that market demand and pressures make gold rise very fast to new highs and way beyond that in the next few years this would be a disorderly reset since i would have no faith in the first official reset which will be fake and not solve any of the world s problems we are likely to see the second reset in any case at that point the gold paper market will go to zero and the physical gold market to unthinkable heights in either case the last chance of getting hold of gold at low prices or at all is now gold is unlikely to wait for a bigger number of investors to get in at these prices so now is the time to get on the gold wagon before it is too late gold is wealth preservation not investment or speculation but remember that gold is acquired for wealth preservation purposes and not for quick gains thus it must be held in physical form and stored in safe jurisdictions outside the financial system personally i think confiscation is less likely this time with high taxation of the assets of the wealthy much more likely but if any country would confiscate gold the us has done it recently and could do it again when roosevelt confiscated gold for us citizens in 1933 gold held by americans outside of the us was not confiscated as i have shown recently gold is now as cheap as in 1970 or 2000 so today is a unique opportunity to acquire gold at a price that is unlikely to ever be seen again
the year 2018 may be remembered as a turning point for us trade policy and the international trading system the trump administration took several unilateral trade actions including the imposition of global national security tariffs and quotas on steel and aluminum and of punitive tariffs on nearly half of all chinese imports as retaliation for that country s commercial and trade policies responsive actions followed in many countries leading to an unprecedented level of national trade barriers and disputes in the modern wto era the measures and countermeasures have not only disrupted global supply chains and heightened uncertainty for business but also have raised doubts about the united states commitment to the multilateral system and the wto s continued ability to serve as a negotiating forum and arbiter of disputes the uncertainty is likely to persist in 2019 approval by the us congress of the agreement to replace the north american free trade agreement nafta is in question us national security tariffs on automotive goods potentially dwarfing those now on steel and aluminum could hinge on the rapid conclusion of bilateral agreements with the eu and japan neither of which will be easy the united states and china have entered negotiations aimed at resolving their ongoing trade dispute but many doubt whether an enduring solution to fundamental economic and geopolitical differences is possible moreover the wto dispute settlement body will deal with several high profile disputes revolving around the sensitive issue of national security and the appellate body could cease to function soon unless demands for reform especially from the united states are met given the magnitude of these issues 2019 promises to be another important year for us trade policy and the multilateral trading system though the year begins without many clear answers this report assesses how these and other important trade issues may develop over the coming year us china trade dispute the ongoing trade dispute between the united states and china is one of the most important issues on the 2019 us trade agenda with implications for businesses governments and supply chains around the world prompted by the united states unilateral imposition of tariffs on chinese imports under section 301 of the trade act of 1974 purportedly in response to china s alleged unfair practices regarding intellectual property protection and forced technology transfer the two countries in 2018 implemented a series of tit for tat tariff actions that now cover approximately us 360 billion in annual bilateral trade on december 1 2018 the sides agreed to begin negotiations aimed at resolving some of the united states concerns about china s trade and industrial policies and averting further tariff increases the united states set a deadline of march 1 2019 for the negotiations allowing for only 90 days of discussion and has stated that absent a satisfactory outcome it will immediately increase to 25 percent the current 10 percent duty rate on approximately us 200 billion in annual chinese imports into the united states another us 50 billion is already subject to additional 25 percent duties there have been signs of incremental progress on some issues covered by the bilateral negotiations but progress on structural reforms to china s trade and industrial policies a demand emphasized by some us officials such as us trade representative ustr robert lighthizer remains unclear china has offered the following concessions since the start of the negotiations good faith concessions at the outset of the negotiations china announced minor good faith concessions on market access for automotive goods purchases of us soybeans and corn intellectual property rights enforcement and the made in china 2025 industrial policy but many details regarding these actions remain unclear us and chinese officials also are discussing the possibility of reopening the chinese market to us chicken exports at the outset of the negotiations china announced minor good faith concessions on market access for automotive goods purchases of us soybeans and corn intellectual property rights enforcement and the made in china 2025 industrial policy but many details regarding these actions remain unclear us and chinese officials also are discussing the possibility of reopening the chinese market to us chicken exports long term goods purchases china reportedly has offered to increase purchases of us goods including energy and agricultural products by more than us 1 trillion over a six year period with the goal of eliminating the us trade deficit with china by 2024 experts have expressed doubt that this target is achievable noting that us exporters may be unable to meet such a large and sudden increase in demand however observers speculate that the proposal may be appealing to the trump administration which has emphasized trade deficit reduction as a central goal of its trade policy china reportedly has offered to increase purchases of us goods including energy and agricultural products by more than us 1 trillion over a six year period with the goal of eliminating the us trade deficit with china by 2024 experts have expressed doubt that this target is achievable noting that us exporters may be unable to meet such a large and sudden increase in demand however observers speculate that the proposal may be appealing to the trump administration which has emphasized trade deficit reduction as a central goal of its trade policy structural reforms china s national people s congress npc on december 26 2018 released a draft foreign investment law that purports to facilitate various structural reforms sought by the united states including a prohibition on forced technology transfers protection of the intellectual property rights of foreign investors and national treatment of foreign investors the npc is expected to approve the law during a session scheduled to open on march 5 however observers have noted that the current draft law consists largely of broad aspirational policy statements and that china s plans for implementing and enforcing the proposed law remain unclear china has not publicly announced any other proposed structural reforms the united states and china held a high level negotiating round in washington from january 30 31 led by chinese vice premier liu he and ustr lighthizer following the meeting ustr lighthizer indicated that the talks had focused primarily on structural issues and that the two sides did make progress on a variety of key issues but he declined to elaborate on specific areas of progress and noted that there s a lot more to be done 1 he further stated that t this point it s impossible for me to predict success but we are in a place where if things work out we could have that he also indicated that the two sides have only just begun drafting a common negotiating document the white house also issued a vague statement acknowledging progress in the talks but providing few details he two sides showed a helpful willingness to engage on all major issues and the negotiating sessions featured productive and technical discussions on how to resolve our differences the united states is particularly focused on reaching meaningful commitments on structural issues and deficit reduction both parties have agreed that any resolution will be fully enforceable while progress has been made much work remains to be done the reaction of us business groups to the talks has been mixed they indicated that while the sides have made progress on market access intellectual property enforcement and other issues e g electronic payments china has not offered substantive concessions on structural issues such as technology transfers and industrial subsidies some observers speculate that the trump administration motivated by recent declines in the us financial markets has recently become more amenable to an agreement that would avert further escalation of the us china trade dispute the recent announcement that ustr lighthizer and secretary mnuchin will visit china for further talks in mid february also has been viewed as a positive signal however the trump administration has not elaborated on the specific outcomes it considers necessary for the negotiation to be successful beyond general statements e g ustr lighthizer s statement that the united states seeks structural changes or an agreement to have structural changes to the chinese industrial policies covered by the section 301 investigation as well as expanded market access for us goods moreover while president trump has repeatedly expressed vague optimism regarding the bilateral talks his deputies have long been skeptical of china s willingness to adhere to its promises and enact fundamental policy reforms in response to pressure from the united states the outcome of the bilateral negotiations therefore is uncertain but there are essentially three possible scenarios no agreement by march 1 it is possible that the parties will fail to reach agreement by the march 1 deadline the united states will refuse to extend the deadline further and the us section 301 tariffs on list 3 goods worth approximately us 200 billion will increase to 25 percent on march 2 as scheduled in this scenario china would likely retaliate with additional tariffs on us goods possibly in combination with non tariff measures causing the trade dispute to escalate further in 2019 ustr lighthizer has stated that should the tariff rate on list 3 goods increase to 25 percent ustr will establish a product exclusion process for goods on list 3 similar to the process it established for goods on lists 1 and 2 it is possible that the parties will fail to reach agreement by the march 1 deadline the united states will refuse to extend the deadline further and the us section 301 tariffs on list 3 goods worth approximately us 200 billion will increase to 25 percent on march 2 as scheduled in this scenario china would likely retaliate with additional tariffs on us goods possibly in combination with non tariff measures causing the trade dispute to escalate further in 2019 ustr lighthizer has stated that should the tariff rate on list 3 goods increase to 25 percent ustr will establish a product exclusion process for goods on list 3 similar to the process it established for goods on lists 1 and 2 extension of negotiations beyond march 1 the parties may fail to reach agreement by the march 1 deadline but decide to extend the negotiations and refrain from any tariff increases while the negotiations are ongoing thus allowing the status quo to persist for weeks or even months president trump previously has mentioned the possibility of extending the negotiations beyond the self imposed march 1 deadline more recently the trump administration has emphasized that march 1 represents a hard deadline but this could simply be negotiating bluster the parties may fail to reach agreement by the march 1 deadline but decide to extend the negotiations and refrain from any tariff increases while the negotiations are ongoing thus allowing the status quo to persist for weeks or even months president trump previously has mentioned the possibility of extending the negotiations beyond the self imposed march 1 deadline more recently the trump administration has emphasized that march 1 represents a hard deadline but this could simply be negotiating bluster preliminary agreement by march 1 in a best case scenario the parties could reach a preliminary agreement that postpones or cancels the tariff increase on list 3 goods in exchange for chinese concessions on market access and possibly structural issues however it is unclear how such an agreement might be structured for example the united states might agree to postpone the tariff increase and to cancel it permanently only upon verifying that china has implemented all of its commitments by a specific date alternatively and given the complexity of the structural issues under discussion the united states could agree to postpone the tariff increase in exchange for some chinese commitments e g on market access and to cancel it entirely pending the outcome of further negotiations on structural issues other arrangements are possible but the united states is expected to insist that any agreement must include a mechanism for verifying china s implementation of and compliance with its commitments thereunder even in the best case scenario described above it is unclear whether the parties will take any action this year to reduce or eliminate the existing section 301 tariffs and chinese retaliation which presently cover us 250 billion and us 110 billion in annual trade respectively neither party has publicly expressed openness to doing so and the us government s statements on the negotiation only contemplate cancellation of the planned tariff increase on list 3 goods there is a strong chance therefore that trade restrictions between the two countries will remain at their current levels in 2019 even if the current bilateral negotiations succeed in producing an agreement us mexico canada agreement nafta 2 0 one development welcomed by many pro trade business groups and members of congress in 2018 was the conclusion of the negotiations for a us mexico canada agreement usmca to replace nafta major us business groups have expressed concerns about elements of the usmca including its limitations on investor state dispute settlement isds and restrictive rules of origin for automobiles but have nonetheless endorsed the agreement and are seeking its approval in 2019 citing its preservation of duty free trade among the parties and its modernized provisions on issues such as digital trade intellectual property and services it is expected that the trump administration will submit legislation to implement the usmca to congress this year and seek its approval under the expedited legislative procedures provided for in the bipartisan congressional trade priorities and accountability act of 2015 tpa however congressional approval of the legislation is far from certain and any vote could be delayed well into the autumn of 2019 if not later prospects for us congressional approval several factors will complicate the usmca s approval in 2019 first it is unclear whether the trump administration can secure sufficient support for the usmca among democratic members of congress such support will be particularly important in the house of representatives where approximately 20 democratic votes will be needed to pass the legislation even if every republican member votes in its favor which is not guaranteed 2 despite efforts by ustr lighthizer to address the priorities of certain democratic lawmakers and labor groups in the usmca e g on isds automotive rules of origin restrictions on mexican trucking and labor provisions reactions to the usmca text among these stakeholders have been largely negative or at least skeptical labor several of the largest us labor unions have stated that they cannot support the agreement in its current form and several others have declined to take a firm position while urging improvements to the deal the afl cio stated that ithout major improvements this supposed overhaul will prove to be nothing more than a rebranded corporate handout any progress made by this deal is meaningless without swift and certain enforcement tools to safeguard key labor protections real steps forward start with changes in the text comprehensive labor law reform from mexico and a strong implementation bill from the united states the united autoworkers union stated that we are concerned the agreement as currently written does not go far enough in addressing the us mexico auto and auto parts trade imbalance and that e encourage all parties to go back to the bargaining table the international association of machinists and aerospace workers stated that nafta 2 0 as currently written does not represent the fair trade principles we continue to demand unless major changes are made so that outsourcing by corporations seeking mexico s suppressed labor costs are adequately addressed the iam cannot support nafta 2 0 the united steelworkers union and the international brotherhood of teamsters also have issued statements suggesting that improvements mostly relating to labor provisions and their enforcement would be required to earn their unions support of the usmca several of the largest us labor unions have stated that they cannot support the agreement in its current form and several others have declined to take a firm position while urging improvements to the deal the afl cio stated that ithout major improvements this supposed overhaul will prove to be nothing more than a rebranded corporate handout any progress

relating to labor provisions and their enforcement would be required to earn their unions support of the usmca congressional democrats house speaker nancy pelosi d ca stated in december that while there are positive things in this proposed trade agreement it is just a list without real enforcement of the labor and environmental protections she did not commit to holding a vote on the usmca in 2019 stating only that orking with our chairman richard neal through the auspices of the ways means committee we will be hosting meetings to brief members on the provisions in the proposal and to hear from various stakeholders as members make their judgments several other democratic members have expressed similar concerns including members with relatively pro trade voting records rep ron kind d wi stated that i continue to have serious questions for the administration about the recently finalized usmca agreement these issues include enforceability of labor and environmental standards senate finance committee ranking member ron wyden d or stated that hile there are elements of the revised nafta agreement that are clear improvements over the status quo i remain concerned about the enforceability of the president s deal he was particularly concerned with the lack of reforms to nafta s state to state dispute settlement system which is widely viewed as a failure since it enables a party to block the establishment of a panel of experts who would adjudicate nafta trade disputes without such changes sen wyden questioned whether the new nafta obligations on labor rights and other issues can ever be effectively enforced these and other concerns have led some democratic members including ways and means committee members to call for further negotiations to amend the usmca or for the inclusion of unspecified provisions on labor and enforcement in the usmca implementing legislation however the current mexican administration has rejected the possibility of renegotiation luz maría de la mora mexico s undersecretary of economy stated in late january that or us this agreement is closed ustr lighthizer also reportedly has rejected the possibility of reopening the agreement given these reactions and broader political dynamics it is unclear whether the democratic leadership in the house of representatives will cooperate with the trump administration s efforts to approve the usmca in its current form by allowing a vote on the implementing legislation though the expedited legislative procedures provided for by tpa require each chamber of congress to hold a final vote on the implementing legislation within a set time period 60 in session days in the house they operate as procedural rules of each chamber and each chamber retains the authority to modify or override the rules at any time congressional override of tpa s fast track process has a particularly noteworthy historical precedent in 2008 during her previous term as house speaker rep pelosi introduced a resolution that changed house rules to specify that expedited legislative procedures would not apply to implementing legislation for the us colombia trade agreement the house approved the resolution and the agreement therefore stalled in congress even though it was submitted under the 2002 tpa law the fta was only approved years later during the obama administration the usmca could face a similar obstacle furthermore even assuming the usmca implementing legislation receives a vote in 2019 its passage is uncertain in addition to the aforementioned concerns expressed by congressional democrats some republican members of congress have expressed reservations about the agreement including its limitations on isds 16 year sunset provision restrictive automotive rules of origin and failure to remove the section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum from canada and mexico at least one senate republican sen pat toomey r pa has said he will oppose the agreement on these grounds in addition members of both parties including house ways and means committee ranking member kevin brady r tx have indicated that they are unwilling to consider the usmca unless the section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum from canada and mexico are removed something the administration thus far has been unwilling to do on the other hand most republicans are expected to support the agreement and members of both parties will face significant pressure from the business community and domestic constituencies to ensure its passage both to realize specific benefits of the agreement and more generally to restore predictability to north american trade relations timing a possible us congressional vote on the usmca is unlikely until at least the second half of 2019 the statutory deadline for the us international trade commission to deliver its economic assessment of the agreement not required before the implementing legislation is submitted but viewed as a prerequisite for any vote is march 15 but it will likely be delayed due to the us government shutdown that occurred from december 22 2018 until january 25 2019 moreover at least 30 days before submitting the implementing legislation the administration must submit to congress its draft statement of administrative action saa for the agreement even assuming a highly ambitious timeline wherein the itc report and the implementing legislation are submitted on march 14 a final congressional vote on the implementing legislation would not be required until approximately november 8 2019 i e 90 in session days from the date of introduction based on the current house and senate legislative schedules congress is free to expedite the process by voting more quickly than the tpa timelines require but it is not obligated and may be reluctant to do so and several members of the ways and means committee have expressed doubt that a vote can occur before june 2019 if a usmca vote is indeed delayed into the late summer or autumn of 2019 it may face even greater political uncertainty due to the 2020 presidential election which will be in full swing by that time possibility of attempted us withdrawal from nafta the uphill battle facing the usmca in congress has heightened concerns that president trump may seek to unilaterally notify canada and mexico of the united states withdrawal from nafta pursuant to article 2205 of that agreement3 in 2019 in an effort to force congress to approve the usmca during the six month period before the withdrawal takes effect president trump has publicly threatened to take such action stating after the signing of the usmca that i ll be terminating within a relatively short period of time and so congress will have a choice of the usmca or pre nafta however the president s attempt to withdraw from nafta without congressional consent would create major uncertainty for north american business and would likely engender widespread opposition from the business community and members of congress some of whom have warned publicly in response to president trump s statements that the president lacks the authority to withdraw from nafta without congressional approval moreover some within the administration including ustr lighthizer reportedly oppose the withdrawal strategy on the grounds that it would decrease rather than increase the usmca s prospects for approval nevertheless this scenario cannot be ruled out and is another source of uncertainty for north american and global supply chains in 2019 section 232 actions us government actions under section 232 of the trade expansion act of 1962 section 232 will feature prominently in 2019 section 232 authorizes 1 the bureau of industry and security bis within the department of commerce to investigate the effects of certain imports on us national security and to issue findings and recommendations based thereupon and 2 the president to negotiate agreements to limit or restrict imports or to take such actions as the president deems necessary to adjust the imports of such article so that such imports will not threaten or impair the national security the statute places no limit on the nature of the restrictions or the height of tariffs two section 232 proceedings will be completed in 2019 automotive goods the administration s section 232 investigation of automotive goods was initiated on may 23 2018 and is now close to being completed assuming the deadline for doc s final report is not tolled due to the us government shutdown it will be transmitted to the president by february 19 2019 270 days after initiation as required by law according to industry sources the report which had undergone multiple revisions and interagency reviews finds a national security threat and offers three different recommendations for the president 1 blanket tariff on autos and auto parts ranging from 20 25 percent 2 narrowly tailored tariffs on automated connected electric and shared aces vehicle technologies and 3 a middle ground option between the first two options a previous version included only the blanket tariffs option the release of the report and the president s decision to take action could depend on the status of ongoing us trade negotiations with japan and the eu the initiation of which paused the united states imposition of any new tariffs canada and mexico meanwhile negotiated a substantial exception from any future section 232 tariffs on their automotive exports through the usmca combined these exemptions leave korea and china as the largest automotive exporters to the united states without some public assurance that their goods would not be subject to new trade restrictions the administration s section 232 investigation of automotive goods was initiated on may 23 2018 and is now close to being completed assuming the deadline for doc s final report is not tolled due to the us government shutdown it will be transmitted to the president by february 19 2019 270 days after initiation as required by law according to industry sources the report which had undergone multiple revisions and interagency reviews finds a national security threat and offers three

negotiated a substantial exception from any future section 232 tariffs on their automotive exports through the usmca combined these exemptions leave korea and china as the largest automotive exporters to the united states without some public assurance that their goods would not be subject to new trade restrictions uranium the section 232 investigation of uranium was initiated on july 18 2018 and the final report is due by april 22 2019 unless tolled bis has reportedly conducted site visits and issued surveys to various us stakeholders the outcome of the investigation is unclear complicated by the unique nature of the product the lack of viable near term domestic supplies and the end 2019 expiration of us legal measures e g agreement suspending the antidumping investigation on uranium from the russian federation of 1992 that already restrict imports of uranium from russia one of the world s largest producers although the shutdown created confusion as to whether the section 232 deadlines will be tolled it appears at the time of this report s publication that each will be transmitted to the president by its respective original deadline though neither doc nor bis has provided official public instructions on this point regardless of the tolling issue the administration may delay the public release of the reports until after the respective statutory deadlines for example to keep the report on automotive imports from interfering with the early march deadline for a trade deal with china although the statute s 270 day deadline for report delivery is firm it is murky as to when the report must be actually published sections without classified or business proprietary information must be published in the federal register but there is no deadline for doing so along with each report s publication the president might also delay any final measures until later in the year the president has 90 days from receipt of a section 232 report to make a final determination as to whether he concurs with the report s findings and will take action e g impose tariffs to adjust the imports at issue however this deadline may also be extended by an additional 180 days where the action is the negotiation of an agreement which limits or restricts the subject imports these provisions could extend presidential action on autos or uranium into late 2019 meanwhile the steel and aluminum section 232 tariffs imposed in march 2018 remain in place as does the process for interested us parties to apply for and eventually receive an exclusion from the tariffs prior to the us government shutdown bis had approved only 14 301 of 44 958 steel exclusion requests denying 4 727 others and only 1 191 of 6 159 aluminum requests denying 205 in 2019 bis will continue processing the remaining exclusion requests and new requests including those from applicants who received one year exclusions in 2018 but the substantial backlog is expected to worsen due to the shutdown although the impact and administration of the tariffs and exclusions have been widely criticized the president appears committed to the measures for the foreseeable future indeed the usmca negotiations were widely expected to end section 232 tariffs on mexican and canadian steel and aluminum but that has not yet happened the eu has also repeatedly sought an exemption from the tariffs as a precondition for initiating bilateral fta negotiations but the administration has given no indication of supporting that request finally a ruling from the court of international trade is expected in the coming weeks with respect to the american institute for international steel aiis challenge to section 232 as an unconstitutional delegation of congress tariff powers under article i section 8 of the us constitution american institute for international steel inc et al v united states et al court no 18 00152 oral argument in that case took place in december 2018 before a rare three judge panel and an opinion is expected as soon as february though there is no hard deadline for releasing the opinion regardless of the outcome the opinion is widely expected to be appealed thus having little immediate impact on the current or pending section 232 import restrictions bilateral trade negotiations with japan the european union and the united kingdom the trump administration has notified congress of its intention to negotiate bilateral trade agreements with japan the eu and the united kingdom the administration has indicated that it will seek to use the recently completed usmca as the template for much of these potential agreements but many questions remain about the timing scope and prospects for each negotiation we discuss the outlook for each negotiation below us japan trade agreement having published its negotiating objectives for the proposed us japan trade agreement on december 21 2018 the trump administration has completed the pre notification requirements set forth in tpa and therefore can begin formal trade negotiations with japan however the parties have not yet begun formal negotiations nor have they announced a date on which they will do so the formal launch of negotiations appears to have been delayed in part by the recent us government shutdown which caused ustr to furlough more than 70 percent of its staff it is therefore unclear when formal negotiations between the two countries will begin but observers speculate that the implementation of competing trade agreements i e the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership cptpp in december 2018 and eu japan economic partnership agreement epa in february 2019 will motivate the trump administration to move quickly especially given that the united states abandoned the cptpp in 2017 it is therefore possible that the us japan negotiations will begin in early 2019 it remains unclear how the bilateral negotiations will be structured including whether the negotiations in 2019 will be aimed at reaching an early harvest agreement covering only trade in goods or alternatively a comprehensive fta covering all the issues discussed in ustr s negotiating objectives the united states has indicated that it might seek to conduct the negotiation in stages beginning with an early harvest agreement on trade in goods but this approach would likely encounter opposition from certain members of congress and us business groups who fear that their sectors might be abandoned once an early harvest is achieved it also is questionable whether such an approach would be deemed consistent with tpa and wto rules governing interim agreements and free trade areas and whether the japanese government will be willing to participate in a staged negotiation regardless of their structure completing negotiations in 2019 on all of the issues contemplated by ustr s negotiating objectives will be difficult and completing even an early harvest agreement on goods this year could prove challenging though the usmca and tpp texts overlap significantly and could serve as useful templates in some areas completing the negotiations quickly will be difficult given the broad range of issues under discussion the sizes of the us and japanese economies and their importance in global trade and the long history of bilateral trade frictions in sensitive areas such as agriculture and automotive trade moreover controversial us proposals e g for a sunset provision or limitations on japanese automotive exports to the united states are expected to add further complexity to the negotiations it is therefore questionable whether any us japan agreement can be reached in 2019 and whether japan will be able to secure a long term exemption from any potential section 232 restrictions on automotive goods as a result senate finance committee chairman chuck grassley r ia has expressed skepticism that a us japan trade agreement can be completed in 2019 us eu trade agreement the united states and the eu agreed in 2018 to pursue formal bilateral trade negotiations but the start of these talks remains in limbo given major disagreements between the parties regarding their scope in a joint statement issued in july 2018 by president trump and european commission president jean claude juncker the two leaders agreed to pursue negotiations toward zero tariffs zero non tariff barriers and zero subsidies on non auto industrial goods as well as to reduce barriers and increase trade in services chemicals pharmaceuticals medical products as well as soybeans however in january 2019 the two parties issued significantly different negotiating objectives for the proposed trade agreement in keeping with the july 2018 joint communique the eu negotiating mandates propose a narrow negotiation that is limited to the elimination of tariffs for industrial goods and an agreement to facilitate the mutual acceptance of conformity assessment results for industrial goods by contrast the us negotiating objectives seek a comprehensive agreement covering trade in goods including agricultural products services government procurement and intellectual property that would be similar in scope to the transatlantic trade and investment partnership ttip negotiations with the eu that were placed on hold in 2016 at the end of the administration of president obama the eu has ruled out negotiating on trade in agriculture because of opposition from france and southern eu member states to any reduction in the protection of eu farming the united states however is aiming for comprehensive market access for its agricultural exports in the eu market through the elimination of eu tariffs and non tariff barriers with a particular focus on changing eu sanitary and phytosanitary sps measures that are not based on scientific risk assessment although the eu claims that president trump agreed that the negotiations should cover only industrial goods the importance of the inclusion of trade in agriculture has been emphasized repeatedly by united states farm lobbies and their allies in congress chairman grassley has expressed serious doubt that a draft trade agreement with the eu that excluded agriculture would be approved by the us senate the notion that some people in the eu think there could be an agreement that doesn t address the many ways they block our good agricultural products from being sold in europe is ridiculous given these differences and the political dynamics of both parties it is unclear whether the parties can reach agreement on the scope of the negotiations in 2019 some observers speculate that the trump administration s proposal to conduct the negotiations in stages could allow the us and the eu to begin negotiations in 2019 without resolving the impasse over agriculture 4 they note that the parties could begin a bilateral negotiation for an agreement to eliminate tariffs on industrial goods as envisioned in the eu negotiating mandates while leaving the remaining issues to be addressed in subsequent stages however this approach would likely engender significant opposition from the us agricultural community and other business groups as well as members of congress who fear that agriculture and other priorities will not be addressed in the subsequent stages of the negotiation rep kevin brady recently expressed strong doubts about an early harvest agreement that excludes agriculture stating that from the us standpoint i don t know how you make that sale at all moreover such an approach would raise questions regarding the consistency of the early harvest agreement with tpa and wto rules the impasse over the scope of the bilateral negotiations has heightened concerns that president trump may impose or threaten to impose section 232 restrictions on automotive imports from the eu in 2019 though the united states assured the eu that it would be excluded from any such restrictions while the negotiations are ongoing president trump could seek to use section 232 tariffs or at least the threat of such tariffs as leverage to pressure the eu to engage in negotiations on agriculture the eu for its part has said it will suspend negotiations if the united states imposes new section 232 measures on eu goods and eu trade officials stated in january that the eu is prepared to impose retaliatory tariffs on us 22 7 billion of us goods in response to any section 232 measures on eu automotive goods thus while the july 2018 statement by presidents trump and juncker was welcomed as a sign of improvement in us eu trade relations 2019 begins without much assurance that the current truce will hold and with increasing concerns about the prospect of further us section 232 tariffs and eu retaliation on a larger scale than that which took place in 2018 us uk trade agreement the united states and the uk have announced their intention to start negotiations on a free trade agreement but the timing of those negotiations is still unclear because the uk s draft treaty of withdrawal from the eu has not yet received parliamentary approval for the time being other brexit outcomes cannot be ruled out such as a hard brexit where the uk withdraws from the eu without an agreement or even a second referendum on eu membership if the draft withdrawal treaty is approved in the next few weeks the uk is expected to leave the eu formally on march 29 2019 the uk will stay in the eu customs union and single market and be subject to eu trade law for a transition period until december 2020 extendable for one or two years until no later than december 2022 during the transition period the uk can negotiate and ratify an fta with the united states and with other third countries although the agreement cannot enter into force until the transition period ends at the same time the uk will negotiate its new trade agreement with the eu for the uk conducting two such significant trade negotiations in parallel could prove challenging particularly where trade offs between the two need to be made the united states may face similar challenges as its planned bilateral negotiations with japan and possibly the eu and its efforts to secure congressional approval of the usmca may constrain its ability to conduct simultaneous negotiations with the uk thus while the two countries may be able to launch formal trade negotiations in 2019 rapid progress appears unlikely congressional trade agenda the 115th congress generally took a passive approach to trade policy reacting to and at times criticizing the trump administration s aggressive unilateral trade actions but not asserting its constitutional authority to curtail them through legislation this pattern should continue in 2019 despite democrats assuming the majority in the house of representatives unless certain unilateral actions by the trump administration prompt congress to consider new limitations on the president s trade authority in particular the potential application of section 232 tariffs to finished automobiles or an attempt by president trump to unilaterally withdraw the united states from nafta could cause congress to consider legislation to prevent these actions and the serious political and economic turmoil they would create some members already have introduced legislation in the new congress that would curtail the president s authority to impose trade restrictions under section 232 one such bill the bicameral congressional trade authority act would require the president to obtain congressional approval before imposing import restrictions under section 232 and for any section 232 actions imposed within the last four years including the steel and aluminum tariffs in addition it would clarify section 232 s definition of national security and limit the types of products that can be investigated under the law the bill was introduced in the senate by sens pat toomey r pa and mark warner d va and presently has nine senate co sponsors reps ron kind d wi and mike gallagher r wi have introduced an identical bill in the house although the bill appears unlikely to advance in the near term it or similar legislation could gain momentum should the trump administration announce plans for further significant trade restrictions under section 232 particularly on automobiles a wide range of influential us business groups and think tanks have endorsed the bill including the us chamber of commerce and more than 40 organizations representing the retail agriculture automotive energy and manufacturing sectors among others following the bill s introduction a spokesman for chairman grassley stated that the senator has said he supports some of the ideas being discussed by members of the committee but he hasn t endorsed any particular bill by contrast a small group of house republicans has introduced legislation that seeks to expand the president s authority to impose tariffs the legislation entitled the united states reciprocal trade act would authorize the president to increase us tariffs on a particular good upon determining that the rate of duty imposed by a foreign country with respect to when imported from the united states is significantly higher than the rate of duty imposed by the united states on that good when imported from that country the legislation would similarly authorize the president to increase us tariffs upon determining that the non tariff barriers applied by a foreign country with respect to that good impose significantly higher burdens than those applied by the united states white house trade advisor peter navarro reportedly assisted in the drafting of the bill which was introduced by rep sean duffy r wi and has 18 republican co sponsors it is very unlikely that congress will enact the legislation however as there is little congressional support in either party for further expanding the president s trade authority chairman grassley has rejected the proposal stating that e ain t gonna give any greater authority we ve already delegated too much as has ranking member wyden us business groups also have expressed strong opposition to the bill noting that it would ignore the united states wto obligations and invite retaliation against us exporters other items on the congressional trade agenda this year will include consideration of the usmca implementing legislation consultations with the trump administration under tpa concerning the planned bilateral negotiations with japan the eu and the uk and continued oversight of the administration s section 232 and section 301 product exclusion processes primary responsibility for these activities will lie with the house ways and means and senate finance committees both of which will have new leadership and members in the 116th congress as discussed in greater detail below house ways and means committee the makeup of the house ways and means committee has shifted significantly in the new congress the committee now comprises 25 democrats and 14 republicans compared to 24 republicans and 16 democrats during the previous congress the incoming democratic majority on the committee generally has been less supportive of trade liberalization measures than its republican predecessors for example just five of the 19 democratic members on the committee who were present for the 2015 vote on tpa voted in favor the legislation even though a democrat obama was president at the time by contrast all 24 republican members of the committee in 2015 voted for tpa the full list of members of the house ways and means committee for the 116th congress is provided in the table below house ways and means committee members 116th congress democratic

note bold indicates members of subcommittee on trade italics indicates chairman ranking member of subcommittee on trade na indicates that the member did not vote on tpa 2015 the new ways and means committee chairman rep richard neal d ma has a mixed record on trade issues having voted for some ftas korus panama peru while opposing others colombia dr cafta nafta and the 2002 and 2015 iterations of tpa chairman neal has criticized the trump administration s execution of some of its more controversial trade actions e g the trade dispute with china and the section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum but has been less critical of the underlying policies for example he described the trump administration s initial section 301 tariffs on chinese goods as substantial and aggressive enforcement actions that can be an important tool in re setting the us china trade and economic dynamic expressing concern only about the apparent lack of coherence in the administration s approach with china in january 2019 he discouraged the administration from lifting the section 301 tariffs in exchange for a quick and easy deal with china regarding the section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum he stated that the measures could if implemented and designed thoughtfully bring about a recovery of us steel and aluminum production though he later criticized their application to imports from canada mexico and the eu these comments suggest at least some alignment with the trump administration s approach to trade policy chairman neal has not identified trade policy as a priority for the committee in 2019 focusing instead on other issues such as tax and infrastructure policy he has not yet taken a position on the usmca stating upon its signing that i will continue to scrutinize the details of this deal my assessment will focus on the content of the commitments that have been put on paper and whether those commitments especially on worker rights and environmental protections are enforceable senate finance committee the makeup of the senate finance committee remains largely unchanged from the previous congress it will comprise of 15 republicans and 13 democrats compared to 14 republicans and 13 democrats in the previous congress sen grassley has assumed the chairmanship following the retirement of sen orrin hatch r ut like his predecessor chairman grassley has largely been supportive of trade liberalization during his career and has been critical of the trump administration s actions under section 301 and section 232 at the same time he has occasionally expressed openness to the trump administration s use of unilateral trade actions as negotiating leverage for example chairman grassley has made the following statements regarding the 2019 trade agenda regarding section 232 he stated that i do not believe that we should alienate our allies with tariffs disguised as national security protections and that i strongly disagree with the notion that imports of steel and aluminum automobiles and auto parts somehow could pose a national security threat i intend to review the president s use of power under section 232 of the trade act of 1962 he also referred to a bill introduced by sen rob portman r oh to narrow the president s section 232 authority as a prudent starting point for the discussion we need to have on section 232 authority in the next congress on the other hand he stated that the president s threat to impose tariffs on eu automotive goods under section 232 may be an effective tool and is probably the only thing that will bring europe to the table in a reasonable way to negotiate a trade agreement with the united states involving agricultural market access regarding the usmca he stated that he will continue to work with the trump administration toward implementation and that i m committed to working with the administration to ensure that us farmers ranchers and businesses face minimal uncertainty from updating nafta on the other hand he subsequently stated that if congressional democrats insist that the usmca be renegotiated i would encourage the president to pull out of nafta and hope that they re smart enough to not let that happen regarding the us china dispute he stated that i m not fond of the section 301 tariffs on products from china but i agree with the reasons they ve been applied i ll continue to engage with the administration on the ongoing trade dispute with china in hopes that negotiations will result in a change in china s discriminatory policies and practices and an easing of tariffs and tensions the comments have raised questions about the extent to which the finance committee under chairman grassley s leadership will serve as a check on the trump administration s trade actions the full list of members of the senate finance committee for the 116th congress is provided in the table below notably the membership of the senate finance subcommittee on international trade customs and global competitiveness has doubled to 20 members in the 116th congress the expanded membership likely reflects a heightened interest in trade policy among members of congress and their constituents

wto dispute settlement and negotiations looking to the year ahead the wto faces challenges on multiple fronts the organization s dispute settlement body dsb will face several systemic tests in 2019 the first of these is the viability of the appellate body ab due to the retirement of previous ab members and the continued refusal of the united states to appoint new ones before its concerns over the ab are addressed by the wto membership there are only three sitting members on the ab unless wto members can agree to appoint new members this number will fall to one by december 2019 at which point the ab will no longer be able to function at the end of 2018 the eu china india and nine other wto members proposed modifications to the dispute settlement understanding dsu that would in their view provide solutions to all of the issues on which the united states has criticized the functioning of the ab for the past 12 months the united states however rejected all elements of the proposal some observers believe that the united states may have already decided to put the ab out of business at the end of 2019 and that it has no intention before then of engaging with other members to try to correct the ab practices about which it has complained moreover it is possible that the crisis over the ab s functioning will come to a head sooner than december the chinese ab member zhao hong may have to recuse herself from any appeal involving china and three such appeals could arise in in the first half of 2019 ds511 in which the united states has challenged china s agricultural subsidies for wheat rice and corn as exceeding china s domestic agricultural support limits ds517 in which the united states has challenged china s tariff rate quotas for certain agricultural products as being inconsistent with china s obligations in the gatt and in its protocol of accession and ds516 in which china has challenged the eu s use of non market price comparison methodologies in its anti dumping investigations against china if appeals were made but were unable to proceed in these cases the dsb would not be able to consider adoption of the dispute panel reports and the dispute settlement system could potentially enter a no man s land of uncertainty an additional systemic challenge in the dsb concerns prospective developments in a series of disputes concerning national security and trade the panel report in ds512 which concerns russian measures on traffic in transit from ukraine through russia to third countries is expected in the first quarter of 2019 the members who have filed disputes against the united states concerning its section 232 measures on steel and aluminum have all requested the establishment of a panel in their respective disputes and composition and selection will likely prove controversial likewise a panel has been established but not yet composed in qatar s case against saudi arabia over ip rights and composed in qatar s case against the united arab emirates regarding the same all of these cases could test the limits of the dsb as members are expected to make arguments related to national security and may invoke article xxi of the gatt or its parallel provisions in other wto agreements long considered the third rail of wto dispute settlement additionally in the first half of january venezuela requested consultations with the united states in ds574 which concerns us sanctions against it suggesting that disputes over national security related trade measures may continue to dominate discussion in addition the panel report in china s dispute with the eu over non market economy nme treatment of china in anti dumping investigations ds516 is expected in the first half of 2019 ustr lighthizer has warned that a wto ruling in china s favor on the issue of nme treatment would be cataclysmic for the wto a statement interpreted by some as a threat that such a ruling would cause the united states to withdraw from the wto in terms of negotiations some progress is possible albeit in modest increments more than 70 countries including the united states china the eu and japan have announced their intention to pursue plurilateral negotiations in the realm of e commerce the key areas for discussion include the freedom of data flows across borders and bringing an end to data localization requirements separately some wto members are seeking to expand disciplines on services particularly by updating the provisions of the general agreement on trade in services gats regarding domestic regulation of services with the aim of providing outcomes by the 2020 wto ministerial conference in astana kazakhstan on the multilateral front negotiations over fisheries subsidies are expected to continue with the twin issues of 1 special and differential treatment for developing countries and 2 defining the scope of subsidies subject to such disciplines as the major issues in these discussions finally despite the proposals by some members to reform the wto in 2018 e g with respect to agricultural and industrial subsidies state owned enterprises etc members appear to be far away from finding common ground on which to start a serious discussion let alone an eventual negotiation on elements of wto reform director general roberto azevêdo will continue to hold consultations on the subject in 2019 but it appears doubtful that members will be able to forge agreement around a single agenda in the near future conclusion uncertainty about the united states trade policies and the future of the multilateral trading system will likely persist throughout 2019 congressional debate over the usmca is likely to be contentious and could last late into the year leaving businesses unsure of the rules that will govern future trade and investment in north america the united states and china might reach a preliminary agreement in march to pause their trade dispute but permanent cancellation of the united states planned tariff increase might not come until much later and could be contingent on china s implementation of policy reforms which is not guaranteed there are many unanswered questions about the scope and structure of the planned bilateral negotiations with japan the eu and the uk but it appears doubtful they will be completed in 2019 and negotiations with japan and the eu in particular are expected to be contentious in addition the outcome of the trump administration s section 232 investigation of automotive goods might not be known until late in the year and there is potential for new trade restrictions and foreign retaliation on a scale much larger than that which resulted from the steel and aluminum investigations at the same time the wto dispute settlement system will face unprecedented challenges including the potential inability to resolve disputes in which appeals are brought it is unclear how such a crisis might be resolved but a solution is unlikely to come quickly or easily thus while some progress is possible this year the trade policy environment is likely to remain challenging for businesses governments and global supply chains click here to download pdf 1 a white house statement on the meeting said that the sides discussed among other things 1 the ways in which united states companies are pressured to transfer technology to chinese companies 2 the need for stronger protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights in china 3 the numerous tariff and non tariff barriers faced by united states companies in china 4 the harm resulting from china s cyber theft of united states commercial property 5 how market distorting forces including subsidies and state owned enterprises can lead to excess capacity 6 the need to remove market barriers and tariffs that limit united states sales of manufactured goods services and agriculture to china and 7 the role of currencies in the united states china trading relationship the two sides also discussed the need to reduce the enormous and growing trade deficit that the united states has with china 2 by comparison 28 house democrats voted to grant trade promotion authority to the obama administration

billion an increase of approximately 555 million or 18 4 as compared to 3 022 billion for the corresponding quarter last fiscal year revenues increased due to higher sales volumes mainly derived from

the activities of shepherd gourmet dairy ontario inc shepherd gourmet acquisition and the f a acquisition as compared to the same quarter last fiscal year this increase was partially offset by a lower average block market per pound of cheese and a lower average butter market price per pound which decreased revenues by approximately 42 million lower international selling prices of cheese and dairy

two crises have deepened america s anxieties over immigration since congress tried to reform the law two years ago the global recession and an outburst of murder and mayhem in northern mexico the recession has aroused antipathy for foreigners who compete for jobs the violence along the border which stems from a high stakes campaign by mexican president felipe calderón to bust apart several large drug cartels has inflamed fears that our borders aren t secure americans differ on what to do about illegal immigration but most agree that the root of the problem is mexico s failure to provide adequately for its own people mexicans differ on how to create a more prosperous democratic nation but most are eager to improve the status of their countrymen living illegally in the united states these attitudes suggest the contours of a grand bargain that both peoples might be persuaded to accept immigration reforms that help mexicans in the united states conditioned on economic and political reforms that help more mexicans get ahead and stay back home mexico s problems have not changed much in 500 years the country has never managed to organize itself into a liberal democracy founded on the habit of inquiry an engaged citizenry and the rule of law its people endured centuries of domination as a colony of spain decades of war and tyranny after independence and a decade long revolution begun in 1910 that killed 2 million people and replaced one autocracy with another for the rest of the century power was concentrated in an immense political corporation the institutional revolutionary party pri and in a succession of presidents who ruled like kings even the pri s defeat in 2000 by vicente fox and the conservative national action party pan has not brought much democracy its main effect has been to weaken the presidency and to set off a free for all among political parties state governments and the big unions bureaucracies and businesses that control them unchecked by executive power these institutions are authoritarian averse to change and corrupt mexicans joke that theirs is the first country in history to move from monarchy backward to feudalism political institutions remain antiquated the mexican constitution prohibits elected officials from standing for reelection it is a chicken and egg dilemma the people don t trust their elected officials to represent their interests so they bar them from serving consecutive terms thereby making them less likely to represent their interests two fifths of the members of the lower house of congress aren t elected at all but appointed by the parties in proportion to their share of the vote citizens efforts to challenge the system are stymied by laws that prohibit anyone outside a party from running for office and also make it hard to form new national parties political discourse is stifled by laws restricting private funding of campaigns and prohibiting all but the parties from buying campaign ads on radio or television rules forbidding campaigns from criticizing one another infantilize the political debate the people are not happy with the system a survey last year by the mexican newspaper reforma found that just 36 percent of mexicans were satisfied with their new multiparty democracy and that only 25 percent felt that their congressional delegates represented their interests political weakness has produced economic weakness the privatization in the 1980s and 1990s of hundreds of state owned enterprises everything from banks and mines to airlines and the phone company strengthened public finances but in most cases the sales were poorly designed and created private monopolies that have impeded productivity growth nafta sold to mexicans as their ticket into the first world has disappointed expectations trade and foreign investment have created jobs but because of government restrictions there hasn t been enough of either to solidify a consensus against protectionism government revenues depend too much on petroleum nearly 40 percent of the federal budget comes from the sale of oil to the united states annual per capita growth over the last decade has averaged just 1 9 percent 40 percent of the population lives below the official poverty line and 60 percent of the nation s households earn less than 25 percent of the nation s income the lack of consensus on how to achieve healthier growth was vivid in the 2006 presidential election when pan candidate calderón defeated a left wing coalition s candidate former mexico city mayor andrés manuel lópez obrador by fewer than 250 000 votes out of more than 41 million cast the results set off months of protests and laid bare a long standing demographic wound the more prosperous north blessed by its proximity to the united states voted by healthy margins for calderón the standard bearer for free markets the south more isolated more indian and with four times the poverty rate of the north voted for lópez obrador who campaigned for social justice for the poor through more government control of the economy ill conceived laws and regulations impede economic growth the world bank group estimates that it takes nearly two months to open a business in mexico compared with five days in the u s and three in canada labor laws make it hard to fire workers land tenure laws make it hard to transfer farmland and inadequate property rights laws make it hard to secure title and get a mortgage many mexicans resort to bribery to skirt these rules a study by the private sector center for economic studies in mexico city found that one in three businesses made extra official payments totaling 11 2 billion to legislators and other public officials in 2004 tax evasion is widespread with total tax collection from all levels of government in 2007 estimated at 19 8 percent of gdp the lowest among 40 countries studied by eurostat and the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd economists estimate the size of the informal economy businesses not registered with the government at 40 percent of gdp the country remains organized into large corporatist powers toxic to free enterprise another oecd report this year cites telecommunications electricity railroads and the media as areas where competition is weak nor is there great clamor for change in a lawless society it pays to be big few mexicans want the government to sell its giant oil monopoly pemex even though the state runs it dismally and the people hate the state the industry was expropriated from foreign companies in 1938 and mexicans are taught in grade school that though the u s stole half their nation s territory the oil at least remains theirs reuters corbis schools are another enormous problem in mexico student knowledge of reading math and science as gauged by the programme for international student assessment is the lowest of the 29 oecd nations graduation rates are low too mexico s 2 400 plus municipalities receive half the federal budget but they spend it poorly because most municipal presidents have only a seventh grade education reports are common of teachers extorting parents abusing children skipping class teaching subjects they don t know drawing salaries for no show jobs and shutting down schools for months at a time when they don t get their way the head of the national educational workers union the largest trade union in latin america with 1 4 million members and the single most powerful institution in mexico agreed last year to permit some competitive hiring based on independent evaluation of teacher competence her members accustomed to selling or bequeathing their posts to offspring and friends protested with strikes but the most notorious challenge to mexico today is the drug cartels and the related surge in crime according to the u s drug enforcement agency mexico produces about eight tonnes of heroin and 10 000 tonnes of marijuana per year mostly for u s consumption it is also the main source of methamphetamine production and the transshipment point for 90 percent of the cocaine that enters the united states a report by barry mccaffrey former director of the white house office of national drug control policy estimates that drug cartels earn over 25 billion a year from u s sales and repatriate over 10 billion a year in cash to mexico tens of thousands of mexicans from shanty dwellers to state governors benefit directly from the drug trade drug abuse has increased in mexico as well seeded by the cartels which began dumping and bartering surplus product as u s markets shrank several years ago an estimated 5 percent of the mexican population consumes illegal drugs the government says and chronic use has doubled in the last six years to half a million addicts murders involving the drug cartels more than doubled last year as the mafias fought one another and the calderón government more than 730 troops and police have been killed since january 2008 in 2008 the u s department of defense caused a stir when it issued a report noting that mexico s government in a worst case scenario might suffer a rapid and sudden collapse under sustained assault and pressure by criminal gangs and drug cartels cocaine traffickers spend as much as 500 million on bribery in mexico more than double the budget of the mexican attorney general s office credible analysts say that the cartels have a significant presence in 20 of the country s 32 states and arrangements of various kinds with at least eight governors the finance ministry estimates that organized crime costs mexico 1 percent of gdp growth per year mexico s kidnapping rate which spiked in the 1990s as drug traffickers diversified or were driven out of business remains among the highest in the world more than 500 kidnappings per month according to a 2008 study by the citizens institute for crime studies protection rackets have also grown the government says that it received 50 000 extortion complaints last year in the border state of chihuahua where fighting against and among the cartels has been fierce even wal mart was approached to pay protection money the country s prison population has doubled to 219 000 in the last eight years but people still don t feel secure four out of five respondents to a national survey last year by the polling firm ipsos bimsa said that they felt very or somewhat unsafe in a reforma poll of mexico city residents this year 65 percent called security the city s biggest problem 20 percent said that they had been the victim of a crime within the prior 12 months most often personal assault when i visited earlier this year one friend i met witnessed an armed robbery another had his car stolen at gunpoint and another an accountant was held up on his way to meet me he hadn t brought his bodyguard law enforcement is terrible a study by researchers at mexico s national autonomous university estimates that for every 1 000 crimes committed in mexico just 16 get prosecuted the offenses that are prosecuted are not the most serious ones 75 percent of state spending on public safety and criminal justice goes to fight minor nonviolent crimes the center of research for development reports a reforma poll found that 36 percent of mexicans consider police corruption an urgent national problem the highest percentage of 65 countries surveyed calderón who has staked his presidency on beating back the cartels and improving public safety had to deploy the army instead of the state and local police because the military is the only security apparatus in mexico that works comparatively well millions of mexicans have fled the country s woes between 1970 and 2008 the percentage of the mexican born population living in the u s grew from 1 5 percent to 11 percent from about 760 000 to 11 8 million people roughly 15 percent of the country s potential male workforce about 7 million are here illegally making up 61 percent of the total illegal immigrant population the department of homeland security estimates most mexicans have relatives living in the u s and as many as one in four households has at least one member here surveys by mexican polling firms show the migration is self perpetuating because the most likely to emigrate are those with relatives already here though the exodus has slowed a bit since the recession mexico s national population council projects that it will last another 30 years or longer the desire for a better life trumps even national pride polls find that most mexicans would be willing to join the two countries into one if doing so would raise their standard of living the most powerful engine of migration is jobs the income gap between mexico and the u s is the largest of any two contiguous countries in the world in 2005 7 750 per capita in mexico versus 35 878 per capita in the united states an american manufacturing job pays four times as much as a mexican manufacturing job and up to 30 times as much as a mexican farming job the gap in per capita gdp between the two countries has barely narrowed in 20 years americans of course can t decide what to do about immigration most business labor and nonprofit organizations support pro immigration policies such as qualified amnesty for illegal aliens increases in legal immigration and new or expanded guest worker programs president barack obama who supported the comprehensive reform bill that failed in 2007 has said that he intends to promote a similar plan that would increase the number of legal immigrants and allow undocumented immigrants to stay in the country pay a fine learn english and go to the back of the line for the opportunity to become citizens most voters however believe that offering amnesty to illegal immigrants would harm american workers and put a strain on the nation s resources there is evidence to support their view a 1997 national academy of sciences study found that the typical u s household pays between 166 and 226 in extra taxes to cover the cost of schools health care and other services used by immigrants and a 2004 study by harvard labor economist george borjas concluded that competition from immigrants depressed wages by 7 4 percent for u s born men without a high school education if these studies are correct it s hard to imagine a policy that protects america s low skilled workers eases the burden of immigrants on public services and satisfies the demands of large u s employers and hispanic rights groups the grim fact is that mexico must help solve america s immigration dilemma by becoming a better country for its people but the united states has two big cards to play to encourage mexico to reform its legal power to resolve the status of 7 million mexicans living here in limbo and its more pervasive economic power as mexico s dominant trading partner and source of foreign investment polls by the magazine este país show that the mexican people would be willing to abandon one of their most cherished convictions and open pemex to private investors in exchange for measures that benefit their relatives in the u s privatizing the oil company would require amending mexico s constitution but energy sector productivity would improve dramatically even if the mexican congress simply passed laws to eliminate restrictions on the import export and domestic sale of crude gasoline basic petrochemicals electricity gas and oil derivatives if opening the energy sector to foreign competition proved too controversial lawmakers could begin with other industries that the oecd identifies as sheltered and inefficient such as telecommunications and the media in return the u s could offer mexican immigrants various benefits higher quotas for work visas or green cards for example like mexico it could avoid the more controversial concessions at first such as guest worker programs beyond the virtues of any one deal establishing the principle of linkage immigration liberalization in the u s conditioned on economic liberalization in mexico would change the political conversations in both countries mexicans in the u s have influence back home and surveys show that they are more likely than the vested interests there to support policies that lead to growth americans likewise might be more willing to accept as truly comprehensive an immigration reform that took into account the key variable affecting migrant flows into the u s mexico s own behavior more broadly the best way to strengthen mexico and ease the pressure of illegal immigration is to stimulate free trade and investment to promote the continent s competitiveness the goal should be to create regional mechanisms like nafta that are accountable to each country s people but that strengthen mexico s institutions in a range of areas including economic regulation competition and monetary policy america should also continue to help mexico fight the drug cartels calderón has won support from the u s congress which last year approved 1 4 billion in security aid for mexico and from president obama who has stepped up efforts to interdict illegal weapons and cash flowing into mexico from the u s we could increase support too for calderón s effort to build a competent national police force the u s agency for international development which has given grants that are stimulating judicial reforms in chihuahua and other states might fund efforts to improve how states and municipalities screen train deploy monitor and reward their security forces we might also consider funding border cities or states to work with their neighbors in the u s to prevent smuggling illegal immigration and crime the u s and mexico grow more intertwined every year mexico supplies a third of our imported oil and is our second largest export market half of mexico s imports come from the u s and more than 80 percent of its exports 20 percent of its gdp go to the united states four of five tourists in mexico come from the u s 18 000 mexican companies have u s investment more than 1 million americans have established mexican residency the largest u s expatriate group in the world despite these ties there is no taking mexico s stability for granted the country mistrusts itself a survey by reforma found that only one in four mexicans agreed that most other mexicans were honest every year brings fresh challenges in 2008 drug violence soared and the global recession slowed growth this year the economy contracted 8 percent through june and the pri corrupt as ever made a strong comeback in july s congressional elections hurting prospects for reform next year is the bicentennial of mexico s independence and the centennial of the revolution u s policies should give both countries something to celebrate top photo chameleonseye istock
via economicprism currency debasement asset price inflation booms bubbles and busts yes folks central bankers have succeeded at making full hash of the world at large this goes for the federal reserve too tracing back recent financial disasters we find the mortgage meltdown coincided with the fed s interest rate raising cycle the fed had dropped rates following the dot com bust and in return puffed up a massive housing bubble so they raised rates to let some air out and pop the bubble exploded the dot com bust also coincided with fed rate hikes rates had been dropped to bailout financial markets from the long term capital management fiasco and to stem contagion from the 1997 asian financial crisis the cheap credit was then channeled into the delusion that the internet would make everyone rich so the fed raised rates to impart some reality back to the stock market and kaboom the pets com sock puppet was blown to bits and on and on these fed exacerbated bubble and bust cycles go back through the decades and maybe these failures are all in the past and maybe they are of little significance to our present complications and maybe the fed will this time get it right and maybe pigs will fly the hopeless truth is central bankers always botch it for example this week following the federal open market committee s fomc january meeting the fomc announced it would continue to price fix the federal funds rate at 2 25 to 2 5 percent is this the correct rate is this the incorrect rate given that it was decreed by a focus group of central planners as opposed to a real open market we can assure you that it s completely and utterly incorrect if you don t already get this you probably never will so here s what you need to know the fed always explodes financial markets and central bankers always botch it a downright disgrace this premise no doubt is obvious and indisputable still like witnessing a slow motion train wreck we can t look away the ongoing disfigurement is transfixing and has extended to every corner of the globe you see several years ago while visiting in laws and outlaws in mexico city the true insanity of central banking was revealed to us in the most unlikely of places we recount this brief tale today as a salutary reminder of the quackery explicit to the central banking profession however before we get to it some context is in order to begin currencies both north and south of the rio grande ain t what they use to be several generations ago they were as reliable as a rooster s call at dawn now they re as crooked as a politician s spine we know this not by reading the history books nor by hearsay but by the honest verifiable silver dollar and silver peso we re holding in our hands one coin the peace dollar is a united states silver dollar minted in the 1920s at the time of its mint one coin equaled one dollar and each dollar contained 0 77344 troy ounces of silver the other coin the 1922 un peso is a mexican silver peso at the time of its mint one coin equaled one peso and each peso contained 0 3856 troy ounces of silver the exchange rate was real simple based on their silver content two pesos equaled one dollar nowadays both pesos and dollars are merely paper promissory notes issued by their country s central banks their value is derived by their track record of stewardship the size of their country s military and the international currency market s acceptance of their government s ability to make payments on their debt we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us today it takes about 19 14 pesos to buy one dollar as you can see the mexican government has been less upright in managing its currency than the u s government has over the last 100 years but when you use silver as the measuring stick the picture changes in the 1920s it took about 1 29 to buy an ounce of silver today it takes 15 94 to buy an ounce of silver this means silver presently costs 1 136 percent more in dollar terms than it did in the 1920s this also means the u s treasury with aid from the federal reserve has done an abysmal job managing the dollar in pesos however it s a downright disgrace in 1922 it took 2 58 pesos to buy an ounce of silver today an ounce of silver costs 305 09 pesos astonishingly in peso terms silver now costs 11 725 percent more than it did in the 1920s the categorical insanity of central planning it doesn t take much time in mexico city to observe that behind the hustle and bustle not only has the government successfully vaporized their currency they have successfully vaporized their middle class you can actually see its nonexistence everywhere you look yet at the same time you can see the ashes of a middle classes prior existence within the cracks of decay as an aside the appearance of a shrinking middle class is now highly visible when traversing through nearly all major u s cities today this is one of the tradeoffs of deficit spending based government stimulus that politicians fail to mention when promising free school free drugs free food and a free retirement yet this is a discussion for another day the current task at hand is to properly characterize the true insanity of central banking as it was revealed to us from the small pueblo of tepoztlán roughly 80 kilometers south of mexico city we d made the trek out to the countryside to visit tío carlos our mother in law s brother a man with unique capabilities tío carlos has never taken a medical course or formally studied medicine certainly he can t perform open heart surgery we don t know if he can even use popsicle sticks to set a broken finger but to the entire pueblo he s el doctor when someone fears their body has been overtaken by evil spirits they visit el doctor for limpia spiritual cleansing with no more than a raw egg he s able to transfer negative energy from a person s body to the egg we were told the egg acts as a sponge in this process this all sounds a little crazy we know but apparently these healings have been taking place in mesoamerica since pre columbian times much longer than central banking s been around we doubt tío carlos knows much if anything about central banking though we re certain he fully appreciates that within his lifetime his country s bank notes have been transmuted to toilet paper as far as we can tell while a bit crazy sounding limpias are generally harmless central banking on the other hand is categorically insane sincerely mn gordon for economic prism
via blacklisted news washington in a leaked military manual on unconventional warfare recently highlighted by wikileaks the u s army states that major global financial institutions such as the world bank international monetary fund imf and the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd are used as unconventional financial weapons in times of conflict up to and including large scale general war as well as in leveraging the policies and cooperation of state governments the document officially titled field manual fm 3 05 130 army special operations forces unconventional warfare and originally written in september 2008 was recently highlighted by wikileaks on twitter in light of recent events in venezuela as well as the years long u s led economic siege of that country through sanctions and other means of economic warfare though the document has generated new interest in recent days it had originally been released by wikileaks in december 2008 and has been described as the military s regime change handbook what s happening with venezuela wikileaks publication of us coup manual fm3 05 130 unconventional warfare provides insight dos department of state ic intelligence community uwoa uw operations area arsof us army special operations forces pic twitter com ez0tgqhesw wikileaks wikileaks january 28 2019 wikileaks recent tweets on the subject drew attention to a single section of the 248 page long document titled financial instrument of u s national power and unconventional warfare this section in particular notes that the u s government applies unilateral and indirect financial power through persuasive influence to international and domestic financial institutions regarding availability and terms of loans grants or other financial assistance to foreign state and nonstate actors and specifically names the world bank imf and the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd as well as the bank for international settlements bis as u s diplomatic financial venues to accomplish such goals the manual also touts the state manipulation of tax and interest rates along with other legal and bureaucratic measures to open modify or close financial flows and further states that the u s treasury s office of foreign assets control ofac which oversees u s sanctions on other nations like venezuela has a long history of conducting economic warfare valuable to any arsof uw campaign this section of the manual goes on to note that these financial weapons can be used by the u s military to create financial incentives or disincentives to persuade adversaries allies and surrogates to modify their behavior at the theater strategic operational and tactical levels and that such unconventional warfare campaigns are highly coordinated with the state department and the intelligence community in determining which elements of the human terrain in uwoa are most susceptible to financial engagement the role of these independent international financial institutions as extensions of u s imperial power is elaborated elsewhere in the manual and several of these institutions are described in detail in an appendix to the manual titled the financial instrument of national power notably the world bank and the imf are listed as both financial instruments and diplomatic instruments of u s national power as well as integral parts of what the manual calls the current global governance system furthermore the manual states that the u s military understand that properly integrated manipulation of economic power can and should be a component of uw meaning that these weapons are a regular feature of unconventional warfare campaigns waged by the united states another point of interest is that these financial weapons are largely governed by the national security council nsc which is currently headed by john bolton the document notes that the nsc has primary responsibility for the integration of the economic and military instruments of national power abroad independent but controlled though the unconventional warfare manual is notable for stating so openly that independent financial institutions like the world bank and the imf are essentially extensions of u s government power analysts have noted for decades that these institutions have consistently pushed u s geopolitical goals abroad indeed the myth of world bank and imf independence is quickly eroded by merely looking at the structure and funding of each institution in the case of the world bank the institution is located in washington and the organization s president has always been a u s citizen chosen directly by the president of the united states in the world bank s entire history the institution s board of governors has never rejected washington s pick this past monday it was reported that president donald trump nominated former bear stearns economist david malpass to lead the world bank malpass had famously failed to foresee the destruction of his former employer during the 2008 financial crisis and is likely to limit world bank loans to china and to countries allied or allying with china given his well established reputation as a china hawk in addition to choosing its president the u s is also the bank s largest shareholder making it the only member nation to have veto rights indeed as the leaked unconventional warfare manual notes as major decisions require an 85 supermajority the united states can block any major changes to world bank policy or the services it offers furthermore the u s treasury secretary former goldman sachs banker and foreclosure king steve mnuchin functions as the world bank s governor though the imf is different from the world bank in several respects such as its stated mission and focus it too is largely dominated by u s government influence and funding for instance the imf is also based in washington and the u s is the company s largest shareholder the largest by far owning 17 46 percent of the institution and also pays the largest quota for the institution s maintenance paying 164 billion in imf financial commitments annually though the u s does not choose the imf s top executive it uses its privileged position as the institution s largest funder to control imf policy by threatening to withhold its imf funding if the institution does not abide by washington s demands as a consequence of the lopsided influence of the u s on these institutions behavior these organizations have used their loans and grants to trap nations in debt and have imposed structural adjustment programs on these debt saddled governments that result in the mass privatization of state assets deregulation and austerity that routinely benefit foreign corporations over local economies frequently these very institutions by pressuring countries to deregulate their financial sector and through corrupt dealings with state actors bring about the very economic problems that they then swoop in to fix guaidó hits up imf given the close relationship between the u s government and these international financial institutions it should come as little surprise that in venezuela the u s backed interim president juan guaidó has already requested imf funds and thus imf controlled debt to fund his parallel government this is highly significant because it shows that top among guaidó s objectives in addition to privatizing venezuela s massive oil reserves is to again shackle the country to the u s controlled debt machine as the grayzone project recently noted venezuela s previous elected socialist president hugo chávez broke ties with the imf and world bank which he noted were dominated by us imperialism instead venezuela and other left wing governments in latin america worked together to co found the bank of the south as a counterbalance to the imf and world bank however venezuela is far from the only country in latin america being targeted by these financial weapons masquerading as independent financial institutions for instance ecuador whose current president has sought to bring the country back into washington s good graces has gone so far as to conduct an audit of its asylum of journalist and wikileaks publisher julian assange in order to win a 10 billion bailout from the imf ecuador granted assange asylum in 2012 and the u s has fervently sought his extradition for still sealed charges ever since in addition last july the u s threatened ecuador with punishing trade measures if it introduced a measure at the un to support breastfeeding over infant formula in a move that stunned the international community but laid bare the willingness of the u s government to use economic weapons against latin american nations beyond ecuador other recent targets of massive imf and world bank warfare include argentina which awarded the largest imf bailout loan in history just last year that loan package was unsurprisingly heavily pushed by the u s according to a statement from treasury secretary mnuchin released last year notably the imf was instrumental in causing the complete collapse of the argentinian economy in 2001 sending a poor omen for last year s approval of the record loan package though it was released over a decade ago this u s coup manual recently highlighted by wikileaks serves as a salient reminder that the so called independence of these financial institutions is an illusion and that they are among the many financial weapons regularly used by the u s government to bend countries to its will and even overthrow u s disfavored governments top photo a masked demonstrator wearing a detail of a 100 u s dollar bill protests the government s plans to make a deal with the imf and increase the price

will we see a recession and a rally in gold in 2019 or 2020 arkadiusz sieron posted feb 7 2019 114 months so long is the current us economic expansion it officially started in june 2009 and if the country avoids recession until july 2019 the uptrend in the business cycle will exceed 120 months becoming the longest expansion since at least 1857 when the nber began recording economy last year we analyzed the popular claim that the current expansion is so long that it must end soon surprisingly for us we reached similar conclusions to janet yellen who said once that expansions do not die of old age however many analysts present more sophisticated arguments for the upcoming crisis for example morgan stanley has recently estimated the odds of recession in the us at 15 percent in 2019 and 30 percent in 2020 larry summers the former treasury secretary has gone even further putting the chances of a recession in the us within the next two years at about 50 percent among institutions and people warning against the upcoming downturn are also brunello rosa and nouriel roubini who forecast recession in 2020 as roubini predicted the great recession it is worthwhile to examine carefully their article the makings of a 2020 recession and financial crisis especially that the authors list 10 reasons justifying their prediction by 2020 stimulus provided by accommodative fiscal policy will run out the rising inflation due to poorly timed stimulus will force the fed to overtighten its monetary policy trump s trade wars will escalate other us policies restricting the foreign investments and immigration will add stagflationary pressure global growth especially in china and emerging markets will slow down europe too will experience slower growth because of the monetary policy tightening and trade frictions us and global equity markets are frothy so there will be a correction in risky assets when the correction occurs the risk of illiquidity and fire sales will become more severe confronted with slower growth trump will attack the fed more directly and will become even more hawkish in foreign policy potentially triggering a military conflict the space for fiscal or monetary stimulus is limited now so the policymakers will not prevent the deep recession roubini and rossa make some good points that s for sure the correction in the stock market has already started but we believe that it s actually something positive the fed is moving off the monetary drip which has to come with painful adjustments correction today means lower risk of harsh burst tomorrow and although the risky assets are subject to repricing so far we do not see systematic risk emanating from the us financial system actually the financial conditions although tightened remain accommodative as the chart below shows chart 1 chicago fed national financial conditions index red line st louis fed financial stress index blue line and kansas fed financial stress index green line from january 2009 to november 2018 click on images to enlarge we totally agree that fiscal stimulus will run out by 2020 but it does not necessarily imply a recession after all the economy grew also before trump s tax cuts slowdown yes recession not necessarily however we do not buy point no 6 we don t want to argue that europe can t experience slower growth but not due to the monetary tightening and trade frictions actually europe may benefit from the trade dispute between us and china and american and chinese companies may trade more with european partners and although the ecb stopped its quantitative easing it will reinvest the principals payments from maturing bonds and it will not raise its interest rates through summer 2019 so there is hardly any monetary tightening in the eurozone other points are also debatable as the pace of money supply growth slows down see the chart below inflation may remain constrained politics is always quite unpredictable but it s not so obvious that trump will escalate the trade conflict with china endlessly or engage in some military conflicts if china makes some concessions just like mexico and canada did in case of nafta trump could strike a deal chart 2 us m1 red line and m2 blue line annual growth rates from january 2014 to november 2018 does it mean that we do not see any risks not at all we do see many risks on a global scale china is probably the biggest question mark the indebtedness is growing and one day the red dragon may fall under the burden of all this debt within the us we see the non financial corporate leverage as the biggest current threat during a downturn a lot of companies will go bankrupt which would worsen the situation however high risks are not immediate risks to sum up expansions do not die of old age they end because of significant imbalances in the economy and excessive monetary tightening which reveals them however although the fed tightens its stance the interest rates are still below neutral level while financial conditions remain favorable and regarding potential imbalances the household balance sheets are not strained see the chart below the corporate sectors look more vulnerable but we do not see a massive overinvestment in capex as before previous recessions chart 3 household debt service payments as a percent of disposable personal income from q1 2009 to q2 2018 what does it all mean for the gold market the lack of clear typical warning signs that preceded the past recessions put the recession in 2020 narrative into question it weakens the arguments saying that gold has to rally soon as the next crisis is just behind the corner having said that gold may shine even without a recession all it needs to shine is the bear market in the us dollar it s too early to call it but if the fiscal stimulus and monetary tightening run out of steam the greenback will lose an important part of its support which would allow gold to catch its breath if you enjoyed the above analysis we invite you to

morning and welcome to today s earnings call as s p global team focused on powering the markets of the future a volatility and uncertainty returned to the markets in 2018 the causes were numerous rising interest rates trade negotiations brexit and the unwinding of global monetary stimulus and during the fourth quarter this volatility and uncertainty impacted debt issuance and therefore our ratings business fortunately our remaining three businesses performed well and the company delivered strong financial results i m going to review our full year highlights and ewout will review the fourth quarter results in a moment in 2018 we delivered 3 revenue growth and 23 adjusted diluted eps growth we generated significant margin improvement in every business we reported 2 billion in free cash flow excluding certain items an 8 increase year over year we returned 2 2 billion through share repurchases and dividends as you know our target is return to at least 75 of free cash flow excluding certain items to shareholders but we returned more than 100 in 2018 we initiated a new we re initiating a new 500 million asr in the next few days and we made great strides toward our investor day targets but in the meantime we always need to build for the future both through organic projects and by adding new capabilities from outside the company to that end we added leading edge technology and unique data sets with the acquisitions of kensho panjiva and ratewatch revenue for 2018 increased 3 despite a 4 decline in our ratings segment our adjusted operating profit increased 8 and our adjusted operating profit margin increased 230 basis points to 48 8 this marks great progress on our investor day adjusted operating profit margin target over the next three to four years of low 50s in addition we continued to reduce our shares outstanding the 2 reduction achieved in 2018 helped us reduce shares by 10 over the past five years finally our adjusted diluted eps increased by 23 while revenue growth margin improvement and share count reduction played a role approximately one half of the increase in 2018 was the benefit us tax reform had on effective tax rate advertisement advertisement revenue growth and productivity efforts propelled the adjusted operating profit margin in 2018 revenue declined in ratings due to reduced issuance despite this decline ratings delivered greater margin improvement than any other segment i m pleased with the efforts of our employees to continue to drive revenue growth and productivity gains across s p global this performance extended our succession of solid revenue growth and adjusted operating margin growth we ve delivered a four year cagr for revenue of 6 and improved our adjusted operating profit margin by more than 1 200 basis points in the past four years the results of these collective efforts has been a 21 compounded annual growth rate of adjusted diluted eps over the past four years as we ve delivered these results we ve continued to invest for future growth and productivity in 2018 we continued to invest in technology and data we acquired world class artificial intelligence and machine learning technology with kensho unique technology and supply chain data with panjiva differentiated banking data with ratewatch and in the fourth quarter certain index intellectual property rights in addition to these acquisitions we invested in companies pioneering new technologies these included regtech solutions of fiscalnote an energy production information with xpansiv we also licensed private company data from crunchbase and through our other agreements licensed new data sets for companies in china and the uk finally we accelerated our esg investments organically and through the full acquisition of the climate data pioneer trucost this has allowed us to expand trucost s unique data across s p global and combine our data resources with our world class data operations in market intelligence in aggregate during 2018 we invested more than 800 million in acquisitions we made another 60 million in internal investments that were expensed for work associated with kensho panjiva ratewatch esg and china one of the highlights of 2019 so far has been our recent approval to enter the china domestic bond market we re honored to receive the first approval for our wholly owned subsidiary of an international cra to rate domestic chinese bonds we are now authorized to rate issuers and issuances from financial institutions corporates structured finance bonds and panda bonds or renminbi denominated bonds from foreign issuers our new entity s p ratings china ltd will be headquartered in beijing and has 36 employees 31 of which are ratings analysts advertisement advertisement we are able to assemble an exceptional team made up of our existing ratings employees as well as experts from the chinese debt capital markets and local ratings agencies it s important to understand that s p ratings china ltd and s p global ratings are two independent entities each with their own methodologies and analytical autonomy the methodologies in the new business have been developed with reference to and leveraged from s p global ratings methodologies this brings our total presence in greater china for ratings to more than 200 employees we plan to initiate coverage on the roughly 400 existing corporate clients that already issue cross border bonds today issuance spreads within china s bond markets are virtually uncorrelated with domestic rating categories we intend to offer a national scale rating for issuers in the chinese market we re well prepared and ready to issue chinese domestic ratings both our ratings business and our indices business can be impacted by short term market movements i d like to put some of these movements into perspective starting with 2018 issuance global issuance decreased 6 in the volatile market environment in particular high yield issuance declined 40 this category has a disproportionate impact on our revenues since few if any of these companies are in frequent issuer programs we often talked about the correlation between spreads and issuance this can be seen very clearly in the high yield market issuance levels have a strong negative correlation with spreads so the spreads widened in 2018 progressed especially in the fourth quarter issuance was impacted just for comparison purposes you can see that the correlation between spreads and issuance is not nearly as strong in investment grade where gdp growth business confidence and maturity pipeline are more highly correlated to issuance volumes while the impact from us tax reform has been positive for our bottom line it has as we expected been a drag and issuance in fact the 50 us companies with the largest overseas cash balances at the end of 2017 issued 170 billion of debt in 2017 and only 42 billion in 2018 this drop is responsible for a 10 decline overall in investment grade issuance in aggregate over 2018 the global cash balances of these 50 companies have declined by 91 billion or 10 while 18 of these companies have returned to the bond market we expect more will return as cash balances continue to normalize we ll continue to monitor this very closely advertisement advertisement during the fourth quarter global issuance decreased 19 as the weakness in corporate issuance exceeded strength in some pockets of the structured market in the us issuance declined 36 as investment grade decreased 34 high yield cratered 79 in fact december was the first month since lcd began tracking issuance in 2005 that there was no high yield issuance public finance decreased 44 and structured finance declined 16 with gains in rmbs offset by declines in abs clos and cmbs in europe issuance decreased 11 as investment grade decreased 25 high yield declined 73 and structured finance increased 59 almost entirely due to strength in covered bonds a category where we have very little presence in asia issuance increased 8 since much of this is made up of local chinese debt that we currently don t rate this increase is not meaningful to our results while these declines are very significant let me put the fourth quarter global issuance into perspective this slide depicts quarterly global issuance for the past six years the fourth quarter of each year is highlighted in dark blue as you can see the fourth quarter of 2018 was in line with historical fourth quarters it s the exceptional issuance in the fourth quarter of 2017 which created a very difficult comparison there s another dynamic increasingly impacting high yield issuance this chart shows that us speculative grade borrowers are increasingly turning to the bank loan market the light and dark blue bars illustrate leveraged loans and the brown bars depict high yield bonds the movement from high yield bonds to leveraged loans is not a concern for the company these charts depict that in both the us and europe leveraged loan volumes have increased and the percentage of these loans that we rate is also increasing in fact in 2018 we rated 92 of us leveraged loans and 84 of european leveraged loans and so our bank loan ratings revenue continues to increase reaching 380 million in 2018 remember when doing your analysis leveraged loan activity is not included in bond issuance data now let me turn to indices the savings to investors from the lower fees associated with index investing has been dramatic the bars on this chart depict the growth in total index assets invested in products linked to the s p 500 s p midcap 400 and the s p smallcap 600 as the end of 2017 they totaled 3 6 trillion the line on this chart depicts the fees saved by investors on these products more than 150 billion in the last 10 years advertisement advertisement turning to industry trends affecting our indices business this chart depicts the continuing outflows from actively managed us mutual funds into index based etfs and mutual funds a trend that has benefited us as we worked with the markets to provide indexed products and solutions and much of the success arose from the visionary legend in the index investment world who passed away last month jack bogle the father of indexing jack wanted to help individual investors save and give them as he would say a fair shake and we re grateful for his vision in 1976 jack introduced the first indexed mutual fund now called the vanguard 500 index fund today this fund based on the s p 500 is one of the largest mutual funds in the world with more than 400 billion in aum jack didn t just build a fund he built an industry specifically to etf aum associated with our indices we saw a decline in 2018 due to year end market correction for the full year market declines led to a 125 billion reduction in year end etf aum despite this decline inflows continued adding 90 billion in etf aum i d like to shift to our 2019 outlook our economists expect 2019 global gdp growth of 3 6 slightly lower than the 2018 forecast of 3 8 with lower growth in the us europe and china our economists believe that there is only a 15 to 20 chance of a us recession in 2019 last month ratings issued its annual global refinancing study this yearly study shows debt maturities for the upcoming five years the chart on the left illustrates data from the 2018 and 2019 studies the five year period in the 2019 study shows a 400 billion increase in the total debt maturing versus the 2018 study we use this study along with other market based data to forecast issuance taking a closer look at data from the study reveals an important trend in high yield maturities over the next five years the level of high yield debt maturing significantly increases each year which is a potential source of revenue in the coming years the company updated its 2019 bond issuance forecast in a report issued last week excluding international public finance issuance is expected to decrease less than 1 advertisement advertisement during investor day we introduced the framework powering the markets of the future including six foundational capabilities we use this framework to set our goals and allocate resources so in 2019 here are some of the top projects and initiatives we prioritized in line to this framework under global we believe that they are in a unique position to bring additional transparency and independent analytics to the capital markets in china the ratings opportunity that i just discussed is one example in addition market intelligence will be expanding its private company and local content within rich data risk analytics and models in china platts will be extending its commercial presence in asia and additional locations with a larger sales force under customer orientation we continue to build out the market intelligence platform which will be rebranded as the s p global platform we ll continue to migrate both capital iq content and capital iq users to the platform in addition we will be adding platts pricing and news content in the platform and expanding the ratings 360 content these efforts are intended to create an increasingly rich user experience for our customers under innovation we re ramping up our esg data factory by centralizing data sets from across the company as well as adding new data sets we re also creating new data feeds for our customers our indices business will be expanding its offering at esg and smart beta indices under technology we re moving out of several data centers and into cloud operation in addition as ewout will review in a moment we re implementing numerous kensho related projects under operational excellence we ll continue our efforts to optimize the management of data ingestion and operation we ll also be leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities throughout our data operations and while cybersecurity has already been an area of focus it s important that we keep improving our capabilities as benchmarks against the nift framework under people we ll extend the program that was initiated in 2018 to raise the technological acumen of all of our employees through a series of online and classroom training courses we also maintain our commitment to diversity and inclusion advertisement advertisement and finally i want to bring your attention to a campaign that we introduced at the world economic forum in davos last month it s entitled changepays within on our data and insights we were able to demonstrate a greater workforce inclusivity leads to healthier stronger economies our campaign illuminates the positive impact of women in the workforce on companies organizations economies and global communities please take a look at our research and watch the changepays video and while you re added take a look at our 2018 corporate responsibility report for all we are doing in esg and now i d like to turn the call over to ewout steenbergen who ll provide additional insights into our capital plans and financial performance ewout ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you doug and good morning to all of you on the call let me start with our fourth quarter financial results organic revenue decreased 4 as issuance driven declines in ratings exceeded growth in the other three segments adjusted corporate unallocated loss was improved by 24 due to lower incentive compensation as well as our productivity efforts to lower real estate costs and a reduction in professional fees adjusted total expense declined due to lower incentive compensation and success with our ongoing productivity efforts this led to a 270 basis points improvement in our adjusted operating profit margin while us tax reform has substantially lowered our adjusted effective tax rate this quarter it was unusually low because new tax regulations related to us tax reform were issued in the fourth quarter which altered our previous assumptions when the stock declined in the fourth quarter we initiated a new 500 million asr this program along with other share repurchases resulted in a 2 decline in our diluted weighted average shares outstanding and finally we achieved a 20 increase in our adjusted diluted eps to 2 22 during the fourth quarter because of the unusual level of stock option activity in the third quarter of 2017 the stock based compensation tax benefit that we received in 2018 was 0 14 lower than in 2017 as the number of employee stock options continues to decline we expect the stock based compensation tax benefit to decline as well for 2019 we estimate a positive eps impact of 0 05 to 0 10 changes in foreign exchange rates had a modest negative impact on revenue in the ratings business and a positive 15 million impact on adjusted operating profit for the company or about 0 05 of adjusted diluted eps our expenses were positively impacted by the weakening of the indian rupee british pound and argentine peso for the full year changes in foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of 0 19 on adjusted diluted eps there were a number of non gaap adjustments to operating profit this quarter 16 million in restructuring charges in ratings and market intelligence we expect that this will result in 15 million in annual savings a 5 million non cash accounting adjustment associated with our uk pension plan 9 million in kensho retention related expenses and we had 31 million in deal related amortization this is a slide that we shared at our investor day in may it depicts the framework that we outlined to show the areas where we can most impact shareholder value the first two require investments we need to continue to invest to fuel revenue momentum by improving our products introducing new technology adding new data sets and entering new geographies we ve made great progress delivering ebita enhancement and we must continue to fund new organic opportunities to drive additional productivity gains driving financial leverage involves optimizing interest costs reducing shares outstanding and optimizing the tax rates and finally we want to return capital to shareholders while maintaining flexible debt capacity we are committed to returning at least 75 of annual free cash flow to shareholders each year this quarter we recorded strong revenue growth in s p dow jones indices market intelligence and platts ratings declined due to lower debt issuance with the exception of the revenue driven shortfall in ratings revenue growth and productivity efforts resulted in substantial adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating profit margin improvement in every other business segment here you see our headcount by business at the end of the last three years the key takeaway is that over the past two years headcount has increased 6 and revenue and adjusted diluted eps have increased 11 and 59 respectively the major additions have been from acquisitions and insourcing of contractors at investor day we cited a new 100 million three year cost reduction plan it was based on productivity improvements often through investments in support functions real estate technology and digital infrastructure i m pleased to report that after our first year we estimate that we have achieved run rate savings of approximately 60 million of which about 40 million was realized in our 2018 results examples include reducing our real estate footprint by exiting space at our new york headquarters and at our london office consolidating data centers and offshoring certain business services now turning to the balance sheet in 2018 our return of capital to shareholders exceeded 100 of 2018 free cash flow this was accomplished by returning 1 66 billion to repurchase 8 4 million shares and paying 503 million in dividends in addition we re actively working to fuel future revenue growth through acquisitions and organic investments collectively these actions resulted in a 800 million decline in our cash balances versus the end of 2017 our adjusted gross leverage to adjusted ebitda is holding steady at 1 9x well within our targeted range while we have begun already our 2019 share repurchases program with open market purchases of approximately 130 million in january we ll initiate a new 500 million asr in the next few days free cash flow excluding certain items increased 8 in 2018 to 2 billion this level is a bit lower than our 2018 forecast due to lower fourth quarter ratings revenue and a longer renewal process associated with enterprisewide contracts in market intelligence the latter is due to a timing issue that will reverse in 2019 now let s turn to the segment results starting with ratings the decline in issuance particularly high yield issuance that doug discussed resulted in a 16 decline in ratings revenue nevertheless we reported a 16 decline in adjusted expenses resulting in a 10 basis point increase in adjusted segment operating profit margin expense reductions were primarily from productivity programs lower incentive compensation accruals and lower it spend as ratings has established an it center in india and has in sourced much of its it spend for 2018 ratings delivered a 240 basis point improvement in adjusted segment operating profit margin to 56 this is particularly notable in light of the 4 decline in revenue for the year the ratings cost structure is well positioned for a recovery in issuance non transaction revenue decreased primarily due to a 6 million impact from changes in foreign exchange in addition there were lower excess issuance fees associated with medium term notes and lower rating evaluation services activity transaction revenue decreased due to debt issuance reductions partially offset by increased bank loan rating activity non transaction revenue has been a steady source of growth this is because the majority of the revenue is subscription like however there is some volatility of certain components namely rating evaluation services ebb and flow with m a activity and changes in foreign exchange rates can always have an impact this slide depicts ratings revenue by its end markets the largest contributor to the decline in ratings revenue was the 15 decline in corporates primarily as a result of us tax reform that doug discussed earlier issuance declines associated with market volatility also drove the declining revenue financial services revenue decreased 22 structured finance declined 14 and governments decreased 33 while the crisil and other categories decreased 2 it included an increase in inter segment royalties for market intelligence offset by a decline in crisil s dollar denominated revenue market intelligence delivered a strong quarter with organic revenue excluding revenue from panjiva and ratewatch increasing 7 and active desktop user growth of 12 with adjusted expenses down 1 adjusted segment operating profit increased 27 and the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 570 basis points to 38 5 a new high point for the full year the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 200 basis points to 34 1 while we are thrilled with the fourth quarter of margin the full year margin is more representative of our current run rate beginning this quarter we began integrating trucost into market intelligence market intelligence has a lot of esg activity under way and we believe the business is better suited to be included here desktop the largest category grew 6 data management solutions realized 12 revenue growth once again benefiting from expansion of the data feeds business risk services grew 6 with the ratingsxpress providing the greatest level of growth as we continued to expand the data feeds portion of risk services turning to s p dow jones indices the segment delivered 13 revenue growth 7 adjusted expense growth and 17 adjusted segment operating profit growth this led to an adjusted segment operating profit margin of 67 1 for the quarter and 68 for the full year increases of 220 basis points and 160 basis points respectively strong revenue growth during the quarter was driven by a 43 increase in exchange traded derivatives from increased market volatility and a 19 increase in data and custom subscriptions data and custom subscriptions increased due to a catch up in real time reporting that we first discussed in the second quarter as well as from organic growth asset linked fees increased 4 primarily due to increased average aum in etfs and mutual funds linked to our indices it is important to understand that asset linked fees include revenue associated with etfs mutual funds and certain over the counter derivatives investors frequently assume that all this revenue is related to etfs despite the market downturn at the end of 2018 inflows into to passive products continued in the fourth quarter both for the industry and for etfs tied to our indices for our indices business etf net inflows were 22 billion in the fourth quarter and 90 billion for the full year the average aum in the fourth quarter increased 9 year over year i want to make a clear distinction between average aum and quarter ending aum our contracts are based on average aum we disclose quarter ending figures because flows and market gains and losses are best depicted using quarter end figures as shown in the waterfall chart on the right while average aum increased quarter ending aum declines versus the end of the fourth quarter 2017 a year ago there was 1 343 trillion in etf aum linked to our indices at the end of 2018 there was 1 309 trillion during 2018 we saw 90 billion of inflows and 125 billion in stock market declines industry inflows into exchange traded funds were 168 billion in the fourth quarter and 499 billion in 2018 clearly we are encouraged by the recovery in etf aum in january key indicators for our exchange traded derivatives volume were extremely strong during the quarter s p 500 index options activity increased 36 vix futures and options activity increased 2 and activity at the cme equity complex increased 71 for the full year s p 500 index options activity increased 26 vix futures and options activity decreased 6 and activity at the cme equity complex increased 34 and now turning to the last business segment platts delivered healthy revenue and margin growth revenue increased 7 as a result of a 7 increase in core subscriptions and 11 increase in global trading services partially offset by a decline in other revenue which is mostly from conferences adjusted expense declined 2 due to reduced incentive accruals and a reduction in outside services the fourth quarter adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 470 basis points to 48 2 the full year adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 200 basis points to 49 1 this chart depicts global trading services revenue by quarter for the last three years there s volatility from quarter to quarter as the underlying trading volume fluctuates however gts does provide a constant revenue contribution to the platts business during the fourth quarter revenue improved due mainly to increased trading volumes in certain gas oil and fuel oil markets platts revenue increased in the quarter as all four commodity groups delivered mid single digits growth during investor day in may 2018 we introduced medium term aspirational targets for the company we are pleased to use this morning s investor call to reiterate these targets and to share the great progress we have made in just the first year we target to deliver organic revenue growth of mid to high single digit each year during 2018 we achieved the target in three of our four businesses unfortunately ratings fell short due to market factors we target low double digit adjusted eps growth during 2018 we delivered 23 we re committed to return at least 75 of our free cash flow each year in 2018 we returned 108 through share repurchases and dividends and we established adjusted operating profit margin levels that we target to achieve in next three to four years in the first year we made substantial progress with each of the businesses contributing to an overall 230 basis point improvement in the company s adjusted operating profit margin we re energized by our progress and confident as we begin the second year of this effort in 2019 we plan to invest 90 million to 110 million in new project to fuel additional future organic growth this is an increase over the 60 million we invested in 2018 the first category for investment is global growth with regulatory approvals now secured ratings will continue to build its domestic ratings capability in china and platts is working to expand its commercial operations in asia market intelligence has a china initiative that involves setting up digital infrastructure and domestic operations as well as adding additional global capability to the s p global platform the second category is innovation with plans to ramp up our esg data factory as a central source to serve esg offerings from various business segments including new esg analytics and data products that we will be piloting platts agriculture acceleration involves extending news and data offerings and expanding into additional commodities we ll also expand the number of projects that are under way as part of our kensho initiative the third category is in technology we re adding investments to continue the deployment of data science ai cloud machine learning and robotics tools we also continue to raise the technology acumen of all employees through a multitude of training programs all of these investments were aimed at either growing revenue or enhancing ebitda ph next i would like to update you on kensho one of the greatest challenges we have had with kensho is prioritizing the large number of projects that employees have identified projects generally can be grouped in three key areas data ingestion data processing and data and document delivery within these categories there are a number of projects that are under way omnisearch and entity linking are two we have cited in the past omnisearch is the next generation of search capability for our market intelligence ratings360 and platts lng surface applications it leverages advanced machine learning techniques to bring natural language search to our web and mobile platforms we re also working to link user personas to more relevant responses as well as expanding the data sets that will be searchable the first release will be available in the first half of 2019 to a select group of clients for preview and feedback and then released in a broader capacity later in 2019 or the first half of 2020 entity linking involves using machine learning to link data from different sources to correct entities without errors and in a fraction of the time it would take our employees it unlocks the ability to ingest data sets that are too large to be done with traditional methods in addition to the crunchbase data we previously discussed we have been working on certain data sets for private company data in china and the uk for the uk data we plan to make the first 100 000 companies available in the first quarter of this year with subsequent releases of coverage throughout 2019 codex is a next generation customer oriented platform designed to ingest any document and provide the relevant data and information for a particular user s needs a first version of the platform has been built and demonstrations are under way proof of concept user case has been created for ratings analysts to alert them to new relevant information more quickly we have numerous other projects under way in data processing and delivery the first projects were initiated in just nine months since acquiring kensho we estimate the initial projects in omnisearch entity linking and codex which are the most advanced have the potential to generate a net present value equal to approximately one third of the purchase price of kensho we have numerous other projects under way in data processing and data delivery and numerous others that have been identified but not yet begun we believe that this is a very positive start with much more value generation to be achieved during the next few years now lastly i would like to introduce our 2019 guidance this slide depicts our gaap guidance please keep in mind that our guidance reflects current spot market forex rates this slide shows our adjusted guidance an increase in revenue of mid single digits with contributions by every business segment we have decided to record kensho revenue in market intelligence going forward therefore we are providing guidance on corporate unallocated expense excluding any revenue of 155 million to 165 million deal related amortization of 120 million to 125 million kensho retention plans of 20 million to 25 million operating profit margin in the range of 48 8 to 49 8 interest expense of 145 million to 150 million a tax rate of 22 5 to 23 5 this is an increase over 2018 because we expect to have a lower benefit from employee stock based compensation as well as less discrete benefits from prior year tax adjustments and diluted eps which excludes deal related amortization of 8 95 to 9 15 in addition we expect capital expenditures of approximately 120 million and free cash flow excluding certain items in the range of 2 2 billion to 2 3 billion in 2019 we are increasing our organic investments in productivity programs and new revenue opportunities and we will continue to look for opportunities to add unique data analytics and geographies despite so many pending global economic issues this guidance reflects our expectation that we will continue to deliver solid financial performance again in 2019 with this let me turn the call back over to chip for your questions chip merritt senior vice president investor relations thank you just a couple of instructions for our phone participants operator instructions operator we ll now take our first question questions and answers operator thank you this question comes from toni kaplan from morgan stanley you may ask your question toni kaplan morgan stanley analyst thank you good morning transaction revenue this quarter was not surprisingly weak just given the issuance levels and january issuance was maybe modestly better than 4q but still down double digits according to our sources so can you give a bit more color on how you re thinking about the credit environment as we progress through the year thanks douglas l peterson president and chief executive officer hi toni thank you this is doug first of all as you know during the year last year we had a solid year during the year but the fourth quarter in particular december ended up with very very weak comparables from prior years in particular there was a shift in the high yield market where people started thinking differently about the type of covenants that were going out to the markets we also had as you know the impact from tax reform from the largest cash holders it started bringing their cash back and had not gone to the market we think that january is not necessarily indicative of the entire year as you know typically january is a pretty weak month one of the things that was important in january is to see in the second half of january in the third and fourth week the markets actually started rebounding you saw more people coming back to the market you saw spreads came down in the high yield market but as you know in our forecast overall we have a forecast for total issuance which takes into account the pipeline that we see coming in from maturities we speak with investment banks and with issuers and right now we have projected that for the entire year that issuance would be down to about 0 6 so call it down a little bit or flat we think that in the corporate sector that s going to be down about 4 at financial services it is going to be down about 1 3 structured finance basically flat and public finance up over the prior year of about 9 so if you look across different categories this is how we ve calculated and this is what we ve used to build into our plans for the year toni kaplan morgan stanley analyst great thanks for that and then in market intelligence you expanded margin significantly this quarter and i know you said that full year is probably more representative of run rate margins but could you give some additional color on what i guess may be the onetime pieces were in 4q and what s ongoing and then are margins in market intelligence an area that you can flex when if there s a weak issuance environment thank you ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning toni this is ewout so the strong margin improvement in market intelligence was driven on the one hand as you ve seen by very healthy revenue growth and then on the other hand by a small decline in expenses if you look at the underlying components in the expense movements there were a couple of items that were going in opposite directions and therefore showing the declines small decline modest decline in expenses compensation base compensation was up but then there was an offset in lower incentive compensation accruals so the net was close to zero results strong sales in the fourth quarter strong sales was driving up the cost of sales as well as inter segment royalties but then also strong sales leads to higher capitalization of acquisition cost under the new revenue accounting methods so those are also a bit offsetting we saw fx having a positive impact on the expenses of market intelligence allocations were down so corporate allocations were down but then acquisitions that were down during the year most notably panjiva and ratewatch were driving expenses up so a lot of moving pieces but net net a small decline in expenses and therefore a good improvement in margins but we don t expect all of these items to recur in every quarter so therefore the full year margin is a better guidance for market intelligence going forward toni kaplan morgan stanley analyst thank you operator thank you this question comes from manav patnaik with barclays you may ask your question manav patnaik barclays analyst thank you good morning just on the 2019 topline guidance what s the fx impact you are assuming and also you kind of gave us a framework for the ratings business i know you don t like to give specific guidance on the others but is there anything to call out for next year for each of those businesses or can we just assume kind of the trends that we ve seen so far ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning manav this is ewout first in our guidance we assume current spot market forex rates so that is what is the underlying assumption if you look at our guidance with respect to topline for the company as a whole as you know we re not breaking out guidance for each of the segments but what i can explain to you is some of the assumptions underneath so if you have to think about ratings as doug already mentioned our assumption is more or less flat issuance markets during 2019 then we have some small adjustments in market shares in short in segments and then we also take into account price increases based on the new list price that we re using from the 1st of january of this year so that is the underlying assumption we have under our plan for 2019 for ratings we have two subscription businesses so those are i think businesses that see growth based on the annualized contract value that we are increasing every year and you have seen the good progress we are making with platts and market intelligence and then with respect to indices as you know there is a natural hedge in our indices business if stock markets will come down we see exchange traded derivatives volumes going up and the other way around so you have to take that into account in your modeling to also reflect the growth of our indices business but as we have said in the prepared remarks we expect mid single digit revenue growth for the company as a whole and contributions by each of our segments to achieve that manav patnaik barclays analyst got it thank you and then i guess just thinking about china you ve talked about the ratings opportunity there for some time but i guess i was struck by it sounds like market intelligence is doing something new platts kensho i was just wondering if you could briefly address how we should think about the opportunity that those other areas present douglas l peterson president and chief executive officer let me take that one well first of all as you know the chinese financial markets are still a very bank centric market in fact as we were doing the work to understand the opportunity for ratings business we did a lot of macroanalysis of the market just to share with you a couple of the numbers for instance in the bond market in china 54 of the bonds are held by banks and 32 by mutual funds and wealth management projects only 2 of the bonds in china are held by foreign investors and the issuers themselves are spread between corporate bonds such which actually quite low compared to the other markets local governments commercial banks et cetera but what s important is the chinese market becomes more sophisticated as the bond market shifts to become a true bond market and not a commercial banking market as more foreign investors start going into the chinese market we looked at the structured markets in the way they change over time as they become more developed and what we believe is that there is our basic thesis is that there will be more and more demand for independent analytics so one of the first products is obviously the ratings and we think that that is a market which will develop pretty quickly especially because there s going to be demand not just from the domestic investors but also over time from international investors and along with that is in any market comes demand for other types of products and services data products information more information about private companies that don t have that are not publicly traded and this is where we are looking at the market intelligence offering to be able to provide more data and analytics at cap iq snl like data service for the chinese markets and we ve just started to mentioning that and we just started rolling it out we have a team on the ground one of the other elements which is for us is actually quite exciting of the launch of the chinese market is that we re also doing this is a team we re doing it as s p global even though the rating agency has its own license and it has it s own staff we re also going in with one effort when it comes to hiring in our human resources and people policies one legal and compliance team so we can actually leverage our sources on the ground so we re able to go to the market but overall our thesis is that as the market becomes more sophisticated more connected there s going to be a whole set of data and analytics and financial products which are going to be necessary in the market and we want to be on the ground floor as they become more important operator thank you this question comes from hamzah mazari from macquarie capital you may ask your question hamzah mazari macquarie capital analyst good morning you talked about the shift from high yield to leveraged loans in the us could you maybe remind us what the margin difference is in your business between loan ratings and high yield and then whether you re seeing the same trend in europe because secular thesis a while back on ratings was european bank dis intermediation so wondering if that has sort of reversed any color there douglas l peterson president and chief executive officer thanks hamzah this is doug first of all on the pricing it s basically about the same it s not there s not a material difference between the pricing between the two different products in europe we continue to see europe the capital markets are continuing to develop but you have one major impact which has in a sense slowed down what we thought was going to be the ultimate development and that is the ecb is continuing to provide a lot of liquidity for the markets but in the last quarter up until you had the slowdown of the leveraged loan market the european markets were actually moving quite fast so there was a lot of issuance and in the last two weeks of january the european leveraged markets actually came back to life and there was issuance back in the european market so we do think in the long run the european markets will continue to move toward capital markets more quickly obviously compared to we just talked about in the prior questions about china europe is a much more developed capital market than what we see it s one that just starting out but it s not quite still at the level of us when it comes to participation of traditional capital market entities like insurance companies and pension funds and asset managers but we re seeing continued move in that direction hamzah mazari macquarie capital analyst okay and just a follow up question on ratings margins you talked about up 10 bps on a 16 revenue drop and highlighted various reasons if ratings revenue does come back how quickly do costs come back in that segment just any comments on operating leverage in that segment being structurally much higher or any thoughts on sort of how costs come back to that segment if you see revenue come back ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning hamzah this is ewout a couple of thoughts that hopefully are helpful on the one hand ratings is working on very active programs to think about how to redesign its operations its business model its processes its systems is introducing new technologies in order to make the life of inaudible analysts more effective to take away some of the lower value added work the spreadsheet work and updating of the models and to replace that with new technologies and to get that done in a more efficient way so we expect operating leverage for ratings to continue you saw that we took another restructuring charge for ratings as well so those are benefits in the programs where we will continue to see improvements in overall productivity in the ratings organization the other element that you have to take into account is incentive compensation and we had some expense benefit during the quarter from the incentive compensation accruals for the full year the way how to dimensionalize that is the following so first ratings had a very good year in 2017 as had some other businesses in the company as you will recall so we had very good payout so we will see a reduction just every year a reset to a 100 of the accrual levels and then this year particularly in the fourth quarter the performance was of course lower so now you have a reflection of lower payout from that 100 level so if you look at the overall expense reduction year over year for ratings which was approximately 120 million the majority of that came from incentive accruals a little over half of that was just a reset year over year to the 100 level and a little bit less than half of that reduction came from the lower accruals that we established in 2018 that of course will come back up to the 100 level in 2019 so that is an automatic increase in the costs that we will see in 2019 from 2018 but again we expect also at the same time continued improvement of the productivity programs that we are implementing in ratings hamzah mazari macquarie capital analyst very helpful thank you operator thank you this question comes from alex kramm from ubs you may ask your question alex kramm ubs analyst yeah hi good morning everyone just hoping you can expand on the conversation about china that was asked about earlier and in your prepared remarks you gave some nice data points i think 35 employees in that new entity but 200 in the other parts like how quickly are you ramping people here and what cost is tied to it at an end secondarily you said 400 companies already rated out of the other entities so that can come pretty quickly so maybe just talk about the next few quarters few years in terms of how quickly that business can ramp and then in terms of pricing like how do you think envision the pricing structures are very comparable to the rest of the world or is there something we should be thinking about differently in terms of basis points thank you douglas l peterson president and chief executive officer okay thanks alex well just to give you a little bit more of the ramp up plan as you have heard we have 36 employees in the entity 31 of those are analysts of those analysts about 10 of them are employees from s p global that transferred in from other parts of the world who are bringing their core knowledge and expertise of how s p global works everywhere else they are native mandarin speakers that have come in from other offices and then we ve hired 21 more analysts from the market being a first mover was an advantage to us because we were able to go out in the market and attract a very large pool of candidates and hire a really highly qualified set of people and because we were there first we already have started hiring we think that we can ramp up very quickly if the demand comes in right now in china there s about 4 000 issuers that are rated across the markets by the domestic rating agencies we rate about 400 of those offshore we ve already developed plans to go out and meet with all of those different 400 that we re working with already as well as the others as many as possible the other issuers that are rated i can t i don t want to give you any kind of financial projections on this but i can tell you that the pricing that we re looking at over time will develop to a similar level as around the globe it s likely to start out where you need to enter the market at a level of pricing that s going to be able to get us close the transactions and get out into the markets but we expect over time that the pricing is going to be similar to the rest of the world as you know pricing on bond ratings is actually a very low amortized cost compared to the cost of actual bond issuance and so that s why we think we can over time we can develop to that level of pricing when we look at the different kinds of bond markets is as you saw in our prepared remarks there s four different categories of bonds that we re able to rate that we ve been approved for we think that the financial institutions and the corporates are really the core area that we will start rating right away because that s where we have the relationships with the 400 issuers we do as you know we have a very long term thinking about this this is something that developed over the long term this didn t just come about over one quarter we ve been working on this for years john berisford ewout and myself have been visiting china for years to build the relationships and to understand the markets and with that kind of a long term commitment to the way we ve approached to this is the same way we think about building out the business and ensuring that we build it with a really strong foundation and a really strong team on the ground alex kramm ubs analyst excellent super helpful color thank you and then secondly maybe also coming back to a prior question but if you think about the issuance forecast i know it s another team that does it but if i think about last few quarters i think that it was revised lower every quarter and obviously they re difficult to forecast but if you think about it from a bigger picture perspective what are the big puts and takes that you re thinking about as you look at that forecast and where things could do a lot better or do worse and a couple of things to maybe highlight is like you said the loans businesses has been an area of strength but i think people are getting increasingly more worried about what s going on in that market and then we re hearing increasingly cfos talking about the leverage de leveraging the balance sheet so what are the kind of puts and takes i guess you would be watching out for thank you douglas l peterson president and chief executive officer yeah so let me give you a few of the thoughts on that and let me start with a leverage market and it s as you have seen in the numbers we presented the leverage market has the component of the financial the corporation s a good leverage market can go either to the bond market or the loan market they have increasingly been going to the loan market for various reasons based on the kinds of borrowers the kinds of lenders and investors that have gone in the market the attraction of a floating rate versus fixed rate the attraction of the kinds of covenants and other aspects of the loan market that they could get we saw a correction in that market in december and there s a lot of people including myself that think that some of the aspects of that were probably healthy leverage had gotten quite high you saw leverage in some deals going over 6 times 7 times sometimes even 8 times and so since the market has opened up even though there s a lot of investors going back to the market there s been some correction in terms of leverage not so much in covenants so far but much more in total leverage amount so we see that as one of the factors which will be driving our forecasts going forward a little bit more specifically on the forecast and you mentioned that since our october outlook or december outlook and our january outlook we ve seen actually a moderation of that when we first did our 2019 forecast in october we expected that it was going to be up about 0 6 december about the same up 0 6 and now we see it going down 0 6 so just to give you some of the sentiment in some of the areas that we see those changes we did drop a little bit on the corporates we dropped it by about another 1 down from the prior forecast just based on the pipelines that we ve seen from the market participants but financial services is the one that we saw the largest shift between the end of the year and now the beginning of the year and that is originally been expected to go up 5 and now we re expected to only go up about 1 3 and the main difference there is based on what we expect financial institutions are going to be issuing related to reserve requirements and some of them by speaking with them a lot of them are not going to be growing their balance sheets as much as we had originally expected so this goes back to policies capital policies at the fed as well as capital policies of the banks themselves and that s probably the largest difference overall that drove that so a little bit in the corporates a lot more from financial institutions and then our outlook for the leverage market is come back not necessarily with the same level of leverage that we saw in the middle of the year last year but it actually has come back pretty healthy the last couple weeks of january the markets were back they were open again after 45 days of being closed alex kramm ubs analyst excellent thanks again douglas l peterson president and chief executive officer thank you ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks alex operator thank you this question comes from tim mchugh from william blair and company you may ask your question tim mchugh william blair and company analyst thanks i just want to ask about how you would characterize you talked about the incremental 100 million of investments i guess you re always investing somewhat in the business so is this a stepped up level of investment that s different than other years are you just trying to highlight to us i guess what you what the focus is for the year just trying to understand the context of what you re saying with that ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning tim yes we are just trying to highlight and to make this transparent to you and also show you the specific areas where we are investing to give you a little bit broader perspective we re of course always investing in our businesses and business as usual to keep our benchmarks relevant in systems in processes in new designs of the organization so there is always a lot of level of business as usual investments what we are trying to highlight here is investments specifically in new initiatives new products and new markets as we showed you in 2018 those investments were at the level of 60 million and that will go up by approximately 40 million to 50 million to that new number for 2019 in those areas like china and i think everyone would agree with me that the chinese ratings opportunity for the company is very large and it makes a lot of sense to make this investment and the company will see hopefully a lot of benefit out of that in the mid and long term so obviously we are self funding those initiatives you see that we have productivity programs going on where we have savings on one hand and capturing the operating leverage and then reinvesting it and also you see the margin still going up for the company so another indication that we are self funding those initiatives so we hope it s overall helpful that we give this clarity and you have a feel of where the company is making the large investments in new initiatives going forward to expect huge revenue growth for the company on top of our current business activities tim mchugh william blair and company analyst okay that s helpful and then just want to follow up i think it was when you re talking about the cash flow there was quick comment you made about longer renewal cycles for some of the enterprise deals in market intelligence i guess can you elaborate on what that was and i guess just you said i think you thought it was a timing issue so why do you think that necessarily ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer sure tim what is happening is as you know we are going through the process to move all market intelligence customers to enterprisewide contracts so this is purely an administrative process where we are changing the contracts you have discussions about the new language of the new contracts those contracts then need to be signed new invoices needs to be issued and then there needs to be a cash collection on those new invoices so going through this process right now the change in time lines have shifted from about 10 days to 52 days in terms of cash collection so this is purely a delay in the process we expect a catch up of that during 2019 so therefore you see a free cash flow number guidance for 2019 which is up 10 to 15 over the free cash flow we generated in 2018 tim mchugh william blair and company analyst okay so the comment about the delay is more about the collection process and not necessarily the sale or negotiation of the agreement ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer it s just going through the whole process of new contract legal documentation signing processing invoicing and so on it s purely the administrative renewal process itself tim mchugh william blair and company analyst okay thank you operator thank you this question comes from jeff silber from bmo capital markets you may ask your question jeff silber bmo capital markets analyst thank you so much i know it s late obviously i ll ask a couple of quick ones you mentioned when talking about the outlook for the ratings segment the price increases you instituted at the beginning of the year can you give us some order of framework roughly what that was and how that compared to prior years ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer the list price that has been issued is 6 95 you see it was up from approximately 6 75 so about 3 increase year over year that is just the headline list price of course there s a lot of differentiation by type of customer type of arrangements and so on but that would be the headline number jeff silber bmo capital markets analyst and what was the headline increase in 2018 ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer more or less the same so that is the usual increase that we see over the past few years jeff silber bmo capital markets analyst okay great and again i know you don t give quarterly guidance but beside potentially ratings being more back end loaded is there anything you want to point out for the quarters for 2019 ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer no there s nothing else that we can point out at this time jeff silber bmo capital markets analyst great thank you so much ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks operator thank you this question comes from craig huber from huber research partners you may ask your question craig huber huber research partners analyst thank you doug i just want to get back to china for a second here you mentioned about 31 analysts in that market you ve hired or switched over there i guess roughly 2 of analysts on a global basis how quickly do you think this market to be in perspective from a ratings revenue standpoint can pick up here in the coming years inaudible maybe we ll see it in the numbers i mean it s a long term play obviously but do you expect any material positive impact on revenues and profits in the first two years say is there any big pent up demand we get a big bump upfront in your revenue boost with the ratings being in that market or just you take a real long time to play out douglas l peterson president and chief executive officer my expectation is that this will take a little bit to play out what i d like to do is give you numbers as we start looking at this over quarter by quarter we ll figure it how often and how much we re going to we will give you about our progress but just a couple of more couple more statistics about the market overall in china the total lending market including everything is about 20 6 trillion of that about 13 trillion is corporate so it s little bit more than half of the market is corporate loans and of that about 2 trillion more or less are bonds of which 1 trillion are bonds outstanding of corporates so think about it s a 1 trillion corporate bond market about 4 000 issuers we think that we ve got 400 where you have relationships that we can tap as the first companies that we go to we also as you know the panda bond markets where foreign issuers going to the chinese market is one that it s very small right now but we think that s another area that will bring specific expertise as well as interest from foreign issuers to go into the chinese market using s p as the company that can do the rating so i don t want to give you any projections or numbers on the revenues over time as i ve said we see this is a market which is going to transform to more of a global capital market much more connected as i mentioned earlier it s only 2 of the bonds in china are held by foreign investors so you see that growing and so let us come back to you to give you updates on our progress so we can really understand how fast this is going to move once we re starting to see volume coming through the door craig huber huber research partners analyst and then on second doug you mentioned i guess in a global basis expecting debt issuance down zero to 1 call it if you could just segment for just us part of that i d be curious for your thoughts how you think that might play out the debt issuance for investment grade and high yield and then also maybe with how you maybe see bank loan issuance for this year playing out those three segments within this country douglas l peterson president and chief executive officer well the two pieces which are the most significant that i mentioned a couple of minutes ago the corporates which are down 4 8 more or less what we re projecting that s mostly the us and that s mostly the us and it s partially because of tax reform and what our projections are as to what will be the issuance level for the companies that have very cash rich balance sheet so then the other which is probably the most significant as i said financial services that s also us and that s the us financial institutions that are ones that are projecting to have smaller balance sheets or less growth on their balance sheets than we had expected three and four months ago so that s the color that i can give you based on the analysis that our team has done thanks craig craig huber huber research partners analyst thanks thank you ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks craig operator thank you this question comes from joseph foresi from cantor fitzgerald you may ask your question joseph foresi cantor fitzgerald analyst hi my first question is just on china can you give us a little bit of a better understanding or maybe what the risks are of having ratings in that region is there sufficient accounting standards there do you feel like you re more exposed i m just trying to get a sense of how the market works from risk perspective douglas l peterson president and chief executive officer well thanks joseph for the question as we ve gone into the chinese market as i ve mentioned earlier this is something that we ve been looking at for years this isn t just something that cropped up in the last quarter and we ve also already had a business on the ground for over 10 years with ratings analysts on the ground in china who have been rating chinese corporations on offshore issuance or dim sum bonds that are issued offshore and as i mentioned we have 400 of those that we ve already rated so we know that there s at least 400 companies that already audited by global auditing firms they have transparency in their financials they ve been going offshore to raise funds so there s already a core group of corporations and financial institutions in china that are rated and are already issuing bonds at global standards but clearly you re raising what for us are very important points and how do we roll out a ratings business in the market which is developing we re using our knowledge and experience of how we ve gone into other markets like india through crisil or mexico which we did an acquisition many years ago to go into that market both india and mexico are markets where we issue with local rating scales where we do not have rating scales that are linked to the global scales they are based on local market conditions and so one of the reasons that we re rolling out our china rating agency as a local independently scaled rating agency is that we want to be able to meet and understand all the local conditions of what are the conditions of bankruptcy laws what are the conditions of workouts what are the conditions of companies that could potentially have any kind of a default or payment issue and this is why it s important for us to go in that market independently with a locally managed rating agency we ve been working closely with the regulators to ensure that they understand the rating agency model as we roll it out it s critical that they understand that we are independent and that our ratings are going to be issued with an independent opinion that we ve got the right kind of analysts that are well trained so we ve looked at what are the kind of risks do we get the right kind of disclosure from companies do you have the ability to understand if there s been a payment issue do we have the right kind of regulatory environment which we think is being developed in a way that s very professional and understanding what are the other environments around the globe for rating regimes etcetera so we ve gone with this over many many years of analysis many many years of building relationships and we think that some of those risks that you ve mentioned are things that we have good ways to mitigate or manage joseph foresi cantor fitzgerald analyst got it and then just to switch gears anyway to start to quantify the impact of the increase in your focus on data i m thinking more on the kensho side and i m just trying to get a sense of you know we re early stages sort of building the foundation but clearly it s a focus clearly it s something that i would agree is going to be an important part of the future but i m wondering how internally you re starting to think about quantifying that and any anecdotes you could provide thanks ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah let me give you a couple of thoughts on that first we are looking at more and more data sets ideally proprietary data sets that are unique and only can be found on our platform but there could also be other data sets that we license and therefore incorporate as we mentioned during the prepared remarks with data sets it s very important that those data sets are linked to our existing master database so that is an automatic link between entities between individuals between a lot of different other data sets because data is only valuable if it is put in perspective of all the other data rich data that we have already today on our platform therefore it s so important that we are working on that new search engine the omnisearch with kensho because the more data we put on our platform the more important it will be for our customers to find the right data and use that data in the future hence the investments we are doing with kensho on the omnisearch moreover we are having a lot of data intake elements within the organization and we re thinking now about a design of the overall data factory to make data more a commodity within the firm based on the same definitions the same data architecture have an efficient data intake which is based on a lot of technology tools and to take the benefit of the enterprise as a whole so data is core to our strategy core to our business growth core to the commercial propositions that are being developed by our businesses and we make a lot of investments in this area but ultimately this will be the main driver of revenue growth for the company in the future joseph foresi cantor fitzgerald analyst thank you operator thank you this question comes from the dan dolev from nomura securities you may ask your question dan dolev nomura securities analyst hi thank you for taking my question just from a housekeeping item is the kensho 20 million to 25 million expense embedded in the guidance for retention is that the main difference between the 18 unallocated expense and what you re guiding for 19 ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer no if you look at the unallocated what we are doing is moving the kensho revenue to the market intelligence revenue and the reason why we are doing that is more and more the kensho contracts with kensho customers are being forward into overall market intelligence relationships with the same customers and therefore it s more difficult to separately identify kensho revenue in the future so that s why it s being integrated with revenue of market intelligence so if you look purely at unallocated expenses unallocated expenses were 171 million for 2018 which is then excluding the 15 million kensho revenue that included 20 million of funding for the foundation that happened last year and kensho expenses but kensho expenses you have to realize those were kensho expenses over a nine month period so now we are of course are having kensho expenses for the full year 2019 so if you look at those to all those elements we will continue to see a nice reduction in unallocated expenses to that range of 155 million to 165 million in 2019 which is ultimately done based on the productivity programs we are introducing within the company dan dolev nomura securities analyst yeah that s helpful so the kensho retention plans i believe they were excluded from the adjusted number right the 34 million in 18 they were not in the non gaap number ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer if you look at kensho expenses we have kensho expenses that are being included from a performance basis and then we have excess kensho expenses that are based on the rollover equity as part of the consideration for the acquisitions so what we have done is we looked at what is market compensation for employees of kensho everything that is market level is being included on the non gaap basis and everything s that s over and above what would be normalized market levels which is based on that rollover equity that is being stripped out as the kensho retention related expenses that number you should see coming down over time and the reason is just purely the accounting it s an accelerated accounting method so every year you see that number coming down very quickly the excess expenses for kensho that are being pulled out on a non gaap basis dan dolev nomura securities analyst got it thank you and then just my follow up is on the overall headcount i see some nice growth in the headcount in the year over year if you have to sort of think about the different segment it looks like the corporate headcount increased dramatically yet same ratings headcount declined if you had to sort of normalize that in terms of the centers of excellence like how would that roughly look like would you be expecting ratings headcount to grow up as well if you didn t allocate it into corporate that s sort of the question ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah that s really a great question so there s always going to be some movements in headcount so when we do acquisitions of course headcount will go up so for example in corporate headcount went up for example based on the kensho acquisition but also headcount in market intelligence is up and that s based on the acquisitions of panjiva ratewatch but also new content sets that mi is introducing so we will have a reductions of headcount based on productivity on existing data sets in market intelligence and then headcount additions for the new data sets that are being introduced corporate headcounts might go up a bit over time because when we are centralizing certain activities in centers of excellence it might mean a shift from headcount in the divisions to corporate so that could be another shift also when we are insourcing certain activities for example the it and engineering activities in ratings will ultimately be an increase headcount for ratings but that is an offset on external services that will be eliminated going forward so that s a shift in headcount numbers but not so much a shift in expenses or actually that is a decline in expenses that we will realize as a company douglas l peterson president and chief executive officer and just to add one thing one of the things that john s trying to do in ratings is he aspires to try to be able to handle more and more and more credit each year with the same number of analysts so we re not really looking to reduce they were looking to try to make the more and more efficient with all the technology that we re trying to deploy dan dolev nomura securities analyst makes sense thank you so much ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks dan operator thank you this question comes from george tong from goldman sachs you may ask your question george tong goldman sachs analyst hi thanks good morning your non transaction revenues took a step back in the ratings business in part because of tougher comps were there specific items that weighed on non transaction revenues this quarter and how do you see non transaction revenues performing next year ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer hi george good morning fx had a negative impact on non transaction revenue if you strip that element out it was more or less flat the other element that impacted non transaction revenue was rating evaluation services we ve always called out that that could go up or down by quarter that s very much driven by the m a environment so we ll have quarters where the rest of revenues will be a little higher or a little lower but overall we look at non transaction revenue as a very stable source of revenues and we expect that to continue to be a very steady source for the ratings business in the future george tong goldman sachs analyst got it that s helpful you ve achieved 60 million in cost savings through year end 2018 out of your 100 million of cost reductions planned in your analyst day over the intermediate term can you talk about the pacing of when you expect to achieve the remainder of your cost savings and what the principal drivers of savings will be going forward ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah we are very encouraged by progress we have made during the first year 60 million in run rate and 40 million of that in our annual results for 2018 we will continue on the same pace what you have seen toward our targets and the main areas where we find those opportunities are in our functions so we are trying to create new operating models for our functions across the enterprise both in the businesses as well as in the corporate center we are looking at opportunities in our digital infrastructure area for example consolidation of some of our data centers moving to the cloud other outsourcing arrangements etcetera and we are taking care of real estate costs we are reducing excess real estate we have in the company and are significantly driving down real estate expenses and we will continue with all of those levers over the next few years of course we will let you know once we have achieved these targets and at that point announce you a new target but at this moment we are very encouraged by the progress we re making with all of those programs george tong goldman sachs analyst very helpful thank you operator we will now take our final question from bill warmington from wells fargo you may ask your question bill warmington wells fargo analyst good morning everyone the final question here it is actually two right so first on kensho you mentioned the entity linking work you re doing with kensho crunchbase the private company databases in china and the uk can you frame that opportunity for us that s commercial credit information space is typically in the area we associated with dnb and bbd and it sounds like you re moving increasingly into that space ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer this is an area where we are very pleased with some of the first results of the kensho collaboration we have talked to you about crunchbase but in the meantime we have done the same with the algorithms that have been developed on other private company data sets and the benefit of entity linking is the following it s not only a expense reduction opportunity of course in the past we could do the same entity linking but by asking a lot of teams and a lot of employees to work on that and that will take a lot of time to achieve data linking with the right quality of data is it the same entity the name is spelled at a slightly different way slightly different abbreviation is it a subholding is it in another jurisdiction so a lot of work has to be done to make sure that entity linking is correct and accurate so by doing this now based on algorithms of course we find efficiency opportunities but the larger benefit is in fact in the revenue opportunity why because of speed to market we can significantly increase speed to market of new data sets the quality of the products we bring out because in the end with the algorithms we can achieve a higher quality and less errors going forward and we can think about new products that we could never bring to the market in the past certain data sets are so large that this is almost impossible to achieve any ingestion of that by humans but we can do that now in a fraction of the time by our algorithms and therefore we can now introduce products we could never think of in the past so in the end we always look at this as a larger revenue opportunity than an efficiency opportunity and again we are very pleased with the results so far we have been able to achieve bill warmington wells fargo analyst and then for the second and final question the 8 95 to 9 15 eps guidance for 2019 just wanted to ask about the level of share repurchases built into that number i know you announced the 500 million asr today i would assume that was built into that guidance but then if you assume about 550 million in dividends that would leave about 600 million in excess cash you re going to return is that 600 million built in as well as the 500 million asr ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah obviously we cannot give you a very precise answer on that question but let me give you some of the components we have provided guidance with respect to free cash flow generation for this year you know that we are committed to return at least 75 of that number you are aware of the dividend payout level we will do this year so it s not too difficult to assume what is the remainder in share repurchases that will be achieved if we are going to exceed that number or not is to be seen that depends very much on opportunities we will have this year we always look first in investments in organic opportunities because we think those are the most valuable as long as those make sense strategically and we can achieve the right returns inorganic opportunities if those are not available then we can always return more it than the 75 commitment that we have to the market so those are the components and i think that probably helps you bill with what you were looking for in terms of the question bill warmington wells fargo analyst all right thank you very much chip merritt senior vice president investor relations bill you asked a great final question but the operator saying we do have one more in the queue multiple speakers almost though out there peter analyst did it wrap or am i on douglas l peterson president and chief executive officer you re on peter peter analyst okay so much for bill warmington doug i was just interested in a quick thoughts you have on market share trends in the ratings business your revenue in the first part of year lagged a little bit about some of your competitors we don t know the second half numbers obviously relatively but wondering if that s a red flag at all for you maybe does it suggest that some of that cost cutting initiatives perhaps are hurting you a little bit from a share perspective just your thoughts on that thanks douglas l peterson president and chief executive officer yeah well first of all thank you peter that you ve been able to get on the call and when it comes to the ratings business when we look at the market share globally we continue to have a very strong market share there s a couple of areas where we see weaknesses one of them is in clos as you know there is a couple of other businesses like covered bonds that we are not really active in it all so if there s any place where we have seen areas that we will put some additional concentration on looking at our penetration it s all in the structured finance area peter analyst okay great thanks so much douglas l peterson president and chief executive officer you have a second question peter analyst i do actually on market intelligence the migration douglas l peterson president and chief executive officer inaudible bill s question peter analyst okay probably not as good as bill s he is way more intellectual than i in market intelligence the migration to enterprise contracts how far along are we in that has that had measurable implications in terms of profitability for the segment ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer peter the progress we have made over the last quarter is moving from 76 to 81 of cap iq customers moving to enterprisewide agreements so a nice 5 step up what we re seeing now is what we call the long tail we are now making those changes for a large group of smaller customers we re not planning to really call out those numbers anymore in the future will continue over the next period to drive this to 100 level over the next year or so but we will continue to make progress to ultimately have 100 of our customers on enterprisewide agreements so good progress and i think basically for us the last final number of customers we ll deal with over the remainder of this year peter analyst thank you douglas l peterson president and chief executive officer great well thanks everyone for joining the call this morning i m sure you can hear how enthusiastic we are about the company about our prospects for the future as you can see we have a lot of initiatives to look at our topline growth and our productivity we re committed to continue to manage to of course productivity but also very importantly to growth and you heard about some of our plans for our data operations for technology in particular around artificial intelligence and machine learning and the kind of impact that can have on us and also i want to thank all of you for the questions about china and our international operations we re very enthusiastic about the opportunity we have going forward in china and we ll keep bringing you updates on that as we go forward and on top of that i want to thank our great board of directors our management team our global workforce the commitment they have as well to power the markets in the future and the framework that we ll continue to show you new going forward as to how we re allocating capital where we re growing and again i want to thank all of you and we look forward to even more success in 2019

i m going to put you at the steering wheel of the u s economy you will have opportunity to fix the financial mess the u s economy is in imagine for a moment you are the us secretary of the treasury or some all powerful overseer of us federal government taxation and spending which problem should you fix first a national debt b unemployment c taxation d expansion of government benefits to equalize income e provide equal access to medical care for everybody for reference you have 3 2 trillion in collected taxes to play with and you must make a 523 billion interest payment on 16 trillion in loans the u s has made the national debt and also by law cut 1 trillion of checks for social security and another 1 trillion for medicare medicaid and then come up with 673 billion for the military leaving you just 4 billion to fund all the other branches of government plus provide food stamps for 37 million people the ethics of money pr ju00f6rg guido hu00fcl best price 13 59 buy new 19 99 as of 07 45 utc details the u s budget is 4 193 trillion and the federal government says it borrows 864 billion to come up with the difference between what it collects in taxes 3 2 trillion and its budgetary spending list 4 193 trillion but the u s actually spends 6 048 trillion annually see bottom left corner of the u s debt clock presented below and actually just prints another 2 trillion of electronic money into existence to make up the difference and support the lifestyle americans have grown accustomed to today the public hears various calls for medicare for all or guaranteed income or tax the rich can a modern society just create endless money into existence in essence to give itself a pay increase the answer is yes but not without adverse financial consequences more worrisome is that public opinion polls show a majority of americans want these reforms one pundit cites the fact the u s had a 91 92 tax rate on the richest americans from 1951 to 1963 and the country didn t go to hell however the baby boomers were only beginning to graduate from high school then medicare was enacted in 1965 and covered 19 million retired citizens versus 59 million today and another 75 million covered by medicaid retirees received social security checks amounting to 14 2 billion 1963 compared to 1 trillion covering 43 million americans in 2018 forward projections estimate social security will have to cut checks for 79 million americans by the year 2035 in the early years of social security there were surpluses that should have been invested to yield a return when baby boomers retired but those surplus funds were loaned to the federal government to finance increased deficit spending then there is the reality that in the midst of a financial mess created by loose lending practices that the federal reserve bank literally gave free money to lenders in the 2008 banking crisis increasing the money supply by 4 trillion and essentially redistributed wealth in society to the financial classes we might call it welfare for bankers so the government does hand out endless free money just to a limited group in society the people at the top and bottom income levels are being propped and a group of 122 million tax payers bear the burden for the remaining 206 million citizens that are stuck in the middle denationalisation of m friedrich a hayek best price 12 01 buy new 1 99 as of 06 55 utc details i m going to use the u s debt clock for evaluation purposes as it presents many different economic factors on a single printed page or screen view you should study the u s debt clock and become familiar with it for example the u s debt clock notes america lost 5 million manufacturing jobs in the period 2000 2008 and notes the number of unemployed is more like 12 million rather than the official 6 million i ve consulted with the good offices of economist john williams of shadowstats com to guide me through the morass of federal government data some which is misleading or even fake examples target rate of inflation published by the federal reserve bank is 2 but actual rate is 6 higher the official unemployment rate is 4 is actually above 20 if you can t produce a large enough image of the u s debt clock re creation on your computer monitor then simply go to usdebtclock org to view real time data about the u s economy click to enlarge my notes to the side of the us debt clock may help you understand the bigger picture of the economy similar to the same broad view the u s treasury secretary sees i point to three trigger points that could cause the u s economy to crash loss of confidence in the us dollar not by american citizens but by foreign bankers some say the day when consumers lose faith in the u s dollar is the day the economy will fail but in september 15 of 2008 when lehmann brothers investment bank fell the public had faith in the banking system this means events that precipitated the collapse were being withheld from public view an investment bank didn t create a run on the banks because it was for investors not public depositors the public is not likely to be aware of the dire financial condition of the federal government otherwise bank runs might be common it is more likely that foreign bankers would lose faith in the u s dollar and could trigger a collapse of the u s economy when the u s needs more money to fund government programs it often borrows that money from foreign countries this is how the u s funds various provisions that exceed what is collected in taxes it is possible that foreign countries that buy up our debt in exchange for a low rate of interest may not respond to auctions to buy these debt instruments ious the u s debt clock says the u s needed to borrow 864 billion in 2018 see the upper left quadrant of the u s debt clock money and freedom hans f sennholz best price 4 99 buy new 29 99 as of 06 55 utc details last november 2018 foreign investors began taking a pass on unprecedented debt securities the u s keeps issuing china is not buying lending this debt because of its ongoing trade currency war with the u s japan is selling u s ious because of the strong u s dollar only in a relative sense the euro and chinese yuan are crashing then the u s has to start searching for u s buyers rather than foreign buyers of debt the interest offered on these u s treasury notes may need to rise to attract buyers record amounts of debt projected to exceed 1 trillion are being sold at these debt auctions now the number of bids received to buy up u s bonds are at an all time low selling off of u s treasury notes ious at a discount looking at the us debt clock you will see 6 trillion the us owes to foreign countries lower left quadrant if those countries feel they will never be paid back they may elect to sell off their debt notes at a loss let s say 30 discount that would render the u s dollar less valuable in international trade the cost of imported goods would rise commensurately that type of event would severely affect the u s economy you don t think this will never happen china recently threatened to sell off its u s debt notes at a loss in its trade war with the u s interest on national debt exceeds that of social security medicare etc another trigger point is the interest the u s pays on its national debt upper left quadrant of u s debt clock to be accurate the accumulated debt burden of the u s is published at 21 trillion upper left quadrant u s debt clock economist john williams points us to a more accurate figure directly from the u s treasury dept see below more accurately the u s national debt less what it owes to itself is 16 trillion the u s debt clock states 347 billion is paid annually in interest on this debt but the u s treasury dept provides more accurate figures i ve jotted down outside the left border of the debt clock interest on the national debt exceeds 523 billion and is headed to 915 billion by the year 2028 as interest on the national debt rises there is less money to pay for other pressing and legally required line items like medicare and social security that are partially paid for out of the general fund these days outside of the fica payroll deductions that fill the social security and medicare trust funds every two weeks there is nothing but ious u s treasury bills backed by nothing more than the full faith and credit of the united states so now you understand how precarious the u s economy is it is already overspending and burdened with so much debt that campaigns for a minimum income or medicare for all seem to be totally out of touch with reality the relief valve stop borrowing and paying interest but there is a relief valve as economist martin armstrong hints armstrong has consulted with various sovereign nations so he is no small fry economist armstrong writes from armstrong economics blog economics posted jan 30 2019 by martin armstrong question it seems the left wing progressives in the us house opponents of pelosi have adopted the money market theory of prof stephanie kelton of u of mo kansas city to justify unlimited deficit spending of the us govt ok as the govt can finance its deficits by unlimited currency printing would you please comment mp answer actually there would be no issue if the government simply created money to fund its normal expenditure historically that will produce very modest inflation the crisis is when you borrow to fund that deficit spending in 2019 interest expenditures may now exceed the cost of defense it is far cheaper to create the money needed than borrow and keep rolling the deficits forever then the cumulative interest keeps rising and crowds out all other expenditures this is what is happening the process underway creates deflation not inflation because the governments keep raising taxes to fund the deficits and that reduces the disposable income this is why we see riots in france yes people earn more but they are being left with an eroding disposable income base governments need to fund themselves so they raise taxes but the interest expenditures keep rising and consume all other areas of spending it becomes a self defeating process that leads to the crash and burn the problem is politicians choose to cut bankers into loans to burden the u s with unbearable interest payments rather than just printing money directly from the u s treasury department to meet its obligations essentially the federal government private labels paper money being issued as a federal reserve note when it is actually printed by the us treasury department the federal reserve buys its paper money for the cost of printing 5 5 cents for a 1 bill 14 2 cents for a 100 bill and then lends it out to commercial banks interest in the 2008 banking lending crisis the federal reserve added 4 trillion to the u s money supply by electronically crediting its member banks by that much equivalent to printing 40 billion 100 bills that push button money cost the fed nothing to create end the fed ron paul best price 2 18 buy new 5 68 as of 09 55 utc details inconceivably the federal reserve now pays banks reverse interest to keep money they were given freely to rebalance their accounting books from being lent out which would increase the money supply with a resultant increase in inflation banks were given free money interest to boot the problem was solved but only briefly implemented americans are never taught where money comes from the u s has a debt based monetary system here is how it works the u s buys cars from japan japan then holds u s dollars the u s needs that money back in order to continue to buy cars from japan so japan sends the money back in exchange for an iou interest u s treasury note so when you look at a u s ten dollar bill in essence it is a promise to pay japan 10 interest a ten dollar bill should have a minus sign in front of it it is debt based money critics say fiat currency isn t worth the paper it is printed on it is worse than that it is a debt in the amount printed on the note u s citizens are buying stuff with ious not real money this is what president john f kennedy said in 1963 if the u s keeps dispensing money through a distributor the federal reserve banks it would drive the country into insolvency so kennedy signed executive order 11110 to strip the federal reserve of its power to loan

canonsburg pa feb 7 2019 prnewswire today consol energy inc nyse ceix reported financial and operating results for the period ended december 31 2018 fourth quarter 2018 highlights highlights of the ceix fourth quarter 20181 results include net income and cash provided by operating activities of 46 0 million and 83 3 million respectively total dilutive earnings per share of 1 41 adjusted ebitda 2 of 115 2 million organic free cash flow net to ceix shareholders 2 of 28 9 million repurchased approximately 1 5 of average outstanding ceix shares expect to make a required pre payment of approximately 110 million towards term loan b in february 2019 total net leverage ratio 2 reduced to 1 7x at december 31 2018 compared to 2 4x at the end of 2017 annual production and sales volume records at the pennsylvania mining complex pamc annual revenue record at the consol marine terminal management comments i am extremely proud to announce our results for the fourth quarter of 2018 as it was another strong quarter and capped off a year of many achievements said jimmy brock chief executive officer of consol energy inc the quarter marked a milestone for ceix as we completed our first calendar year as an independent publicly traded coal company in 2018 we also produced and sold more coal than in any other year throughout the pamc s 35 year history i am also pleased to announce that we have made significant improvement during 2018 on the safety front as well our total recordable incident rate at the pamc for full year 2018 has improved by 13 5 and our total number of exceptions improved by 12 1 compared to the same period last year we continue to remain laser focused on having zero life altering injuries at the time of becoming an independent publicly traded company in november 2017 we targeted some very specific near term goals and priorities we set out to de lever our balance sheet improve liquidity and initiate returns to our shareholders while safely and compliantly delivering earnings growth i am pleased to announce that we delivered on all those goals during 2018 operationally we have set new annual production and sales records at the pamc marking three consecutive years of production growth financially we have reduced the leverage on our balance sheet by 0 7x since year end 2017 and opportunistically returned 28 9 million of capital to our shareholders through ceix share repurchases and investment in ccr units we also retired approximately 56 0 million of our term loans and second lien notes for 2019 we expect to continue to focus on further de levering our balance sheet and increasing shareholder returns we are also now turning our focus towards strategically growing our business which will diversify our revenue streams and increase our value per share pennsylvania mining complex pamc review and outlook pamc sales and marketing our marketing team sold 7 0 million tons of coal during the fourth quarter of 2018 at an average revenue per ton of 49 81 compared to 6 2 million tons at an average revenue per ton of 46 36 in the year ago period this brings our full year fy 2018 pamc sales volume to 27 7 million tons which exceeds the high end of our guidance range it also represents a record sales volume year for the pamc and its third consecutive year of sales volume growth this growth was achieved due to improved demand for our products as well as our ability to ramp up production and capture that demand improvement the average revenue per ton for the fourth quarter benefited from stronger pricing on our export sales and domestic netback contracts compared to the year ago period during the quarter our domestic customers demonstrated a strong demand for coal driven by higher natural gas prices and depleted coal inventories following stronger than forecasted burn throughout the year according to the u s energy information administration eia total coal inventories at domestic power plants stood at approximately 104 million tons at the end of november 2018 down by approximately 27 from the same period a year ago and the lowest end of november total inventory tonnage level since 1997 furthermore we believe that inventories at several of our key customers northern appalachian rail served power plants are below normal and absent any meaningful weather related demand decline we expect to ship all we can produce during 2019 as our customers will continue to seek additional coal to replenish their depleted stockpiles taking advantage of this sustained demand we have contracted greater than 95 in 2019 53 in 2020 and 28 in 2021 assuming a base annual production rate of 27 million tons this contracted position includes a mix of sales to our top domestic customers and to the export thermal and export metallurgical markets maintaining our diversified market exposure with our solid 2019 contracted position our primary focus is now on maximizing margins for any remaining 2019 sales and continuing to build on our contract portfolio internationally coal price volatility increased significantly during the quarter with api 2 prompt month prices fluctuating between 86 per ton and 102 per ton overall api 2 prompt month prices declined by approximately 13 during the fourth quarter of 2018 driven by rising global trade tensions and a general decline in energy related commodities however we have not seen and do not expect to see any slowdown in near term export demand for our product furthermore we are currently shipping our coal under a previously disclosed and priced contract which insulates us from the ongoing volatility in export pricing as well there continues to be a significant arbitrage opportunity between coal natural gas and oil prices on a delivered mmbtu basis in many key global markets we believe that with limited coal supply growth throughout the world we will continue to have an increasing role in the coal export markets operations summary on the operations front the pamc achieved record production of 27 6 million tons in 2018 eclipsing the previous record of 26 1 million tons set in 2017 and marking the third consecutive year of production growth during 2018 the complex ran at approximately 97 capacity utilization highlighting the desirability of our product additionally our bailey and harvey mines each set individual production records during the year bailey s 12 7 million tons surpasses its previous record set in 2014 while harvey s 5 0 million tons exceeds its previous record set in 2017 pamc production for the full year benefited from strong demand for our products in the domestic and export markets improving productivity initial benefits from automation projects and improving geological conditions at enlow fork mine the pamc shipped 7 0 million tons of coal during the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 6 2 million tons in the year ago quarter the improvement in coal sales volume was driven by strong production and continued robust demand from our customers total coal revenue for the fourth quarter was 347 8 million which was improved from 288 3 million in the year ago quarter primarily driven by a 3 45 higher average sales price per ton sold our average revenue per ton increased to 49 81 from 46 36 in the year ago quarter due to stronger pricing on our export sales and domestic netback contracts ceix s total costs during the fourth quarter were 335 9 million compared to 312 5 million in the year ago quarter average cash cost of coal sold per ton2 for the fourth quarter was 30 54 compared to 27 30 in the year ago quarter the increase was due to reduced subsidence expense and lower mine maintenance spending in the prior period for fy 2018 ceix s total costs were 1 344 4 million compared to 1 242 1 million in the prior year our fy 2018 average cash cost of coal sold per ton2 was 29 29 compared to 29 02 for fy 2017 an increase of less than 1 average cash margin per ton sold2 for the fourth quarter of 2018 expanded by 0 21 to 19 27 per ton compared to the year ago period driven by higher average revenue per ton offset by higher average cash cost of coal sold per ton three

30 54 27 30 average cash margin per ton sold per ton 19 27 19 06 consol marine terminal review for the fourth quarter of 2018 terminal revenues and operating cash costs were 16 9 million and 5 2 million respectively compared to 17 3 million and 5 5 million respectively during the year ago period given the effect on terminal revenues of the take or pay contract that has been in place at our terminal since mid 2018 we are changing our guidance methodology for consol marine terminal to be based on ebitda instead of throughput volume for the 2019 period equity and debt repurchase update during the fourth quarter we accelerated our rate of repurchasing ceix shares as the declines in our share price and in the broader equity markets created opportunities for us while continuing to remain disciplined in our capital allocation process during the quarter we repurchased approximately 16 1 million of ceix common shares 5 2 million of second lien notes and 1 9 million of ccr common units for the year ended december 31 2018 we have now repurchased approximately 25 8 million of ceix common shares 25 7 million of second lien notes and 3 1 million of ccr common units we have also repaid 26 3 million and 4 0 million of principal with respect to term loan a and term loan b respectively 2019 liability management during the first quarter of 2019 we are required to reduce our outstanding term loan b principal by approximately 110 million based on the 2018 excess free cash flow sweep calculated in accordance with our credit agreement we are also continuing to opportunistically take advantage of market volatility to repurchase our second lien notes in 2019 we repurchased 7 million of our second lien notes we expect to remain active on our liability management program in 2019 to reduce our overall cost of indebtedness 2019 guidance and outlook based on our current contracted position estimated prices and production plans we are providing the

canonsburg pa feb 7 2019 prnewswire today consol energy inc nyse ceix reported financial and operating results for the period ended december 31 2018 fourth quarter 2018 highlights highlights of the ceix fourth quarter 20181 results include net income and cash provided by operating activities of 46 0 million and 83 3 million respectively total dilutive earnings per share of 1 41 adjusted ebitda 2 of 115 2 million organic free cash flow net to ceix shareholders 2 of 28 9 million repurchased approximately 1 5 of average outstanding ceix shares expect to make a required pre payment of approximately 110 million towards term loan b in february 2019 total net leverage ratio 2 reduced to 1 7x at december 31 2018 compared to 2 4x at the end of 2017 annual production and sales volume records at the pennsylvania mining complex pamc annual revenue record at the consol marine terminal management comments i am extremely proud to announce our results for the fourth quarter of 2018 as it was another strong quarter and capped off a year of many achievements said jimmy brock chief executive officer of consol energy inc the quarter marked a milestone for ceix as we completed our first calendar year as an independent publicly traded coal company in 2018 we also produced and sold more coal than in any other year throughout the pamc s 35 year history i am also pleased to announce that we have made significant improvement during 2018 on the safety front as well our total recordable incident rate at the pamc for full year 2018 has improved by 13 5 and our total number of exceptions improved by 12 1 compared to the same period last year we continue to remain laser focused on having zero life altering injuries at the time of becoming an independent publicly traded company in november 2017 we targeted some very specific near term goals and priorities we set out to de lever our balance sheet improve liquidity and initiate returns to our shareholders while safely and compliantly delivering earnings growth i am pleased to announce that we delivered on all those goals during 2018 operationally we have set new annual production and sales records at the pamc marking three consecutive years of production growth financially we have reduced the leverage on our balance sheet by 0 7x since year end 2017 and opportunistically returned 28 9 million of capital to our shareholders through ceix share repurchases and investment in ccr units we also retired approximately 56 0 million of our term loans and second lien notes for 2019 we expect to continue to focus on further de levering our balance sheet and increasing shareholder returns we are also now turning our focus towards strategically growing our business which will diversify our revenue streams and increase our value per share pennsylvania mining complex pamc review and outlook pamc sales and marketing our marketing team sold 7 0 million tons of coal during the fourth quarter of 2018 at an average revenue per ton of 49 81 compared to 6 2 million tons at an average revenue per ton of 46 36 in the year ago period this brings our full year fy 2018 pamc sales volume to 27 7 million tons which exceeds the high end of our guidance range it also represents a record sales volume year for the pamc and its third consecutive year of sales volume growth this growth was achieved due to improved demand for our products as well as our ability to ramp up production and capture that demand improvement the average revenue per ton for the fourth quarter benefited from stronger pricing on our export sales and domestic netback contracts compared to the year ago period during the quarter our domestic customers demonstrated a strong demand for coal driven by higher natural gas prices and depleted coal inventories following stronger than forecasted burn throughout the year according to the u s energy information administration eia total coal inventories at domestic power plants stood at approximately 104 million tons at the end of november 2018 down by approximately 27 from the same period a year ago and the lowest end of november total inventory tonnage level since 1997 furthermore we believe that inventories at several of our key customers northern appalachian rail served power plants are below normal and absent any meaningful weather related demand decline we expect to ship all we can produce during 2019 as our customers will continue to seek additional coal to replenish their depleted stockpiles taking advantage of this sustained demand we have contracted greater than 95 in 2019 53 in 2020 and 28 in 2021 assuming a base annual production rate of 27 million tons this contracted position includes a mix of sales to our top domestic customers and to the export thermal and export metallurgical markets maintaining our diversified market exposure with our solid 2019 contracted position our primary focus is now on maximizing margins for any remaining 2019 sales and continuing to build on our contract portfolio internationally coal price volatility increased significantly during the quarter with api 2 prompt month prices fluctuating between 86 per ton and 102 per ton overall api 2 prompt month prices declined by approximately 13 during the fourth quarter of 2018 driven by rising global trade tensions and a general decline in energy related commodities however we have not seen and do not expect to see any slowdown in near term export demand for our product furthermore we are currently shipping our coal under a previously disclosed and priced contract which insulates us from the ongoing volatility in export pricing as well there continues to be a significant arbitrage opportunity between coal natural gas and oil prices on a delivered mmbtu basis in many key global markets we believe that with limited coal supply growth throughout the world we will continue to have an increasing role in the coal export markets operations summary on the operations front the pamc achieved record production of 27 6 million tons in 2018 eclipsing the previous record of 26 1 million tons set in 2017 and marking the third consecutive year of production growth during 2018 the complex ran at approximately 97 capacity utilization highlighting the desirability of our product additionally our bailey and harvey mines each set individual production records during the year bailey s 12 7 million tons surpasses its previous record set in 2014 while harvey s 5 0 million tons exceeds its previous record set in 2017 pamc production for the full year benefited from strong demand for our products in the domestic and export markets improving productivity initial benefits from automation projects and improving geological conditions at enlow fork mine the pamc shipped 7 0 million tons of coal during the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 6 2 million tons in the year ago quarter the improvement in coal sales volume was driven by strong production and continued robust demand from our customers total coal revenue for the fourth quarter was 347 8 million which was improved from 288 3 million in the year ago quarter primarily driven by a 3 45 higher average sales price per ton sold our average revenue per ton increased to 49 81 from 46 36 in the year ago quarter due to stronger pricing on our export sales and domestic netback contracts ceix s total costs during the fourth quarter were 335 9 million compared to 312 5 million in the year ago quarter average cash cost of coal sold per ton2 for the fourth quarter was 30 54 compared to 27 30 in the year ago quarter the increase was due to reduced subsidence expense and lower mine maintenance spending in the prior period for fy 2018 ceix s total costs were 1 344 4 million compared to 1 242 1 million in the prior year our fy 2018 average cash cost of coal sold per ton2 was 29 29 compared to 29 02 for fy 2017 an increase of less than 1 average cash margin per ton sold2 for the fourth quarter of 2018 expanded by 0 21 to 19 27 per ton compared to the year ago period driven by higher average revenue per ton offset by higher average cash cost of coal sold per ton three

million respectively compared to 17 3 million and 5 5 million respectively during the year ago period given the effect on terminal revenues of the take or pay contract that has been in place at our terminal since mid 2018 we are changing our guidance methodology for consol marine terminal to be based on ebitda instead of throughput volume for the 2019 period equity and debt repurchase update during the fourth quarter we accelerated our rate of repurchasing ceix shares as the declines in our share price and in the broader equity markets created opportunities for us while continuing to remain disciplined in our capital allocation process during the quarter we repurchased approximately 16 1 million of ceix common shares 5 2 million of second lien notes and 1 9 million of ccr common units for the year ended december 31 2018 we have now repurchased approximately 25 8 million of ceix common shares 25 7 million of second lien notes and 3 1 million of ccr common units we have also repaid 26 3 million and 4 0 million of principal with respect to term loan a and term loan b respectively 2019 liability management during the first quarter of 2019 we are required to reduce our outstanding term loan b principal by approximately 110 million based on the 2018 excess free cash flow sweep calculated in accordance with our credit agreement we are also continuing to opportunistically take advantage of market volatility to repurchase our second lien notes in 2019 we repurchased 7 million of our second lien notes we expect to remain active on our liability

earnings call as s p global team focused on powering the markets of the future a volatility and uncertainty returned to the markets in 2018 the causes were numerous rising interest rates trade negotiations brexit and the unwinding of global monetary stimulus and during the fourth quarter this volatility and uncertainty impacted debt issuance and therefore our ratings business fortunately our remaining three businesses performed well and the company delivered strong financial results i m going to review our full year highlights and ewout will review the fourth quarter results in a moment in 2018 we delivered 3 revenue growth and 23 adjusted diluted eps growth we generated significant margin improvement in every business we reported 2 billion in free cash flow excluding certain items an 8 increase year over year we returned 2 2 billion through share repurchases and dividends as you know our target is return to at least 75 of free cash flow excluding certain items to shareholders but we returned more than 100 in 2018 we initiated a new we re initiating a new 500 million asr in the next few days and we made great strides toward our investor day targets but in the meantime we always need to build for the future both through organic projects and by adding new capabilities from outside the company to that end we added leading edge technology and unique data sets with the acquisitions of kensho panjiva and ratewatch revenue for 2018 increased 3 despite a 4 decline in our ratings segment our adjusted operating profit increased 8 and our adjusted operating profit margin increased 230 basis points to 48 8 this marks great progress on our investor day adjusted operating profit margin target over the next three to four years of low 50s in addition we continued to reduce our shares outstanding the 2 reduction achieved in 2018 helped us reduce shares by 10 over the past five years finally our adjusted diluted eps increased by 23 while revenue growth margin improvement and share count reduction played a role approximately one half of the increase in 2018 was the benefit us tax reform had on effective tax rate revenue growth and productivity efforts propelled the adjusted operating profit margin in 2018 revenue declined in ratings due to reduced issuance despite this decline ratings delivered greater margin improvement than any other segment i m pleased with the efforts of our employees to continue to drive revenue growth and productivity gains across s p global this performance extended our succession of solid revenue growth and adjusted operating margin growth we ve delivered a four year cagr for revenue of 6 and improved our adjusted operating profit margin by more than 1 200 basis points in the past four years the results of these collective efforts has been a 21 compounded annual growth rate of adjusted diluted eps over the past four years as we ve delivered these results we ve continued to invest for future growth and productivity in 2018 we continued to invest in technology and data we acquired world class artificial intelligence and machine learning technology with kensho unique technology and supply chain data with panjiva differentiated banking data with ratewatch and in the fourth quarter certain index intellectual property rights in addition to these acquisitions we invested in companies pioneering new technologies these included regtech solutions of fiscalnote an energy production information with xpansiv we also licensed private company data from crunchbase and through our other agreements licensed new data sets for companies in china and the uk finally we accelerated our esg investments organically and through the full acquisition of the climate data pioneer trucost this has allowed us to expand trucost s unique data across s p global and combine our data resources with our world class data operations in market intelligence in aggregate during 2018 we invested more than 800 million in acquisitions we made another 60 million in internal investments that were expensed for work associated with kensho panjiva ratewatch esg and china one of the highlights of 2019 so far has been our recent approval to enter the china domestic bond market we re honored to receive the first approval for our wholly owned subsidiary of an international cra to rate domestic chinese bonds we are now authorized to rate issuers and issuances from financial institutions corporates structured finance bonds and panda bonds or renminbi denominated bonds from foreign issuers our new entity s p ratings china ltd will be headquartered in beijing and has 36 employees 31 of which are ratings analysts we are able to assemble an exceptional team made up of our existing ratings employees as well as experts from the chinese debt capital markets and local ratings agencies it s important to understand that s p ratings china ltd and s p global ratings are two independent entities each with their own methodologies and analytical autonomy the methodologies in the new business have been developed with reference to and leveraged from s p global ratings methodologies this brings our total presence in greater china for ratings to more than 200 employees we plan to initiate coverage on the roughly 400 existing corporate clients that already issue cross border bonds today issuance spreads within china s bond markets are virtually uncorrelated with domestic rating categories we intend to offer a national scale rating for issuers in the chinese market we re well prepared and ready to issue chinese domestic ratings both our ratings business and our indices business can be impacted by short term market movements i d like to put some of these movements into perspective starting with 2018 issuance global issuance decreased 6 in the volatile market environment in particular high yield issuance declined 40 this category has a disproportionate impact on our revenues since few if any of these companies are in frequent issuer programs we often talked about the correlation between spreads and issuance this can be seen very clearly in the high yield market issuance levels have a strong negative correlation with spreads so the spreads widened in 2018 progressed especially in the fourth quarter issuance was impacted just for comparison purposes you can see that the correlation between spreads and issuance is not nearly as strong in investment grade where gdp growth business confidence and maturity pipeline are more highly correlated to issuance volumes while the impact from us tax reform has been positive for our bottom line it has as we expected been a drag and issuance in fact the 50 us companies with the largest overseas cash balances at the end of 2017 issued 170 billion of debt in 2017 and only 42 billion in 2018 this drop is responsible for a 10 decline overall in investment grade issuance in aggregate over 2018 the global cash balances of these 50 companies have declined by 91 billion or 10 while 18 of these companies have returned to the bond market we expect more will return as cash balances continue to normalize we ll continue to monitor this very closely during the fourth quarter global issuance decreased 19 as the weakness in corporate issuance exceeded strength in some pockets of the structured market in the us issuance declined 36 as investment grade decreased 34 high yield cratered 79 in fact december was the first month since lcd began tracking issuance in 2005 that there was no high yield issuance public finance decreased 44 and structured finance declined 16 with gains in rmbs offset by declines in abs clos and cmbs in europe issuance decreased 11 as investment grade decreased 25 high yield declined 73 and structured finance increased 59 almost entirely due to strength in covered bonds a category where we have very little presence in asia issuance increased 8 since much of this is made up of local chinese debt that we currently don t rate this increase is not meaningful to our results while these declines are very significant let me put the fourth quarter global issuance into perspective this slide depicts quarterly global issuance for the past six years the fourth quarter of each year is highlighted in dark blue as you can see the fourth quarter of 2018 was in line with historical fourth quarters it s the exceptional issuance in the fourth quarter of 2017 which created a very difficult comparison there s another dynamic increasingly impacting high yield issuance this chart shows that us speculative grade borrowers are increasingly turning to the bank loan market the light and dark blue bars illustrate leveraged loans and the brown bars depict high yield bonds the movement from high yield bonds to leveraged loans is not a concern for the company these charts depict that in both the us and europe leveraged loan volumes have increased and the percentage of these loans that we rate is also increasing in fact in 2018 we rated 92 of us leveraged loans and 84 of european leveraged loans and so our bank loan ratings revenue continues to increase reaching 380 million in 2018 remember when doing your analysis leveraged loan activity is not included in bond issuance data now let me turn to indices the savings to investors from the lower fees associated with index investing has been dramatic the bars on this chart depict the growth in total index assets invested in products linked to the s p 500 s p midcap 400 and the s p smallcap 600 as the end of 2017 they totaled 3 6 trillion the line on this chart depicts the fees saved by investors on these products more than 150 billion in the last 10 years turning to industry trends affecting our indices business this chart depicts the continuing outflows from actively managed us mutual funds into index based etfs and mutual funds a trend that has benefited us as we worked with the markets to provide indexed products and solutions and much of the success arose from the visionary legend in the index investment world who passed away last month jack bogle the father of indexing jack wanted to help individual investors save and give them as he would say a fair shake and we re grateful for his vision in 1976 jack introduced the first indexed mutual fund now called the vanguard 500 index fund today this fund based on the s p 500 is one of the largest mutual funds in the world with more than 400 billion in aum jack didn t just build a fund he built an industry specifically to etf aum associated with our indices we saw a decline in 2018 due to year end market correction for the full year market declines led to a 125 billion reduction in year end etf aum despite this decline inflows continued adding 90 billion in etf aum i d like to shift to our 2019 outlook our economists expect 2019 global gdp growth of 3 6 slightly lower than the 2018 forecast of 3 8 with lower growth in the us europe and china our economists believe that there is only a 15 to 20 chance of a us recession in 2019 last month ratings issued its annual global refinancing study this yearly study shows debt maturities for the upcoming five years the chart on the left illustrates data from the 2018 and 2019 studies the five year period in the 2019 study shows a 400 billion increase in the total debt maturing versus the 2018 study we use this study along with other market based data to forecast issuance taking a closer look at data from the study reveals an important trend in high yield maturities over the next five years the level of high yield debt maturing significantly increases each year which is a potential source of revenue in the coming years the company updated its 2019 bond issuance forecast in a report issued last week excluding international public finance issuance is expected to decrease less than 1 during investor day we introduced the framework powering the markets of the future including six foundational capabilities we use this framework to set our goals and allocate resources so in 2019 here are some of the top projects and initiatives we prioritized in line to this framework under global we believe that they are in a unique position to bring additional transparency and independent analytics to the capital markets in china the ratings opportunity that i just discussed is one example in addition market intelligence will be expanding its private company and local content within rich data risk analytics and models in china platts will be extending its commercial presence in asia and additional locations with a larger sales force under customer orientation we continue to build out the market intelligence platform which will be rebranded as the s p global platform we ll continue to migrate both capital iq content and capital iq users to the platform in addition we will be adding platts pricing and news content in the platform and expanding the ratings 360 content these efforts are intended to create an increasingly rich user experience for our customers under innovation we re ramping up our esg data factory by centralizing data sets from across the company as well as adding new data sets we re also creating new data feeds for our customers our indices business will be expanding its offering at esg and smart beta indices under technology we re moving out of several data centers and into cloud operation in addition as ewout will review in a moment we re implementing numerous kensho related projects under operational excellence we ll continue our efforts to optimize the management of data ingestion and operation we ll also be leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities throughout our data operations and while cybersecurity has already been an area of focus it s important that we keep improving our capabilities as benchmarks against the nift framework under people we ll extend the program that was initiated in 2018 to raise the technological acumen of all of our employees through a series of online and classroom training courses we also maintain our commitment to diversity and inclusion and finally i want to bring your attention to a campaign that we introduced at the world economic forum in davos last month it s entitled changepays within on our data and insights we were able to demonstrate a greater workforce inclusivity leads to healthier stronger economies our campaign illuminates the positive impact of women in the workforce on companies organizations economies and global communities please take a look at our research and watch the changepays video and while you re added take a look at our 2018 corporate responsibility report for all we are doing in esg and now i d like to turn the call over to ewout steenbergen who ll provide additional insights into our capital plans and financial performance ewout ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you doug and good morning to all of you on the call let me start with our fourth quarter financial results organic revenue decreased 4 as issuance driven declines in ratings exceeded growth in the other three segments adjusted corporate unallocated loss was improved by 24 due to lower incentive compensation as well as our productivity efforts to lower real estate costs and a reduction in professional fees adjusted total expense declined due to lower incentive compensation and success with our ongoing productivity efforts this led to a 270 basis points improvement in our adjusted operating profit margin while us tax reform has substantially lowered our adjusted effective tax rate this quarter it was unusually low because new tax regulations related to us tax reform were issued in the fourth quarter which altered our previous assumptions when the stock declined in the fourth quarter we initiated a new 500 million asr this program along with other share repurchases resulted in a 2 decline in our diluted weighted average shares outstanding and finally we achieved a 20 increase in our adjusted diluted eps to 2 22 during the fourth quarter because of the unusual level of stock option activity in the third quarter of 2017 the stock based compensation tax benefit that we received in 2018 was 0 14 lower than in 2017 as the number of employee stock options continues to decline we expect the stock based compensation tax benefit to decline as well for 2019 we estimate a positive eps impact of 0 05 to 0 10 changes in foreign exchange rates had a modest negative impact on revenue in the ratings business and a positive 15 million impact on adjusted operating profit for the company or about 0 05 of adjusted diluted eps our expenses were positively impacted by the weakening of the indian rupee british pound and argentine peso for the full year changes in foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of 0 19 on adjusted diluted eps there were a number of non gaap adjustments to operating profit this quarter 16 million in restructuring charges in ratings and market intelligence we expect that this will result in 15 million in annual savings a 5 million non cash accounting adjustment associated with our uk pension plan 9 million in kensho retention related expenses and we had 31 million in deal related amortization this is a slide that we shared at our investor day in may it depicts the framework that we outlined to show the areas where we can most impact shareholder value the first two require investments we need to continue to invest to fuel revenue momentum by improving our products introducing new technology adding new data sets and entering new geographies we ve made great progress delivering ebita enhancement and we must continue to fund new organic opportunities to drive additional productivity gains driving financial leverage involves optimizing interest costs reducing shares outstanding and optimizing the tax rates and finally we want to return capital to shareholders while maintaining flexible debt capacity we are committed to returning at least 75 of annual free cash flow to shareholders each year this quarter we recorded strong revenue growth in s p dow jones indices market intelligence and platts ratings declined due to lower debt issuance with the exception of the revenue driven shortfall in ratings revenue growth and productivity efforts resulted in substantial adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating profit margin improvement in every other business segment here you see our headcount by business at the end of the last three years the key takeaway is that over the past two years headcount has increased 6 and revenue and adjusted diluted eps have increased 11 and 59 respectively the major additions have been from acquisitions and insourcing of contractors at investor day we cited a new 100 million three year cost reduction plan it was based on productivity improvements often through investments in support functions real estate technology and digital infrastructure i m pleased to report that after our first year we estimate that we have achieved run rate savings of approximately 60 million of which about 40 million was realized in our 2018 results examples include reducing our real estate footprint by exiting space at our new york headquarters and at our london office consolidating data centers and offshoring certain business services now turning to the balance sheet in 2018 our return of capital to shareholders exceeded 100 of 2018 free cash flow this was accomplished by returning 1 66 billion to repurchase 8 4 million shares and paying 503 million in dividends in addition we re actively working to fuel future revenue growth through acquisitions and organic investments collectively these actions resulted in a 800 million decline in our cash balances versus the end of 2017 our adjusted gross leverage to adjusted ebitda is holding steady at 1 9x well within our targeted range while we have begun already our 2019 share repurchases program with open market purchases of approximately 130 million in january we ll initiate a new 500 million asr in the next few days free cash flow excluding certain items increased 8 in 2018 to 2 billion this level is a bit lower than our 2018 forecast due to lower fourth quarter ratings revenue and a longer renewal process associated with enterprisewide contracts in market intelligence the latter is due to a timing issue that will reverse in 2019 now let s turn to the segment results starting with ratings the decline in issuance particularly high yield issuance that doug discussed resulted in a 16 decline in ratings revenue nevertheless we reported a 16 decline in adjusted expenses resulting in a 10 basis point increase in adjusted segment operating profit margin expense reductions were primarily from productivity programs lower incentive compensation accruals and lower it spend as ratings has established an it center in india and has in sourced much of its it spend for 2018 ratings delivered a 240 basis point improvement in adjusted segment operating profit margin to 56 this is particularly notable in light of the 4 decline in revenue for the year the ratings cost structure is well positioned for a recovery in issuance non transaction revenue decreased primarily due to a 6 million impact from changes in foreign exchange in addition there were lower excess issuance fees associated with medium term notes and lower rating evaluation services activity transaction revenue decreased due to debt issuance reductions partially offset by increased bank loan rating activity non transaction revenue has been a steady source of growth this is because the majority of the revenue is subscription like however there is some volatility of certain components namely rating evaluation services ebb and flow with m a activity and changes in foreign exchange rates can always have an impact this slide depicts ratings revenue by its end markets the largest contributor to the decline in ratings revenue was the 15 decline in corporates primarily as a result of us tax reform that doug discussed earlier issuance declines associated with market volatility also drove the declining revenue financial services revenue decreased 22 structured finance declined 14 and governments decreased 33 while the crisil and other categories decreased 2 it included an increase in inter segment royalties for market intelligence offset by a decline in crisil s dollar denominated revenue market intelligence delivered a strong quarter with organic revenue excluding revenue from panjiva and ratewatch increasing 7 and active desktop user growth of 12 with adjusted expenses down 1 adjusted segment operating profit increased 27 and the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 570 basis points to 38 5 a new high point for the full year the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 200 basis points to 34 1 while we are thrilled with the fourth quarter of margin the full year margin is more representative of our current run rate beginning this quarter we began integrating trucost into market intelligence market intelligence has a lot of esg activity under way and we believe the business is better suited to be included here desktop the largest category grew 6 data management solutions realized 12 revenue growth once again benefiting from expansion of the data feeds business risk services grew 6 with the ratingsxpress providing the greatest level of growth as we continued to expand the data feeds portion of risk services turning to s p dow jones indices the segment delivered 13 revenue growth 7 adjusted expense growth and 17 adjusted segment operating profit growth this led to an adjusted segment operating profit margin of 67 1 for the quarter and 68 for the full year increases of 220 basis points and 160 basis points respectively strong revenue growth during the quarter was driven by a 43 increase in exchange traded derivatives from increased market volatility and a 19 increase in data and custom subscriptions data and custom subscriptions increased due to a catch up in real time reporting that we first discussed in the second quarter as well as from organic growth asset linked fees increased 4 primarily due to increased average aum in etfs and mutual funds linked to our indices it is important to understand that asset linked fees include revenue associated with etfs mutual funds and certain over the counter derivatives investors frequently assume that all this revenue is related to etfs despite the market downturn at the end of 2018 inflows into to passive products continued in the fourth quarter both for the industry and for etfs tied to our indices for our indices business etf net inflows were 22 billion in the fourth quarter and 90 billion for the full year the average aum in the fourth quarter increased 9 year over year i want to make a clear distinction between average aum and quarter ending aum our contracts are based on average aum we disclose quarter ending figures because flows and market gains and losses are best depicted using quarter end figures as shown in the waterfall chart on the right while average aum increased quarter ending aum declines versus the end of the fourth quarter 2017 a year ago there was 1 343 trillion in etf aum linked to our indices at the end of 2018 there was 1 309 trillion during 2018 we saw 90 billion of inflows and 125 billion in stock market declines industry inflows into exchange traded funds were 168 billion in the fourth quarter and 499 billion in 2018 clearly we are encouraged by the recovery in etf aum in january key indicators for our exchange traded derivatives volume were extremely strong during the quarter s p 500 index options activity increased 36 vix futures and options activity increased 2 and activity at the cme equity complex increased 71 for the full year s p 500 index options activity increased 26 vix futures and options activity decreased 6 and activity at the cme equity complex increased 34 and now turning to the last business segment platts delivered healthy revenue and margin growth revenue increased 7 as a result of a 7 increase in core subscriptions and 11 increase in global trading services partially offset by a decline in other revenue which is mostly from conferences adjusted expense declined 2 due to reduced incentive accruals and a reduction in outside services the fourth quarter adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 470 basis points to 48 2 the full year adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 200 basis points to 49 1 this chart depicts global trading services revenue by quarter for the last three years there s volatility from quarter to quarter as the underlying trading volume fluctuates however gts does provide a constant revenue contribution to the platts business during the fourth quarter revenue improved due mainly to increased trading volumes in certain gas oil and fuel oil markets platts revenue increased in the quarter as all four commodity groups delivered mid single digits growth during investor day in may 2018 we introduced medium term aspirational targets for the company we are pleased to use this morning s investor call to reiterate these targets and to share the great progress we have made in just the first year we target to deliver organic revenue growth of mid to high single digit each year during 2018 we achieved the target in three of our four businesses unfortunately ratings fell short due to market factors we target low double digit adjusted eps growth during 2018 we delivered 23 we re committed to return at least 75 of our free cash flow each year in 2018 we returned 108 through share repurchases and dividends and we established adjusted operating profit margin levels that we target to achieve in next three to four years in the first year we made substantial progress with each of the businesses contributing to an overall 230 basis point improvement in the company s adjusted operating profit margin we re energized by our progress and confident as we begin the second year of this effort in 2019 we plan to invest 90 million to 110 million in new project to fuel additional future organic growth this is an increase over the 60 million we invested in 2018 the first category for investment is global growth with regulatory approvals now secured ratings will continue to build its domestic ratings capability in china and platts is working to expand its commercial operations in asia market intelligence has a china initiative that involves setting up digital infrastructure and domestic operations as well as adding additional global capability to the s p global platform the second category is innovation with plans to ramp up our esg data factory as a central source to serve esg offerings from various business segments including new esg analytics and data products that we will be piloting platts agriculture acceleration involves extending news and data offerings and expanding into additional commodities we ll also expand the number of projects that are under way as part of our kensho initiative the third category is in technology we re adding investments to continue the deployment of data science ai cloud machine learning and robotics tools we also continue to raise the technology acumen of all employees through a multitude of training programs all of these investments were aimed at either growing revenue or enhancing ebitda ph next i would like to update you on kensho one of the greatest challenges we have had with kensho is prioritizing the large number of projects that employees have identified projects generally can be grouped in three key areas data ingestion data processing and data and document delivery within these categories there are a number of projects that are under way omnisearch and entity linking are two we have cited in the past omnisearch is the next generation of search capability for our market intelligence ratings360 and platts lng surface applications it leverages advanced machine learning techniques to bring natural language search to our web and mobile platforms we re also working to link user personas to more relevant responses as well as expanding the data sets that will be searchable the first release will be available in the first half of 2019 to a select group of clients for preview and feedback and then released in a broader capacity later in 2019 or the first half of 2020 entity linking involves using machine learning to link data from different sources to correct entities without errors and in a fraction of the time it would take our employees it unlocks the ability to ingest data sets that are too large to be done with traditional methods in addition to the crunchbase data we previously discussed we have been working on certain data sets for private company data in china and the uk for the uk data we plan to make the first 100 000 companies available in the first quarter of this year with subsequent releases of coverage throughout 2019 codex is a next generation customer oriented platform designed to ingest any document and provide the relevant data and information for a particular user s needs a first version of the platform has been built and demonstrations are under way proof of concept user case has been created for ratings analysts to alert them to new relevant information more quickly we have numerous other projects under way in data processing and delivery the first projects were initiated in just nine months since acquiring kensho we estimate the initial projects in omnisearch entity linking and codex which are the most advanced have the potential to generate a net present value equal to approximately one third of the purchase price of kensho we have numerous other projects under way in data processing and data delivery and numerous others that have been identified but not yet begun we believe that this is a very positive start with much more value generation to be achieved during the next few years now lastly i would like to introduce our 2019 guidance this slide depicts our gaap guidance please keep in mind that our guidance reflects current spot market forex rates this slide shows our adjusted guidance an increase in revenue of mid single digits with contributions by every business segment we have decided to record kensho revenue in market intelligence going forward therefore we are providing guidance on corporate unallocated expense excluding any revenue of 155 million to 165 million deal related amortization of 120 million to 125 million kensho retention plans of 20 million to 25 million operating profit margin in the range of 48 8 to 49 8 interest expense of 145 million to 150 million a tax rate of 22 5 to 23 5 this is an increase over 2018 because we expect to have a lower benefit from employee stock based compensation as well as less discrete benefits from prior year tax adjustments and diluted eps which excludes deal related amortization of 8 95 to 9 15 in addition we expect capital expenditures of approximately 120 million and free cash flow excluding certain items in the range of 2 2 billion to 2 3 billion in 2019 we are increasing our organic investments in productivity programs and new revenue opportunities and we will continue to look for opportunities to add unique data analytics and geographies despite so many pending global economic issues this guidance reflects our expectation that we will continue to deliver solid financial performance again in 2019 with this let me turn the call back over to chip for your questions chip merritt senior vice president investor relations thank you just a couple of instructions for our phone participants operator instructions operator we ll now take our first question questions and answers operator thank you this question comes from toni kaplan from morgan stanley you may ask your question toni kaplan morgan stanley analyst thank you good morning transaction revenue this quarter was not surprisingly weak just given the issuance levels and january issuance was maybe modestly better than 4q but still down double digits according to our sources so can you give a bit more color on how you re thinking about the credit environment as we progress through the year thanks douglas l peterson president and chief executive officer hi toni thank you this is doug first of all as you know during the year last year we had a solid year during the year but the fourth quarter in particular december ended up with very very weak comparables from prior years in particular there was a shift in the high yield market where people started thinking differently about the type of covenants that were going out to the markets we also had as you know the impact from tax reform from the largest cash holders it started bringing their cash back and had not gone to the market we think that january is not necessarily indicative of the entire year as you know typically january is a pretty weak month one of the things that was important in january is to see in the second half of january in the third and fourth week the markets actually started rebounding you saw more people coming back to the market you saw spreads came down in the high yield market but as you know in our forecast overall we have a forecast for total issuance which takes into account the pipeline that we see coming in from maturities we speak with investment banks and with issuers and right now we have projected that for the entire year that issuance would be down to about 0 6 so call it down a little bit or flat we think that in the corporate sector that s going to be down about 4 at financial services it is going to be down about 1 3 structured finance basically flat and public finance up over the prior year of about 9 so if you look across different categories this is how we ve calculated and this is what we ve used to build into our plans for the year toni kaplan morgan stanley analyst great thanks for that and then in market intelligence you expanded margin significantly this quarter and i know you said that full year is probably more representative of run rate margins but could you give some additional color on what i guess may be the onetime pieces were in 4q and what s ongoing and then are margins in market intelligence an area that you can flex when if there s a weak issuance environment thank you ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning toni this is ewout so the strong margin improvement in market intelligence was driven on the one hand as you ve seen by very healthy revenue growth and then on the other hand by a small decline in expenses if you look at the underlying components in the expense movements there were a couple of items that were going in opposite directions and therefore showing the declines small decline modest decline in expenses compensation base compensation was up but then there was an offset in lower incentive compensation accruals so the net was close to zero results strong sales in the fourth quarter strong sales was driving up the cost of sales as well as inter segment royalties but then also strong sales leads to higher capitalization of acquisition cost under the new revenue accounting methods so those are also a bit offsetting we saw fx having a positive impact on the expenses of market intelligence allocations were down so corporate allocations were down but then acquisitions that were down during the year most notably panjiva and ratewatch were driving expenses up so a lot of moving pieces but net net a small decline in expenses and therefore a good improvement in margins but we don t expect all of these items to recur in every quarter so therefore the full year margin is a better guidance for market intelligence going forward toni kaplan morgan stanley analyst thank you operator thank you this question comes from manav patnaik with barclays you may ask your question manav patnaik barclays analyst thank you good morning just on the 2019 topline guidance what s the fx impact you are assuming and also you kind of gave us a framework for the ratings business i know you don t like to give specific guidance on the others but is there anything to call out for next year for each of those businesses or can we just assume kind of the trends that we ve seen so far ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning manav this is ewout first in our guidance we assume current spot market forex rates so that is what is the underlying assumption if you look at our guidance with respect to topline for the company as a whole as you know we re not breaking out guidance for each of the segments but what i can explain to you is some of the assumptions underneath so if you have to think about ratings as doug already mentioned our assumption is more or less flat issuance markets during 2019 then we have some small adjustments in market shares in short in segments and then we also take into account price increases based on the new list price that we re using from the 1st of january of this year so that is the underlying assumption we have under our plan for 2019 for ratings we have two subscription businesses so those are i think businesses that see growth based on the annualized contract value that we are increasing every year and you have seen the good progress we are making with platts and market intelligence and then with respect to indices as you know there is a natural hedge in our indices business if stock markets will come down we see exchange traded derivatives volumes going up and the other way around so you have to take that into account in your modeling to also reflect the growth of our indices business but as we have said in the prepared remarks we expect mid single digit revenue growth for the company as a whole and contributions by each of our segments to achieve that manav patnaik barclays analyst got it thank you and then i guess just thinking about china you ve talked about the ratings opportunity there for some time but i guess i was struck by it sounds like market intelligence is doing something new platts kensho i was just wondering if you could briefly address how we should think about the opportunity that those other areas present douglas l peterson president and chief executive officer let me take that one well first of all as you know the chinese financial markets are still a very bank centric market in fact as we were doing the work to understand the opportunity for ratings business we did a lot of macroanalysis of the market just to share with you a couple of the numbers for instance in the bond market in china 54 of the bonds are held by banks and 32 by mutual funds and wealth management projects only 2 of the bonds in china are held by foreign investors and the issuers themselves are spread between corporate bonds such which actually quite low compared to the other markets local governments commercial banks et cetera but what s important is the chinese market becomes more sophisticated as the bond market shifts to become a true bond market and not a commercial banking market as more foreign investors start going into the chinese market we looked at the structured markets in the way they change over time as they become more developed and what we believe is that there is our basic thesis is that there will be more and more demand for independent analytics so one of the first products is obviously the ratings and we think that that is a market which will develop pretty quickly especially because there s going to be demand not just from the domestic investors but also over time from international investors and along with that is in any market comes demand for other types of products and services data products information more information about private companies that don t have that are not publicly traded and this is where we are looking at the market intelligence offering to be able to provide more data and analytics at cap iq snl like data service for the chinese markets and we ve just started to mentioning that and we just started rolling it out we have a team on the ground one of the other elements which is for us is actually quite exciting of the launch of the chinese market is that we re also doing this is a team we re doing it as s p global even though the rating agency has its own license and it has it s own staff we re also going in with one effort when it comes to hiring in our human resources and people policies one legal and compliance team so we can actually leverage our sources on the ground so we re able to go to the market but overall our thesis is that as the market becomes more sophisticated more connected there s going to be a whole set of data and analytics and financial products which are going to be necessary in the market and we want to be on the ground floor as they become more important operator thank you this question comes from hamzah mazari from macquarie capital you may ask your question hamzah mazari macquarie capital analyst good morning you talked about the shift from high yield to leveraged loans in the us could you maybe remind us what the margin difference is in your business between loan ratings and high yield and then whether you re seeing the same trend in europe because secular thesis a while back on ratings was european bank dis intermediation so wondering if that has sort of reversed any color there douglas l peterson president and chief executive officer thanks hamzah this is doug first of all on the pricing it s basically about the same it s not there s not a material difference between the pricing between the two different products in europe we continue to see europe the capital markets are continuing to develop but you have one major impact which has in a sense slowed down what we thought was going to be the ultimate development and that is the ecb is continuing to provide a lot of liquidity for the markets but in the last quarter up until you had the slowdown of the leveraged loan market the european markets were actually moving quite fast so there was a lot of issuance and in the last two weeks of january the european leveraged markets actually came back to life and there was issuance back in the european market so we do think in the long run the european markets will continue to move toward capital markets more quickly obviously compared to we just talked about in the prior questions about china europe is a much more developed capital market than what we see it s one that just starting out but it s not quite still at the level of us when it comes to participation of traditional capital market entities like insurance companies and pension funds and asset managers but we re seeing continued move in that direction hamzah mazari macquarie capital analyst okay and just a follow up question on ratings margins you talked about up 10 bps on a 16 revenue drop and highlighted various reasons if ratings revenue does come back how quickly do costs come back in that segment just any comments on operating leverage in that segment being structurally much higher or any thoughts on sort of how costs come back to that segment if you see revenue come back ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning hamzah this is ewout a couple of thoughts that hopefully are helpful on the one hand ratings is working on very active programs to think about how to redesign its operations its business model its processes its systems is introducing new technologies in order to make the life of inaudible analysts more effective to take away some of the lower value added work the spreadsheet work and updating of the models and to replace that with new technologies and to get that done in a more efficient way so we expect operating leverage for ratings to continue you saw that we took another restructuring charge for ratings as well so those are benefits in the programs where we will continue to see improvements in overall productivity in the ratings organization the other element that you have to take into account is incentive compensation and we had some expense benefit during the quarter from the incentive compensation accruals for the full year the way how to dimensionalize that is the following so first ratings had a very good year in 2017 as had some other businesses in the company as you will recall so we had very good payout so we will see a reduction just every year a reset to a 100 of the accrual levels and then this year particularly in the fourth quarter the performance was of course lower so now you have a reflection of lower payout from that 100 level so if you look at the overall expense reduction year over year for ratings which was approximately 120 million the majority of that came from incentive accruals a little over half of that was just a reset year over year to the 100 level and a little bit less than half of that reduction came from the lower accruals that we established in 2018 that of course will come back up to the 100 level in 2019 so that is an automatic increase in the costs that we will see in 2019 from 2018 but again we expect also at the same time continued improvement of the productivity programs that we are implementing in ratings hamzah mazari macquarie capital analyst very helpful thank you operator thank you this question comes from alex kramm from ubs you may ask your question alex kramm ubs analyst yeah hi good morning everyone just hoping you can expand on the conversation about china that was asked about earlier and in your prepared remarks you gave some nice data points i think 35 employees in that new entity but 200 in the other parts like how quickly are you ramping people here and what cost is tied to it at an end secondarily you said 400 companies already rated out of the other entities so that can come pretty quickly so maybe just talk about the next few quarters few years in terms of how quickly that business can ramp and then in terms of pricing like how do you think envision the pricing structures are very comparable to the rest of the world or is there something we should be thinking about differently in terms of basis points thank you douglas l peterson president and chief executive officer okay thanks alex well just to give you a little bit more of the ramp up plan as you have heard we have 36 employees in the entity 31 of those are analysts of those analysts about 10 of them are employees from s p global that transferred in from other parts of the world who are bringing their core knowledge and expertise of how s p global works everywhere else they are native mandarin speakers that have come in from other offices and then we ve hired 21 more analysts from the market being a first mover was an advantage to us because we were able to go out in the market and attract a very large pool of candidates and hire a really highly qualified set of people and because we were there first we already have started hiring we think that we can ramp up very quickly if the demand comes in right now in china there s about 4 000 issuers that are rated across the markets by the domestic rating agencies we rate about 400 of those offshore we ve already developed plans to go out and meet with all of those different 400 that we re working with already as well as the others as many as possible the other issuers that are rated i can t i don t want to give you any kind of financial projections on this but i can tell you that the pricing that we re looking at over time will develop to a similar level as around the globe it s likely to start out where you need to enter the market at a level of pricing that s going to be able to get us close the transactions and get out into the markets but we expect over time that the pricing is going to be similar to the rest of the world as you know pricing on bond ratings is actually a very low amortized cost compared to the cost of actual bond issuance and so that s why we think we can over time we can develop to that level of pricing when we look at the different kinds of bond markets is as you saw in our prepared remarks there s four different categories of bonds that we re able to rate that we ve been approved for we think that the financial institutions and the corporates are really the core area that we will start rating right away because that s where we have the relationships with the 400 issuers we do as you know we have a very long term thinking about this this is something that developed over the long term this didn t just come about over one quarter we ve been working on this for years john berisford ewout and myself have been visiting china for years to build the relationships and to understand the markets and with that kind of a long term commitment to the way we ve approached to this is the same way we think about building out the business and ensuring that we build it with a really strong foundation and a really strong team on the ground alex kramm ubs analyst excellent super helpful color thank you and then secondly maybe also coming back to a prior question but if you think about the issuance forecast i know it s another team that does it but if i think about last few quarters i think that it was revised lower every quarter and obviously they re difficult to forecast but if you think about it from a bigger picture perspective what are the big puts and takes that you re thinking about as you look at that forecast and where things could do a lot better or do worse and a couple of things to maybe highlight is like you said the loans businesses has been an area of strength but i think people are getting increasingly more worried about what s going on in that market and then we re hearing increasingly cfos talking about the leverage de leveraging the balance sheet so what are the kind of puts and takes i guess you would be watching out for thank you douglas l peterson president and chief executive officer yeah so let me give you a few of the thoughts on that and let me start with a leverage market and it s as you have seen in the numbers we presented the leverage market has the component of the financial the corporation s a good leverage market can go either to the bond market or the loan market they have increasingly been going to the loan market for various reasons based on the kinds of borrowers the kinds of lenders and investors that have gone in the market the attraction of a floating rate versus fixed rate the attraction of the kinds of covenants and other aspects of the loan market that they could get we saw a correction in that market in december and there s a lot of people including myself that think that some of the aspects of that were probably healthy leverage had gotten quite high you saw leverage in some deals going over 6 times 7 times sometimes even 8 times and so since the market has opened up even though there s a lot of investors going back to the market there s been some correction in terms of leverage not so much in covenants so far but much more in total leverage amount so we see that as one of the factors which will be driving our forecasts going forward a little bit more specifically on the forecast and you mentioned that since our october outlook or december outlook and our january outlook we ve seen actually a moderation of that when we first did our 2019 forecast in october we expected that it was going to be up about 0 6 december about the same up 0 6 and now we see it going down 0 6 so just to give you some of the sentiment in some of the areas that we see those changes we did drop a little bit on the corporates we dropped it by about another 1 down from the prior forecast just based on the pipelines that we ve seen from the market participants but financial services is the one that we saw the largest shift between the end of the year and now the beginning of the year and that is originally been expected to go up 5 and now we re expected to only go up about 1 3 and the main difference there is based on what we expect financial institutions are going to be issuing related to reserve requirements and some of them by speaking with them a lot of them are not going to be growing their balance sheets as much as we had originally expected so this goes back to policies capital policies at the fed as well as capital policies of the banks themselves and that s probably the largest difference overall that drove that so a little bit in the corporates a lot more from financial institutions and then our outlook for the leverage market is come back not necessarily with the same level of leverage that we saw in the middle of the year last year but it actually has come back pretty healthy the last couple weeks of january the markets were back they were open again after 45 days of being closed alex kramm ubs analyst excellent thanks again douglas l peterson president and chief executive officer thank you ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks alex operator thank you this question comes from tim mchugh from william blair and company you may ask your question tim mchugh william blair and company analyst thanks i just want to ask about how you would characterize you talked about the incremental 100 million of investments i guess you re always investing somewhat in the business so is this a stepped up level of investment that s different than other years are you just trying to highlight to us i guess what you what the focus is for the year just trying to understand the context of what you re saying with that ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning tim yes we are just trying to highlight and to make this transparent to you and also show you the specific areas where we are investing to give you a little bit broader perspective we re of course always investing in our businesses and business as usual to keep our benchmarks relevant in systems in processes in new designs of the organization so there is always a lot of level of business as usual investments what we are trying to highlight here is investments specifically in new initiatives new products and new markets as we showed you in 2018 those investments were at the level of 60 million and that will go up by approximately 40 million to 50 million to that new number for 2019 in those areas like china and i think everyone would agree with me that the chinese ratings opportunity for the company is very large and it makes a lot of sense to make this investment and the company will see hopefully a lot of benefit out of that in the mid and long term so obviously we are self funding those initiatives you see that we have productivity programs going on where we have savings on one hand and capturing the operating leverage and then reinvesting it and also you see the margin still going up for the company so another indication that we are self funding those initiatives so we hope it s overall helpful that we give this clarity and you have a feel of where the company is making the large investments in new initiatives going forward to expect huge revenue growth for the company on top of our current business activities tim mchugh william blair and company analyst okay that s helpful and then just want to follow up i think it was when you re talking about the cash flow there was quick comment you made about longer renewal cycles for some of the enterprise deals in market intelligence i guess can you elaborate on what that was and i guess just you said i think you thought it was a timing issue so why do you think that necessarily ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer sure tim what is happening is as you know we are going through the process to move all market intelligence customers to enterprisewide contracts so this is purely an administrative process where we are changing the contracts you have discussions about the new language of the new contracts those contracts then need to be signed new invoices needs to be issued and then there needs to be a cash collection on those new invoices so going through this process right now the change in time lines have shifted from about 10 days to 52 days in terms of cash collection so this is purely a delay in the process we expect a catch up of that during 2019 so therefore you see a free cash flow number guidance for 2019 which is up 10 to 15 over the free cash flow we generated in 2018 tim mchugh william blair and company analyst okay so the comment about the delay is more about the collection process and not necessarily the sale or negotiation of the agreement ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer it s just going through the whole process of new contract legal documentation signing processing invoicing and so on it s purely the administrative renewal process itself tim mchugh william blair and company analyst okay thank you operator thank you this question comes from jeff silber from bmo capital markets you may ask your question jeff silber bmo capital markets analyst thank you so much i know it s late obviously i ll ask a couple of quick ones you mentioned when talking about the outlook for the ratings segment the price increases you instituted at the beginning of the year can you give us some order of framework roughly what that was and how that compared to prior years ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer the list price that has been issued is 6 95 you see it was up from approximately 6 75 so about 3 increase year over year that is just the headline list price of course there s a lot of differentiation by type of customer type of arrangements and so on but that would be the headline number jeff silber bmo capital markets analyst and what was the headline increase in 2018 ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer more or less the same so that is the usual increase that we see over the past few years jeff silber bmo capital markets analyst okay great and again i know you don t give quarterly guidance but beside potentially ratings being more back end loaded is there anything you want to point out for the quarters for 2019 ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer no there s nothing else that we can point out at this time jeff silber bmo capital markets analyst great thank you so much ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks operator thank you this question comes from craig huber from huber research partners you may ask your question craig huber huber research partners analyst thank you doug i just want to get back to china for a second here you mentioned about 31 analysts in that market you ve hired or switched over there i guess roughly 2 of analysts on a global basis how quickly do you think this market to be in perspective from a ratings revenue standpoint can pick up here in the coming years inaudible maybe we ll see it in the numbers i mean it s a long term play obviously but do you expect any material positive impact on revenues and profits in the first two years say is there any big pent up demand we get a big bump upfront in your revenue boost with the ratings being in that market or just you take a real long time to play out douglas l peterson president and chief executive officer my expectation is that this will take a little bit to play out what i d like to do is give you numbers as we start looking at this over quarter by quarter we ll figure it how often and how much we re going to we will give you about our progress but just a couple of more couple more statistics about the market overall in china the total lending market including everything is about 20 6 trillion of that about 13 trillion is corporate so it s little bit more than half of the market is corporate loans and of that about 2 trillion more or less are bonds of which 1 trillion are bonds outstanding of corporates so think about it s a 1 trillion corporate bond market about 4 000 issuers we think that we ve got 400 where you have relationships that we can tap as the first companies that we go to we also as you know the panda bond markets where foreign issuers going to the chinese market is one that it s very small right now but we think that s another area that will bring specific expertise as well as interest from foreign issuers to go into the chinese market using s p as the company that can do the rating so i don t want to give you any projections or numbers on the revenues over time as i ve said we see this is a market which is going to transform to more of a global capital market much more connected as i mentioned earlier it s only 2 of the bonds in china are held by foreign investors so you see that growing and so let us come back to you to give you updates on our progress so we can really understand how fast this is going to move once we re starting to see volume coming through the door craig huber huber research partners analyst and then on second doug you mentioned i guess in a global basis expecting debt issuance down zero to 1 call it if you could just segment for just us part of that i d be curious for your thoughts how you think that might play out the debt issuance for investment grade and high yield and then also maybe with how you maybe see bank loan issuance for this year playing out those three segments within this country douglas l peterson president and chief executive officer well the two pieces which are the most significant that i mentioned a couple of minutes ago the corporates which are down 4 8 more or less what we re projecting that s mostly the us and that s mostly the us and it s partially because of tax reform and what our projections are as to what will be the issuance level for the companies that have very cash rich balance sheet so then the other which is probably the most significant as i said financial services that s also us and that s the us financial institutions that are ones that are projecting to have smaller balance sheets or less growth on their balance sheets than we had expected three and four months ago so that s the color that i can give you based on the analysis that our team has done thanks craig craig huber huber research partners analyst thanks thank you ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks craig operator thank you this question comes from joseph foresi from cantor fitzgerald you may ask your question joseph foresi cantor fitzgerald analyst hi my first question is just on china can you give us a little bit of a better understanding or maybe what the risks are of having ratings in that region is there sufficient accounting standards there do you feel like you re more exposed i m just trying to get a sense of how the market works from risk perspective douglas l peterson president and chief executive officer well thanks joseph for the question as we ve gone into the chinese market as i ve mentioned earlier this is something that we ve been looking at for years this isn t just something that cropped up in the last quarter and we ve also already had a business on the ground for over 10 years with ratings analysts on the ground in china who have been rating chinese corporations on offshore issuance or dim sum bonds that are issued offshore and as i mentioned we have 400 of those that we ve already rated so we know that there s at least 400 companies that already audited by global auditing firms they have transparency in their financials they ve been going offshore to raise funds so there s already a core group of corporations and financial institutions in china that are rated and are already issuing bonds at global standards but clearly you re raising what for us are very important points and how do we roll out a ratings business in the market which is developing we re using our knowledge and experience of how we ve gone into other markets like india through crisil or mexico which we did an acquisition many years ago to go into that market both india and mexico are markets where we issue with local rating scales where we do not have rating scales that are linked to the global scales they are based on local market conditions and so one of the reasons that we re rolling out our china rating agency as a local independently scaled rating agency is that we want to be able to meet and understand all the local conditions of what are the conditions of bankruptcy laws what are the conditions of workouts what are the conditions of companies that could potentially have any kind of a default or payment issue and this is why it s important for us to go in that market independently with a locally managed rating agency we ve been working closely with the regulators to ensure that they understand the rating agency model as we roll it out it s critical that they understand that we are independent and that our ratings are going to be issued with an independent opinion that we ve got the right kind of analysts that are well trained so we ve looked at what are the kind of risks do we get the right kind of disclosure from companies do you have the ability to understand if there s been a payment issue do we have the right kind of regulatory environment which we think is being developed in a way that s very professional and understanding what are the other environments around the globe for rating regimes etcetera so we ve gone with this over many many years of analysis many many years of building relationships and we think that some of those risks that you ve mentioned are things that we have good ways to mitigate or manage joseph foresi cantor fitzgerald analyst got it and then just to switch gears anyway to start to quantify the impact of the increase in your focus on data i m thinking more on the kensho side and i m just trying to get a sense of you know we re early stages sort of building the foundation but clearly it s a focus clearly it s something that i would agree is going to be an important part of the future but i m wondering how internally you re starting to think about quantifying that and any anecdotes you could provide thanks ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah let me give you a couple of thoughts on that first we are looking at more and more data sets ideally proprietary data sets that are unique and only can be found on our platform but there could also be other data sets that we license and therefore incorporate as we mentioned during the prepared remarks with data sets it s very important that those data sets are linked to our existing master database so that is an automatic link between entities between individuals between a lot of different other data sets because data is only valuable if it is put in perspective of all the other data rich data that we have already today on our platform therefore it s so important that we are working on that new search engine the omnisearch with kensho because the more data we put on our platform the more important it will be for our customers to find the right data and use that data in the future hence the investments we are doing with kensho on the omnisearch moreover we are having a lot of data intake elements within the organization and we re thinking now about a design of the overall data factory to make data more a commodity within the firm based on the same definitions the same data architecture have an efficient data intake which is based on a lot of technology tools and to take the benefit of the enterprise as a whole so data is core to our strategy core to our business growth core to the commercial propositions that are being developed by our businesses and we make a lot of investments in this area but ultimately this will be the main driver of revenue growth for the company in the future joseph foresi cantor fitzgerald analyst thank you operator thank you this question comes from the dan dolev from nomura securities you may ask your question dan dolev nomura securities analyst hi thank you for taking my question just from a housekeeping item is the kensho 20 million to 25 million expense embedded in the guidance for retention is that the main difference between the 18 unallocated expense and what you re guiding for 19 ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer no if you look at the unallocated what we are doing is moving the kensho revenue to the market intelligence revenue and the reason why we are doing that is more and more the kensho contracts with kensho customers are being forward into overall market intelligence relationships with the same customers and therefore it s more difficult to separately identify kensho revenue in the future so that s why it s being integrated with revenue of market intelligence so if you look purely at unallocated expenses unallocated expenses were 171 million for 2018 which is then excluding the 15 million kensho revenue that included 20 million of funding for the foundation that happened last year and kensho expenses but kensho expenses you have to realize those were kensho expenses over a nine month period so now we are of course are having kensho expenses for the full year 2019 so if you look at those to all those elements we will continue to see a nice reduction in unallocated expenses to that range of 155 million to 165 million in 2019 which is ultimately done based on the productivity programs we are introducing within the company dan dolev nomura securities analyst yeah that s helpful so the kensho retention plans i believe they were excluded from the adjusted number right the 34 million in 18 they were not in the non gaap number ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer if you look at kensho expenses we have kensho expenses that are being included from a performance basis and then we have excess kensho expenses that are based on the rollover equity as part of the consideration for the acquisitions so what we have done is we looked at what is market compensation for employees of kensho everything that is market level is being included on the non gaap basis and everything s that s over and above what would be normalized market levels which is based on that rollover equity that is being stripped out as the kensho retention related expenses that number you should see coming down over time and the reason is just purely the accounting it s an accelerated accounting method so every year you see that number coming down very quickly the excess expenses for kensho that are being pulled out on a non gaap basis dan dolev nomura securities analyst got it thank you and then just my follow up is on the overall headcount i see some nice growth in the headcount in the year over year if you have to sort of think about the different segment it looks like the corporate headcount increased dramatically yet same ratings headcount declined if you had to sort of normalize that in terms of the centers of excellence like how would that roughly look like would you be expecting ratings headcount to grow up as well if you didn t allocate it into corporate that s sort of the question ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah that s really a great question so there s always going to be some movements in headcount so when we do acquisitions of course headcount will go up so for example in corporate headcount went up for example based on the kensho acquisition but also headcount in market intelligence is up and that s based on the acquisitions of panjiva ratewatch but also new content sets that mi is introducing so we will have a reductions of headcount based on productivity on existing data sets in market intelligence and then headcount additions for the new data sets that are being introduced corporate headcounts might go up a bit over time because when we are centralizing certain activities in centers of excellence it might mean a shift from headcount in the divisions to corporate so that could be another shift also when we are insourcing certain activities for example the it and engineering activities in ratings will ultimately be an increase headcount for ratings but that is an offset on external services that will be eliminated going forward so that s a shift in headcount numbers but not so much a shift in expenses or actually that is a decline in expenses that we will realize as a company douglas l peterson president and chief executive officer and just to add one thing one of the things that john s trying to do in ratings is he aspires to try to be able to handle more and more and more credit each year with the same number of analysts so we re not really looking to reduce they were looking to try to make the more and more efficient with all the technology that we re trying to deploy dan dolev nomura securities analyst makes sense thank you so much ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks dan operator thank you this question comes from george tong from goldman sachs you may ask your question george tong goldman sachs analyst hi thanks good morning your non transaction revenues took a step back in the ratings business in part because of tougher comps were there specific items that weighed on non transaction revenues this quarter and how do you see non transaction revenues performing next year ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer hi george good morning fx had a negative impact on non transaction revenue if you strip that element out it was more or less flat the other element that impacted non transaction revenue was rating evaluation services we ve always called out that that could go up or down by quarter that s very much driven by the m a environment so we ll have quarters where the rest of revenues will be a little higher or a little lower but overall we look at non transaction revenue as a very stable source of revenues and we expect that to continue to be a very steady source for the ratings business in the future george tong goldman sachs analyst got it that s helpful you ve achieved 60 million in cost savings through year end 2018 out of your 100 million of cost reductions planned in your analyst day over the intermediate term can you talk about the pacing of when you expect to achieve the remainder of your cost savings and what the principal drivers of savings will be going forward ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah we are very encouraged by progress we have made during the first year 60 million in run rate and 40 million of that in our annual results for 2018 we will continue on the same pace what you have seen toward our targets and the main areas where we find those opportunities are in our functions so we are trying to create new operating models for our functions across the enterprise both in the businesses as well as in the corporate center we are looking at opportunities in our digital infrastructure area for example consolidation of some of our data centers moving to the cloud other outsourcing arrangements etcetera and we are taking care of real estate costs we are reducing excess real estate we have in the company and are significantly driving down real estate expenses and we will continue with all of those levers over the next few years of course we will let you know once we have achieved these targets and at that point announce you a new target but at this moment we are very encouraged by the progress we re making with all of those programs george tong goldman sachs analyst very helpful thank you operator we will now take our final question from bill warmington from wells fargo you may ask your question bill warmington wells fargo analyst good morning everyone the final question here it is actually two right so first on kensho you mentioned the entity linking work you re doing with kensho crunchbase the private company databases in china and the uk can you frame that opportunity for us that s commercial credit information space is typically in the area we associated with dnb and bbd and it sounds like you re moving increasingly into that space ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer this is an area where we are very pleased with some of the first results of the kensho collaboration we have talked to you about crunchbase but in the meantime we have done the same with the algorithms that have been developed on other private company data sets and the benefit of entity linking is the following it s not only a expense reduction opportunity of course in the past we could do the same entity linking but by asking a lot of teams and a lot of employees to work on that and that will take a lot of time to achieve data linking with the right quality of data is it the same entity the name is spelled at a slightly different way slightly different abbreviation is it a subholding is it in another jurisdiction so a lot of work has to be done to make sure that entity linking is correct and accurate so by doing this now based on algorithms of course we find efficiency opportunities but the larger benefit is in fact in the revenue opportunity why because of speed to market we can significantly increase speed to market of new data sets the quality of the products we bring out because in the end with the algorithms we can achieve a higher quality and less errors going forward and we can think about new products that we could never bring to the market in the past certain data sets are so large that this is almost impossible to achieve any ingestion of that by humans but we can do that now in a fraction of the time by our algorithms and therefore we can now introduce products we could never think of in the past so in the end we always look at this as a larger revenue opportunity than an efficiency opportunity and again we are very pleased with the results so far we have been able to achieve bill warmington wells fargo analyst and then for the second and final question the 8 95 to 9 15 eps guidance for 2019 just wanted to ask about the level of share repurchases built into that number i know you announced the 500 million asr today i would assume that was built into that guidance but then if you assume about 550 million in dividends that would leave about 600 million in excess cash you re going to return is that 600 million built in as well as the 500 million asr ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah obviously we cannot give you a very precise answer on that question but let me give you some of the components we have provided guidance with respect to free cash flow generation for this year you know that we are committed to return at least 75 of that number you are aware of the dividend payout level we will do this year so it s not too difficult to assume what is the remainder in share repurchases that will be achieved if we are going to exceed that number or not is to be seen that depends very much on opportunities we will have this year we always look first in investments in organic opportunities because we think those are the most valuable as long as those make sense strategically and we can achieve the right returns inorganic opportunities if those are not available then we can always return more it than the 75 commitment that we have to the market so those are the components and i think that probably helps you bill with what you were looking for in terms of the question bill warmington wells fargo analyst all right thank you very much chip merritt senior vice president investor relations bill you asked a great final question but the operator saying we do have one more in the queue multiple speakers almost though out there peter analyst did it wrap or am i on douglas l peterson president and chief executive officer you re on peter peter analyst okay so much for bill warmington doug i was just interested in a quick thoughts you have on market share trends in the ratings business your revenue in the first part of year lagged a little bit about some of your competitors we don t know the second half numbers obviously relatively but wondering if that s a red flag at all for you maybe does it suggest that some of that cost cutting initiatives perhaps are hurting you a little bit from a share perspective just your thoughts on that thanks douglas l peterson president and chief executive officer yeah well first of all thank you peter that you ve been able to get on the call and when it comes to the ratings business when we look at the market share globally we continue to have a very strong market share there s a couple of areas where we see weaknesses one of them is in clos as you know there is a couple of other businesses like covered bonds that we are not really active in it all so if there s any place where we have seen areas that we will put some additional concentration on looking at our penetration it s all in the structured finance area peter analyst okay great thanks so much douglas l peterson president and chief executive officer you have a second question peter analyst i do actually on market intelligence the migration douglas l peterson president and chief executive officer inaudible bill s question peter analyst okay probably not as good as bill s he is way more intellectual than i in market intelligence the migration to enterprise contracts how far along are we in that has that had measurable implications in terms of profitability for the segment ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer peter the progress we have made over the last quarter is moving from 76 to 81 of cap iq customers moving to enterprisewide agreements so a nice 5 step up what we re seeing now is what we call the long tail we are now making those changes for a large group of smaller customers we re not planning to really call out those numbers anymore in the future will continue over the next period to drive this to 100 level over the next year or so but we will continue to make progress to ultimately have 100 of our customers on enterprisewide agreements so good progress and i think basically for us the last final number of customers we ll deal with over the remainder of this year peter analyst thank you douglas l peterson president and chief executive officer great well thanks everyone for joining the call this morning i m sure you can hear how enthusiastic we are about the company about our prospects for the future as you can see we have a lot of initiatives to look at our topline growth and our productivity we re committed to continue to manage to of course productivity but also very importantly to growth and you heard about some of our plans for our data operations for technology in particular around artificial intelligence and machine learning and the kind of impact that can have on us and also i want to thank all of you for the questions about china and our international operations we re very enthusiastic about the opportunity we have going forward in china and we ll keep bringing you updates on that as we go forward and on top of that i want to thank our great board of directors our management team our global workforce the commitment they have as well to power the markets in the future and the framework that we ll continue to show you new going forward as to how we re allocating capital where we re growing and again i want to thank all of you and we look forward to even more success in 2019 thank you very much operator that concludes this morning s call a pdf version of the presenter slides is available

approximately 2 0 to 3 0 in 2019 slight stronger than in 2018 due to stabilization in turkey after a significant decline in 2018 versus 2 1 in 2018 in china overall demand is expected to decline by between 0 5 to 1 5 in 2019 versus growth of 3 5 in 2018 as relatively stable demand from automotive and construction is offset by declining machinery output given these demand expectations as well as the expectation that operational disruptions both controllable and uncontrollable that negatively impacted 2018 shipments will not recur the group s steel shipments are expected to increase in 2019 vs 2018 market priced iron ore shipments for fy 2019 are expected to be broadly stable as compared to fy 2018 with increases in liberia and ammc to be offset by lower volume in mexico in part due to the end of life of volcan mine the company expects certain cash needs of the business including capex interest cash taxes pensions and certain other cash costs but excluding working capital changes to increase in 2019 to approximately 6 4 billion from 5 0 billion in 2018 capex is expected to increase by 1 0 billion to 4 3 billion versus 3 3 billion in fy 2018 including 0 4 billion carried over from 2018 the impact of ilva 0 4 billion and the continued investment in high returns projects in mexico and brazil interest is expected to be stable at 0 6 billion while cash taxes pensions and other cash costs are expected to increase by 0 4 billion to 1 5 billion primarily on account of certain cash tax settlements deferred from 2018 and non recurrence of certain gains on other accounts due to a smaller than anticipated release in the final quarter the group invested more in working capital than expected in 2018 4 4 billion versus guidance of 3 0 3 5 billion the group expects this additional investment to be released over the course of 2019 the extent of any further changes in working capital in 2019 will be dictated by market conditions particularly the price and volume environment in

reported diluted earnings per share forecast and the related adjusted diluted eps growth rate as a range as pmi has previously communicated its reduced risk product category performance is expected to play an increasingly important role in the company s future results however its growth trajectory is inherently more difficult to predict with the same level of accuracy compared to the performance of its cigarette category specifically the company anticipates periods of accelerated growth and periods of slower growth for reduced risk products the timing and drivers of which may be more difficult to predict compared to those for cigarettes therefore the company believes it is more prudent to now forecast its annual reported diluted earnings per share and the related currency neutral adjusted diluted eps growth rate by reference to a minimum threshold of expected performance at the start of the year and provide more details as the year unfolds 2019 full year forecast reported diluted earnings per share forecast to be at least 5 37 at prevailing exchange rates representing a projected increase of at least 5 7 versus reported diluted earnings per share of 5 08 in 2018 excluding an unfavorable currency impact at prevailing exchange rates of approximately 0 14 per share this forecast represents a projected increase of at least 8 0 versus adjusted diluted earnings per share of 5 10 in 2018 as detailed in the attached schedule 2 2019 full year forecast overview assumptions this forecast assumes a total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume decline for pmi of approximately 1 5 to 2 0 versus an estimated total international industry volume decline excluding china and the u s of approximately 2 5 to 3 0 and currency neutral net revenue growth of at least 5 0 which includes an adverse impact of approximately 0 6 points related to the move to highly inflationary accounting in argentina resulting in the treatment of the u s dollar as the functional currency of the company s argentinian affiliates described below this forecast further assumes an increase in full year reported operating income margin of at least one percentage point ex currency compared to 2018 operating cash flow of at least 10 0 billion subject to year end working capital requirements capital expenditures of approximately 1 1 billion an effective tax rate of approximately 23 and no share repurchases this forecast excludes the impact of any future acquisitions unanticipated asset impairment and exit cost charges future changes in currency exchange rates further developments related to the tax cuts and jobs act and any unusual events factors described in the forward looking and cautionary statements section of this release represent continuing risks to these projections pmi s 2019 2021 targets the company has communicated the following key targets related to the three year period 2019 to 2021 net revenue compound annual currency neutral growth of at least 5 adjusted diluted eps compound annual currency neutral growth of at least 8 and heated tobacco unit volume of 90 100 billion units by 2021 2018 fourth quarter and full year consolidated results philip morris international inc nyse pm today announced its 2018 fourth quarter and full year results we closed out a challenging year with a robust financial and strategic performance across the business excluding inventory movements largely associated with heated tobacco unit volume in japan our total volume variance was flat our best annual performance since 2012 underpinned by a near doubling of global in market sales of heated tobacco units we grew our international market share by 0 5 points to reach 28 4 and maintained a stable share of the cigarette category highlighting our ability to successfully manage our transition to reduced risk products said andré calantzopoulos chief executive officer our total net revenues were driven by an exceptional cigarette pricing variance of 7 6 and a strong contribution of more than 4 billion from our smoke free products despite the impact of the inventory adjustments our operating income was essentially flat excluding currency primarily reflecting increased investment behind our reduced risk product portfolio our robust currency neutral double digit adjusted eps performance was assisted by a lower effective tax rate and interest expense thanks to the tremendous efforts of our employees around the world and significant investments in portfolio development and organizational capabilities including a state of the art digital infrastructure to fuel our expansion we believe we have laid the foundation for an even better performance in 2019 the underlying strength of our combustible tobacco business remains intact and our reduced risk products are the catalysts to accelerate our business growth and secure the long term future of our company and the sustainability of our earnings and dividend growth conference call a conference call

analysis of the tax cuts and jobs act during 2018 and adjusted the 2017 provisional estimates to the final amounts based on its 2017 u s federal income tax return as filed accordingly in the fourth quarter 2018 pmi recorded in its income tax provision a charge of 31 million representing a current income tax charge of 185 million primarily due to an increase in its aggregate foreign cash position used to determine its final 2017 transition tax liability mostly offset by a deferred income tax benefit of 154 million primarily due to the recognition of deferred tax assets for net operating losses in the state of new york updates to the provisional estimates have been recorded in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 118 sab 118 pmi s 2019 full year diluted earnings per share forecast assumes a full year effective tax rate of approximately 23 reflecting the current analysis interpretation and clarifications of the scope and impact of the tax cuts and jobs act the act the act has significant complexity and pmi s final full year effective tax rate may differ from this assumption due to among other things additional guidance that may be issued by the u s treasury department and the internal revenue service related interpretations and clarifications of tax law in addition to repatriation cost differences and earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction u s gaap treatment of argentina as a highly inflationary economy following the categorization of argentina by the international practices task force of the center for audit quality as a country with a three year cumulative inflation rate greater than 100 the country is considered highly inflationary in accordance with u s gaap consequently pmi began to account for the operations of its argentinian affiliates as highly inflationary and to treat the u s dollar as the functional currency of the affiliates effective july 1 2018 the move to highly inflationary accounting in argentina reduced pmi s currency neutral net revenue growth by approximately 0 6 points in 2018 dividends during 2018 pmi increased its regular quarterly dividend by 6 5 from 1 07 to 1 14 representing an annualized rate of 4 56 per common share since its spin off in march 2008 pmi has increased its regular quarterly dividend by a compound annual growth rate of 9 5 or by 147 8 from the initial annualized rate of 1 84 per common share shipment

welcome to this week s market wrap podcast i m mike gleason coming up axel merk of merk investments joins me for a terrific conversation about gold the fed stocks and the dollar and find out why he believes investors will soon realize that it does matter again about where you put your money don t miss my interview with axel merk coming up after this week s market update gold and silver markets closed out the month of january on a high note as the federal reserve signaled it would back off on further rate hikes on wednesday fed policymakers voted unanimously to leave the central bank s benchmark interest rate unchanged fed chairman jerome powell cited recent weakness in economic growth forecasts left unspoken was the recent pressure directed at the fed from the white house and wall street the stock market plunge in late december set off multiple alarm bells and even activated the treasury department s plunge protection team the fed got the message and wall street seems to be back on good terms with monetary planners stocks posted one of their best january performances on record on wednesday president donald trump celebrated the dow jones hitting 25 000 however he didn t mention that the best performing sector this week is the gold miners the hui gold mining index popped over 7 higher into thursday s close gold itself is up a more modest 1 1 this week to bring spot prices to 1 318 per ounce silver trades at 16 01 an ounce after rising 1 4 on the week platinum is putting in a weekly gain of 1 3 to trade at 833 and finally palladium is flat for the week to come in at 1 373 per ounce now just slightly ahead of gold well gold is at the center of a geopolitical crisis now playing out in venezuela the venezuelan government is scrambling to get ahold of its own gold reserves after the united states imposed economic sanctions on the country and the united kingdom refused to release 1 2 billion in gold held on behalf of the maduro regime the united states officially recognizes juan guaidó as the acting president of venezuela even though he hasn t yet formed a government or removed maduro from power the socialist incumbent maduro still has the backing of china and of russia he reportedly sent 20 tons of gold to russia on a cargo jet shrouded in mystery whether maduro is trying to steal the country s gold or prevent it from being stolen isn t clear the long suffering venezuelan people have certainly had much of their wealth stolen through hyperinflation that is now approaching 2 million percent as of this recording the bank of england is still freezing venezuela s gold the unprecedented action is raising grave concerns about trust and counterparty risk in the global financial system we in the united states are busily going through a multi year program to see whether the russians had some role in the united states nothing remotely like what the united states and perhaps now britain are doing inside of venezuela richard wolff and you can be sure that every government in the world is going to rethink putting any money in london as they used to do when they re watching this political manipulation it makes a mockery of every international agreement that we know of about non interference in the internal affairs of other countries neo conservative hawks within the trump administration are bent on toppling venezuelan president nicolás maduro and aren t ruling out a military invasion secretary of state mike pompeo appointed elliott abrams one of the main architects of regime change in iraq to oversee regime change in venezuela the trump administration s hasty pivot towards regime change has drawn surprisingly little opposition from democrats perhaps that s because it is the deep state calling most of the shots on foreign policy and not president trump himself yet when it comes to domestic policy the hyper partisan environment in washington threatens to bring about another government shutdown or declaration of national emergency later this month one of the few genuine opportunities for bipartisanship would be an audit the fed bill in january representative thomas massie reintroduced the federal reserve transparency act with a democrat co sponsor this bill which would subject the board of governors of the federal reserve to a full audit has garnered a large congressional majority of support in the past it would probably win majorities in both the house and senate in spite of the existing partisan divide between them the problem has always been whether it can get through procedural hurdles put up by the fed s legislative shills house speaker nancy pelosi may simply refuse to put audit the fed up for a vote and in the senate where a filibuster proof majority is always hard to obtain chuck schumer is a master at blocking legislation on behalf of central bankers some progress on the sound money front continues to be made at the state level in january the arizona legislature took up the sound money stabilization act it would require that at least 10 of arizona s budget stabilization fund be held in precious metals in a secure depository in 2017 arizona removed all state income taxation on gold and silver last year saw the passage of the wyoming legal tender act it reaffirms gold and silver as constitutional money and removes all state taxation of them sound money advocates in wyoming and arizona legislatures are now pushing bills to provide that a small portion of state assets be held in the monetary metals it s still a major uphill battle to persuade states to protect themselves by holding gold and silver and a number anti gold naysayers in wyoming have already come out of the woodwork to oppose the idea even as they defend the state s devasting losses on investments in third world debt in west virginia legislators will have a chance to vote on the west virginia sound money act it would remove all taxation against gold and silver including sales and use tax property tax individual income tax and corporate income tax the sound money defense league and campaign for liberty are helping to garner public support for these and other sound money initiatives in states across the country well now without further delay let s get right to this week s exclusive interview mike gleason it is my privilege now to welcome axel merk president and chief investment officer of merk investment and author of the book sustainable wealth axel is a well known market commentator and money manager and is a highly sought after guest at financial conferences and on news outlets throughout the world and it s always great to have him back on with us axel it s always a pleasure and thanks for joining us again axel merk my pleasure mike gleason well axel we want to get your thoughts here as the market seemed to be in a bit of flux a few months ago pretty much everyone was looking at three or four rate hikes and for quantitative tightening the reduction of the central banks bond holdings to continue but then the higher rates and prospects of further tightening finally caught up to the equity markets we had three months of sustained selling in stocks late last year and suddenly fed officials are singing a very different tune today they are signaling a much more dovish policy however we ve seen a big rally in stocks it isn t clear what to expect since the equity market seems to be a major factor when it comes to fomc policy tell us what you re expecting here and before we get too much into fed policy moving forward which i ll ask you about in a moment tell us is the selling we saw in the fourth quarter all behind us or is this a bit of a sucker s rally in stocks axel merk sure well i think you re timing is right talking about the expectations we had the end of the third quarter last year about a lot of tightening and to talk market terms there were very substantial positions on short treasuries short bonds betting on higher rates and as investors then looked out towards this year 2019 they repositioned or you can say there was a short squeeze and you had a significant rally in treasuries suddenly this took on a life of its own and the media is never afraid of putting a story into market a move and say oh my god the world is falling apart and sure enough the scare made it all the way to the fed and our mr powell who was walking in his dark room and said alright alright the market once had it a certain way and now it doesn t and then the moment that switched the market then started on rallying a few things here the u s consumer is doing just fine maybe they re going to fall off a cliff we don t see that yet inflation impressions are increasing no matter what everybody is telling you wages are going up not just for the c o level but all the way down the corporate ladder yes there are issues in the rest of the world and yes we are late in the economic cycle and so what all of that means is that higher rates to me automatically translates to more volatility so the high volatility is just natural obviously it may have been exasperated you can blame the algos whatever you want but yes higher volatility is with us historically we don t have a bear market most of the time anyway unless there is a recession and i just said i don t think the recession is imminent now that doesn t mean there isn t a risk of one that doesn t mean volatility isn t high it doesn t mean investments aren t going to diversify but certainly long in the tooth on this expansion and so everybody may well be prudent to kind of trim things back on their risk exposure and that s exactly what s been happening but for the time being i do think this economic cycle is not over yet we are late in it i also happen to think i mentioned inflationary prices the fed is not done tightening we ve gone overboard on that and i think we will likely see two more rate hikes later this year so this back and forth is likely going to continue and it s going to be a bit of a rollercoaster because also i mentioned higher wages that obviously hits corporate earnings corporate america is exposed internationally so yes they ll have some headwinds but in the meantime the consumer seems to be spending happily maybe not on housing but on many other things mike gleason as we re talking here on wednesday afternoon fed chair powell just came out with his statement tell us what you took from that sounds like you re still expecting that we are going to see a couple more rate hikes this year talk about fed policy a bit more axel merk well yeah that was my view and of course my view doesn t matter it matters what mr powell thinks because he is the one who calls the shots right it s not me i just have my thoughts here obviously powell has backpedaled quite substantially and they re two things there is the rate path and then there s this wonderful thing called quantitative tightening you refer to and maybe let s talk about that first remember when yellen talked about paint drying on a wall when they started on this journey basically they decided the fed balance sheet is too large they want to get down but that s about all they decided they didn t make up their mind of where that journey is going to take them in my view they thought that they had until the end of this year or so before they can actually decide how low they want to take the balance sheet so sure enough the market threw a tantrum and powell said okay i get it we got to do something and at the fomc meeting he kind of said we still don t have a clue he didn t use those words but yeah we might consider doing something and that really shows that the fed doesn t have a plan with quantitative tightening they re in so called uncharted territory and there s no academic framework no past of framework other than listening to the markets and that s really dangerous because it s the fed that s supposed to set what the risk free asset is the regulatory risk free asset treasuries and so when the fed just says hey let the market dictate that it creates an interesting unstable back and forth i m not suggesting that wouldn t be better if he market did everything but with the fed in there with a bazooka that kind of creates odd dynamics on the other side of it with regard to raise remember we are still only just about maybe in neutral yet unemployment has been going down and wage prices have been going up at some point that s not going to work anymore and i think that ll have to take the foot further off the accelerator i happen to think that s still on there even though we ve had hiccups in the emerging markets where it matters accessibility to loans financial conditions are just fine in the u s and the whole point of hiking is to tighten financial conditions that hasn t happened unless you re in emerging markets unless you re in some bad areas or from a junk area a little bit but for mainstream america financial conditions have not tightened and that s why i think they will change their view later this year possibly as early as this summer and if you just take what the fed said that s part of what markets rallied that s why metals rallied is because rate hikes are off the table for now and god speed for you people are thinking maybe the economy is going to ease up some point mike gleason yeah happy days are here again i guess at least in the short term one of the reasons it s great to have you on is that we know you re always keeping a close eye on international markets as well there s a lot going on in both europe and china the chinese economy appears to be slowing and any serious recession there will have big impacts for all of us and the political turmoil in europe may also drive markets what do you see as the biggest developing story internationally that will impact investors her in the u s axel axel merk the biggest story may not always be what the biggest impact is you rightfully mentioned china first china is just so much bigger so what happens in china matters china clearly has had a slowdown they have all kinds of incentives along the way to try to boost that they re trying not to actually lower rates so they re actually lowering most of the reserve requirements and have tax cuts they don t like to lower rates because they don t like to mess with the exchange rates too much they like to keep that reasonably stable whatever that means these days with the yuan and so there is some slowing down if they quote unquote panic it means they ll open the floodgates of stimulus but for the time being they re reasonably confident that the stimulus will work its way through the quote unquote bigger story may well be brexit even powell referred to it keep in mind the good old great empire is about less than 3 of world gdp these days so yes brexit matters but it doesn t matter as much as some other things out there similarly italy that was the sideshow mostly a show and sure there are going to be elections in the european union and sure the populists are going to get more votes but none of that really changes the global dynamics obviously what does happen on global scale are the trade discussions the general perception is there are solutions they re not going to happen there tomorrow and if you listen to draghi the head of the european central bank he says oh we downgraded our outlook but it s not that we think that we going to be negative outcomes to these many risk scenarios that s what draghi said he actually thinks there s going to be positive outcomes to most of them but because of the uncertainty the sentiment has been impacted so that s dragging on things and obviously the sentiment is impacted and that s the same danger with the u s consumer of course is that that might actually then induce slower growth all these risks that are out there they re solvable brexit most people believe we re not going to haunt brexit to kick the can down the road heard that term before that s what strong leaders are best at it seems the world will be around tomorrow in the meantime american consumers are happily spending mike gleason let s get your thoughts on what all of this might mean for precious metals can you give us a quick summary of what you re expecting in the metals market as we move through the year axel merk yes sure on gold which is kind of the easiest because of the least industrial influence that s difficult enough to prognosticate about you ve got these two forces on the one end i see rising inflationary pressures that s a positive i see at some point rates are going to go down as a discounting mechanism the market seems to be giving a boost here to precious metals now with that said i do think rates will move higher later this year the main buyer in gold that i see these days is one that buys for diversification when you have higher volatility cash flow gets discounted more that means the risk assets stock market in particular is under pressure potentially but gold historically does well when the stock market doesn t do well there are exceptions like the early 80 s bear market and that s when real interest rates went up to through the roof but it is for diversification because gold is really one of the easiest diversifiers i say easier rather than best necessarily because it has the zero correlation to stocks and it s far easier to do than some long short strategy that gives you an uncorrelated return otherwise if you go to other metals and other commodities of course the dynamics are far more complex that s why i really try to stick to gold especially on a brief analysis mike gleason my guest last week talked about how gold is hitting all time highs in many different currencies talk about the currency side of things the dollar what you re expecting there because obviously gold is trading in reverse correlation to the dollar in many situations not always but in many situations give us your thoughts there axel merk well on the day we re talking the dollar index is plunging other currencies are rising versus the dollar because of this very dovish commentary and statement by the fed and the question really is and the world was divided on that and that s great because we make the market where s it going to be heading from here we ve had years of dollar going up the u s was the cleanest of the dirty shirts and what not and it increasingly appears that the market is looking forward to the next easing cycle whereas the other parts of the world and i include the eurozone here they re still thinking we re on the hiking cycle we have sweden who also negative rates for example other than the eurozone they hiked rates draghi is retiring at the end of this year out of the ecb i happen to think that as both yellen and bernanke were more hawkish towards the end of their terms so will draghi be and draghi is actually quite positive in a medium term the successor to draghi cannot be as dovish in my view as draghi is and then i happen to think the glass is half full on some of these inflation metrics on that note by the way we have low oil prices at the end of last year if oil prices are not depressed any of this year the year over year effects will show quite significant headline inflation in the eurozone by the way headline inflation is the mandate in the u s it s core inflation but if you look at longer term inflation expectations they happen to be very correlated to the price of oil it may not make much sense because obviously in the long run the price of oil of today doesn t really matter but as those changes are filtering through i think inflation expectations will rise wage prices will lead to higher wages inflation expectations so all of that will get other leaders around also to be a tad more hawkish and it appears to be that is in favor of world currencies versus the dollar that just had such a great ride for several years and so it appears to me that this long bull run in the dollar might be over mike gleason well as we begin to wrap up her axel give us any final thoughts that you may have for us today or maybe touch on anything else that you may be focusing on that perhaps we didn t get to already and then ultimately what kind of year do you envision 2019 is going to be for investors expand on any or all of that as we begin to close please axel merk well the short of it is higher volatility higher rates warrant higher volatility and at the risk if using a technical term that means higher dispersion of risk let me expand on that just briefly when you have quantitative easing the perceived risk was taken out of the market so you invested in junk barns and it was quote unquote not risky because the fed took care of it now fear is back and the good news of that is that it matters where you put your money that means active management will come back that means the making a choice is actually going to prove you re right or wrong whereas before you just bought the index and everything was great that doesn t mean that suddenly all the money will go back to active managers i think that s going to be a long process but i would not be surprised of this year active managers are going to significantly outperform the industry simply because of greater opportunities there with the greater volatility reference the sharks but i just look at interest rates because when interest rates are higher there will be more opportunities i think for the active manager mike gleason well we ll leave it there thanks as always axel we certainly appreciate your getting your very studied insights and greatly appreciate your time coming on with us once again now before we let you go like we always do please tell folks a little bit more about you and your firm and then also how they can follow you more closely axel merk sure come to merkinvestments com we publish research charts on the fed on all kinds of things we do have some investment products including a gold product look around on our site we do a lot of work on currencies if you want to get my up to date commentaries feel free to follow me on twitter or linkedin or whatever your favorite social media site is we re there to help and we can even devise some specialized strategies to take a position on interest rates if that s something somebody s interested in we do a great deal of things also we got a mandate the other day to manage a precious mining fund and that s still subject to shareholder approval but if and when so we ll be talking a lot more about the specific mining companies down the road as well mike gleason yeah i think many folks here would be interested in that well excellent axel thanks so much for your time we look forward to checking back with you before we re long and dissecting the state of the markets again with you soon until then take care and enjoy your weekend thanks for joining us axel merk my pleasure take care mike gleason

i m going to put you at the steering wheel of the u s economy you will have opportunity to fix the financial mess the u s economy is in imagine for a moment you are the us secretary of the treasury or some all powerful overseer of us federal government taxation and spending which problem should you fix first a national debt b unemployment c taxation d expansion of government benefits to equalize income e provide equal access to medical care for everybody for reference you have 3 2 trillion in collected taxes to play with and you must make a 523 billion interest payment on 16 trillion in loans the u s has made the national debt and also by law cut 1 trillion of checks for social security and another 1 trillion for medicare medicaid and then come up with 673 billion for the military leaving you just 4 billion to fund all the other branches of government plus provide food stamps for 37 million people the u s budget is 4 193 trillion and the federal government says it borrows 864 billion to come up with the difference between what it collects in taxes 3 2 trillion and its budgetary spending list 4 193 trillion but the u s actually spends 6 048 trillion annually see bottom left corner of the u s debt clock presented below and actually just prints another 2 trillion of electronic money into existence to make up the difference and support the lifestyle americans have grown accustomed to today the public hears various calls for medicare for all or or tax the rich can a modern society just create endless money into existence in essence to give itself a pay increase the answer is yes but not without adverse financial consequences more worrisome is that public opinion polls show a majority of americans want these reforms one pundit cites the fact the u s had a 91 92 tax rate on the richest americans from 1951 to 1963 and the country didn t go to hell however the baby boomers were only beginning to graduate from high school then medicare was enacted in 1965 and covered 19 million retired citizens versus 59 million today and another 75 million covered by medicaid retirees received social security checks amounting to 14 2 billion 1963 compared to 1 trillion covering 43 million americans in 2018 forward projections estimate social security will have to cut checks for 79 million americans by the year 2035 in the early years of social security there were surpluses that should have been invested to yield a return when baby boomers retired but those surplus funds were loaned to the federal government to finance increased deficit spending then there is the reality that in the midst of a financial mess created by loose lending practices that the federal reserve bank literally gave free money to lenders in the 2008 banking crisis increasing the money supply by 4 trillion and essentially redistributed wealth in society to the financial classes we might call it welfare for bankers so the government does hand out endless free money just to a limited group in society the people at the top and bottom income levels are being propped and a group of 122 million tax payers bear the burden for the remaining 206 million citizens that are stuck in the middle i m going to use the u s debt clock for evaluation purposes as it presents many different economic factors on a single printed page or screen view you should study the u s debt clock and become familiar with it for example the u s debt clock notes america lost 5 million manufacturing jobs in the period 2000 2008 and notes the number of unemployed is more like 12 million rather than the official 6 million i ve consulted with the good offices of economist john williams of shadowstats com to guide me through the morass of federal government data some which is misleading or even fake examples target rate of inflation published by the federal reserve bank is 2 but actual rate is 6 higher the official unemployment rate is 4 is actually above 20 if you can t produce a large enough image of the u s debt clock re creation on your computer monitor then simply go to usdebtclock org to view real time data about the u s economy click to enlarge my notes to the side of the us debt clock may help you understand the bigger picture of the economy similar to the same broad view the u s treasury secretary sees i point to three trigger points that could cause the u s economy to crash loss of confidence in the us dollar not by american citizens but by foreign bankers some say the day when consumers lose faith in the u s dollar is the day the economy will fail but in september 15 of 2008 when lehmann brothers investment bank fell the public had faith in the banking system this means events that precipitated the collapse were being withheld from public view an investment bank didn t create a run on the banks because it was for investors not public depositors the public is not likely to be aware of the dire financial condition of the federal government otherwise bank runs might be common it is more likely that foreign bankers would lose faith in the u s dollar and could trigger a collapse of the u s economy when the u s needs more money to fund government programs it often borrows that money from foreign countries this is how the u s funds various provisions that exceed what is collected in taxes it is possible that foreign countries that buy up our debt in exchange for a low rate of interest may not respond to auctions to buy these debt instruments ious the u s debt clock says the u s needed to borrow 864 billion in 2018 see the upper left quadrant of the u s debt clock last november 2018 foreign investors began taking a pass on unprecedented debt securities the u s keeps issuing china is not buying lending this debt because of its ongoing trade currency war with the u s japan is selling u s ious because of the strong u s dollar only in a relative sense the euro and chinese yuan are crashing then the u s has to start searching for u s buyers rather than foreign buyers of debt the interest offered on these u s treasury notes may need to rise to attract buyers record amounts of debt projected to exceed 1 trillion are being sold at these debt auctions now the number of bids received to buy up u s bonds are at an all time low selling off of u s treasury notes ious at a discount looking at the us debt clock you will see 6 trillion the us owes to foreign countries lower left quadrant if those countries feel they will never be paid back they may elect to sell off their debt notes at a loss let s say 30 discount that would render the u s dollar less valuable in international trade the cost of imported goods would rise commensurately that type of event would severely affect the u s economy you don t think this will never happen china recently threatened to sell off its u s debt notes at a loss in its trade war with the u s interest on national debt exceeds that of social security medicare etc another trigger point is the interest the u s pays on its national debt upper left quadrant of u s debt clock to be accurate the accumulated debt burden of the u s is published at 21 trillion upper left quadrant u s debt clock economist john williams points us to a more accurate figure directly from the u s treasury dept see below more accurately the u s national debt less what it owes to itself is 16 trillion the u s debt clock states 347 billion is paid annually in interest on this debt but the u s treasury dept provides more accurate figures i ve jotted down outside the left border of the debt clock interest on the national debt exceeds 523 billion and is headed to 915 billion by the year 2028 as interest on the national debt rises there is less money to pay for other pressing and legally required line items like medicare and social security that are partially paid for out of the general fund these days outside of the fica payroll deductions that fill the social security and medicare trust funds every two weeks there is nothing but ious u s treasury bills backed by nothing more than the full faith and credit of the united states so now you understand how precarious the u s economy is it is already overspending and burdened with so much debt that campaigns for a minimum income or medicare for all seem to be totally out of touch with reality the relief valve stop borrowing and paying interest but there is a relief valve as economist martin armstrong hints armstrong has consulted with various sovereign nations so he is no small fry economist armstrong writes from armstrong economics blog economics posted jan 30 2019 by martin armstrong question it seems the left wing progressives in the us house opponents of pelosi have adopted the money market theory of prof stephanie kelton of u of mo kansas city to justify unlimited deficit spending of the us govt ok as the govt can finance its deficits by unlimited currency printing would you please comment mp answer actually there would be no issue if the government simply created money to fund its normal expenditure historically that will produce very modest inflation the crisis is when you borrow to fund that deficit spending in 2019 interest expenditures may now exceed the cost of defense it is far cheaper to create the money needed than borrow and keep rolling the deficits forever then the cumulative interest keeps rising and crowds out all other expenditures this is what is happening the process underway creates deflation not inflation because the governments keep raising taxes to fund the deficits and that reduces the disposable income this is why we see riots in france yes people earn more but they are being left with an eroding disposable income base governments need to fund themselves so they raise taxes but the interest expenditures keep rising and consume all other areas of spending it becomes a self defeating process that leads to the crash and burn the problem is politicians choose to cut bankers into loans to burden the u s with unbearable interest payments rather than just printing money directly from the u s treasury department to meet its obligations essentially the federal government private labels paper money being issued as a federal reserve note when it is actually printed by the us treasury department the federal reserve buys its paper money for the cost of printing 5 5 cents for a 1 bill 14 2 cents for a 100 bill and then lends it out to commercial banks interest in the 2008 banking lending crisis the federal reserve added 4 trillion to the u s money supply by electronically crediting its member banks by that much equivalent to printing 40 billion 100 bills that push button money cost the fed nothing to create inconceivably the federal reserve now pays banks reverse interest to keep money they were given freely to rebalance their accounting books from being lent out which would increase the money supply with a resultant increase in inflation banks were given free money interest to boot the problem was solved but only briefly implemented americans are never taught where money comes from the u s has a debt based monetary system here is how it works the u s buys cars from japan japan then holds u s dollars the u s needs that money back in order to continue to buy cars from japan so japan sends the money back in exchange for an iou interest u s treasury note so when you look at a u s ten dollar bill in essence it is a promise to pay japan 10 interest a ten dollar bill should have a minus sign in front of it it is debt based money critics say fiat currency isn t worth the paper it is printed on it is worse than that it is a debt in the amount printed on the note u s citizens are buying stuff with ious not real money this is what president john f kennedy said in 1963 if the u s keeps dispensing money through a distributor the federal reserve banks it would drive the country into insolvency so kennedy signed executive order 11110 to strip the federal reserve of its power to loan money to the u s government at interest an order that has never been repealed united states note debt free money the u s treasury department issued u s notes in 2 and 5 denominations as interest free and debt free currency backed by silver reserves in the u s treasury around 4 billion of these u s notes were distributed into circulation and quietly withdrawn after kennedy was assassinated on nov 22 1963 silver backed money would have been preferred over the fiat paper money the federal reserve distributes since 1963 the u s would have saved more in interest payments than the entire current accumulated national debt had it heeded executive order 11110 president holds wild card the president of the united states holds a wild card the u s has physical assets that are valued at 150 trillion u s debt clock bottom middle that the general accounting office now called the government accountability office now says are worth 200 trillion donald trump is the first president to say he wants to sell off a portion of those assets and erase the national debt entirely the u s would then become a creditor nation the bankers would finally be cut out of their scheme to charge the federal government interest on its own money excuse me i must abruptly cease writing and shop for a bullet proof vest now
joseph v micallef is a best selling military history and world affairs author and keynote speaker follow him on twitter josephvmicallef roughly 12 weeks ago french citizens in paris took to the streets to protest the imposition of sharp new taxes on fuel the protesters wore yellow plastic vests similar to the kind traffic coordinators or construction workers often wear in france such vests are mandatory equipment in cars and must be worn by drivers if they are forced to stop because of a roadside emergency the movement was quickly dubbed the yellow vest movement over the month of december it grew to encompass several hundred thousand protesters spread to france s major cities and resulted in widespread damage and acts of vandalism along paris s premier address the avenue des champs élysées it also found an echo among supporters across some two dozen countries as far flung as canada australia iraq pakistan and taiwan even russia witnessed a demonstration by muscovites wearing yellow vests in protest of proposed parking fee hikes after first ignoring the yellow vest movement french president emmanuel macron abruptly switched course first suspending the proposed increase in gas taxes and then freezing fuel and auto taxes for six months in addition macron promised an increase in the minimum wage eliminated taxes on overtime and end of year bonuses and pressured large french companies to issue end of year bonuses to take pressure off the government the protesters described themselves as working class french men and women many of whom earned monthly salaries of 2 000 euros 2 300 or less the movement was not associated with any political party either from the left or the right and caught france s cultural and political elites by surprise to date the yellow vest movement has issued 42 demands ranging from the elimination of traffic control cameras and a decrease in fuel and auto taxes to improved government services in rural areas and greater government accountability and transparency about two thirds of the policies advocated by the yellow vest movement were associated with positions taken by france s radical leftist parties while the balance was associated with positions taken by marine le pen s far right national rally according to an opinion poll published by the elabe institute 36 percent of the yellow vest participants voted for marine le pen in the may 2017 presidential election while 28 percent voted for far left socialist candidate jean luc mélenchon without question support for the yellow vests cuts across the spectrum of french politics is the yellow vest movement just another example of the social unrest that has periodically gripped france or does it have far ranging implications for the rest of the world in particular what are the strategic implications of the yellow vest movement for the u s the yellow vests and globalism globalism has been a feature of the international economic system since the end of world war ii it took a dramatic leap forward over the last half century however as china and india the two most populous countries in the world opened themselves up to international trade and the capitalist economic system the digital revolution the emergence of global supply and distribution systems from containers to overnight shipping and unfettered capital flows kicked globalism into high gear the immediate consequences of globalism were a vastly expanded global economy the emergence of a burgeoning middle class in china india and elsewhere in emerging economies drove a growing appetite for western consumer goods and services from johnnie walker scotch whisky to nike shoes to starbucks accelerating economic growth and rising standards of living around the world fueled demand from raw materials from soybeans to petroleum while rapidly modernizing economies fueled demand for sophisticated capital goods from caterpillar earth movers to boeing passenger jets the globalism revolution lifted hundreds of millions of people above the poverty line and created a new vibrant middle class from india and china to brazil mexico and south africa it did so however by transferring millions of what used to be called working class jobs from the industrial economies of europe and north america to low wage economies around the world it s likely that ever increasing levels of factory automation would eventually have eliminated many of these jobs anyway under globalism however the process was significantly speeded up one of the consequences of that change was an increasing disconnect between the world s great urban centers and the rural areas that surround them cities like london paris new york and san francisco thrived in the new globalist economy even as their peripheries suffered job losses depopulation and disinvestment indeed globalism and relentless urbanization became mirror images of the same coin the world s great cities continued to grow becoming the engines of technological innovation and economic growth those cities had more in common with each other than they did with their stagnating peripheries relentless urbanization steadily drove up the value of urban real estate block by block cities became increasingly gentrified driving up not just the cost of real estate but the cost of essential services as well that process made multimillionaires of many urban home owners while making it impossible for many working class inhabitants to live in those cities one of the primary complaints of the yellow vest movement is that its members cannot afford to live in france s major cities and that the smaller towns and cities they can afford to live in are economic backwaters with no jobs the financial crisis of 2008 was in many ways the apex of globalism and its associated economic policies what was significant about the 2008 economic crisis was that it reverberated around the world creating a worldwide economic downturn across the globe from beijing to washington to brussels governments responded to the economic downturn by massively hiking spending and accepting unprecedented levels of public debt by all accounts the world s economy has bounced back nicely since the economic crisis of 2008 financial markets in many countries including the u s are at near record levels many urban real estate markets in the world s major cities have recovered to the pre 2008 levels in the u s the unemployment rate is at multi decade low levels and for the first time in half a century middle class incomes have started to trend upward nonetheless since 2010 there has been a growing anti globalist protest movement around the world that movement has often expressed itself as a reassertion of national sovereignty against global institutions and the elites that run them in the u s such sentiments are what propelled donald trump s america first campaign and his subsequent election victory in the 2016 presidential elections it s what drove the brexit movement in great britain and what has fueled anti eu brussels protests from italy to poland the strategic consequences of anti globalism globalist economic policies lead to higher levels of economic growth and wealth creation but they do so at the expense of marginalizing a significant segment of western societies in the past western governments sought to address this worker obsolescence by offering extended safety nets of unemployment insurance retraining programs and financial assistance to displaced workers while such policies helped ameliorate the immediate consequences of industrial job losses it did not solve the long term social consequences of such policies globalism isn t going to go away even at the heights of the great depression there was a significant amount of international trade that still occurred regardless of the tariff barriers that were imposed but as the international monetary fund has continued to warn anti globalism protectionist policies will reduce overall rates of economic growth worldwide such reductions would occur at a time when most of the world s major economies are already experiencing lower growth and at a time when many governments around the world are experiencing large deficits and unprecedented levels of public indebtedness in the u s the federal government is already on track to experience trillion dollar yearly deficits at a time of larger than average economic growth and historically low unemployment an economic contraction a foregone conclusion at some point in the next several years will raise serious doubts about the nation s ability to continue to fund trillion dollar plus public deficits or 700 billion dollar defense budgets likewise much of the eu is experiencing low to stagnant economic growth italy is officially in a recession german retailers just experienced their worst fourth quarter in a decade with a significant year over year decline in retail sales without long term structural reforms designed to spread european economic growth more evenly across the continent it is hard to see how the eu and more importantly the euro its common currency can survive while the eu represents a formidable economic and technological competitor to the u s it is also a critical political partner and defense ally political disarray in europe of which the yellow vests are simply one manifestation has a direct consequence on nato and on the defense organization s spending for defense and security such disarray also gives the kremlin more opportunities to foster political dissension and chaos within the eu and nato lower levels of economic growth also have a direct bearing on the economic prosperity of major commodity producers such as brazil canada and australia more importantly they have a direct bearing on the long term prices of petroleum products the u s is now the world s largest producer of petroleum with an output greater than the combined output of saudi arabia and russia the next two largest producers america s petroleum exports are now up to 2 million barrels a day roughly the equivalent of pre sanction iran it is midland texas rather than riyadh that now determines long term petroleum prices for washington oil prices are a double edged sword lower oil prices are the equivalent of a tax cut for many americans and a boost to consumer spending on the other hand lower oil prices negatively impact a key american industrial sector internationally low oil prices cripple the russian economy a consequence that paradoxically both limits and encourages russian adventurism more importantly low oil prices are a major factor of potential political instability in the middle east economic competition between china and the u s is just one aspect of a broader geopolitical and military competition between the two countries the u s china economic and trade relationship is at the heart of the globalist economy while the trump administration has focused on the u s china trade balance and claims that chinese companies routinely steal american intellectual property the issues between washington and beijing go beyond economic ones lower global growth will drive economic weakness in china and will go hand in hand with beijing s renewed emphasis on chinese nationalist aspirations in the south china sea and elsewhere in the indo pacific region beijing often responds to slowdowns in china s economy by ratcheting up nationalist and especially anti japanese and anti american sentiments such policies will further strain beijing s relationship with washington and with its immediate neighbors it is likely to manifest itself as a more bellicose chinese foreign and military policy the yellow vest movement has been described as the proverbial canary in the coal mine the western equivalent of the arab spring it is simply the most recent evidence that the globalist economic system that has developed since the end of world war ii and which sharply accelerated from the 1980s on is in need of long term structural reforms that doesn t mean that globalism will end but it does mean that economic policies whose inadvertent consequences decimate the working class in europe and north america are simply not sustainable over the long term the consequences of reforming the current globalist system will likely lead to a reduction in overall economic growth at a time when western governments are already operating under unprecedented deficits and levels of public debt that leave them ill equipped to deal with an extended period of economic weakness the consequences of that weakness on u s security and america s global posture is unavoidable so yes what happens on the streets of paris matters to america the

president donald trump delivered his second state of the union address on tuesday where he re enforced his immigration agenda slammed ridiculous partisan investigations and announced he would meet with north korea s kim jong un for a second time later this month nbc news fact checked his state of the union address as it happened claim trump s administration has created 600 000 manufacturing jobs trump s figure is close the u s has added 454 000 manufacturing jobs since trump took office in january 2017 some of the biggest gains in 20 years according to jobs data trump s numbers mark an acceleration of a trend that began in 2010 under president barack obama still after decades of automation and change to the industry in the u s manufacturing is a much smaller part of the country s economy than it was decades ago while 19 5 million people were employed in the manufacturing industry in 1979 there were 12 8 million americans in the industry in late 2018 claim trump says he launched an unprecedented economic boom in just over two years since the election we have launched an unprecedented economic boom a boom that has rarely been seen before trump said trump took office amid a booming economy and he s been taking credit for it since day one but there s no evidence he created this boom some economists argue he boosted growth with tax cuts turbocharging an already booming economy while others argue the government shutdown tariffs and trade war have slowed growth most can agree however that trump s economy something he touts among his biggest successes has been built upon the upward trajectory that began under obama and while america s economy is strong it has grown at a faster rate in earlier years in 1983 for example the nation s annual gdp was 7 9 percent in the second quarter of 2018 the gdp was 4 2 percent claim trump says unemployment is at its lowest rate in half a century trump s figure is accurate though it s notably a continuation of a strong growth trend begun after the recession ended in 2010 when unemployment ticked down to 3 7 percent in september 2018 that indeed marked the lowest jobless rate since december 1969 per the bureau of labor statistics but the jobless rate has since ticked back up to 4 0 in january which is above the 3 8 percent achieved in the clinton administration in april 2000 it s certainly true that the economy is in a much improved place now than it was a decade ago joblessness has steadily declined since the end of the economic recession in 2010 but it s a fuzzier picture when it comes to whether trump deserves credit for the low unemployment rate or whether he has continued a trend started by the obama administration in the 24 months since trump has been in office total non farm employment has grown by nearly 4 9 million over the same period of time 24 months at the end of obama s tenure total non farm employment grew by about 5 1 million claim trump boasts of energy revolution says u s is now no 1 producer of oil and natural gas trump said tuesday night that we have unleashed a revolution in american energy the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world while it s true that u s is the leading producer of both oil and gas in the world the president is claiming undue credit that s been the case since the middle of the obama administration the u s energy information administration found that in 2017 the united states produced the most petroleum and dry natural gas of any country in the world but that s not a recent phenomenon either the u s has topped the production charts in both categories since 2013 for petroleum and 2011 for natural gas claim trump says nothing can compete with america s economy trump said tuesday night that there s nothing anywhere in the world that can compete with america before later saying the u s is experiencing an economic miracle while the u s economy has been strong overall it s not the fastest growing economy in the world and some argue that it s not actually the biggest either according to the international monetary fund s most recent estimates in its world economic outlook india is projected to have the highest rate of economic growth among major economies in 2019 and 2020 at somewhere around 7 5 to 7 7 percent gdp growth rate china is projected around 6 2 percent growth in 2019 and 2020 the united states meanwhile clocks in at just a 2 5 percent rate in 2019 and 1 8 percent in 2020 the united states does have the highest nominal gdp of any country in the world per the imf that measure does not take into account cost of living in various countries so many economists use also a measure called purchasing power parity which adjusts gross domestic product for lower consumer prices and standards of living using that measure china surpassed the united states as the biggest economy in the world back in 2014 claim trump takes credit for criminal justice reform both parties united for criminal justice reform they said it couldn t be done trump said tuesday night trump is correct that he signed the first major overhaul of prison sentencing in decades that legislation the first step act includes provisions for sentencing reform such as shortening some mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenses and addressing racial disparities in the federal prison system it s also true that lawmakers tried and failed to pass a similar package of reforms during obama s second term but it was republicans who blocked that bill despite general bipartisan support for the measure that consensus legislation was introduced by sen chuck grassley r iowa and sen dick durbin d ill in 2015 it had the support of then speaker of the house paul ryan the koch brothers and president barack obama but senate majority leader mitch mcconnell was reluctant to bring the issue up for a vote during the tumultuous 2016 election and a handful of gop lawmakers including sens tom cotton of arkansas and jeff sessions of alabama led the charge to argue that the bill would result in the release of violent criminals the bill never saw a vote during obama s presidency as a result in 2018 however trump with significant lobbying from his son in law jared kushner backed the bill prompting mcconnell to agree to bring the bill to the floor some advocates while still supportive of the effort argued that it does not go far enough for starters the bill only addresses the federal prison population which only makes up about 12 percent of incarcerated individuals in the u s claim trump says wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders trump underscored his pitch to address illegal immigration by claiming that wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards many democrats have called for reforming immigration enforcement in particular some have called for abolishing and rethinking immigration and customs enforcement but no prominent lawmakers have pushed for open borders democratic leaders amid the recent government spending fight that led to the longest shutdown in u s history consistently rejected trump s wall while still advocating for border security in general we all agree we need to secure our borders while honoring our values we can build the infrastructure and roads at our ports of entry we can install new technology to scan cars and trucks for drugs coming into our nation we can hire the personnel we need to facilitate trade and immigration at the border we can fund more innovation to detect unauthorized crossings house speaker nancy pelosi d calif said in january and while a meme shared by conservatives on social media alleged there is a wall around pelosi s california home and the president has asserted there is a wall around former president barack obama s washington home there is no wall encircling either the front of the obamas home is easily visible in photos and the walled off house pictured in the meme is not actually pelosi s politifact reported rating the claim pants on fire according to the washington post the obamas did add fencing and a guard booth former presidents have secret service protection for life claim trump says the state of the southern border is lawless threatening the security of all americans america s immigration system is broken that s something experts advocates and politicians across the spectrum can agree on but there s little evidence the southern border is experiencing a new state of emergency violence isn t spilling over the border and terrorists aren t being caught in droves trying to cross it illegal drugs largely come through legal ports of entry not unguarded parts of the border according to border authorities illegal border crossings have been dropping for years and while border apprehensions have risen in recent months they are still markedly lower than they were twenty years ago customs and border protection data shows and though trump has focused on the border illegal immigration in the u s is being driven by another factor people who overstay their visas more than 701 900 people overstayed their visas during fiscal year 2017 according to the department of homeland security people who overstay their visas usually enter the country through an airport not from the border claim trump says democrats voted for border barriers in the past this is true but trump dismissed the wall legislation democrats supported as inadequate dozens of democrats including senate minority leader chuck schumer of new york did vote for the secure fence act of 2006 which authorized building a fence along about 700 miles of the border between the united states and mexico trump derided that fencing in 2016 as such a little wall such a nothing wall claim we re taking in billions off chinese goods with tariffs trump vowed to right calamitous trade policies and said he is making it clear to china the theft of american jobs and wealth has come to an end he continued therefore we recently imposed tariffs on 250 billion of chinese goods and now our treasury is receiving billions of dollars the president portrays this as an american victory over foreign companies and while the u s government is taking in billions of dollars in tariffs it s not the chinese who are paying the bulk of these it s american consumers experts told nbc news in december that trump was misunderstanding tariffs the fee charged on foreign goods when they are imported american consumers typically end up footing the bill for those taxes not foreign companies while one expert said there is some evidence that chinese corporations may be reducing prices to absorb a fraction of the tariffs to stay more competitive in american markets consumers are expected to absorb the bulk of the fee claim san diego proves walls work to combat illegal immigration trump says when trump argues that the united states needs a wall along the southern border he likes to point to san diego s success san diego used to have the most illegal border crossing in the country trump said tuesday night in response a strong security wall was put in place this powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings the militarized border touching the communities of imperial beach san ysidro and otay mesa contributed to a 75 percent decline in crossings in the years immediately after fencing was installed in the 1990s according to u s customs and border protection data there double and triple barriers fortify the westernmost stretch of the nearly 2 000 mile u s mexico border as u s border patrol agents drive suvs along frontage roads and hover overhead in helicopters the hardened border however pushed migrants to remote areas that are more dangerous those experts contended arizona has become a hotbed of crossings but migrants often die of dehydration the mountains east of san diego have also become a crossing zone where migrants have died from hypothermia claim trump says drug prices have declined in 2018 already as a result of my administration s efforts in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years trump said on tuesday the president first said drug prices would start dropping in may but an associated press investigation of drug prices in the first half of the year found that overall prices are still on the rise over the first seven months of 2018 the ap found that there were 96 price hikes for every price cut there were fewer price increases from january through july 2018 than during comparable time frames in years past but companies still hiked prices significantly more than they cut them at the end of may the president announced that drug companies would be voluntarily slashing prices within two weeks in the two months after that there were 395 price increases and 24 decreases in an interview with the ap at the time health secretary alex azar said that it would be awhile before drug prices actually fall he credited the complexity of the medicine market and incentives for drugmakers to boost prices in order to boost profits claim nafta was a historic blunder for america trump in urging congress to support his new trade agreement said he had met men and women across the country whose dreams were shattered by nafta there are many estimates for job losses due to the clinton era north american free trade agreement nafta but millions is higher than the number calculated by most groups from across the ideological spectrum robert e scott of the pro labor economic policy institute found that about 851 700 u s jobs were displaced by the u s trade deficit with mexico between 1993 shortly before nafta was implemented and 2014 that s a data point that was cited by bernie sanders during his 2016 campaign when he frequently decried job losses due to nafta a 2014 peterson institute for international economics study found that while nafta has caused about 203 000 jobs to be displaced by nafta related imports annually imports support 188 000 new jobs leading to a net loss of only about 15 000 annually and the nonpartisan congressional research service wrote in 2017 that in reality nafta did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters the net overall effect of nafta on the u s economy appears to have been relatively modest primarily because trade with canada and mexico accounts for a small percentage of u s gdp claim trump says new york allows abortion moments before birth there could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our nation saw in recent days trump said speaking out against abortion that occurs later in pregnancy lawmakers in new york cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother s womb moments before birth this is false the state recently passed a law loosening restrictions on abortions in the state allowing abortions after 24 weeks if the fetus is not viable or when it s necessary to protect the life of the mother the president paints the picture of a healthy mother and child but an abortion would not be legal in that scenario after 24 weeks in new york state democratic gov andrew cuomo has pushed back at critics noting that it is just a mirror of the federal law the abortion rights enshrined in the supreme court decision roe v wade what s more abortions later in pregnancy are exceedingly rare the centers for disease control reports that just 1 3 percent of abortions in the u s in 2015 took place in or after the 21st week claim virginia gov ralph northam stated he would execute a baby after birth speaking about abortion trump said we had the case of governor of virginia where he stated he would execute a baby after birth a spokesman for the governor ralph northam disputed this characterization of confusing remarks he made days ago and it should be noted that northam was discussing a hypothetical procedure that would occur only in cases of severe deformities or nonviable pregnancy nonetheless northam caused a firestorm when he responded to a hypothetical question related to a proposed state law that would have made it somewhat easier for a woman to obtain an abortion later in a pregnancy for medical reasons asked on a radio program what happens when a woman who is going into labor desires a third trimester abortion northam noted that this kind of procedure only occurs in cases of severe deformities or a nonviable pregnancy he said that in this scenario the infant would be resuscitated if that s what the mother and the family desired and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother it s worth noting that the proposed virginia law which failed to pass the republican controlled legislature wasn t proposing legalizing abortions in the third trimester that is already legal in the state the bill proposed changing the number of physicians required for that kind of abortion s approval from three to one doctor it also proposed broadening the list of health concerns that would allow a woman to seek approval for such an abortion claim over the last two years we have begun to fully rebuild the united states military despite trump s frequent discussion of restoring and rebuilding america s military might the most recent legislation he signed to fund national defense came in at less than an obama signed bill in 2011 for fiscal year 2019 trump has signed into law national defense authorization legislation that provides 716 billion for national defense operations including 639 billion for the pentagon that s a smaller dollar number than the 726 billion provided by the 2011 national defense authorization act it s not clear yet what trump will ultimately propose for defense spending in fiscal year 2020 in a tweet on dec 4 he appeared to decry the amount of spending on defense saying the u s spent 716 billion dollars this year crazy he s referring to the same bill he signed into law but days after reports that he wanted to slash future spending to 700 billion the administration signaled that trump would instead agree to a request from then defense secretary jim mattis to boost that number to 740 billion claim trump says venezuela s collapse is a result of socialist policies since the swearing in of president nicolás maduro whom much of the international community has called illegitimate many conservative critics have blamed the country s 21st century socialism for the unrest and protests in the country trump on tuesday night said that maduro s socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in south america into a state of abject poverty and despair but it s a more complicated picture than just the s word the corruption of venezuelan leaders and the country s near complete dependence on oil are also important components of the country s downfall after maduro s predecessor hugo chávez became president in 1999 he worked to use oil revenues from the then booming industry to fund national programs but when oil prices began to collapse in 2014 shortly after chávez died and maduro took over the country lacked funds for those programs u s sanctions on the oil industry a result of charges of corruption and human rights abuses by venezuelan leaders have been another blow to the economy francisco toro a venezuelan journalist and an official with the latin american business organization group of 50 wrote in a washington post opinion article last year that all venezuela demonstrates is that if you leave implementation to the very worst most anti intellectual callous authoritarian and criminal people in society socialism can have genuinely horrendous consequences toro and others have pointed out that other countries with leftist or socialist leaning governments like denmark or sweden have not experienced similar unrest claim north korea hasn t tested a missile in 15 months our hostages have come home nuclear testing has stopped and there has not been a missile launch in 15 months much work remains to be done but my relationship with kim jong un is a good one trump said while trump is correct that north korea has not launched a missile in 15 months there s ample evidence that north korea is seeking to retain and hide their nuclear capabilities contradicting the president s past claims that he s made great progress in getting pyongyang to give up their nuclear weapons director of national intelligence dan coats said last week that it s unlikely north korea will try to denuclearize and the regime appears to be working to hide their efforts as nbc news reported on jan 21 researchers funded by the defense think tank center for strategic and international studies have discovered an undisclosed secret ballistic missile base in north korea and that there could be as many as 20 north korea has also refused to provide a detailed list of its nuclear and missile facilities despite the u s calls for it to do so a former senior u s official who has been briefed on the negotiations told nbc news that i can t find anybody in the u s who thinks the north koreans are denuclearizing vice president mike pence conceded earlier this month that the u s is still await concrete steps by north korea to dismantle the nuclear weapons that threaten our people and our allies in the region claim trump says u s has liberated virtually all of iraq and syria from isis it s accurate for trump to say that isis can claim just a fraction of the territory it once did all but about 1 percent of the territory that isis once controlled is now gone according to brett mcgurk the now former special presidential envoy to the coalition to defeat isis in syria and iraq but the center for strategic and international studies estimates that while islamic state territorial control has been reduced to minor pockets of rural iraq the group was still carrying out an average of 75 attacks per month in 2018 and in the annual worldwide threat assessment released in january u s intelligence officials concluded that isis still commands thousands of fighters in iraq and syria and it maintains eight branches more than a dozen networks and thousands of dispersed supporters around the world despite significant leadership and territorial losses one such attack is particularly raw four americans were among those killed by an explosion in manbij syria on january 16 isis claimed responsibility for that attack additionally military officials have warned that without sustained pressure from the u s isis could regain that lost territory in january nbc news reported on a draft pentagon report warning that isis is intent on reconstituting a physical caliphate and that the terror group could retake lost land in six to 12 months if there is no military pressure preventing them from doing so nobody is declaring mission accomplished in the fight against isis mcgurk said in early december then after trump announced on dec 19 that u s troops would withdraw from syria tweeting that isis had been defeated mcgurk resigned defense secretary jim mattis also resigned in the wake of that decision claim 1 in 3 women is sexually assaulted on the journey to america while it s difficult to estimate the rates at which it occurs it s true that sexual violence is a reality for many female migrants one amnesty international publication in 2010 reported that it is the widely held view of non profit and medical workers that as many as six in 10 migrant women are raped trump s estimate appears to be based on a may 2017 report by doctors without borders which found that about one third of female migrants out of a survey of 467 migrants total had experienced sexual abuse during their journey claim trump says we have more women serving in congress than at any time before trump earned big applause for this line we have more women serving in congress than at any time before he s correct but it s also true that those women are overwhelmingly democrats in fact the share of republican women in the house has gone down since the last congress according to the center for american women and politics at rutgers university of the 127 female voting members of the house and senate in the chamber tonight 106 are democrats and just 21 are republicans in fact in the house the share of republican women actually decreased from last congress to this one last congress there were 23 republican women serving in the house as voting members that s down to just 13 this congress the overall breakdown of female voting members is house 89 democrats 13 republicans senate 17 democrats 8 republicans claim trump says he s sending another 3 750 troops to the u s border this is true though those troops won t all deploy at the same time the department of homeland security request for assistance was approved in january by acting defense secretary patrick shanahan who agreed to send 3 750 more troops to string concertina wire man surveillance cameras and provide some airlift support however they won t all deploy to the border at once there will be an influx of about 2 000 to string 160 miles of concertina wire but then the number will go back down as the mission turns to manning surveillance cameras and supporting customs and border protection in other ways there are about 2 400 active duty there now and more will begin to deploy in mid february still the total deployed there is not expected to surpass about 4 400 at this point claim trump says mexican cities are paying for migrants to journey to u s in a section discussing illegal immigration trump said that mexican cities in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection trump seems to be referring to a group of about 2 000 migrants who arrived at the port of entry in eagle pass texas this group made much of their journey by bus and a handful of cities and towns they passed through in mexico paid for the buses because they were not equipped to care for the immigrants however it s not clear what trump meant when he said there is little border protection texas sent state patrolmen and women to eagle pass today as reinforcements where federal and local law enforcement also had a larger than usual presence according to local news reports there is patrol at all times through the area so it s just a little heavier today than usual eagle pass mayor ramsey cantu told reporters on tuesday according to the local abc news affiliate department of homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen said that dhs will take all steps to ensure the safety of law enforcement personnel at the border claim the economy is growing twice as fast today as when trump took office the u s economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when i took office trump said tuesday night this is true when trump took office the rate of gdp growth was 1 8 percent for the first quarter of 2017 in the third quarter of 2018 the most recent data available it was 3 4 percent claim tens of thousands of americans are killed by drugs coming across the border it s correct that lethal drugs do come across the border and drug overdose deaths are up among men women all races and adults of nearly all ages according to the centers for disease control and prevention in 2017 70 237 people died from an overdose but trump in pushing for a border wall tends to ignore that the vast majority of hard drugs from mexican cartels come into the u s through legal ports of entry which wouldn t be affected by a wall according to a 2015 national drug threat assessment by the dea mexican drug cartels transport the bulk of their drugs over the southwest border through ports of entry poes using passenger vehicles or tractor trailers the drugs are typically secreted in hidden compartments when transported in passenger vehicles or commingled with legitimate goods when transported in tractor trailers in the 2018 version of the same publication dea said the most common method employed by these involves transporting illicit drugs through u s poes in passenger vehicles with concealed compartments or commingled with legitimate goods on tractor trailers the trump administration knows this then department of homeland security secretary john kelly who went on to become white house chief of staff until december 2018 said in april 2017 that illegal drug traffic mostly comes through the ports of entry claim trump says u s has more women in the workforce than ever before it s true that there are more women in the workforce than ever before but that s the continuation of a long term trend the bureau of labor statistics estimated in january that there were about 74 9 million women in the workforce but that number has long been trending upward and the overall growth of the u s population means that the raw number of women in the workforce has increased nearly every year since at least the early 1980s except for in years during which the country experienced a recession perhaps another metric to measure women s participation in the workforce would be the women s unemployment rate the unemployment rate for women over 16 stood at 3 9 percent in january that was up slightly from a low of 3 6 percent in may and september of last year but as with unemployment overall women s unemployment has been falling since the end of the recession claim trump says border fencing made el paso safer the border city of el paso texas used to have extremely high rates of violent crime one of the highest in the country and considered one of our nation s most dangerous cities trump claimed in his address now with a powerful barrier in place el paso is one of our safest cities in fact el paso s crime rate had been dropping for years when construction on border fence began in 2008 however the crime rate actually rose during construction and in the year after completion of a fence according to an analysis of fbi crime data by the el paso times the city s democratic sheriff richard wiles disputed trump s characterization as falsehoods used to justify the building of a 2 000 mile wall the facts are clear while it is true that el paso is one of the safest cities in the nation it has never been considered one of our nation s most dangerous cities wiles said in a statement provided to nbc news and el paso was a safe city long before any wall was built president trump continues to give a false narrative about a great city that truly represents what this great nation is all about claim trump says countless americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens there isn t good data on homicides specifically in the united states but there s no evidence that immigrants commit more crimes than american born residents previous empirical research shows that immigrants do not increase local crime rates are less likely to cause crime than their native born peers and are less likely to be incarcerated than native born americans according to the libertarian leaning cato institute trump has previously circulated a claim backed by rep steve king r iowa that 63 000 americans have been killed by undocumented immigrants since 9 11 but that number has since been debunked politifact has extrapolated from existing data sources that the number of homicides committed by undocumented immigrants may fall between about 450 600 per year but again those are guesses not based on national data sources claim trump claims he s added 5 3 million jobs we have created 5 3 million new jobs trump said tuesday night this number needs context trump is taking credit for the job gains in the final months of his predecessor s administration starting the clock on job gains from his election not his inauguration since trump has been in office total nonfarm employment has grown by nearly 4 9 million the 5 3 million data point includes gains in between his election on nov 8 2016 and his inauguration on jan 20 2017

to us for example during q4 when market concerns increased about the pace of 2019 global growth we proactively reduced production rates as a derisking measure even though we didn t see any significant demand weakness in our performance data we took advantage of this opportunity to run product trials in some of our specialty catalysts plants these actions temporarily reduced margins and earnings growth but were clearly the right thing to do to ensure we remain well positioned for growth in 2019 i want to emphasize that we took these actions to reduce risk not in response to any change in demand turning to page 6 it has been almost a year since our investor day when we presented our growth strategy and introduced the grace value model to investors i want to give you an update on the progress we made in 2018 against our key strategic initiatives first we ve successfully accelerated our investments in high return growth projects these investments are primarily in specialty catalysts and materials technologies where we have the strongest growth drivers importantly these capacity and productivity investments are timed and sized to meet identified customer demand over 90 of our current growth capital is linked to specific customer investments contracts or licenses second we continue to see clear benefits from the grace manufacturing system which is improving our manufacturing operations through increased production reliability and efficiency our gms implementation is currently focused on five plants with the greatest opportunity the most significant investments in gms have already been made and we are confident we will see a payback of less than two years gms delivered a 50 basis point benefit to gross margins in 2018 for example at one plant we did a gms implementation focused on improved reliability in less than one year reliability increased by over 6 percentage points the result in higher volumes and lower costs added millions to 2018 earnings shifting gears the single site polyolefin catalysts acquisition is delivering on our key business objectives of strengthening our technology position enhancing our technical and manufacturing capabilities and broadening our relationships with our customers the business is well integrated into grace at this point and is on track for the sales earnings and synergies we expected our scientists and business development teams are seeing some exciting opportunities as they work with our customers to leverage the combined technologies of grace and the acquired business from a financial perspective the acquisition contributed 7 growth to the catalyst segment this year overall i m pleased with the progress we re making at the company i m excited about the strong commitment and engagement of our employees and the great work they re doing with our customers i m confident we have the levers we need to achieve the commitments in our 2016 to 2021 financial framework please turn to page 7 to discuss catalysts catalysts technologies delivered another strong year with sales up 15 we saw 5 higher catalyst sales volumes and continued strength in unipol process licensing technology last year we announced four new polypropylene process licenses totaling over 1 500 kta of new capacity in january we announced another 400 kta license and we are encouraged by the robust pipeline of future opportunities q4 sales were up 18 driven by 8 volume growth 210 basis points improved pricing and an 8 contribution from the acquisition specialty catalyst sales were up 11 organically plus 28 million from the acquisition in the quarter refining technologies sales also were up about 11 including strong volume and improved pricing fcc catalysts pricing improved by more than 200 basis points last year and we expect pricing to improve more than 200 basis points in 2019 as well we made significant progress in 2018 shifting our portfolio to those customers that value our high technology products and problem solving capabilities we are working closely with these customers to help them optimize their margins in a dynamic world our art joint venture continues to experience solid demand for its hydroprocessing catalysts we are working closely with our customers to help them meet market demand for increased diesel production as the imo 2020 deadline approaches art s industry leading technologies position the business well to capitalize on this clean fuels opportunity as a reminder growth in our catalyst business is driven by the global demand for plastics petrochemical feedstocks and cleaner transportation fuels volatility in crude prices create opportunities for us as customers use our technologies to optimize their margins in a changing environment let s turn to materials technologies on page 8 our materials business delivered a solid year in 2018 with sales up 7 on higher volumes and improved pricing in q4 volumes and prices were up about 3 but fully offset given the dollar strength against other currencies mt delivered more than 200 basis points of improved pricing through value selling and a commitment to customer driven innovation mt demand remains solid globally that we did see some slower growth in the china coatings end market in q4 this is a relatively small end market for us at about 5 of segment sales one of the strengths of the mt model is our ability to shift focus from one end market to another as market conditions change we ve already shifted more than 10 of our sales in the faster growing more profitable end markets we re seeing strong demand for our high value specialty silica technologies and the benefits of investments and customer driven innovation as an example our team recently developed a new silica technology to help one of our customers achieve a key sustainability commitment to reduce water usage in their manufacturing process this customer driven innovation created a compelling value proposition for our customer and attractive growth and margin opportunity for us as a reminder growth in our materials business is driven by growing global middle class incomes stricter environmental standards and increased focus on health and wellness in addition to general economic growth i ll now turn the call to jeremy who will discuss our financial results and outlook in more detail jeremy rohen vice president investor relations and corporate development thanks hudson let me begin on slide 10 with our fourth quarter results q4 sales were 520 million up 13 sales were up more than 8 organically on higher sales volumes and improved pricing in both segments adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 38 3 down 250 basis points largely driven by the impact of our proactive decision to reduce production rates in q4 as hudson said this was done to reduce risk not in response to any change in customer demand adjusted ebit was up 3 on strong organic growth adjusted ebit margin was 22 8 down 220 basis points on lower gross margin adjusted eps was 1 14 per share up 16 including the benefit from a lower effective tax rate for the year our adjusted free cash flow was 235 million including higher capital spending as part of our multiyear investment plan to accelerate growth adjusted ebit roic was 20 9 down year over year as the result of our acquisition in q2 but up 30 basis points from last quarter now let s turn to slide 11 to cover capital allocation in 2018 we continued to execute our disciplined capital allocation strategy we made significant investments in our business while continuing to return cash to shareholders first we invested 216 million of capital in our plants with more than 60 of the investment dollars directed toward high return strategic investments in q2 we acquired the leading single site catalyst business for 418 million to strengthen our technology and manufacturing positions in this high growth segment of the polyethylene industry we re on track to deliver our synergy commitments which will result in a post synergy purchase price multiple more than 3 turns below the announced multiple for the year we returned a 145 million of cash to our shareholders including 65 million in dividends and 80 million in share buybacks we ended 2018 at 3 2 times net leverage and expect to be back in our target range of 2 to 3 times by the end of 2019 moving to slide 12 let s take a more detailed look at our 2019 outlook we remain upbeat about the fundamentals of our businesses and underlying markets we are positioned to deliver another solid year of growth to expand our margins and execute our capital investments for the full year we expect revenue growth of 6 to 7 including organic growth of 5 to 6 with solid demand and improved pricing in both catalysts and materials looking at our business segments the organic growth rates we provided at our investor day continue to reflect our views of the businesses today we expect high single digit growth from specialty catalysts mid single digit growth for materials and low single digit growth in refining technologies benefiting from a continued shift toward faster growing crude to chemicals applications we expect 2019 adjusted ebit in the range of 490 million to 500 million up 7 to 9 and adjusted eps in the range of 4 53 to 4 63 per share which is up 10 to 12 earnings growth and margin expansion will be driven by our solid top line growth and benefits of our commercial and operating excellence initiatives we do expect some continued headwinds from inflation this year and moderate headwind from fx in the first half of 2019 our adjusted free cash flow is expected to be between 235 million and 250 million finally looking at q1 we expect year over year adjusted eps growth of 7 to 9 driven by strong business performance including solid organic growth this is slightly below our full year growth rate of 10 to 12 because of approximately 10 million to 12 million of headwinds from inflation and fx in the first quarter with that let s open the line for questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from john mcnulty with bmo capital markets your line is now open hudson la force president and chief executive officer john we can t hear you john mcnulty bmo capital markets analyst can you hear me now sorry about that hudson la force president and chief executive officer yes you re loud and clear now john john mcnulty bmo capital markets analyst all right apologies so with regard to the catalyst business we look and when it comes to your guide it looks like you re looking for low single digits from the fcc side it sounds like a lot of that s coming from the pricing side i guess i believe you re at the point now where you re somewhat capacity constraint can you give us an update on the new capacity that you were looking to ramp up in the middle east and how that might unlock future growth going forward hudson la force president and chief executive officer sure john your analysis is right as we look into next year we are expecting low single digit growth from catalysts we do see low single digit volume growth plus the benefit of improved pricing the demand driver there is really the increasing demand for petrochemical feedstocks as our customers run more and more for propylene the but to your the longer term part of your question we do we ve done the engineering for that project we are waiting to start that project to make sure that it s timed with demand in the region we don t want to do anything that upsets the balance of supply and demand globally and when we see that demand at present we will proceed with construction john mcnulty bmo capital markets analyst great and then maybe just a follow up with regard to your specialty catalyst volume growth were you looking for it looks like high single digit which or at least high single digit sales growth how much of that is dependent on the macro verse either new facilities coming up and or things that you ve locked up whether it s tied to the type of some of the licensing business et cetera how should we think about the sensitivity of that business as we look through 2019 given the macro headwinds or tailwinds hudson la force president and chief executive officer it s a combination of those things john as you might imagine over time the macro environment is going to drive the demand for plastics and plastics has grown at a premium to global gdp for a long long time and we expect that trend to continue in the shorter term it is affected by start up of new investments for example or a new product win that we might have with an individual customer but i will tell you that an individual plant starting up or an individual win with the customer in the quarter maybe that makes the growth rate a little higher but over the course of the year and certainly over the course of multiple years it s really driven by the long term demand for plastics john mcnulty bmo capital markets analyst great thanks very much for the color operator thank you our next question comes from christopher parkinson with credit suisse your line is now open kiran credit suisse analyst good morning this is kiran ph on for chris i was wondering if you can talk a little bit more about your forward outlook for margins and give any color on how you expect gross margins to evolve throughout the course of the year especially considering the actions that you took throughout this quarter thank you hudson la force president and chief executive officer we do expect margins to expand 2018 into 2019 in 2018 gross margins expanded about 60 basis points and that s a typical margin expansion for us over time i don t see anything that s going to change that general rate as we look into the future kiran credit suisse analyst great and i guess in looking at materials tech it seems like you re still seeing good pricing but volumes seemed to have slowed a bit this quarter pharma consumers still saw a little bit of growth but chemicals and coatings seemed to have stagnated can you discuss your outlook for 19 maybe by region and then maybe any levers you can pull to accelerate that demand or win market share going forward thank you hudson la force president and chief executive officer sure so what we saw at the end of last year in q4 coatings growth wasn t as strong as it had been earlier in the year we did see some slowdown in china as we commented earlier on the chemical process side we had a very strong chemical process quarter q4 of 17 and so we had a tough compare there but is if i look generally at mts growth momentum i feel very good about mts growth momentum and as we look into next year jeremy s guide and i think it s right is mid single digits growth in that business and we ll see growth in coatings we ll see growth in consumer pharma and we ll see growth in chemical process kiran credit suisse analyst great thank you operator thank you our next question comes from kevin mccarthy with vertical research partners your line is now open kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst good morning hudson did the volatility in the crude oil markets have any appreciable impact either positively or negatively on your businesses hudson la force president and chief executive officer kevin good morning there is always volatility so it s hard to say whether q4 volatility had any different impact than q3 q2 or q1 volatility really it creates opportunity for us at the end of the day and it s not always an opportunity that we capture in the current quarter but when our customers see changes in their operating environment whether it s crude prices or something else new regulations whatever it may be it leads them to think about how they reoptimize their refinery operations and they and the catalyst is a very important lever to them in that problem solving as you know and so the way i think about it is volatility really creates opportunity for us with our customers but as i said it doesn t always pay off in the current quarter kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst and then as a follow up a fair amount has been written in the popular press about us oil production like sweet crude in particular and that s had a pronounced impact on light heavy spreads as i look at your financials it would seem that art s posted a very strong equity earnings quarter and so can you talk about i guess trends at that joint venture in the context of what s going on in the energy markets and also what s going on head of imo 2020 hudson la force president and chief executive officer sure so if i think broadly about the art joint venture the growth the growth driver for the business is really two things it s customers processing heavier feeds and customers trying to produce a cleaner fuels or low sulfur fuel those are the two fundamental drivers and while in north america the crude slate has been getting lighter with shale production as you noted on a global basis feed is been trending toward heavier harder to process crudes and that s driven our customers to invest in hydroprocessing units and ultimately creating demand for our hydroprocessing catalysts clean fuels regulations have been a growth driver in this business for many many years and imo 2020 is really just the latest chapter in a longer book about clean fuels regulations and a year i guess it s actually been two years now when those regs were firmed up for a 2020 effective day we saw customers that had hydroprocessing investments already planned in some cases they were timed to start up with imo 2020 in other cases they were not originally timed there but customers were able to do some acceleration some customers that had been thinking about it firmed up plans to proceed and so we see that regulation really what s the right way to say it bolstering our customers investment decisions in hydroprocessing capability which in turn bolsters our opportunity and this business has grown 6 to 7 a year for a while we think that growth rate continues this year but beyond 2020 as well as customers continue to make these investments kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst that s helpful thank you so much operator thank you our next question is from john roberts with ubs your line is now open john roberts ubs analyst thank you you said you ran more trials in the quarter in anticipation of weakness at customers that s not normally something that you call out and i thought the weakness at the customers was pretty late in the quarter so maybe you could elaborate a little bit more on was that just right at the very end of the quarter that you were doing some of that activity hudson la force president and chief executive officer i want to be very clear we ve seen no weakness in demand from customers and i want to i can t be too clear on this and then john i m not just speaking to you but everybody we took a derisking action in q4 because of the concern heightened concern about growth in 2019 that was a market concern we wanted to be proactive and derisk but we ve seen no slowdown in demand from our customers john roberts ubs analyst could you tell us a little go ahead hudson la force president and chief executive officer our specialty catalysts plants ran pretty hard this year and we didn t have as much trial time in those units as we would like to have and when we made the decision to slowdown some of the plants it was a great opportunity to accelerate some of the work that we ve been doing on products and that s what we re trying to communicate this was a derisking action but not in any way in response to lower customer demand john roberts ubs analyst could you tell us a little bit about some of the new products that you are trialing because obviously you were doing more activity than normal on new products hudson la force president and chief executive officer yes i mean this is in both polypropylene and polyethylene end use applications these are customer driven trials where we re doing joint development with our customers ultimately designed to help them produce the resin characteristics that they re seeking to produce for their customers i m not going to be more specific than that john it s too early and we re still working very closely with our customers on these development projects john roberts ubs analyst okay thank you operator thank you our next question comes from robert koort with goldman sachs your line is now open christopher evans goldman sachs company inc analyst thanks chris evans on for bob i just wanted to maybe go on that point a little bit more i mean you referenced the possibility for softening market conditions that been materializing but maybe could you just contextualize for your business your catalysts business as a whole how much of volatility is even possible in catalyst sales given the strong visibility your customers like to provide for start ups or turnarounds given you probably have a pretty good read on the first half at the very least just could you give any context to what s going on there and then just on the fourth quarter real quick your refining catalyst volume stepped up pretty massively up 11 and for the year you re guiding the low single digits in 19 and i ll think at one point in 18 to reach those low levels just wondering if you could kind of describe the cadence of what s going on there too hudson la force president and chief executive officer sure so on your first question chris i appreciate the question the demand for catalyst is actually pretty resilient and if we go back to the 08 09 time period and i don t think anybody is predicting that that period repeat itself but it s a data point that we have we saw a decline in catalyst demand that was low single digits literally a few percentage points even in that environment and so we believe that demand for catalyst is pretty resilient in any downturn mostly because the demand for transportation fuels is pretty resilient the demand for plastics is pretty resilient and remember all of these are global businesses so our exposure to any one market is relatively small the other thing that s important to note is catalyst inventories are never that significant in rt or in sorry in refining technologies or in specialty catalysts there s not a lot of inventory that we have and there s not a lot of inventory that our customers carry so we don t see that that inventory bullwhip effect when demand changes on the second part of your question about rt growth rates we did have a strong quarter in q4 we had a good growth year in 2018 we do believe that we will have a low single digit growth rate as we head into the future that s our multiyear view on growth in this business and we think it aligns well with the underlying drivers around transportation fuel and propylene production christopher evans goldman sachs company inc analyst thanks and then in the catalyst segment you reported 2 1 pricing and noted fcc was greater than 200 bps but fcc is not 100 of the segments so just curious are you seeing pricing or mix support elsewhere in the portfolio to maintain that 2 plus pricing for the segment and then just curious in your 19 guidance does fcc and mt pricing more than offset the inflation you guys are expecting hudson la force president and chief executive officer in your question about catalysts pricing sc does get some pricing i will tell you that rt pricing was greater than sc pricing and then yes we do expect pricing in 2019 to offset more than offset inflation christopher evans goldman sachs company inc analyst great thank you operator thank you our next question comes from mike sison with keybanc your line is now open michael sison keybanc capital markets inc analyst hey guys in terms of the first quarter lot of inaudible are struggling a little bit in your outlook seems pretty good so when you think about the 7 to 9 eps growth can you maybe talk about the underlying sales growth ebit growth and is that 10 million headwinds is that the largest for the year in terms of how big that is hudson la force president and chief executive officer mike we re not going to give more specific color on q1 but as jeremy said in his prepared remarks we do see good business performance in q1 but we do have these headwinds and the fx headwinds are really for the first half the inflation headwinds are for the first half more than the second half q1 might be a little more than q2 but you should think of it as a first half headwind and we were just a little more specific on q1 michael sison keybanc capital markets inc analyst okay and then again the fourth quarter pretty solid routes to others and oil price you said historically doesn t really dictate demand to some degree but you did see it fall quite a bit were there any benefits from that in terms or major negatives from the oil price did customers think about maxing propylene little bit more and what are your thoughts here at current levels does it affect the business at all going forward hudson la force president and chief executive officer well so let me deal with the q4 part first i think john asked a similar question in the short term changes in crude prices create conversations between us and our customers but those are conversations that usually take months to a handful of months to play out some of our customers are more nimble but in general as our customers see changing market conditions it takes them some time to respond refineries are big complex operations as you can imagine and so they don t tend to respond to changes that they see as temporary or pure volatility but when things are trending they do want to respond to that so that they continue to maximize their margins over time a lower crude price should ultimately translate into lower transportation fuel costs and lower plastic feedstock costs that supports demand for transportation fuels and supports demand for plastics and but it s a balance you don t want crude prices too low customers won t invest you don t want them too high you run the risk of a demand destruction but i think that s a very broad range 40 to 100 or 30 to 100 or something like that before you see significant long term changes in behavior michael sison keybanc capital markets inc analyst great thank you operator thank you our next question comes from chris kapsch with loop capital markets your line is now open christopher kapsch loop capital markets analyst good morning hey hudson just wanted to follow up on the conversation around the derisking action that you took just want to make sure i understand that was focused exclusively on the polymers and specialty businesses and did not related at all to any manufacturing facilities on the refining tech side hudson la force president and chief executive officer no this was in catalysts where we the catalyst segment where we did this where we took advantage to do the product trials within specialty catalysts christopher kapsch loop capital markets analyst got it okay and then so just to follow up on i get the macro and obviously a global sort of destocking in the polymer supply chain so maybe that contributed to the impetus for the derisk action but there was a disconnect then with what you saw if anything it seems like your sales maybe the demand was even stronger than expected so i m just wondering where do you think was the source of that disconnect and is there still the potential that you see a belated slowdown from your customers henceforth hudson la force president and chief executive officer i m going to try one more time to be as clear as i can possibly be on this we have seen no change in customer demand what we did in the fourth quarter was not in response to any change in customer demand what went through our mind was market participants were getting increasingly concerned about the pace of 2019 growth and we said to ourselves maybe there is something out there that we re not seeing in our demand data let s be prudent and derisk a little bit as we stand here on february 7th we haven t seen any change in customer demand but i m glad we took the derisking decision it was the right thing to do at the time given the level of uncertainty that we re starting to manifest in the market but we did not and have not seen any change in customer demand christopher kapsch loop capital markets analyst and hudson the cost accounting hit associated with this action to gross margins when does that normalize does it spill over into the first quarter hudson la force president and chief executive officer no it s a great question chris this is q4 it s done christopher kapsch loop capital markets analyst okay and then if i could just to follow up on the fcc pricing outlook more than 200 bps is that a function mostly of a customer mix and upgrading to the higher end technologies or is there also some like for like year over year price increases tied to maybe customers that where you ve seen the supply agreements roll over the multiyear supply agreements roll over hudson la force president and chief executive officer it s all of the above chris christopher kapsch loop capital markets analyst okay thank you hudson la force president and chief executive officer thanks operator thank you our next question comes from laurence alexander with jefferies your line is now open daniel rizzo jefferies analyst good morning guys this is dan rizzo on for laurence how are you hudson la force president and chief executive officer hi dan daniel rizzo jefferies analyst hi you mentioned shifting i think 10 of sales to faster growing end markets i was wondering if you could just elaborate on what you were shifting toward and prompt hudson la force president and chief executive officer sure it s a great question i appreciate it so when we look at our this is the materials technologies question for everybody when we look at our materials technologies business we look at it in a handful of sub segments you see the three groups coatings consumer pharma and chemical process we look at it at another level of detail and those end markets different ones are growing at different growth rates our best growth rates right now are in consumer pharma sub segments and within chemical process there is some environmental end use applications for our silica technologies where we are seeing better than segment average growth rates and opportunities in the future in coatings it s more niche than that they re very specific coatings end use applications where we ve brought a specific technology to a specific niche and we re investing more in that type of technology but broadly speaking it s consumer pharma in the environmental a couple of different environmental end use applications within chemical process daniel rizzo jefferies analyst okay that s helpful and then one of the question you mentioned also inflation headwinds that are going to be a thing in q1 again i was just wondering what specifically you re referring to i don t think it s oil related but where is the inflation coming from hudson la force president and chief executive officer this is mostly organic materials metals sorry i said organic inorganic materials metals energy this is where we are saying the inflation 100 to 150 basis points is our estimate for the full year a little heavier in the first half just on a year over year basis we have almost no exposure to organic or crude derived raw materials daniel rizzo jefferies analyst would that be labor i mean would labor be a part of that as well labor inflation hudson la force president and chief executive officer yes i mean labor is certainly in our cost base we do see labor cost inflation but nothing that s out of the ordinary or noteworthy daniel rizzo jefferies analyst okay thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from mike harrison with seaport global securities your line is now open michael harrison seaport global securities analyst hi good morning hudson la force president and chief executive officer hi michael harrison seaport global securities analyst just maybe to follow up on the question regarding raw material inflation was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you re seeing in aluminum markets and could that possibly be a source of some raw material relief at some point later in the year hudson la force president and chief executive officer we do we do buy a lot of aluminum and aluminum compounds the concerns that developed last year about the aluminum market have significantly dissipated as you probably know and while we are seeing some inflation it s certainly not the level of inflation that we saw last year michael harrison seaport global securities analyst okay and then i was also i hate to be the one to ask about this but can we just get an update on your major middle eastern customer and plans for commercial sales during 2019 thanks hudson la force president and chief executive officer you bet i appreciate the question our expectations haven t changed we expect that unit to start up this quarter meaning q1 and we expect to resume commercial supply in q2 and the our intention in terms of how we monetize that opportunity is really through mix shift there may be small amount of volume improvement but we re really going to use this as an opportunity to upgrade our portfolio and drive positive mix and margin michael harrison seaport global securities analyst all right thanks very much hudson la force president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from ben kallo with baird your line is now open benjamin kallo robert w baird co inc analyst hi good morning hudson hudson la force president and chief executive officer hi ben benjamin kallo robert w baird co inc analyst can you talk a little bit about your capex plans growth capex for the year specifically where they go by segments and then just can you talk about your leverage ratio and how you think about your target ratio and if we should expect this growth going forward for this year at least to be organic or are you still out in the market looking for opportunities hudson la force president and chief executive officer thanks ben so on the capital side we are investing in growth opportunities in all of our businesses but the biggest investments are in specialty catalysts and materials technologies specialty catalyst a little more than materials technologies this is a program that we began last year it will continue this year and some of these investments won t start up until 20 next year 2020 we want to make sure that we ve got the right capacity in the right places and it s important i hope everybody took note of one of the comments we had in our prepared remarks about 90 of this growth capital is connected to specific customer investments customer contracts or licenses so we feel quite confident making these investments at this time from a leverage perspective our long term leverage target is between 2 and 3 turns and we ve been above that often on in the last couple of years as we ve made these acquisitions and then we ve come back below that target after each of the acquisitions and in 2018 of course we bumped up with the acquisition in the polyolefin catalyst business and we expect to be back below 3 turns during the course of 2019 long term we think that s the right place for us but when there s a strategic opportunity for us we re quite comfortable going above 3 turns in the right situation in terms of m a generally it is part of our long term growth plan it s a big part of our history as a company i think it s part of our future we are spending time in all of our businesses looking at opportunities we spent more time in materials technologies in the last year than in any other segment not counting the one acquisition we actually did and sc but mt has a lot of promise for us and it s an area where we ve spent a lot of time and we want to spend even more time in the future benjamin kallo robert w baird co inc analyst thank you operator thank you and i m showing no further questions in the queue at this time ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation in today s conference

share forecast and the related adjusted diluted eps growth rate as a range as pmi has previously communicated its reduced risk product category performance is expected to play an increasingly important role in the company s future results however its growth trajectory is inherently more difficult to predict with the same level of accuracy compared to the performance of its cigarette category specifically the company anticipates periods of accelerated growth and periods of slower growth for reduced risk products the timing and drivers of which may be more difficult to predict compared to those for cigarettes therefore the company believes it is more prudent to now forecast its annual reported diluted earnings per share and the related currency neutral adjusted diluted eps growth rate by reference to a minimum threshold of expected performance at the start of the year and provide more details as the year unfolds 2019 full year forecast reported diluted earnings per share forecast to be at least 5 37 at prevailing exchange rates representing a projected increase of at least 5 7 versus reported diluted earnings per share of 5 08 in 2018 excluding an unfavorable currency impact at prevailing exchange rates of approximately 0 14 per share this forecast represents a projected increase of at least 8 0 versus adjusted diluted earnings per share of 5 10 in 2018 as detailed in the attached schedule 2 2019 full year forecast overview assumptions this forecast assumes a total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume decline for pmi of approximately 1 5 to 2 0 versus an estimated total international industry volume decline excluding china and the u s of approximately 2 5 to 3 0 and currency neutral net revenue growth of at least 5 0 which includes an adverse impact of approximately 0 6 points related to the move to highly inflationary accounting in argentina resulting in the treatment of the u s dollar as the functional currency of the company s argentinian affiliates described below this forecast further assumes an increase in full year reported operating income margin of at least one percentage point ex currency compared to 2018 operating cash flow of at least 10 0 billion subject to year end working capital requirements capital expenditures of approximately 1 1 billion an effective tax rate of approximately 23 and no share repurchases this forecast excludes the impact of any future acquisitions unanticipated asset impairment and exit cost charges future changes in currency exchange rates further developments related to the tax cuts and jobs act and any unusual events factors described in the forward looking and cautionary statements section of this release represent continuing risks to these projections pmi s 2019 2021 targets the company has communicated the following key targets related to the three year period 2019 to 2021 net revenue compound annual currency neutral growth of at least 5 adjusted diluted eps compound annual currency neutral growth of at least 8 and heated tobacco unit volume of 90 100 billion units by 2021 2018 fourth quarter and full year consolidated results philip morris international inc nyse pm today announced its 2018 fourth quarter and full year results we closed out a challenging year with a robust financial and strategic performance across the business excluding inventory movements largely associated with heated tobacco unit volume in japan our total volume variance was flat our best annual performance since 2012 underpinned by a near doubling of global in market sales of heated tobacco units we grew our international market share by 0 5 points to reach 28 4 and maintained a stable share of the cigarette category highlighting our ability to successfully manage our transition to reduced risk products said andré calantzopoulos chief executive officer our total net revenues were driven by an exceptional cigarette pricing variance of 7 6 and a strong contribution of more than 4 billion from our smoke free products despite the impact of the inventory adjustments our operating income was essentially flat excluding currency primarily reflecting increased investment behind our reduced risk product portfolio our robust currency neutral double digit adjusted eps performance was assisted by a lower effective tax rate and interest expense thanks to the tremendous efforts of our employees around the world and significant investments in portfolio development and organizational capabilities including a state of the art digital infrastructure to fuel our expansion we believe we have laid the foundation for an even better performance in 2019 the underlying strength of our combustible tobacco business remains intact and our reduced risk products are the catalysts to accelerate our business growth and secure the long term future of our company and the sustainability of our earnings and dividend growth conference call a conference call hosted by andré calantzopoulos chief executive officer and martin king chief financial officer will be webcast at 1 00 p m eastern time on february 7 2019 access is at www pmi com 2018q4earnings the audio webcast may also be accessed on

during 2018 and adjusted the 2017 provisional estimates to the final amounts based on its 2017 u s federal income tax return as filed accordingly in the fourth quarter 2018 pmi recorded in its income tax provision a charge of 31 million representing a current income tax charge of 185 million primarily due to an increase in its aggregate foreign cash position used to determine its final 2017 transition tax liability mostly offset by a deferred income tax benefit of 154 million primarily due to the recognition of deferred tax assets for net operating losses in the state of new york updates to the provisional estimates have been recorded in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 118 sab 118 pmi s 2019 full year diluted earnings per share forecast assumes a full year effective tax rate of approximately 23 reflecting the current analysis interpretation and clarifications of the scope and impact of the tax cuts and jobs act the act the act has significant complexity and pmi s final full year effective tax rate may differ from this assumption due to among other things additional guidance that may be issued by the u s treasury department and the internal revenue service related interpretations and clarifications of tax law in addition to repatriation cost differences and earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction u s gaap treatment of argentina as a highly inflationary economy following the categorization of argentina by the international practices task force of the center for audit quality as a country with a three year cumulative inflation rate greater than 100 the country is considered highly inflationary in accordance with u s gaap consequently pmi began to account for the operations of its argentinian affiliates as highly inflationary and to treat the u s dollar as the functional currency of the affiliates effective july 1 2018 the move to highly inflationary accounting in argentina reduced pmi s currency neutral net revenue growth by approximately 0 6 points in 2018 dividends during 2018 pmi increased its regular quarterly dividend by 6 5 from 1 07 to 1 14 representing an annualized rate of 4 56 per common share since its spin off in march 2008 pmi

subclass 5 there is no certainty that any portion of the resources will be discovered if discovered there is no certainty that it will be commercially viable to produce any portion of the resources based upon the foregoing analysis as well as arc s expertise in the montney formation in northeast british columbia and alberta it is expected that significant additional reserves will be developed in the future with continued drilling success on currently undeveloped montney acreage together with further development completions refinements and improved economic conditions historic drilling success and recoveries on the more fully developed montney acreage abundant well log and production test data and the application of increased drilling densities support arc s belief that significant additional resources will be recovered continuous development through multi year exploration and development programs and significant levels of future capital expenditures are required in order for additional resources to be recovered in the future the principal risks that would inhibit the recovery of additional reserves relate to the potential for variations in the quality of the montney formation where minimal well data currently exists access to the capital which would be required to develop the resources low commodity prices that would curtail the economics of development and the future performance of wells regulatory approvals access to the required services at the appropriate cost and the effectiveness of well fracturing technology and applications for ecr to be converted to reserves management and the board of directors need to ascertain commercial production rates then develop firm plans including timing infrastructure and the commitment of capital confirmation of commercial productivity is generally required before the company can prepare firm development plans and commit required capital for the development of the ecr additional contingencies are related to the current lack of infrastructure required to develop the resources in a relatively quick time frame as continued delineation occurs some resources currently classified as ecr are expected to be re classified to reserves definitions of oil and gas resources and reserves reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and natural gas and related substances anticipated to be recoverable from known accumulations as of a given date based on the analysis of drilling geological geophysical and engineering data the use of established technology and specified economic conditions which are generally accepted as being reasonable reserves are classified according to the degree of certainty associated with the estimates as follows proved reserves are those reserves that can be estimated with a high degree of certainty to be recoverable it is likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the estimated proved reserves probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves it is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the sum of the estimated proved plus probable reserves resources encompasses all petroleum quantities that originally existed on or within the earth s crust in naturally occurring accumulations including discovered and undiscovered recoverable and unrecoverable plus quantities already produced total resources is equivalent to total petroleum initially in place resources are classified in the following categories total petroleum initially in place tpiip is that quantity of petroleum that is estimated to exist originally in naturally occurring accumulations it includes that quantity of petroleum that is estimated as of a given date to be contained in known accumulations prior to production plus those estimated quantities in accumulations yet to be discovered discovered petroleum initially in place dpiip is that quantity of petroleum that is estimated as of a given date to be contained in known accumulations prior to production the recoverable portion of dpiip includes production reserves and contingent resources the remainder is unrecoverable contingent resources are those quantities of petroleum estimated as of a given date to be potentially recoverable from known accumulations using established technology or technology under development but which are not currently considered to be commercially recoverable due to one or more contingencies economic contingent resources ecr are those contingent resources which are currently economically recoverable project maturity subclass development not viable is defined as a contingent resource that is not viable in the conditions prevailing at the effective date of the evaluation and where no further data acquisition or evaluation is planned and therefore has not been assigned a low chance of development project maturity subclass development pending is defined as a contingent resource that has been assigned a high chance of development and the resolution of final conditions for development are being actively pursued project maturity subclass development unclarified is defined as a contingent resource that requires further appraisal to clarify the potential for development and has been assigned a lower chance of development until contingencies can be clearly defined undiscovered petroleum initially in place upiip is that quantity of petroleum that is estimated on a given date to be contained in accumulations yet to be discovered the recoverable portion of upiip is referred to as prospective resources and the remainder as unrecoverable prospective resources are those quantities of petroleum estimated as of a given date to be potentially recoverable from undiscovered accumulations by application of future development projects unrecoverable is that portion of dpiip and upiip quantities which is estimated as of a given date not to be recoverable by future development projects a portion of these quantities may become recoverable in the future as commercial circumstances change or technological developments occur the remaining portion may never be recovered due to the physical chemical constraints represented by subsurface interaction of fluids and reservoir rocks uncertainty ranges are described by the coge handbook as low best and high estimates for reserves and resources the best estimate is considered to be the best estimate of the quantity that will actually be recovered it is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the best estimate if probabilistic methods are used there should be at least a 50 per cent probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the best estimate information regarding disclosure on oil and gas reserves resources and operational information all amounts in this news release are stated in canadian dollars unless otherwise specified where applicable natural gas has been converted to barrels of oil equivalent boe based on a six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil ratio the boe rate is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different than the energy equivalency of the 6 1 conversion ratio utilizing the 6 1 conversion ratio may be misleading as an indication of value the boe rate is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalent at the wellhead use of boe in isolation may be misleading in accordance with canadian practice production volumes and revenues are reported on a company gross basis before deduction of crown and other royalties and without including any royalty interest unless otherwise stated unless otherwise specified all reserves volumes in this news release and all information derived therefrom are based on company gross reserves using forecast prices and costs this news release contains metrics commonly used in the oil and gas industry each of these metrics is determined by arc as set out below these metrics are reserve replacement reserve life index recycle ratio finding and development costs finding development and acquisition costs operating netback finding and development recycle ratio and finding development and acquisition recycle ratio these metrics do not have standardized meanings and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities as such they should not be used to make comparisons management uses these oil and gas metrics for its own performance measurements and to provide shareholders with measures to compare arc s performance over time however such measures are not reliable indicators of arc s future performance and future performance may not compare to the performance in previous periods reserve replacement is calculated by dividing the annual 2p reserve additions in boe by arc s annual production in boe management uses this measure to determine the relative change of its reserves base over a period of time reserve life index or rli is calculated by dividing the reserves in boe in the referenced category by the midpoint production guidance in boe for the following year management uses this measure to determine how long the booked reserves will last at current production rates if no further reserves were added recycle ratio is calculated by dividing the operating netback for the year in dollars per boe by f d costs or fd a costs for the year in dollars per boe finding and development costs or f d costs are calculated by dividing the sum of the total capital expenditures for the year in dollars by the change in reserves within the applicable reserves category in boe f d costs including fdc includes all capital expenditures in the year as well as the change in fdc required to bring the reserves within the specified reserves category on production finding development and acquisition costs or fd a costs are calculated by dividing the sum of the total capital expenditures for the year inclusive of the net acquisition costs and disposition proceeds in dollars by the change in reserves within the applicable reserves category inclusive of changes due to acquisitions and dispositions in boe fd a costs including fdc includes all capital expenditures in the year inclusive of the net acquisition costs and disposition proceeds as well as the change in fdc required to bring the reserves within the specified reserves category on production both f d and fd a costs take into account reserves revisions and capital revisions during the year the aggregate of the costs incurred in the financial year and changes during that year in estimated fdc may not reflect total f d costs related to reserves additions for that year f d costs and fd a costs have been presented in this news release because acquisitions and dispositions can have a significant impact on arc s ongoing reserves replacement costs and excluding these amounts could result in an inaccurate portrayal of its cost structure management uses f d and fd a costs as measures of its ability to execute its capital programs and success in doing so and of its asset quality operating netback is calculated using commodity sales from production excluding realized gains and losses on commodity risk management contracts less royalties operating and transportation expenses calculated on a per boe equivalent basis management uses this measure to benchmark operating results between areas and or time periods finding and development recycle ratio or f d recycle ratio is calculated by dividing the operating netback in dollars per boe by the f d costs in dollars per boe for the year finding development and

in 1989 caracas exploded into protests riots and looting somewhere between an estimated few hundred to 3 000 people were killed mostly at the hands of a brutal crackdown by government security forces it was a surprise to all of us said francisco rodríguez chief economist with torino economics who was a college student at the time in caracas the venezuela in which i grew up was a very confident nation and it trusted its democracy and it valued its democratic system we all thought that this was a very stable system it had been a democracy since 1958 so during the period of the 1970s where almost all of latin america was in military dictatorship venezuelan democracy had survived venezuela was also rich very rich the wealthiest nation in latin america video of comercial sobre venezuela en los años 50 news commercial about venezuela in the 1950s and so venezuela with the world s largest oil reserves hummed along the price of oil collapses significantly in the 1980s so there s not a lot of money to go around said javier corrales a political scientist at amherst college in massachusetts who also did research in venezuela in the 1990s when oil prices plummeted venezuela was suddenly deep in debt to get assistance from the international monetary fund the country s leaders pursued neoliberal market oriented solutions the government cut back on social programs eliminated price controls on gas and other consumer goods and privatized state owned companies it was all done to try and make the economy run more efficiently it didn t work one theory is that the medicine that was applied was the wrong medicine so you make the patient worse said corrales an alternative argument is that they didn t have enough time to apply the medicine when the government cut subsidies for gas the cost to ride the bus immediately rose 30 percent and people quickly took to the streets in 1989 you either had to tell voters what you were going to do and face the prospect of losing the election or not tell them what you were going to do and then do it once you gained power rodríguez says venezuelans increasingly felt deceived by politicians who imposed tough belt tightening measures you either had to tell voters what you were going to do and face the prospect of losing the election or not tell them what you were going to do and then do it once you gained power he said venezuela s government also overvalued its currency exchange rate for a prolonged period basically it made the venezuelan bolívar artificially strong this benefited venezuela s rich it allowed them to cheaply buy us dollars and set up foreign bank accounts to shield themselves from higher inflation or economic crisis back home the result a lot of capital left venezuela there was an additional reason to prop up the venezuelan bolívar to give the currency more spending power abroad why because they wanted to appeal to voters because they wanted to say imported goods are cheap rodríguez said yes a strong currency allowed venezuelans to buy cheap imports but it also stifled domestic growth if you can import cars or sofas for less than building them at home there s no economic incentive to develop your own industry the big mistake was not diversifying the economy and being so dependent and so reliant on the petroleum sector that s virtually the only thing that venezuela produces the big mistake was not diversifying the economy and being so dependent and so reliant on the petroleum sector that s virtually the only thing that venezuela produces said michael shifter president of the inter american dialogue a think tank in washington so you have an economy almost entirely dependent on oil plunging oil prices and failing economic policies which also led to runaway inflation in the late 1980s on top of all that corruption in venezuela was rampant everything everybody said shifter the system was that they would take off the top of these huge profits they would not distribute that to public funds and public spending but would be used for private use no huge surprise inequality and resentment grew protesters shout out for the end of political and economic corruption in front of the venezuelan congress september 1999 credit reuters there was a desire for change and especially for the poor they wanted a voice and chávez i think very effectively tapped into that desire it would ve been much wiser in retrospect to have had more attention on targeted social policies in the 1990s shifter said there was a desire for change and especially for the poor they wanted a voice and chávez i think very effectively tapped into that desire chávez was a leftist who appealed to venezuela s poor and successfully ran for president in 1998 at the time chávez was a young charismatic military man a third party candidate running within a historically two party system as president chávez also ran venezuela s economy almost entirely on oil but he benefited from higher prices chávez invested a lot of the profits into social programs to help the poor and many venezuelans loved him for it but there was a lot of cronyism and inept management within his administration chávez died in office in 2013 of cancer his successor nicolás maduro stepped in and ran the economy into the ground it seems like venezuela has come full circle shifter said the problems today are magnified but they re the same kind the corruption is monumental the mismanagement is monumental and so it s interesting to reflect on the same themes being touched on by juan guaidó the interim president of venezuela as was touched on by hugo chávez 20 years ago and while the problems in venezuela today are considerably worse shifter said there are economic lessons for whatever government comes next in caracas

play with the potential for significant volumes of recoverable resources the area includes dry gas liquids rich gas and tight oil development opportunities it is one of the largest and lowest cost resource plays in north america arc has a significant presence in northeast british columbia and at ante creek and pouce coupe in alberta with a total land position of 1 122 net sections arc s land position in the montney decreased seven per cent relative to year end 2017 and reflects arc s active management of its lands the decrease in 2018 is primarily attributed to the disposition of arc s blueberry lands in british columbia and non core montney expiries in alberta glj was commissioned in 2018 and in 2017 to conduct independent resources evaluations for arc s lands in the montney region including dawson parkland tower sunrise sunset sundown septimus attachie and red creek in northeast british columbia as well as ante creek and pouce coupe in alberta the evaluated areas the ante creek resources evaluation was performed in 2018 only prior to 2018 ante creek was not a part of the evaluation the independent resources evaluation was effective december 31 2018 based on glj forecast pricing and foreign exchange rates at january 1 2019 the glj independent resources evaluation conducted in respect of 2017 was effective december 31 2017 based on glj forecast pricing and foreign

the 2018 independent resources evaluation and 2017 independent resources evaluation the results of the 2018 and 2017 resources evaluations are summarized in the discussion and tables that follow the evaluation reaffirmed that arc s montney assets provide significant long term growth opportunities with considerable resources extending well beyond existing booked reserves and even the current estimates of ecr arc s montney assets provide optionality for future growth through commodity price cycles given the diversity of arc s montney landholdings with exposure to crude oil liquids rich natural gas and dry natural gas arc believes that the concentrated nature of its montney assets will result in additional upside based on expected capital efficiencies arc s 2018 capital development program was primarily focused on montney development which was inclusive of crude oil liquids rich gas and dry gas opportunities in northeast british columbia and northern alberta arc s capital development program consisted of drilling 72 gross operated wells 72 net wells comprised of 23 dry gas wells and one disposal well at sunrise 15 tight oil wells at tower 13 wells at dawson that were a combination of dry gas and liquids rich wells 10 tight oil wells at ante creek eight liquids rich wells in parkland one liquids rich well at attachie and one dry gas well at sundown tpiip for the shale gas bearing lands in the evaluated areas decreased four per cent to 101 8 tcf relative to 2017 and dpiip for the shale gas bearing lands decreased by five per cent to 43 4 tcf the decreases in tpiip and dpiip were a result of the disposition of arc s montney lands at blueberry in 2018 shale gas ecr was evaluated on an unrisked and risked basis in 2018 and was subdivided into the maturity

subclass 5 there is no certainty that any portion of the resources will be discovered if discovered there is no certainty that it will be commercially viable to produce any portion of the resources based upon the foregoing analysis as well as arc s expertise in the montney formation in northeast british columbia and alberta it is expected that significant additional reserves will be developed in the future with continued drilling success on currently undeveloped montney acreage together with further development completions refinements and improved economic conditions historic drilling success and recoveries on the more fully developed montney acreage abundant well log and production test data and the application of increased drilling densities support arc s belief that significant additional resources will be recovered continuous development through multi year exploration and development programs and significant levels of future capital expenditures are required in order for additional resources to be recovered in the future the principal risks that would inhibit the recovery of additional reserves relate to the potential for variations in the quality of the montney formation where minimal well data currently exists access to the capital which would be required to develop the resources low commodity prices that would curtail the economics of development and the future performance of wells regulatory approvals access to the required services at the appropriate cost and the effectiveness of well fracturing technology and applications for ecr to be converted to reserves management and the board of directors need to ascertain commercial production rates then develop firm plans including timing infrastructure and the commitment of capital confirmation of commercial productivity is generally required before the company can prepare firm development plans and commit required capital for the development of the ecr additional contingencies are related to the current lack of infrastructure required to develop the resources in a relatively quick time frame as continued delineation occurs some resources currently classified as ecr are expected to be re classified to reserves definitions of oil and gas resources and reserves reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and natural gas and related substances anticipated to be recoverable from known accumulations as of a given date based on the analysis of drilling geological geophysical and engineering data the use of established technology and specified economic conditions which are generally accepted as being reasonable reserves are classified according to the degree of certainty associated with the estimates as follows proved reserves are those reserves that can be estimated with a high degree of certainty to be recoverable it is likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the estimated proved reserves probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves it is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the sum of the estimated proved plus probable reserves resources encompasses all petroleum quantities that originally existed on or within the earth s crust in naturally occurring accumulations including discovered and undiscovered recoverable and unrecoverable plus quantities already produced total resources is equivalent to total petroleum initially in place resources are classified in the following categories total petroleum initially in place tpiip is that quantity of petroleum that is estimated to exist originally in naturally occurring accumulations it includes that quantity of petroleum that is estimated as of a given date to be contained in known accumulations prior to production plus those estimated quantities in accumulations yet to be discovered discovered petroleum initially in place dpiip is that quantity of petroleum that is estimated as of a given date to be contained in known accumulations prior to production the recoverable portion of dpiip includes production reserves and contingent resources the remainder is unrecoverable contingent resources are those quantities of petroleum estimated as of a given date to be potentially recoverable from known accumulations using established technology or technology under development but which are not currently considered to be commercially recoverable due to one or more contingencies economic contingent resources ecr are those contingent resources which are currently economically recoverable project maturity subclass development not viable is defined as a contingent resource that is not viable in the conditions prevailing at the effective date of the evaluation and where no further data acquisition or evaluation is planned and therefore has not been assigned a low chance of development project maturity subclass development pending is defined as a contingent resource that has been assigned a high chance of development and the resolution of final conditions for development are being actively pursued project maturity subclass development unclarified is defined as a contingent resource that requires further appraisal to clarify the potential for development and has been assigned a lower chance of development until contingencies can be clearly defined undiscovered petroleum initially in place upiip is that quantity of petroleum that is estimated on a given date to be contained in accumulations yet to be discovered the recoverable portion of upiip is referred to as prospective resources and the remainder as unrecoverable prospective resources are those quantities of petroleum estimated as of a given date to be potentially recoverable from undiscovered accumulations by application of future development projects unrecoverable is that portion of dpiip and upiip quantities which is estimated as of a given date not to be recoverable by future development projects a portion of these quantities may become recoverable in the future as commercial circumstances change or technological developments occur the remaining portion may never be recovered due to the physical chemical constraints represented by subsurface interaction of fluids and reservoir rocks uncertainty ranges are described by the coge handbook as low best and high estimates for reserves and resources the best estimate is considered to be the best estimate of the quantity that will actually be recovered it is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the best estimate if probabilistic methods are used there should be at least a 50 per cent probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the best estimate information regarding disclosure on oil and gas reserves resources and operational information all amounts in this news release are stated in

unless otherwise specified all reserves volumes in this news release and all information derived therefrom are based on company gross reserves using forecast prices and costs this news release contains metrics commonly used in the oil and gas industry each of these metrics is determined by arc as set out below these metrics are reserve replacement reserve life index recycle ratio finding and development costs finding development and acquisition costs operating netback finding and development recycle ratio and finding development and acquisition recycle ratio these metrics do not have standardized meanings and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities as such they should not be used to make comparisons management uses these oil and gas metrics for its own performance measurements and to provide shareholders with measures to compare arc s performance over time however such measures are not reliable indicators of arc s future performance and future performance may not compare to the performance in previous periods reserve replacement is calculated by dividing the annual 2p reserve additions in boe by arc s annual production in boe management uses this measure to determine the relative change of its reserves base over a period of time reserve life index or rli is calculated by dividing the reserves in boe in the referenced category by the midpoint production guidance in boe for the following year management uses this measure to determine how long the booked reserves will last at current production rates if no further reserves were added recycle ratio is calculated by dividing the operating netback for the year in dollars per boe by f d costs or fd a costs for the year in dollars per boe finding and development costs or f d costs are calculated by dividing the sum of the total capital expenditures for the year in dollars by the change in reserves within the applicable reserves category in boe f d costs including fdc includes all capital expenditures in the year as well as the change in fdc required to bring the reserves within the specified reserves category on production finding development and acquisition costs or fd a costs are calculated by dividing the sum of the total capital expenditures for the year inclusive of the net acquisition costs and disposition proceeds in dollars by the change in reserves within the applicable reserves category inclusive of changes due to acquisitions and dispositions in boe fd a costs including fdc includes all capital expenditures in the year inclusive of the net acquisition costs and disposition proceeds as well as the change in fdc required to bring the reserves within the specified reserves category on production both f d and fd a costs take into account reserves revisions and capital revisions during the year the aggregate of the costs incurred in the financial year and changes during that year in estimated fdc may not reflect total f d costs related to reserves additions for that year f d costs and fd a costs have been presented in this news release because acquisitions and dispositions can have a significant impact on arc s ongoing reserves replacement costs and excluding these amounts could result in an inaccurate portrayal of its cost structure management uses f d and fd a costs as measures of its ability to execute its capital

reform act of 1995 the use of words such as anticipates expects intends plans confident that and believes among others generally identify forward looking statements these forward looking statements are based on currently available operating financial economic and other information and are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control could cause actual future results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements specific factors that might cause such a difference include but are not limited to i mattel s ability to design develop produce manufacture source and ship products on a timely and cost effective basis as well as interest in and purchase of those products by retail customers and consumers in quantities and at prices that will be sufficient to profitably recover mattel s costs ii downturns in economic conditions affecting mattel s markets which can negatively impact retail customers and consumers and which can result in lower employment levels lower consumer disposable income and spending including lower spending on purchases of mattel s products iii other factors which can lower discretionary consumer spending such as higher costs for fuel and food drops in the value of homes or other consumer assets and high levels of consumer debt iv potential difficulties or delays mattel may experience in implementing cost savings and efficiency enhancing initiatives v other economic and public health conditions or regulatory changes in the markets in which mattel and its customers and suppliers operate which could create delays or increase mattel s costs such as higher commodity prices labor costs or transportation costs or outbreaks of disease vi currency fluctuations including movements in foreign exchange rates which can lower mattel s net revenues and earnings and significantly impact mattel s costs vii the concentration of mattel s customers potentially increasing the negative impact to mattel of difficulties experienced by any of mattel s customers including the bankruptcy of toys r us inc or changes in their purchasing or selling patterns viii the future willingness of licensors of entertainment properties for which mattel currently has licenses or would seek to have licenses in the future to license those products to mattel ix the inventory policies of mattel s retail customers including retailers potential decisions to lower their inventories even if it results in lost sales as well as the concentration of mattel s revenues in the second half of the year which coupled with reliance by retailers on quick response inventory management techniques increases the risk of underproduction of popular items overproduction of less popular items and failure to achieve compressed shipping schedules x the increased costs of developing more sophisticated digital and smart technology products and the corresponding supply chain and design challenges associated with such products xi work disruptions which may impact mattel s ability to manufacture or deliver product in a timely and cost effective manner xii the bankruptcy of toys r us inc or other of mattel s significant retailers or the general lack of success of one of mattel s significant retailers which could negatively impact mattel s revenues or bad debt exposure xiii the impact of competition on revenues margins and other aspects of mattel s business including the ability to offer products which consumers choose to buy instead of competitor s products the ability to secure maintain and renew popular licenses and the ability to attract and retain talented employees xiv the risk of product recalls or product liability suits and costs associated with product safety regulations xv changes in laws or regulations in the united states and or in other major markets such as china in which mattel operates including without limitation with respect to taxes tariffs trade policies or product safety which may increase mattel s product costs and other costs of doing business and reduce mattel s earnings xvi failure to realize the planned benefits from any investments or acquisitions made by mattel xvii the impact of other market conditions third party actions or approvals and competition which could reduce demand for mattel s products or delay or increase the cost of implementation of mattel s initiatives or alter mattel s actions and reduce actual results xviii changes in financing markets or the inability of mattel to obtain financing on attractive terms xix the impact of litigation or arbitration decisions or settlement actions and xx other risks and uncertainties as may be described in mattel s periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission including the risk factors section of mattel s annual report on form 10 k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2017 and mattel s quarterly reports on form 10 q for fiscal year 2018 as well as in mattel s other public statements mattel does not update forward looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so non gaap financial measures to supplement our financial results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap mattel presents certain non gaap financial measures within the meaning of regulation g promulgated by the securities and exchange commission the non gaap financial measures that mattel uses in this earnings release include gross sales adjusted gross profit adjusted gross margin adjusted other selling and administrative expenses adjusted operating income loss adjusted earnings loss per share earnings before interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda adjusted ebitda and constant currency mattel uses these metrics to analyze its continuing operations and to monitor assess and identify meaningful trends in its operating and financial performance and each is discussed in detail below mattel believes that the disclosure of non gaap financial measures provides useful supplemental information to investors to be able to better evaluate ongoing business performance and certain components of the company s results these measures are not and should not be viewed as substitutes for gaap financial measures reconciliations of the non gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures are attached to this earnings release as exhibits and to our earnings slide presentation as an appendix this earnings release and our earnings slide presentation are available on mattel s investor relations website under the subheading financial information earnings releases gross sales gross sales represent sales to customers excluding the impact of sales adjustments net sales as reported include the impact of sales adjustments such as trade discounts and other allowances mattel presents changes in gross sales as a metric for comparing its aggregate brand and geographic results to highlight significant trends in mattel s business changes in gross sales are discussed because while mattel records the details of such sales adjustments in its financial accounting systems at the time of sale such sales adjustments are generally not associated with brands and individual products making net sales less meaningful since sales adjustments are determined by customer rather than at the brand level mattel believes that the disclosure of gross sales by brand is useful supplemental information for investors to be able to assess the performance of its underlying brands e g barbie and also enhances their ability to compare sales trends over time adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin represent reported gross profit and reported gross margin respectively adjusted to exclude asset impairments and severance and restructuring expenses adjusted gross margin represents mattel s adjusted gross profit as a percentage of net sales adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin are presented to provide additional perspective on underlying trends in mattel s core gross profit and gross margin which mattel believes is useful supplemental information for investors to be able to gauge and compare mattel s current business performance from one period to another adjusted other selling and administrative expenses adjusted other selling and administrative expenses represents mattel s reported other selling and administrative expenses adjusted to exclude asset impairments non recurring executive compensation severance and restructuring expenses and sale of assets which are not part of mattel s core business adjusted other selling and administrative expenses is presented to provide additional perspective on underlying trends in mattel s core other selling and administrative expenses which mattel believes is useful supplemental information for investors to be able to gauge and compare mattel s current business performance from one period to another adjusted operating income loss adjusted operating income loss represents mattel s reported operating loss adjusted to exclude the impact of asset impairments non recurring executive compensation severance and restructuring expenses and sale of assets which are not part of mattel s core business adjusted operating income loss is presented to provide additional perspective on underlying trends in mattel s core operating results which mattel believes is useful supplemental information for investors to be able to gauge and compare mattel s current business performance from one period to another adjusted earnings loss per share adjusted earnings loss per share represents mattel s reported diluted earnings loss per common share adjusted to exclude the impact of asset impairments non recurring executive compensation severance and restructuring expenses and venezuela matters which are not part of mattel s core business the aggregate tax effect of the adjustments is calculated by tax effecting the adjustments by the current effective tax rate adjusting for certain discrete tax items and dividing by the reported weighted average number of common shares adjusted earnings loss per share also excludes the impact of the tax for deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings and changes to mattel s indefinite reinvestment assertion both as a result of the u s tax act and the impact of the valuation allowance established for the portion of deferred tax assets mattel believes will likely not be realized adjusted earnings loss per share is presented to provide additional perspective on underlying trends in mattel s core business mattel believes it is useful supplemental information for investors to gauge and compare mattel s current earnings results from one period to another adjusted earnings loss per share is a performance measure and should not be used as a measure of liquidity ebitda and adjusted ebitda ebitda represents mattel s net income loss adjusted to exclude the impact of interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda represents ebitda adjusted to exclude the impact of asset impairments share based compensation severance and restructuring expenses sale of assets and venezuela matters which are not part of mattel s core business mattel believes ebitda and adjusted ebitda are useful supplemental information for investors to gauge and compare mattel s business performance to other companies in our industry with similar capital structures the presentation of adjusted ebitda differs from how we will calculate ebitda for purposes of covenant compliance under the indenture governing our 6 75 senior notes due 2025 and the syndicated facility agreement governing our senior secured revolving credit facilities because of these limitations ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business as a result we rely primarily on our gaap results and use ebitda and adjusted ebitda only supplementally constant currency percentage changes in results expressed in constant currency are presented excluding the impact from changes in currency exchange rates to present this information mattel calculates constant currency information by translating current period and prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar using consistent exchange rates the constant currency exchange rates are determined by mattel at the beginning of each year and are applied consistently during the year they are generally different from the actual exchange rates in effect during the current or prior period due to volatility in actual foreign exchange rates mattel considers whether any changes to the constant currency rates are appropriate at the beginning of each year the exchange rates used for these constant currency calculations are generally based on prior year actual exchange rates the difference between the current period and prior period results using the consistent exchange rates reflects the changes in the underlying performance results excluding the impact from changes in currency exchange rates mattel analyzes constant currency results to provide additional perspective on changes in underlying trends in mattel s operating performance mattel believes that the disclosure of the percentage change in constant currency is useful supplemental information for investors to be able to gauge mattel s current business performance and the longer term strength of its overall business since foreign currency changes could potentially mask underlying sales trends the disclosure of the percentage change in constant currency enhances investor s ability to compare financial results from one period to another about mattel

the federal reserve signalled last week it had finished raising interest rates at least for a while when it chose to keep them unchanged the change in stance was a sweeping pivot for the us central bank just weeks after the last quarter point rate rise in december the final of four increases in 2018 when it lifted the federal funds rate target to a range of 2 25 per cent to 2 5 per cent that was the ninth increase since 2015 when it started gradually increasing the cost of borrowing with the fed indicating there would be more to come to in 2019 however the federal open market committee said in a statement last week it will be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate sam instone director of financial advisory aes international says it is likely there won t be any interest rate rises this year at all especially in this quarter the international situation is concerning and the federal reserve remains cautious he says trade tensions economic slowdowns in the eu and china and of course brexit are placing pressure on the global economy added to that is a burgeoning debt bubble particularly on corporate levels so it s prudent of the federal reserve to act swiftly and pause any possible interest rate increases for the near future us stocks rallied on the news of the fed s more dovish approach while treasury yields fell and the dollar sank as investors digested the new message the move also followed months of criticism from president donald trump for raising rates too much who later tweeted dow just broke 25 000 tremendous news but why is this significant for residents in the uae tim fox chief economist at emirates nbd dubai s largest bank says given the dirham currency peg to the us dollar monetary policy is effectively set by the fed in washington this means that interest rate changes in 2019 will depend on what the fed does at the end of last year markets were anticipating two to four us interest rate hikes this year which could have meant interest rates being raised by as much as 1 per cent in the uae in total however due to slowing global growth market expectations have reduced since then to the point where they are hardly discounting any rate increases at all in the us in 2019 and by extension in the uae either the central bank of the uae raised its key rate by 25 basis points to 2 75 per cent on december 19 following the fed s decision to hike the funds rate by 25 bps avoid typical lifestyle temptations during this time such as spontaneous luxury purchases upscaling homes or cars however the situation could still change ambareen musa founder and chief executive of the financial comparison site souqalmal com says the fed s more cautious tone doesn t mean there won t be any rate hikes in 2019 the fed s policy stance is on the lines of a wait and see approach so there s no reason why bank customers should take any drastic decisions she adds mr fox says the us economy is still in relatively good shape so it probably still makes sense to factor in the possibility of one or two rate hikes over the year as a whole this may serve to restrain borrowing in the uae which would also be a further headwind to discretionary consumption and to overall growth he adds mr instone advises residents to exercise better financial habits whether it s paying off debt saving more spending less or seeking financial advice avoid typical lifestyle temptations during this time such as spontaneous luxury purchases upscaling homes or cars these decisions could come back to haunt you if interest rates rise and loan repayments and credit card instalments become difficult to afford here s how a gentler interest rate policy from the us affects the finances of uae residents savers jonathan rawling chief financial officer of uae financial comparison site yallacompare says some economists are still predicting two interest rate increases in 2019 down from an earlier outlook of three generally speaking this is good news for savers and bad news for borrowers he adds ms musa says the current interest rate environment is ideal for savers now may be a good time to lock in a high interest rate on fixed deposits or park extra cash in high interest savings accounts she says local banks are already offering some very unique savings products that offer better than ever returns coupled with little to no restriction on withdrawals it would be worth exploring such options especially if you re looking for low risk savings products according to yallacompare s consumer confidence survey for the fourth quarter of 2018 57 per cent of uae residents say they are saving less than they were in 2017 while 48 per cent claim to have less credit card debt this suggests to us that uae consumers are taking a prudent approach and paying down debt rather than saving says mr rawling borrowers lower interest rates mean cheaper debt says mr instone who advises anyone applying for loans and credit cards to err on the side of caution as the situation could change avoid the temptation of taking on more debt than you can afford it s also important to note that lower interest rates signal slower economic growth meaning fewer job opportunities and salary increases it s particularly necessary for residents to save for a rainy day he adds ms musa says with no imminent tightening of monetary policy by the regulator local banks may be more open to keeping credit card and loan rates as competitive as possible this would essentially give prospective borrowers some breathing room and allow both retail and business customers to access finance at reasonably lower borrowing costs in the future the move also helps alleviate rising worry among potential borrowers who were seeing loans consistently become more expensive for those looking to sign up for a mortgage the advice is always to lock in the lowest rate possible with no clarity on whether rates will stay stable go up or go down ms musa advises browsing the market carefully given this uncertainty mortgage applicants can either choose to lock in the lowest possible fixed rate for the first few years or opt for a variable rate arrangement and negotiate lower bank margins for the entire tenure she says borrowers should also factor in other costs such as processing fees and partial settlement fees that certainly impact the overall attractiveness of a home finance product investors gordon robertson director of financial advisory group investme financial services in dubai says in the past the federal reserve was more accommodative to stock markets than the economy itself when they do see any evidence of a crisis then the fed lowers the rates he adds rightly or wrongly this pumping of money into the system has benefited the stock market mr robertson says fed chair jerome powell s rate hiking schedule came after he found a mismatch between the economy and the excess free money available then came the worst year for the markets since the financial crisis so at the last interest rate meeting mr powell talked about global cross currents he is turning us monetary policy into a global monetary policy says mr robertson as such we now have a dovish fed this should result in stronger stock markets a weaker dollar and rates that are unlikely to rise until either inflation raises its ugly head or a recession brings a drop in rates despite the change in policy mr instone who advises investing in a globally diversified portfolio says investors should not take any drastic action simply stay invested in low cost index funds and focus on your long term goals don t mess with your investment as doing so can result in poorer performance he says it s important for investors to remain unaffected by any economic or market shifts block out the noise don t speculate and exercise discipline your investment strategy should be working for you during both good and bad times mr robertson says a potentially weaker dollar means those sending money home for investments overseas will receive less for their dirhams i suggest buying the currency forward thus locking in your foreign exchange exposure he adds there are many banks and foreign exchange platforms that can help the latter tends to be cheaper but in both instances you will need a deposit which is typically 10 per cent of the amount you are hedging

call participants prepared remarks operator good morning and welcome to the crown holdings fourth quarter 2018 conference call your lines have been placed in a listen only mode until the question and answer session please be advised that this conference is being recorded i would now like to turn the call over to mr thomas kelly senior vice president and chief financial officer sir you may begin thomas a kelly senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you eric and good morning with me on today s call is tim donahue president and chief executive officer on this call as in the earnings release we will be making a number of forward looking statements actual results could vary materially from such statements additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to vary is contained in the press release and in our sec filings including our form 10 k for 2017 and subsequent filings earnings for the quarter were 0 40 per share compared to a loss of 0 67 in the prior year quarter comparable earnings per share were 1 in the quarter versus 0 84 in 2017 net sales grew 26 in 2018 versus 2017 primarily due to the acquisition of the transit packaging business increased beverage can volumes and the pass through of higher material costs were offset by lower food can volumes and currency translation segment income in the quarter improved primarily due to the signode acquisition as higher global beverage can volumes were offset by lower european food can volumes and start up costs at the two new beverage can plants in europe adjusted free cash flow of 636 million was a bit ahead of our guidance of 625 million year end pro forma net leverage of 4 6 times as shown in the release was consistent with our guidance and we expect the ratio to decline by about half a turn each year going forward as we use cash flows to delever as outlined in the release we estimate the first quarter 2019 adjusted earnings of between 1 per share and 1 10 per share and full year adjusted earnings of between 5 20 per share and 5 40 per share at current exchange rates these estimates include a headwind of approximately 53 million or 32 per share after tax and pension expense reported below income from operations largely due to a decline in pension assets and an increase in discount rates compared to the prior year these estimates also assume a full year tax rate of between 25 and 26 we currently estimate 2019 full year adjusted free cash flow of approximately 775 million with between 400 million and 425 million in capital spending we expect cash pension contributions in line with our 2018 contributions of 20 million with that i ll turn the call over to tim timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer thank you tom and good morning to everyone as reflected in last night s earnings release and as tom just discussed we had a solid fourth quarter and full year 2018 performance higher beverage can shipments and better than expected results in the newly acquired transit packaging business offset weak european food can demand the result of an historically poor harvest for the year adjusted earnings increased 23 over 2017 and free cash flow at 636 million or 4 75 per share exceeded our earlier target in response to increasing global demand for cans we completed four new beverage projects in 2018 and we expect to commercialize the newly announced can plant in brazil in late 2019 the deleveraging of the balance sheet following the signode acquisition is on plan with net leverage at 4 6 times at the end of 2018 we have reaffirmed our 2019 free cash flow target of 775 million well above 5 per share and we project that by the end of the year 2020 our leverage will be back to preacquisition levels in the mid 3s which is only two years and nine months post the acquisition the us dollar gained momentum against most foreign currencies in the back half of 2018 with a comparative negative impact on sales and segment income in the fourth quarter of 53 million and 9 million respectively and for your modeling purposes q4 currency impacts by operating segment and segment income were as follows americas and beverage americas beverage and european beverage 2 million each and european food 5 million at today s rates currency will be a headwind in the first two quarters of 19 and will abate in the back half of the year as a reminder and as discussed previously double digit increases in both tinplate steel and aluminum in 2018 were successfully passed through accordingly as raw material cost increases are passed through on a one for one basis with no impact on absolute margins there is a result and decline in percentage margins for 2019 we expect tinplate steel to be up in the low 20s in the united states as us producers price just below the tariff european steel prices are expected to reflect increases in the low to mid single digits in americas beverage overall unit volumes in the fourth quarter were up 5 with similar gains noted in both north and south american operations segment income in the quarter reflects in equal parts supplier metal issue third party in sourcing in brazil and elevated freight costs in north america looking ahead those items are behind us and we do not anticipate any impact from them in 2019 we do however expect to realize the benefits of improved pricing in north america unit volumes in european beverage were down 2 in the quarter as demand in saudi arabia remains soft continental europe was flat in the quarter as we remain sold out and look forward to the new capacity coming online from the new factories in italy and spain income in the quarter was down as expected and reflects the ongoing softness in saudi combined with the start up costs in the new plants in 2019 we expect the first quarter to reflect start up costs in currency with gradual improvement throughout the year fourth quarter demand in european food continue to reflect the poor 2018 harvest as customers continued to destock through the fourth quarter unit volumes were down 4 in the quarter and 6 for the year in line with the overall market lower shipments combined with lower production levels and foreign currency led to a decline in segment income during the fourth quarter however we are assuming a return to normal harvest levels in 2019 and as in european beverage much of the currency headwind will be felt in the first two quarters of 2019 segment income in asia pacific advanced 11 both in the fourth quarter and for the full year unit volume demand increased 12 in southeast asia with china also advancing 4 in the quarter in accordance with our strategy to align our efforts and resources to markets which offer acceptable returns we closed two beverage can facilities in china in the month of december one of the lines has already been dismantled and is being prepared for relocation to southeast asia the other will soon follow china now only represents approximately 100 million of our more than 11 billion in global sales given the repositioning of assets from china to southeast asia during 2019 our income results in the asia pacific segment are expected to be consistent with 2018 levels we do expect that in 2020 the segment will resume the income growth seen over the last several years net sales in transit packaging increased 5 in the fourth quarter and 7 for the year ebitda advanced 20 million or 5 over 2017 as the business continues to benefit from its broad product offering across a global platform continued strong demand across the protective asia and equipment businesses all contributed to the growth a lot of moving parts for the transit business but overall sales growth can be summarized as follows volume up 4 in the fourth quarter and 3 for the year price mainly pass throughs up 4 and 3 in the quarter and full year and currency was a negative 3 in the quarter and was negligible for the year although not included in the comparative foreign currency numbers we discussed earlier segment income in the transit business experienced a 3 million headwind from currency in the fourth quarter and for the year it was a 1 million tailwind while performance in 2018 was strong we remind you that we believe this is a business that will grow at gdp type levels so you should think 2 to 3 before currency effects with modest capital requirements this is a highly accretive cash flow business with a conversion rate at 90 or higher we d like to thank those of you who were able to join us for analyst day in december hopefully you came away with a better appreciation of the business after meeting just a few of the many outstanding people who deliver high quality products and services to thousands of customers across numerous end markets we know that without another public comp out there that it s unfamiliar and it may be a difficult business for many of you to wrap your arms around but that doesn t detract from the fact that this is an excellent business and an excellent platform to create meaningful shareholder value into the future income in non reportables and corporate was level to the prior year for the quarter with aerosols and machinery both performing well so in summary a productive year in 2018 revenues and segment income advanced significantly on the back of an exciting new business since acquisition the business continues to perform above expectations and we believe transit packaging will enhance our future earnings cash flow and shareholder value cash flow was strong in 2018 and will be even stronger in 2019 in 2018 we completed several projects to expand global beverage can capacity and the future outlook for beverage cans is truly exciting all signs currently point to a future where the can will continue to win share with existing products and will be the package of choice for new product introductions as consumers increasingly embrace the can as the responsible package choice for beverage applications if government ngos and retailers among others are serious about limiting packaging waste and increasing recycling rates we believe there is no reason why the food can should not follow close behind and then just before we open the call to questions we ask that you please limit yourself to two initial questions so that everybody will have a chance to ask their question you re certainly welcome to jump back into the queue for a follow up and with that eric we re now ready to take questions questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions our first question comes from gabe hajde from wells fargo securities your line is open gabe hajde wells fargo analyst tim and tom good morning gentlemen thomas a kelly senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer good morning gabe gabe hajde wells fargo analyst i guess first question would be on european food and i guess can you size up for us maybe tom the unabsorbed fixed overhead in the second half and then maybe where inventories are to start the year appreciating that we re potentially heading into sort of a rebound year in 2019 and then kind of a follow on how might the the normalized production rates impact earnings cadence over the year in that segment timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer so let me let me take that gabe i think that at the end of the year here inventory levels are reflective of where we would like them at the end of any given year regardless of what the past harvest was it s really a january 1 to december 31 business and projecting forward a normal harvest we believe we have appropriate levels of inventory at this point having brought the inventories down from lower production levels understanding that beginning some time in q3 through the end of q3 in october when we talked to you we knew that not only was the third quarter demand soft that the fourth quarter would remain soft as customers destock they re not filling from bulk there is not as much product in bulk so there s there s not the filling required so in the fourth quarter you ve got actual shipments down 4 for the year or 6 so that s fairly significant that s a lot of your profit dollars there and i think currency we said was about 5 million in the quarter for food and then obviously with much lower production levels to get the inventories to appropriate levels that makes up the balance try to stay away from too many specifics in dollar terms but given a more normal harvest we expect that the third quarter of 2019 will show notable improvement over 2018 gabe hajde wells fargo analyst okay and then can you help us i guess the europe beverage and i know that these are our models and not yours but was a bit lighter than what we were looking for i was looking for the start up costs i kind of think about those as 2 million to 3 million a facility is there anything about that that wouldn t be accurate or are there a little bit more for some reason timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer no i mean the one facility is big so you might want to think about it a little bit more than that but that s right i think that we like you we were probably a bit disappointed with the european beverage results i ll characterize our assessment of the fourth quarter by segment real quick and then i ll come back to european beverage for you gabe just so we answer the question i think americas beverage more or less came in on top of where we expected both european beverage and food were a little bit lighter than we expected asia and transit were stronger than we expected and so but but we like you we were disappointed i think one of the challenges we currently have in european beverages were sold out and as you know volume cures a lot of the other issues so there are always a number of issues in any business there s price compression there s other cost you have a small generally the fourth quarter s a very small quarter in european beverage just given the weather in the northern hemisphere especially in the some of the european countries so you put start up cost and currency into a fourth quarter has a much bigger impact and then let s not forget the middle east where we re probably the middle east was i think down at segment income we were probably down 35 million 36 million for the year and perhaps a little bit more than 25 of that was in the fourth quarter but we desperately need the new capacity from the new facilities because we are sold out in europe and we re missing opportunity that we don t otherwise want to miss and so we ll bring those lines up but yeah we were we were disappointed in the performance like you are gabe hajde wells fargo analyst thanks for all the color tim timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from anthony pettinari citigroup your line is now open anthony pettinari citigroup analyst good morning timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer good morning anthony pettinari citigroup analyst in americas you talked about the headwinds from the metal supplier issue and freight and i was wondering if it s possible to quantify the hit that won t repeat in 2019 and then you talked about expecting the benefit from improved pricing in north america understanding you re probably pretty limited in what you can say is it possible to give any sense of a time frame over which these pricing benefits could flow through timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer so i think what i said in the prepared remarks if segment income was down 10 million in the quarter it reflected in equal parts the three issues i discussed so 3 million to 4 million each between the metal issue that i think everybody is well aware of we have the same issue at a much smaller scale we elevated freight and then we until we got a new end module installed and up and running in late fourth quarter in brazil we were sourcing ends from a third party so we we kind of missed out on the profits on the ends for those can sales in the fourth quarter but the module s up and running so we don t expect that next year as for pricing for those customers where contracts have been renewed i e repriced those benefits will begin to accrue from january 1st 2019 probably represents on the order of 20 to 25 of the portfolio and obviously we re endeavoring to try to make sure that was not a one time effort by us and we continue to realize those benefits as future contracts are renewed for 2020 and forward anthony pettinari citigroup analyst okay that s very helpful and then in asia pac is it possible to give any more color in terms of the timeline and the costs associated with relocating i think you said two assets to southeast asia timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer yeah so two two fairly large can lines the one line it should be moving i think it s already created it should be moving anytime now that will go to vietnam the other line we ll dismantle and create that and move that over the next couple of months the costs i guess we did it s not it s not clear in the release what the costs were what were they like 15 million or 16 million just thomas a kelly senior vice president and chief financial officer you re talking about the impairment timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer the chinese yeah thomas a kelly senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think he s talking about the ongoing timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer i m not sure what your question was then anthony thomas a kelly senior vice president and chief financial officer you re talking about operationally or asset impairment anthony pettinari citigroup analyst yeah operationally timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer oh operationally so i think what s going to happen is we re essentially cutting the chinese business in half so you should think of a number and segment income number in the low double digits that doesn t repeat next year that will be made up by southeast asian growth but it just keeps us flat year on year and then obviously as we look forward as those lines get placed into southeast asia we look forward to resuming the income growth across the entire segment i m sorry i thought you were looking for the cost to move the lines and write off the equipment it doesn t get moved anthony pettinari citigroup analyst no no i that s very helpful i ll turn it over timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from scott gaffner barclays your line is open scott gaffner barclays analyst thanks good morning guys timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer good morning scott scott gaffner barclays analyst tim can we just go back to the north american segment sorry the americas segment for a second focusing on north america can you talk about recovery on some of the transit sorry the freight rates from 2018 with your existing contracts how is that going to play out and then the second thing is just on the repricing of the contracts were you able to get anything around better pass through mechanisms just given that 2018 pass through on freight wasn t necessarily as tight as you would like timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer well i mean historically the mechanism for recovering non metal costs which includes freight and a lot of other things was just a ppi multiplier so there was no separate mechanism i can say that with a lot of comfort we don t expect freight cost to be higher in 19 than they were in 18 certainly we are targeting a number that s lower but it s perhaps too early just given we don t know exactly what customer changes to customer order patterns and our freight requirements will be but i ll without giving you too much detail on contracts we didn t look just to improve pricing we look to improve a number of items within contracts because clearly the balance of power have shifted to a point that it was not sustainable between customers and can suppliers scott gaffner barclays analyst okay and when we look at the forecast for 2019 does that include the full benefit of the rework and pricing or is that something we should expect to sort of elevate as we get into the life of this new business timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer well i think what we said was 20 to 25 of the contracts were renewed or repriced at the end of 18 for 19 so you should expect to see improvement in our americas beverage segment as it relates to the north american beverage business and the pricing environment it only reflects 20 to 25 of the contracts scott gaffner barclays analyst okay thanks tim timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from chip dillon vertical research your line is open salvator tiano vertical research analyst yeah this is salvator tiano filling in for chip how are you timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer good morning salvator tiano vertical research analyst great so firstly can you provide us some details about where do you expect minority interest to be both as an expense and also dividends payable to your partners say in 2019 thomas a kelly senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah so on the dividend side for 2019 i d say about 70 million to 75 million and on the income side probably pretty close to this year at about 90 million salvator tiano vertical research analyst okay perfect and then as we look into the to next year s guidance you reiterated the contract essentially we we re aware for i think a little bit over a year has there however any moving parts change because it seems to us we know you have the pension headwind but also it seems like eps even adjusted for that is not growing as much and besides the capex i guess which is growing lower are there any other moving parts that allow you to keep this free cash flow number timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer well that the pension is non cash as tom mentioned and there s always moving parts right it s a it s an 11 billion company with 200 and some factories globally and so from the time we gave you the initial guidance currency has moved against us but we increasingly gained confidence in our ability to appropriately price beverage can contracts in north america and we re going to realize that in 2019 so there s just a couple of items there but there are a whole lot of things that go into it salvator tiano vertical research analyst okay thanks timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer thank you salvator tiano vertical research analyst thank you operator our next question comes from ghansham panjabi r w baird your line is open ghansham panjabi r w baird analyst hi guys good morning timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer good morning ghansham ghansham panjabi r w baird analyst good morning tim so i guess going back to european beverage you ve mentioned a couple of times you re sold out in the region can you just give us characterization of which sub regions within europe you re seeing incremental growth where you re capacity constrained and then over time do you envision repurposing assets away from the middle east just like china toward southeast asia perhaps toward europe because i can t remember the last time the middle east was actually a positive variance year over year timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer yeah so it s been your second point is correct it s been it s been several years since the middle east was a positive move i think we ll the volume environment in the middle east for crown at least will be flatter plus or minus 1 in 19 versus 18 unlikely we repurpose any assets from the middle east to other regions the equipment is quite old and it was when it was installed 80s 90s and then even in the mid 2000s it was used equipment from other facilities around the world in contrast to the two lines we re taking out of china to southeast asia they re brand new lines with five or six years old so that s the middle east i think as you look at continental europe the market s growing 4 to 5 on a base of 65 billion units to 70 billion units so that s 2 5 billion units to 3 three billion units and here we describe that as a multi size can line you probably need somewhere between three and four can lines as an industry to support that and we re we just it just i would say it this way that the capacity coming online in 19 italy and spain for crown it s crown s opportunity or crown s turn and some others have brought capacity on over the last year or two at which time it was their turn but i think if you look at the uk you look at spain you look at turkey you look at some of the other mediterranean areas there is growth there we re not very prevalent in up through the middle of the continent we don t have any operations in germany we have the one in slovakia and the one in eastern france but having said that there s been some notable growth albeit off very low basis in germany so i think the growth in europe is broad based and you re well aware of crown and some of the other s views and convictions around sustainability so i think we re going to see that for some time to come ghansham panjabi r w baird analyst that s super helpful and then just second question going back to going toward i guess transit packaging which obviously had a very strong year overall under your ownership just given some of the choppy macro across europe and china did you notice any customer order pattern shift in 4q maybe give us a characterization of how 1q is progressing so far and also specific to the equipment versus the consumables what trends you re seeing there thanks so much timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer you re welcome so i think this is a question we ask all the time and as i said in the prepared remarks we know you re not very familiar with the business and let s be honest we re gaining our familiarity with the business so we re asking these questions almost on a daily basis the backlog that we saw for equipment tools at the end of 18 was actually stronger than at the end of 17 and we haven t seen any any slowdown in on the consumable side in fact the protective continues to do well and strapping continues to do well in terms of volume so things have been choppy but i think we re not seeing that yet in the macro environment i said to somebody the other day i m not an economist and ghansham i know you re a ph d so you probably have a lot more knowledge in this i m not an economist but it s hard to envision a broad based economic slowdown especially in the united states given the real positive jobs reports we continue to see so we obviously are looking at it going forward i our understanding of the business that we own we re gaining our understanding as it is an extremely strong and resilient business that generates a lot of cash flow we re going to continue to delever if and when there s a pullback in the economy it ll happen when crown s at much lower leverage levels and obviously as global economy expand this is a business that will participate in that expansion but the business is very different i spent the better part of the back half of january in india pretty large indian business that they ve build up over the last decade as you know it s about 1 billion 1 3 billion people with a gdp growth rate of 6 to 7 so enormous organic growth opportunities in that market which temper any downturn in global steel that the business experienced perhaps 10 years ago so but we haven t seen any impact of a wobbling of any macroeconomic concerns so i think we re pretty positive as we look through 2019 sitting here today ghansham panjabi r w baird analyst perfect thank you timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from arun viswanathan of rbc capital markets your line is open arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst hey hi guys good morning just a question on beverage cans so i guess continued relatively robust growth globally it looks like you re tracking at the upper end of maybe a 2 to 4 range maybe you can just give us your outlook on if that would continue and then if so in the americas where do you expect nichols to get to from a utilization standpoint end of year and is there a need to add anymore non 12 ounce or even 12 ounce capacity at some point thanks timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer yeah so i think as we ve said and others have said we were fairly bullish on the future for beverage cans globally not just sustainability certainly is one thing but it is a it is a superior package to all other ph packages do to protect the integrity of the product inside i think specifically to north america nichols performing very well over the last several months of 2018 we ll have some incremental capacity gains in nichols through the first six months to seven months and but we re largely sold out in nichols so nichols operating very well we re in the process now of always balancing how much capital we want to invest for potential growth or our representative share of growth market that looks like it s growing especially for new products and especially can sizes we re trying to ensure that we get adequate returns for putting new capital in so we continue to look at new capacity in north america but we ll try to do that in a way in which it generates the appropriate returns arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst okay thanks and just on the price cost side i think you noted that you do expect freight to be lower in 2019 just wanted to understand your confidence around that and what drives you to that belief i mean would it be better to be more conservative and assume a higher freight cost just given the last couple of years and then also maybe just give us some view on inflationary expectations outside of north america as well thanks timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer so i think in 2018 a combination of perhaps our customers not fully understanding consumer patterns and some of their markets and frankly crown not understanding our customers requirements we found ourselves caught out and oversold throughout much of the year which led to we re exacerbated a freight situation in which there were higher rates generally with excess freight and lanes in which we had a buyer spot so we ve endeavored to reposition as part of the contract renewals our commitments to customers such that we don t experience and they don t experience the large increase in freight that we both had in 2018 so i we re pretty confident on that i don t really see the need to get extra conservative and tell you that freight is going to be higher i just don t think it s going to happen globally i think there s a little bit of inflation everywhere but generally inflation is good for us it s people want more and to get more you need a little bit of inflation so it s incumbent upon us to make sure we recover that and push the business forward arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst and just one last one if i may on working capital is there a chance that that would be potentially a negative if metal supply issues extend for a long time or and any offsets that you could also dig into to keep the free cash flow number intact or how should we think about that thanks timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer well the metal the metal supply issue is resolved and we re not modeling any increase or decrease in working capital it s generally flat in 19 versus 18 which implies in a growing business that we are taking working capital out as a percentage across the system but in on the cash flow statement it s flat arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst thanks timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from debbie jones deutsche bank your line is open debbie jones deutsche bank analyst hi good morning timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer good morning debbie debbie jones deutsche bank analyst tim i wanted to ask just broadly speaking well it seems like there s an opportunity for the growth rate for cans to be more than what it has been in recent years which has been i think about 2 or 3 could you comment on that number one and then two talk about from a regional basis i think there s a couple you haven t mentioned brazil southeast asia how you expect to kind of be ph growth ahead of the industry which is my assumption i don t know if you would agree that in 2019 and 2020 timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer so i think you mentioned or somebody mentioned the growth rate of 2 to 4 i think consistently over the last four years or five years we ve probably been at the high end of that or even higher than the market on a global basis largely due to the footprint in southeast asia or turkey or brazil i think growth rates are certainly different by region we expect we ll expect southeast asia or certainly the countries we operate in southeast asia which is much of southeast asia to be in the high single digits china is a non issue any longer so don t really need to talk about it europe i think europe is we feel pretty firm that europe s going to be in that 2 to 3 to 4 off a pretty big base north america remains to be seen we are we ll be up a little bit as i said early in north america just as nichols for the first six months or seven months is at full production as it was at the end of last year so but other than that we re more or less sold out in north america so we re going to we ll have a little bit of growth in north america in the order of 1 to 2 but i don t have a good handle on why the market why the overall market in north america should be more than that it s certainly there are new products being introduced in beverage and we re all excited about that and i think it s going to continue to happen and we re going to see some renewed growth in north american beverage but it s off a very big base but even a small percentage off a big base is very positive for the industry and then south america the market continues to grow there s capacity being introduced but it ll absorb that capacity in rapid fashion specific to south america we re talking brazil only but in brazil no reason why mid mid single digits and we had a i think we had a market this year in brazil it was up 8 or 9 and we were probably close to that and i think the mid single digits more likely safer number to project for the future in brazil and we might be a touch below that in 19 just because we got to get some new capacity up again we re we re a little capacity constrained to go any harder than that until we get the new plant running debbie jones deutsche bank analyst okay and then as a follow up you mentioned a couple of times the need for new capacity in certain areas of your business and my assumption is just looking at your capex budget that you re doing a lot of shifting of machines just as you highlighted in asia i mean is that kind of the way that you re going to manage this need for the next year or two or do you envision any kind of bigger need to add greenfield facilities timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer well i think we got a capital budget of 400 million to 425 million which implies close to 400 million for the can businesses alone which isn t too far different from what we spent an average over the last four four years five years i think that with the exception of repositioning chinese assets to vietnam and southeast asia that s isolated to that everything else will be new equipment that we buy from equipment suppliers or from our own equipment supplier and it may envision new factories and or speed ups or new lines added to existing factories debbie jones deutsche bank analyst okay thanks tim i ll turn it over timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from tyler langton jpmorgan your line is now open tyler langton jpmorgan analyst hey good morning tim and tom timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer good morning thomas a kelly senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning tyler langton jpmorgan analyst just on i don t know if you can comment but just on the the 20 to 25 of contracts that renewed in north america for 2019 are those in general i guess representative in terms of customer size of the sort of of your entire portfolio if you can comment on that timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer yeah i prefer not to right it s the universe of customers in north american beverage is not very large i make a comment there you can start to figure out who we re talking about tyler langton jpmorgan analyst okay no understand and then just on signode the americas on the the cost side i know in q4 you mentioned the issue there was over 10 million headwind do you have a rough sense just for 18 sort of the impact of buying cans higher freight and sort of all those issues what s sort of the total pressure on 2018 roughly was timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer not i ll tell you not insignificant but i off the top of my head i don t have it tyler langton jpmorgan analyst got you okay and then just a final question i guess tom for corporate expense for 19 just any sort of rough guidance thomas a kelly senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah i d say about 150 million tyler langton jpmorgan analyst got you okay thanks so much timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from mark wilde of bank of montreal your line is open mark wilde bank of montreal analyst thanks good morning tim good morning tom thomas a kelly senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer good morning mark wilde bank of montreal analyst tim i wonder if we could just come back on the north american kind of capacity situation do you expect that you ll be sold out for the full year in 19 timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer yes we ll be sold out but we ll do a better job i think we ve already done a better job planning for the year and discussions with our customers such that we re not oversold and we re not going to incur third party sourcing costs and or the excess freight we had in 2018 mark wilde bank of montreal analyst okay and i think you ve talked about sort of how you re kind of thinking about sort of incremental capital here but i m just i m conscious that you got a hold for a third line up there at nichols can you just talk about that anymore timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer that s the danger of letting you walk through our factories no i think at this time nothing to say right i think we re progressing through a number of discussions with customers as it relates appropriate price points for the future and we ll reevaluate the need for more capacity in whatever location that we think is needed mark wilde bank of montreal analyst okay that s fair enough and just one follow on can you talk a little bit about how the business down in mexico is performing timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer i would characterize the some of the headwinds we had this year in the glass business in mexico the utility company continues to raise gas prices i think one section of the country where we have the large glass factory there s a shortage of gas so they re raising gas prices to industrial users so we do recover that by a formula on a 1 year lag basis so we ll get some of that back subject to them not raising the price again but that s all contractually we get it back it just lags and then on the can side businesses is strong we have a very large firm contract with a customer from year to year we may over index against that contract and they pull back in the following year to the contract level but more or less it s very firm mark wilde bank of montreal analyst okay that s helpful i ll turn it over timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from george staphos bank of america merrill lynch your line is open george staphos bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks hi guys good morning thanks for letting me on thanks for all the details i wanted to go back over north american beverage can and tim i know it s always easier to talk about the future or as i said ph differently i know it s better typically to be more conservative in terms of outlook on a promise and over deliver we haven t seen these kinds of growth rates in north america i think you said you re up mid single recognizing there were some capacity growth that was allowing you to do that in a very long time 1980s type of timeframe now you have new beverages growing in terms of consumption which is first time you ve had in a while cans have been suffering with csd declines and beer declines for a while and you have sustainability why can t the growth rate in your view be better than 1 to 2 in north america overtime and how would you tie the merits that you ve talked about for the can in terms of sustainability better protection innovation through ph capacity and terms you know like so that maybe you do grow in the right way more than 1 to 2 how would you how would you i guess think about that timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer well i don t disagree with anything you just said george other than the industry grew at 0 6 in 2018 and so it is a it s also a big base right it s 95 billion unit to 100 billion unit base so it s just the growth the rate of growth is always weighed down by the base but at 0 6 coming off a number of years we re most recently we were flattish or down 1 to 2 or a couple of years we were down 2 to 3 it s so one year doesn t make a trend i think everything you said is correct i think there is opportunity george staphos bank of america merrill lynch analyst that might be a first time tim timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer no no george come on you know how i feel about you you re the grand poobah let s be clear but i think it s just too early right i agree with everything you said about prospectively looking forward if we re really serious as a society about the environment and about reuse and recycling all the positive benefits of the can as you said to protect the contents of the container but we ll see where it takes us i think we and others are for the first time we re feeling very positive we ve always felt very positive about the product we offer to our customers i think we re feeling more confident that we re going to be appropriately compensated for that and that there s going to be a growth level that as you say we haven t seen since the cola wars of the mid 80s so i just i agree with you george i m just you just not going to get me to say more than 1 to 2 right now george staphos bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay understood maybe attack on to that and then one question on signode and i ll turn it over traditionally a lot of the customer base had its own embedded self make on plastic do you find if it was a barrier to can growth in the past that maybe it s less of a barrier now and then related to signode obviously you had good volumes you have a good backlog i think the ebit year on year was down can you give us perhaps a little bit of the moving parts behind that and is it signode any part of the big increase in the pension expense thanks guys and good luck in the quarter timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer so the you re talking fourth quarter on signode so signode was down two in the fourth quarter at ebit one of its depreciation which is the step up accounting so we generally like to talk about ebitda right now until we cycle through the a full year of the accounting impacts and then there was 3 million of currency so ex currency and the acquisition accounting it s more or less up 2 million roughly in the quarter no the pension impact that tom mentioned earlier nothing to do with signode the pension liabilities acquired with signode in total george on the order of 50 million i think liabilities which is peanuts when you consider the old can pension so this is this is a business that s largely free of legacy liabilities and really well positioned for the future did i miss any other part of the question george staphos bank of america merrill lynch analyst just the impact of self make in terms of cans growth timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer sorry i m sorry yeah well like you know like they have they have filling assets well they they have filling assets that are set up to fill certain products and plants that are set up to fill certain products and some of those products they manufacture themselves and that will take some time for them to want to change if they want to change that at all but i think we re more likely to see new product introductions in the can and marginally see can growth in existing products until one or two things happens in my mind those filling assets or bottle making assets need to be replaced and they reevaluate how they want to spend their capital or there s some larger movement environmentally notwithstanding the petrochemical industry is going to do their best to try to come up with recyclable plastics or at least convince the regulators that we promise you we ll get to a recycle rate of 25 by the year 2030 and blah blah blah give us some more time we ll get there and we all know that by 2030 they won t get there so we ll see how that manifests itself over time george staphos bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay thank you very much timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from adam josephson keybanc capital markets your line is open adam josephson keybanc capital markets analyst tim and tom good morning timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer hi adam adam josephson keybanc capital markets analyst tim i think you mentioned in the prepared remarks that asia pac would be about flat on ebit in 2019 in america going back to americas beverages there are so many moving parts with the price increases that presumed the absence of the freight inflation you won t hopefully be buying in cans at no margin and then you got on the other hand you got the fx you got the pension can you just give us some parameters but what you re thinking in terms of americas beverage ebit this year and perhaps give us some of the moving parts there timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer well i think we talked about the moving parts i would tell you we if asia is going to be flat because of a 10 million headwind from reducing china we expect the tailwind in in the americas beverage certainly to be much larger than 10 million but beyond that i m not prepared to give you any more specifics although we re quite positive on the americas beverage segment income growth in 2019 the moving parts are we ve got some marginal volume that we re going to gain in north america as we ve talked about but largely we re sold out we ll recover some of the inflationary headwinds we had in mexico as i talked about earlier just by formula under the contract we have and brazil we ll have some modest volume growth although we re sold out there as well until we get to the new plant coming online at the end of 2019 and then the pricing activity that we ve described is not insignificant so we expect we expect that to be quite positive adam josephson keybanc capital markets analyst thanks tim and on the sustainability topic your commentary about bev cans in the release being the world s most sustainable and recycled packaging was it seemed above and beyond what you ve had before in your earnings releases and for that matter i think what you talked about at the analyst day just a couple of months ago i think you said at the analyst day look this is good for us it s a long term positive i wouldn t pencil anything into your model for the next several years et cetera et cetera has your tone changed at all along those lines do you think it s a more near term opportunity than perhaps what you thought even in early december i m just trying to square your comments with what you ve said in recent months timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer so we ve been we ve been fairly consistent on the sustainability topic i agree with you that the language we used in last night s release especially around the term responsible is new it s a little bit more bullish i think we are seeing some momentum in europe more specific than north america we ll see how north america progresses but at some point and i think we and others feel firmly that we all believe cans whether they re aluminum beverage cans or steel food cans are far better than other package choices for a lot of reasons and if if we re going to be serious about this conversation at government levels and ngo levels and we re not just going to check the box and believe promises for the year 2030 which are somewhat similar to the promises that were made for 2022 that they re not going to achieve then yeah this is going to this is going to happen perhaps a little bit quicker than i originally thought but i think that i still believe what i said in early december is true this is going to be good for us the rate at which it s good for us may vary but i think we re seeing more momentum in europe right now than perhaps say we would have seen only a month and a half ago adam josephson keybanc capital markets analyst hey tim if i could just ask one follow up about that issue you had mentioned in us that there are more products being introduced in cans and that contributed perhaps to the 0 6 growth for the industry last year that s it seems more innovation and sustainability that s not products going from pet to cans it s just new products coming in cans how do you distinguish between the two because they seem different to me timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer well i guess they re different but they are linked in that if you introduce an energy drink or a sparkling water or a juice or a tea you have the option to put that in another packaging format but you and the younger people who are generally responsible for marketing these new brands and sometimes own the brands that are being marketed have a much different view on the environment than more established brand owners and i think the younger brand owners are not willing to jeopardize their brand for a package choice and they re making responsible choice to choose the can over other over other package formats so i think they are linked because everybody always has a choice to pick their package adam josephson keybanc capital markets analyst thanks tim timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from brian maguire of goldman sachs your line is now open brian maguire goldman sachs analyst hey good morning guys timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer good morning brian brian maguire goldman sachs analyst thanks for thanks for putting me in just coming back to the capex outlook it s down a little bit from the last couple of years and just in light of your comments around being sold out in a couple of markets and the growth outlook for cans being better than it has been in years just trying to square that and understand why we re down at such a low level this year and why we re not investing more in capex given the growth outlook and i guess the spirit of the question is i know you obviously want to hit the 775 million of free cash next year but if you do see the growth outlook improve would you be willing to kind of forgo that target if it meant making sure that you took advantage of some some really good growth opportunities timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer so good question we debate that all the time and along with that debate we debate how you re going to characterize how we spend money and if we pull ahead or delay so i think as we look at asia we re going to reposition two can lines in europe we just brought up three can lines over the last two months so there s only so much you can do in those two markets so i think brazil we re going to bring up a can line i think the only market where we re we re kind of in a pause situation until we see how demand shakes out whether it s new products whether it s sustainability whether it s specialty sizes and whether it s the pricing environment all of those things considered we re kind of taking a more of a wait and see approach and in the near term perhaps we miss we miss some can sales but i think in the longer term it s it ll be a much more responsible approach for our company but we take your point we re well aware of the opportunity and the growth but i think it s we ve been fairly consistent for the last 18 months in terms of characterizing how much capital we would spend in 2019 and more or less we re right in line so i think the only area where if we wanted to step out and spend some more money it would be in north america and we re not we re just not prepared to do that until we see the pricing environment return to more normal or more appropriate levels brian maguire goldman sachs analyst okay i appreciate that just one last one from me in the food can business just wondered if you saw any prebuying particularly in north america in 4q and any potential negative impacts that could have in the beginning of 2019 timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer we did not see any prebuy across our customer base in 2018 leading into 2019 brian maguire goldman sachs analyst okay i appreciate it timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from edlain rodriguez of ubs your line is now open edlain rodriguez ubs analyst thank you guys saving saving the best for the last quick one in terms of like the contract repricing 20 25 was done for this year should we expect like a similar pace over the next couple of years timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer yeah i m just trying to think for 2020 for 19 into 20 it could be 25 to 30 and maybe 20 in 21 we ll i think they re probably the appropriate numbers edlain rodriguez ubs analyst okay and in terms of the guidance so bev can volume for 18 was up at 4 so you have a couple of new projects coming in line like do you expect that number to be higher than 4 in 2019 timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer i think generally we re as we said earlier we re somewhat capacity constrained in north america so we re going to be up in the order of 1 to 2 north america i think europe with the new capacity coming online we re probably up 5 to 6 asia will be largely flat because we ll have volume increases in southeast asia which just do nothing more than offset the volume decline in china that we walked away from as we move the assets and then brazil middle east largely flattish maybe down 1 brazil up a few percent just until we get the new can line in so we re kind of in a period here where we re rapidly trying to get as much capacity in as possible we to brian s question we realize there s opportunities globally and we want to have our appropriate share of those opportunities and in responsible terms there s only so much you can expect your people to do in terms of building plants and commercializing plants so we re trying to do that in a measured way so we are we need the capacity and we ll bring plants up but that s regionally that s kind of what we expect what that all adds up to i don t have in front of me in terms of overall volume i i would suggest that given north america is our biggest market and we re only going to see 1 ish to 2 growth there maybe the growth rate for us and globally in 19 is 3 or 3 5 edlain rodriguez ubs analyst okay thank you very much timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer thank you operator our last question in queue comes from neel kumar of morgan stanley your line is open neel kumar morgan stanley analyst hi good morning another question on north america so looking at the north american industry can shipment data we saw some positive growth in alcohol beverages for cans in the fourth quarter which was the first quarter in quite some time that had some positive growth can you just talk about what drove that change specifically in alcohol beverages timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer so neel we don t with the exception of canada where we re very strong in beer we have a pretty small position in the united states in beer so i think we re not the right ones to answer the question i don t know whether it s inventory restocking around perhaps they had a stronger holiday push i don t know but it had to do with promotions around the nfl and so we re not the right ones to ask because we re we don t participate in that market as large as some others neel kumar morgan stanley analyst okay and then in terms of the 4 overall volume growth you saw in beverage can demand in 2018 can you just talk about what type of growth rate you saw in specialty cans versus standard cans timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer yeah well specialty cans off a much smaller base certainly in north america for us i think we re well represented globally in every market around the world either in line with the market or a greater percentage than the market for specialty cans with the exception of north america where we probably have 14 or 15 specialty mix and the market is probably in the low 20s but but if we had 4 growth overall our specialty growth is certainly more than double that just off the top of my head i don t know probably it s in the double digits i just don t know where in the double digits neel kumar morgan stanley analyst that s helpful thanks timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer okay thank you eric thank you very much that concludes the call

policymakers in several states are reviewing options to strengthen support for public investments crucial to state economies and residents well being such as quality early education affordable college and modern infrastructure one way to raise the necessary funds is to raise personal income tax rates on the highest incomes a policy choice sometimes referred to as a millionaires tax this approach makes sense evidence indicates it can generate substantial revenue for public investments that boost a state s productivity in the long run without harming economic growth in the short term one way to

is unlikely to harm state economies in the short run contrary to some claims in six of eight states including the district of columbia that enacted millionaires taxes since 2000 private sector economic growth met or exceeded that of neighboring states since enacting the tax increases seven of the eight states had per capita growth in personal incomes at least as strong as nearby states and five of the eight added jobs at least as quickly as their neighbors only one state that raised its state income tax rates connecticut has seen markedly weaker growth than its neighbors likely for reasons other than state tax levels in six of eight states including the district of columbia that enacted millionaires taxes since 2000 private sector economic growth met or exceeded that of

quickly as their neighbors only one state that raised its state income tax rates connecticut has seen markedly weaker growth than its neighbors likely for reasons other than state tax levels the bulk of mainstream academic research finds that interstate differences in taxes including differences in top personal income tax rates have minimal effects on state economic growth fifteen of the 20 major studies published in academic journals since 2000 that examined the broad economic effect of state personal income tax levels found no significant effects and one of the others produced internally inconsistent results as a pair of university researchers described in a comprehensive literature review in 2018 the vast majority of the academic studies that examined the relationship between state and local taxes and economic growth found little or no effect millionaires taxes increasingly common the personal income tax is a major source of revenue for 41 states although some states apply a flat rate to all taxable income most states with a personal income tax maintain a graduated structure that applies increasing rates to increasing levels of income prior to the 2000s however special brackets or rates targeted specifically to the highest incomes were relatively uncommon california levied a temporary 11 percent rate on incomes above about 200 000 from 1991 to 1996 and in 1992 ohio created a new bracket on incomes above that same level but as of 2000 only five states had top rates kicking in above 100 000 in the early 2000s policymakers began looking at targeted rate increases for affluent households to help close stubborn budget shortfalls stemming from the 2001 recession as well as to respond to the increasingly skewed concentration of wealth and income at the top the top 1 percent of households accounted for 21 5 percent of income in 2017 compared to only 9 percent in 1970 see figure 1 in 2003 new york launched the trend by enacting a three year surcharge on incomes above 500 000 california and new jersey followed suit with millionaires taxes in 2004 overall 12 states including the district of columbia have enacted rate increases targeted to affluent taxpayers since 2000 nine of them california connecticut district of columbia hawaii maryland minnesota new jersey new york and oregon either still have some form of the policy today or maintained it over a span of several years the other three maine north carolina and wisconsin either repealed the policy before implementing it kept the higher rates for only a short span or undermined them through later income tax cuts in some cases a so called millionaire s tax only applies to people with annual incomes of at least 1 million but the term can also refer to a range of personal income tax increases on the highest incomes generally starting at about 100 000 or more for example california levies top personal income tax rates of 10 3 11 3 and 12 3 percent on annual individual incomes over 250 000 300 000 and 500 000 respectively as well as an additional 1 percent surtax on incomes over 1 million for a top rate of 13 3 percent on the state s wealthiest residents people subject to these top rates still pay the same rates as other state residents on their income below these thresholds since graduated income tax systems apply different marginal rates to different increments of income rather than taxing all income at the same rate in most cases states created a new bracket or set of brackets above a higher threshold of income rather than raise existing tax rates minnesota for example created a new 9 85 percent bracket for top earners 2 percentage points above its prior top rate which applied to incomes over about 250 000 for married couples and 150 000 for single filers adjusted annually for inflation hawaii created three new brackets with rates of 9 10 and 11 percent a policy that expired in 2015 but was reauthorized in 2018 even modest rate increases on high incomes can generate significant revenue from a relatively small number of taxpayers namely the narrow sliver of households at the top of the income distribution who are most able to afford the cost in california just 0 3 percent of taxpayers reported more than 1 million in income when the state s 2005 millionaires tax took effect yet they accounted for more than 21 percent of all income in the state when oregon approved an increase on high income earners in 2009 the state s legislative office projected that it would raise nearly 472 million over two years from 2 5 percent of tax filers and in maine a 3 percent surcharge on household incomes above 200 000 that voters approved in 2016 but the legislature repealed and was never implemented would have raised over 320 million a year from fewer than 1 in 40 state taxpayers according to one estimate this report focuses on the eight states that substantially raised top income tax rates since 2000 and have characteristics allowing for reasonable comparisons to other states california connecticut the district of columbia maryland minnesota new jersey new york and oregon it excludes hawaii as is done in some academic studies since its unique geography complicates comparisons to other states track record of tax raising states rebuts dire predictions proposals to raise state income tax rates often spark contentious debate with anti tax activists and commentators predicting widespread economic harm yet the actual experience of the eight states that have adopted this approach over the past decade belies such claims available data on common measures of economic health like job creation and per person income growth reveal that these tax raising states have performed comparably to other states in their region after raising taxes some states have exceeded their peers across multiple measures while others have done so only on some measures only connecticut has consistently underperformed relative to its neighbors likely for reasons unrelated to the state s income tax levels see box connecticut s economic struggles likely reflect non tax factors six of the eight states enacting millionaires taxes since 2000 had economic growth about as good or better than neighboring states while the tax cuts were in effect see figure 2 in four of the eight states california the district of columbia maryland and new york growth in private sector gross domestic product gdp exceeded other states in the region two other states minnesota and oregon had about the same growth as their neighbors while in connecticut and new jersey economic growth fell below that of nearby states seven of the eight states had per capita income growth as least as good as their neighbors after enacting a millionaires tax california minnesota and new york exceeded their neighbors average by at least 5 percentage points while the district of columbia maryland new jersey and oregon met or slightly surpassed it connecticut fell behind on this measure as it did on private sector gdp growth see figure 3 five of the eight states added jobs at least as quickly as their neighbors new york added jobs at a significantly higher rate than its neighbors minnesota slightly exceeded its neighbors and the district of columbia maryland and oregon kept pace with their neighbors california despite strong growth in its overall economy fell slightly below the regional average on jobs due to above average employment growth in neighboring states such as arizona and nevada though it exceeded the u s average connecticut and new jersey trailed behind on job creation after raising tax rates see figure 4 these trends closely resemble these states relative economic performance before they raised income tax rates at the top six of the eight states had job growth about as good or better than their neighbors in the three years preceding their income tax hike for example in the three years before raising taxes in may 2013 for example minnesota added jobs at a rate of 4 9 percent compared to a 5 1 percent average in neighboring states since that time its rate of job growth equals 8 1 percent versus 6 9 percent in adjacent states similar trends play out across the other states and on other economic measures as well connecticut s economic struggles likely reflect non tax factors connecticut s economy has struggled for many years on several measures of state economic health the state raised personal income tax rates three times in the past decade in 2009 2011 and 2015 because these increases coincide with a period of subpar growth critics often argue that the tax policies are to blame but a larger set of factors are likely at play connecticut relied on outdated economic growth model connecticut has relied for many years on a bedroom community approach of developing high end suburban communities as havens for new york city dwellers and company headquarters but tastes appear to have changed as young professionals entrepreneurs and high growth startups have increasingly clustered in large metros and other revitalizing urban areas a connecticut lacks a city with more than 150 000 people which makes it challenging to compete for talent with neighboring metros like boston or new york or with rapidly growing destinations in the sunbelt b the head of general electric for example cited the lack of technology centers and communities that appealed to young executives rather than taxes as the company s reason for moving its headquarters to massachusetts c connecticut has relied for many years on a

schools and public transportation in the early 1990s when connecticut adopted a personal income tax it used much of the resulting revenue to address debt that had built up over many years and for about the past 15 years lawmakers have used much of connecticut s revenue growth to pay down pension debt caused largely by their previous shortchanging of required pension payments f these past

don t harm growth examining how a state s tax policies affect its relative economic performance can be difficult since large scale trends like job creation and personal income growth depend on many interrelated factors ranging from local workforce and economic development policies to global forces like trade most mainstream academic experts have found that state tax rates may play some role at the margins but likely have little to no impact on states overall economic performance thus modest changes to personal income tax rates would be highly unlikely to alter core economic trends empirical studies conducted by economists over the last 40 years find no consensus that lowering state taxes is a good strategy to boost state economic growth and create jobs or conversely that raising taxes dampens economic growth studies focusing on narrower issues such as the impact of state tax levels on entrepreneurship also find little to no impact for instance a rigorous 2012 study commissioned by the u s small business administration found no evidence of an economically significant effect of state tax portfolios on entrepreneurial activity the same is true of research on personal income taxes of the 20 major studies published in academic journals since 2000 that examined the effect of state personal income tax levels on broad measures of state economic growth 15 found little to no significant effect and one of the others produced internally inconsistent results see appendix ii another recent analysis comes to similar conclusions a comprehensive literature review by two oklahoma state university tax experts in 2018 looked at 36 studies including ten published since 2014 regarding state tax policies overall they concluded the overall state and local tax burden is not a major driver of economic growth differences across states the vast majority of the academic studies that examined the relationship between state and local taxes and economic growth found little or no effect where significant effects were found they generally were modest at most as for state personal income tax taxes in particular the researchers found evidence suggesting that states recently reducing their personal income taxes more likely harmed economic growth and states increasing their personal income taxes more likely spurred their economic growth claims of widespread millionaire migration appear unfounded opponents of raising income taxes often argue that higher rates will cause affluent residents to flee to lower tax states weakening the state s economy and undercutting revenues but mainstream research does not support these claims a landmark analysis in 2016 by researchers from stanford university and the u s treasury department reviewed tax returns for all million dollar earners nationwide over 13 years and found that millionaires rarely move from one state to another and when they do it s usually not because of taxes a of the roughly 500 000 households that report income of 1 million or more only about 12 000 or 2 4 percent move to a new state in any given year compared to 2 9 percent among the general population b the most striking finding of this research is how little elites seem willing to move to exploit tax advantages across state lines the researchers note millionaire tax flight is occurring but only at the margins of statistical and socioeconomic significance the primary reasons cited for low migration are family obligations such as the desire to remain close to grandchildren and business needs such as a company s founder needing to stay close to existing professional networks and customers as one expert put it following california s 2013 income tax hikes moving out of state is actually one of the most costly responses could make moving to nevada or texas or florida is a very big life change and means leaving behind family friends colleagues and business connections c another carefully designed study reviewed new jersey s 2004 personal income tax increase on high income households finding that it raises nearly 1 billion per year and tangibly reduces inequality with little cost in terms of tax flight d a later replication of the study by a group of skeptical researchers found that slightly more millionaires may have moved than originally thought though not nearly enough to sizably reduce the policy s revenue gains e a for

investments targeted income tax increases on high income households can generate substantial revenues allowing lawmakers to minimize harmful cuts when budgets are tight as well as to undertake ambitious initiatives such as expanding early education boosting college access improving infrastructure and strengthening rainy day funds to prepare for the next recession for example minnesota created a new income tax bracket in 2013 for the state s richest households along with other changes such as revisions to the state s tobacco and corporate taxes the new revenue raisers prevented more than 600 million in cuts over two years to services such as schools natural resource protection and assistance programs for children and seniors and allowed lawmakers to invest more in residents and communities in the years following revenues from the higher taxes and a rising economy enabled the state to make a number of promising investments in education in particular including making free full day kindergarten possible in all public school districts helping more low income children afford preschool bolstering financial aid for low and middle income college students and helping stabilize tuition after years of higher education cuts the state also boosted spending for economic development affordable housing and support for local communities created a new income tax bracket in 2013 for

cuts the state also boosted spending for economic development affordable housing and support for local communities california lawmakers have enacted two millionaires taxes since 2000 the first passed in 2004 and still in effect levies an additional 1 percent on incomes above 1 million to help local communities fund mental health services such as prevention and early treatment a rigorous study found that the tax which raises about 2 billion a year has helped local governments improve mental health outcomes minimize unnecessary hospitalizations and reduce homelessness and incarceration in 2012 california voters approved proposition 30 which added new rates of 10 3 11 3 and 12 3 percent on varying levels of income starting at 250 000 bringing the state s top rate to 13 3 percent on incomes above 1 million the state used the resulting revenues to increase investments in k 12 and college access and to rebuild the state s rainy day fund see box other states have used targeted personal income tax increases to close stubborn budget shortfalls and stave off harmful budget cuts especially in the wake of falling state revenues after the great recession in oregon lawmakers in 2009 approved two new top rates of 10 8 percent and 11 percent on households above 250 000 and 500 000 in income respectively the new rates were merged into a single 9 9 percent top bracket in 2012 the policy responded to a pending 4 billion shortfall caused by prior state tax policy choices and declining revenues the tax increase which raised an estimated 349 million over the first two years was part of a balanced approach to the state s budget that combined new revenues with federal stimulus funds to reduce the harm to core state services lawmakers in 2009 approved two new top rates of

state s budget that combined new revenues with federal stimulus funds to reduce the harm to core state services several other states raised personal income tax rates on high earners in the wake of the great recession to minimize harmful budget cuts caused by falling revenues the district of columbia for instance added a top rate of 8 95 percent on income over 350 000 in 2011 after personal income tax revenues had fallen by nearly 20 percent over the prior two years new york in 2009 enacted a millionaires tax estimated at the time to raise 4 billion a year after projected revenues for the coming fiscal year came in 3 2 billion below original expectations and in 2012 maryland approved a package of rate increases on six figure earners designed to prevent more than 400 million in cuts to schools police and other services california using new revenues for variety of investments california leveraged the substantial revenue it gained from personal income tax increases on high income earners into sustained pro growth investments the 2013 income tax increases which voters approved through proposition 30 in november 2012 generated an estimated 8 1 billion in the 2018 19 budget year or about 6 percent of the state s personal income tax revenues a an estimated 98 6 percent of the additional dollars were paid by the highest income 1 percent of residents b the income tax hikes combined with a rising economy helped policymakers devote considerable new revenues to public education and other goals state and local funding for k 12 and community colleges rose from 47 billion in 2011 12 to 72 billion in 2016 17 boosting per student k 12 spending by 14 percent or about 1 325 c and when voters reauthorized the high income rates in 2016 the state s legislative fiscal office estimated that roughly half of the new revenues would support k 12 education and community colleges d the revenue influx occurred alongside california s innovative reform to its k 12 funding formula which strengthened state funding for districts with many disadvantaged students particularly english learners foster youth and students from low income families the revised formula particularly benefits children of color and lays the groundwork for a more equitable economy e california also used the added revenues to expand its earned income tax credit set up a new retirement saving option for private sector employees improve access to affordable health care through california s medicaid program med cal and shore up the rainy day fund f when voters renewed the income tax increases in 2016 state experts estimated the revenue would drive at least an extra 60 million a year into the state s reserves and perhaps as much as 1 5 billion a year depending on broader economic trends and

and healthcare initiative constitutional amendment california legislative analyst s office july 18 2016 new revenues for public investments can help state economies long term expert research and evidence from other states indicate that sustained support for the kinds of public investments made possible by personal income tax increases can help states improve their residents well being and expand opportunity especially for people of color and other marginalized communities that in turn can help bolster states overall economies over time high quality education well funded public schools help children get a good start in life especially when funding targets investments shown to produce better outcomes such as early learning programs smaller classes and higher teacher quality one extensive nationwide study examined the relationship between school funding and student outcomes from the early 1970 s to 2011 it found that low income children whose school districts received a 10 percent increase in per pupil spending before they began their 12 years of public school had 10 percent higher earnings and 17 percent higher family income in adulthood were likelier to complete high school and were less likely as adults to be poor see figure 6 long term economic benefits also flow from investments beyond the k 12 system especially early education and affordable access to college high quality preschool improves not only children s academic performance but also recipients earnings in adulthood one landmark study found the analysis estimated that workers increased earnings alone outweigh the cost of preschool by more than five times affordable access to higher education is important as well but many states have underfunded their public colleges universities and financial aid in recent years when students from low and high income families attend the same college they earn similar salaries post college this helps level the playing field for students of different backgrounds providing an added economic boost down the road these are among the many reasons why states with a better educated workforce tend to have higher wages and better productivity in the long run as one study demonstrated stronger family finances state economies also thrive when families have enough income to afford the basics invest in their own well being and have enough left over to support local shops restaurants and financial institutions for example a growing body of research finds that young children in low income families that get an income boost from policies such as the earned income tax credit eitc tend to do better and go further in school because the additional resources help parents better meet their needs and because children in low income families that receive income boosts attain more skills and education they tend to work more and earn more as adults each 3 000 a year in added income that children in a poor family receive before age 6 leads to an estimated 135 more working hours a year between ages 25 and 37 plus a 17 percent increase in annual earnings research has found see figure 7 this helps communities and the economy because it means more people and families are on solid ground and fewer need help over the long haul better infrastructure and amenities states that generate new revenues for targeted investments in key infrastructure systems can create jobs now and improve economic growth and job quality in the long run businesses need well maintained roads rails and ports to get products to market and local communities need well functioning water sewer and traffic systems to maintain health and preserve a high quality of life expanding and improving a state s broadband internet infrastructure can especially help smaller towns and rural areas where unreliable access to high speed internet poses a steep obstacle to residents looking to start a business or obtain an online credential state investment in other public amenities such as greenspace libraries and cultural institutions can give communities a competitive edge too both entrepreneurs and well educated professionals are often drawn to communities with attractive amenities and pleasant neighborhoods according to research and larger companies looking to relocate or expand increasingly take the quality and attractiveness of local services and amenities into account as amazon noted in its 2017 search for a second headquarters we want to invest in a community where our employees will enjoy living recreational opportunities educational opportunities and an overall high quality of life improved planning and review states can maximize the value of new tax revenues by making sure they re spending existing dollars efficiently for example a growing number of states are saving money and improving residents well being by reforming outdated criminal justice systems and dramatically reducing overincarceration high rates of adult incarceration are costly to families communities and state budgets particularly communities of color overly targeted by harsh incarceration policies states also can improve their planning practices such as by strengthening state rainy day funds in hard times these funds help protect state investments that promote economic growth and provide taxpayers with vital services millionaires taxes can help states advance racial equity targeted income tax hikes for high income residents can allow state lawmakers to pursue another crucial goal beyond raising revenue and curbing runaway economic inequality redressing historic and current racial inequities and building a more inclusive economy although policymakers typically think of tax policy as neutral with respect to race most state tax structures worsen racial and ethnic inequities because they fall harder on lower income households which are disproportionately households of color black and latinx households comprise 22 percent of total u s population for example yet account for nearly 30 percent of the nation s poorest households and in 45 of 50 states lower income households pay a larger share of their income in state and local taxes than high income households the poorest fifth of u s households pay an estimated 11 4 percent of their income in state and local taxes on average whereas the top 1 percent of households pay just 7 4 percent millionaires taxes can be a sound strategy for making state tax systems more equitable for two reasons first they fall exclusively on taxpayers at the very top who are disproportionately white white families are about three times more likely than black and latinx families to be among the nation s top 1 percent of earners according to one estimate racial gaps in wealth are also stark white families comprise 65 percent of u s households but own an estimated 87 percent of the nation s wealth whereas people of color make up 35 percent of all households but own just 13 percent of the wealth see figure 8 second targeted income tax increases provide resources that lawmakers can use to improve schools in low income communities of color invest in safer water systems and other public infrastructure that supports these communities expand access to affordable health care and make other crucial investments that reduce racial and ethnic inequities and help build an economy whose benefits are more widely shared one example is minnesota which in 2013 adopted a new income tax rate on very high incomes and used the revenue in part to help more low income children attend high quality preschool programs providing an outsized benefit to young people of color conclusion raising income tax rates on high income residents can enable states to boost investment in education infrastructure and other vital services that strengthen local communities and aid long term economic growth similar policies enacted in the past decade haven t harmed states ability to add jobs or compete with neighboring states evidence shows mainstream experts largely agree modest shifts in state income tax rates including rate hikes on high income residents are unlikely to affect short term growth and the additional revenues may provide economic benefits down the road if they go toward proven targeted investments like high quality education and tax credits for working families which bolster opportunity and help people maximize their economic contributions over time appendix i states raising income tax rates at the top appendix table 1 nine states enacted long lasting millionaires taxes since 2000 primary or first

pricing volatility will persist in the near term with gradual improvements expected through the second half of 2019 when incremental export pipeline capacity comes on line the majority of arc s crude oil production is made up of conventional light oil and condensate which continue to realize premium pricing relative to heavier crude oil grades to mitigate the impact of weak natural gas pricing arc maintains a strategy to physically and financially diversify its realized natural gas prices to multiple north american downstream sales points with western canadian natural gas prices expected to remain depressed due to limited egress options out of the region arc continues to execute on its diversification strategy which currently includes approximately 46 per cent of arc s corporate natural gas volumes exposed to a combination of us midwest and pacific northwest henry hub and dawn pricing hubs in 2019 and only 25 per cent of corporate natural gas volumes exposed to aeco and station 2 prices the remaining 29 per cent is financially hedged as a result of this diversification strategy less than 10 per cent of arc s expected commodity sales revenue from production is exposed to the aeco and station 2 markets in 2019 2019 capital plan and outlook arc s 2019 capital budget was designed to create value through the development of a compelling suite of projects to increase arc s productive capacity and to continue to pay a meaningful dividend to shareholders arc s near term plan to 2021 includes the development of five infrastructure projects with a continued commitment to arc s monthly dividend of 0 05 per share these initiatives will be guided with a pace of development that supports arc s enduring principle of strong balance sheet performance and controlling corporate decline rates the development plan for 2019 to 2021 includes the following projects which to varying degrees are all currently underway bringing to full capacity the recently constructed 180 mmcf per day sunrise gas processing facility in 2019 the initial 60 mmcf per day of processing capacity is now in service with the remaining balance anticipated to be put in service by june 2019

crude stream price msw at edmonton down an average of 47 per cent reflecting the significant widening of canadian oil differentials due to local export pipeline capacity constraints local canadian benchmark prices have since strengthened in 2019 to date with differentials immediately tightening following the alberta government s mandatory production curtailment it is however expected that pricing volatility will persist in the near term with gradual improvements expected through the second half of 2019 when incremental export pipeline capacity comes on line the majority of arc s crude oil production is made up of conventional light oil and condensate which continue to realize premium pricing relative to heavier crude oil grades to mitigate the impact of weak natural gas pricing arc maintains a strategy to physically and financially diversify its realized natural gas prices to multiple north american downstream sales points with western canadian natural gas prices expected to remain depressed due to limited egress options out of the region arc continues to execute on its diversification strategy which currently includes approximately 46 per cent of arc s corporate natural gas volumes exposed to a combination of us midwest and pacific northwest henry hub and dawn pricing hubs in 2019 and only 25 per cent of corporate natural gas volumes exposed to aeco and station 2

of 122 937 boe per day for the year ended december 31 2017 the increase is predominantly made up of new condensate rich production flowing through the dawson phase iii facility new condensate rich wells at attachie west as well as new production flowing through the sunrise phase ii gas processing facility expansion arc divested approximately 4 700 boe per day of production in 2018 the annual impact of the non core dispositions to arc s full year 2018 production was approximately 2 100 boe per day arc did not experience any material impacts to production as a result of third party outages in 2018 water infrastructure as part of its ongoing commitment to responsible water management and reducing its overall freshwater dependency arc has invested in strategic water infrastructure in northeast british columbia these water infrastructure initiatives are expected to drive cost savings from both reduced capital and lease operating expenses at sunrise arc completed the construction of a 200 000 cubic metre water storage reservoir in the second quarter of 2018 for completion operations the project has generated strong economic returns to date with an expected 80 per cent reduction in water handling costs in the sunrise area at parkland tower construction of a water recycling facility was completed in the fourth quarter of 2018 with pipelines connecting the three assets the water hub facility will reduce arc s dependency on freshwater used for hydraulic fracturing operations and will result in completion cost savings attachie arc s attachie property is a highly prospective montney condensate and liquids rich natural gas play located in northeast british columbia where arc has a land position of 306 net sections approximately 201 000 net acres arc invested 60 million in 2018 directed primarily towards completion activities on a seven well commercial demonstration pad at attachie west arc also drilled a tenure well and invested in upgrades to the attachie west area s battery to increase condensate processing capacity to 3 500 barrels per day arc is encouraged by wellhead condensate rates and indications of the overall productivity of the commercial demonstration pad wells cumulatively the seven wells have produced over 490 000 barrels of condensate and nearly 2 3 bcf of raw natural gas over 275 days of production fourth quarter 2018 production at attachie west averaged 4 100 boe per day comprised of 2 200 barrels per day of condensate and 11 mmcf per day of natural gas with arc s 2019 drilling program at attachie west not planned until the

montney condensate development opportunity at attachie west and extends the prolific lower montney liquids rich resource play into attachie arc s first pilot well into the lower montney horizon encountered high condensate to gas ratio gas and significant over pressuring arc will continue to optimize and monitor production results and will incorporate learnings into well designs and development plans to support the first phase of development at attachie west with its condensate rich production profile significantly over pressured reservoir and a large contiguous land position that is suited for multi layered development attachie west is a leading development opportunity within arc s portfolio arc submitted the regulatory application for multiple phases of development at attachie west in the fourth quarter of 2018 including the attachie west phase i gas processing and liquids handling facility which is expected to be brought on stream during 2021 dawson arc s flagship dawson property is a low cost montney natural gas play where arc has a land position of 137 net sections approximately 89 000 net acres the dawson play delivers strong economics and cash flow at prevailing natural gas prices and is further enhanced by the growing liquids rich production being developed in the lower montney horizon dawson production averaged 47 400 boe per day in the fourth

reserve advisory the recovery and reserve estimates of crude oil reserves provided in this news release are estimates only and there is no guarantee that the estimated reserves will be recovered actual crude oil reserves may eventually prove to be greater than or less than the estimates provided herein all december 31 2018 reserves presented are based on glj s forecast pricing effective

effective january 1 2017 it should not be assumed that the estimates of future net revenues presented herein represent the fair market value of the reserves there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil reserves and the future cash flows attributed to such reserves proved developed producing reserves are those reserves that are expected to be recovered from completion intervals open at the time of the estimate these reserves may be currently producing or if shut in they must have previously been on production and the date of resumption of production must be known with reasonable certainty proved developed non producing reserves are those reserves that either have not been on production or have previously been on production but are shut in and the date of resumption of production is unknown proved undeveloped reserves are those reserves expected to be recovered from known accumulations where a significant expenditure e g when compared to the cost of drilling a well is required to render them capable of production they must fully meet the requirements of the reserves category proved probable possible to which they are assigned proved reserves are those reserves that can be estimated with a high degree of certainty to be recoverable it is likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the estimated proved reserves probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves it is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the sum of the estimated proved plus probable reserves possible reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves there is a 10 percent probability that

used in isolation a boe conversation ratio of 6 mcf 1 bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead given the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6 1 utilizing a conversion ratio at 6 1 may be misleading as an indication of value light crude oil is crude oil with a relative density greater than 31 1 degrees api gravity medium crude oil is crude oil with a relative density greater than 22 3 degrees api gravity and less than or equal to 31 1 degrees api gravity and heavy crude oil is crude oil with a relative density greater than 10 degrees api gravity and less than or equal to 22 3 degrees api gravity with respect to finding and development costs the aggregate of the exploration and development costs incurred in the most recent financial year and the change during that year in estimated future development costs generally will not reflect total finding and development costs related to reserve additions for that year this press release contains several oil and gas metrics including f d costs fd a costs recycle ratio reserve replacement nav and rli these oil and gas metrics have been prepared by management and do not have standardized meanings or standard methods of calculation and therefore such measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies and should not be used to make comparisons such metrics have been included herein to provide readers with additional measures to evaluate the company s performance however such measures are not reliable indicators of the future performance of the company and future performance may not compare to the performance in previous periods and therefore such metric should not be unduly relied upon management uses these oil and gas metrics for its own performance measurements and to provide security holders with measures to compare the company s operations over time readers are cautioned that the information provided by these metrics or that can be derived from the metrics presented in this news release should not be relied upon for investment or other purposes a summary of the calculations of such metrics are as follows finding and development f d costs are calculated by dividing capital expenditures by the change in reserves within the applicable reserves category f d costs including fdc include all capital expenditures in the year as well as the change in fdc required to bring the reserves within the specified reserves category on production finding development and acquisition fd a costs represent the costs of property acquisition exploration and development incurred the aggregate of the exploration and development costs incurred in the most recent financial year and the change during that year in estimated future development costs generally will not reflect total finding and development costs related to reserves additions for that year fd a costs are calculated as capital expenditures plus net acquisition costs plus change in fdc fd a per boe is calculated as fd a costs divided by reserves additions for the applicable period recycle ratio is calculated as funds flow from operations per boe divided by f d or fd a as applicable funds flow from operations per boe is calculated by dividing funds flow from operations by sales volume for the period reserve replacement is calculated by dividing the annual reserve additions by the annual production net asset value nav per share is calculated as before or after tax npv10 plus estimated year end working capital converted from usd to cad as applicable divided by basic shares outstanding at december 31 2018

for two decades more or less since the falklands war and the end of the military dictatorships that had become an international byword for counter revolutionary ferocity south america has been largely forgotten by world politics recycled democratisation debt and dependency offered few conflicts and yielded no consequences to compare with dramas in eastern europe or russia the middle or far east even domestic convulsions in north america the days of the cuban missile crisis might have belonged to another eon today there are once again tremors in these backlands of the larger arena at one end of the continent argentina has seen a social breakdown amid the largest sovereign default in history that is the equivalent for neo liberalism of the collapse of communism in the soviet union at the other venezuela teeters day by day on the brink of civil war till very recently these were the two richest societies of the region in between american gunships swarm over colombia as guerrillas shell the presidential palace desperate indian populations loft a radical colonel to power in ecuador where the dollar thousands of miles from washington is now the official currency and in bolivia have come close to electing one of their own as president a militant farmer of coca the other currency of the area under weak rulers peru and paraguay are seething with discontent everywhere economic crisis is biting hard in this landscape the sweeping electoral victory in brazil of a burly former metal worker from a family of 22 ungrammatical in speech and untutored in government is the loudest rumble of thunder to date with a population now approaching 180 million more than the rest of the continent combined brazil towers over its neighbours but has never historically led them whether this might change under lula is one of the many uncertainties posed by his capture of the presidency at the head of the partido dos trabalhadores within the country itself the nature of his triumph raises other questions in the great brazilian cities his victory was celebrated with explosions of joy in the streets for the disinherited throughout the country one of their own was incredibly in power at last in the united states on the other hand after initial misgivings on the right establishment organs are already falling over each other to reassure their readers that lula is now a reformed character who can be trusted to cherish ties with washington and understand the concerns of wall street here in the uk the economist more warily but more bluntly asks can lula finish the job the job in question is what has been executed in brazil in the past eight years under fernando henrique cardoso here before any consideration of the rebus of lula himself is where all analysis of the current situation in brazil must start what kind of verdict does the impending change represent in the first instance on cardoso s presidency lula campaigned strongly against his record and even josé serra the candidate of his own party avoided compromising mention of him yet opinion polls suggest that cardoso s standing as an individual has held up well and there is no doubt that many brazilians principally but not exclusively from the middle classes believe that he has been their most enlightened ruler to date cardoso s defenders can point to a series of achievements which even if often exaggerated in official apologias have been real enough hyperinflation was broken at the beginning of his rule unambiguously benefiting the worst off layers of the population illiteracy was reduced infant mortality fell there was some redistribution of land if none of these advances was very spectacular brazil lags far behind even mexico on the first and third not to speak of argentina or chile on the second the social ledger is not entirely bare nor for that matter is the administrative the state apparatus has in certain respects undergone genuine modernisation rendering it less opaque and more efficient levels of corruption though still high have fallen statistical information is somewhat more reliable budgetary controls are tighter regional pork barrels are fewer all this has eroded the archaic oligarchies of the north east forces that helped cardoso to power but have weakened under him perhaps the most important long term change of these years if it is a mistake to dismiss these gains they remain modest compared with the damage inflicted by the government s macroeconomic policies the defining character of the cardoso presidency has been neo liberalism lite as brazilians pioneers of nicotine images of politics would say in other words the kind of neo liberalism that predominated throughout the developed capitalist world in the 1990s these were years when doctrines of the third way or the new centre clinton blair schroeder ostensibly distanced themselves from the harder versions of neo liberalism pioneered by reagan and thatcher in the 1980s while in practice continuing indeed often accentuating the original programme if now tricked out with secondary social concessions and a more emollient rhetoric throughout this period the fundamental dynamic of neo liberalism has persisted unabated its two core principles deregulation of markets and privatisation of services or industries where still public setting the parameters of economic correctness in the united states it was the brackish aftertaste of clinton s regime in the white house that made sufficient voters too queasy to return gore but the real legacy of clinton s rule was the abolition of new deal restraint on speculative banking the deregulation of telecoms and the bubble economy that burst in the wake of his exit enron tyco and worldcom its parting signatures in underdeveloped conditions the sequence was necessarily different convinced that brazil could not finance growth from domestic savings and that its public enterprises fostered inefficiency and corruption cardoso overvalued the currency put the state sector on the auction block and threw the economy wide open gambling on imports to hold down inflation and foreign investment to modernise infrastructure and industry brazil is a huge country with a large internal market and abundant resources overseas capital duly flowed in 150 billion by the end of cardoso s mandate but did little or nothing to dynamise the brazilian economy whose rates of investment remained feeble throughout his rule attracted mainly by cheap assets and sky high interest rates foreign operators snapped up public enterprises acquired local firms and above all bought state bonds trade deficits soared interest rates were raised even further to prop up the currency and debt levels became hopelessly vulnerable to loss of confidence triggering enormous outflows whenever there was turbulence in international financial markets mexico in 1995 east asia in 1997 russia in 1998 argentina in 2001 and an inevitable collapse of the exchange rate repeated imf bail outs merely deepened the pit of debt into which the country was being driven when cardoso came to power the trade balance was in surplus and public debt some 28 per cent of gdp by the end of this year it had doubled to 56 per cent most of it held on short term maturities under his presidency per capita growth rate has been a miserable 1 per cent a year the results of the brazilian variant of neo liberalism are plain for all to see worsening stagnation falling real wages unprecedented unemployment and a staggering debt burden the regime stands condemned on its own terms the government s original achievement monetary stabilisation is in ruins the currency is worth a quarter of its value at the outset of cardoso s presidency interest rates are the highest in the world 22 per cent and the country is staring a moratorium in the face violent crime haunts the big cities as never before inequality remains very nearly the worst in the world dependency in every deleterious sense is incomparably greater than it was when cardoso in a now distant past as a sociologist once proposed a critical theory of it the logic of a neo liberal model on the periphery of world capitalism puts any country that adopts it at the mercy of unpredictable movements in the financial markets at the centre so cardoso s misadventures were in large measure the chronicle of a fiasco foretold but this was also a timorous and incompetent regime the exchange rate was overvalued from the start and no thought was given even to the modest degree of capital controls that a dependent neo liberalism still allows and which protected the chilean economy from the worst ravages that brazil was to suffer more generally the notion that the key to attracting foreign capital was deregulation and privatisation à l outrance was extraordinarily naive in the same years that cardoso was leading brazil into its present blind alley china was attracting productive foreign investment on a scale that dwarfed the hot money in brazil while maintaining tight capital controls and a non convertible currency to achieve the highest rates of gnp growth in the world there is no shortage of acute economic problems not to speak of inequalities and injustices in china today but the contrast between vigorous development and crippled dependency could not be starker why did cardoso stick to a plainly calamitous path for so long when its logic was already clear in the first exchange rate crisis in the spring of 1995 one explanation would point to the political pact with the old order the landowners of the north east the bankers and media magnates of são paulo and rio that brought him to power pas d ennemis à droite had been his maxim today though he himself continues to speak otherwise his admirers abroad as any issue of the economist reveals praise cardoso s rule as a centre right regime in this interpretation a distinguished statesman and intellectual of the left became a captive of conservative alliances from which he could never free himself such a view however miscontrues the traditional oligarchies of the country which have never been doctrinally inflexible their instincts are utterly pragmatic or physiological as the brazilians put it and often stood to lose from strong doses of deregulation a better answer probably lies in cardoso s relationship to his finance minister pedro malan and through him to the imf and the us psychological dependence of a ruler on a technician in the decisive area of contemporary government has become an increasingly common pattern next door the relationship between carlos menem and domingo cavallo offered an even more striking example the two couples brazilian and argentinian were very different cavallo had a demonic side not least in his boldness and energy that malan a quiet mediocrity entirely lacks menem who was completely ignorant of economics allowed cavallo to install the ultimate insanity of a currency board guaranteeing parity of the peso to the dollar but he had reason to fear him as a potential rival and in due course they parted company cardoso on the other hand who would probably have liked malan to succeed him was infinitely better prepared than menem but still remained by formation a sociologist whose sense of the separation of disciplines perhaps inclined him to favour a professional economist the original stabilisation of 1994 was the work of malan and his team and cardoso owed everything to it that moral debt made it difficult for him to jettison malan along with gustavo franco the brash novice he had installed as head of the central bank when politically speaking he should in his own interest have done so when the artificial exchange rate finally buckled franco was dropped but malan stayed and brazil s fuite en avant into the tunnel of debt rattled on in cardoso s inability to separate himself from his chamberlain there was a further and ultimately more decisive factor malan an intimate of the imf enjoyed american confidence these were the years in which stanley fischer acting as itinerant bagman for robert rubin and lawrence summers would disburse stand by credits and loans from the imf in sovereign disregard of its statutes according to the political value to washington of incumbent regimes around the world the two chief beneficiaries of his largesse were russia and brazil countries large and strategic enough for rulers congenial to us interests to warrant special favours no matter how deficient their economic performance yeltsin and cardoso were both rescued from electoral difficulties by timely injections of cash because washington wished to keep them in power in moscow the guarantor of these transactions was chubais in brasília it was malan so long as his finance minister remained in office cardoso could be sure of exceptional treatment by the fund and the treasury this was a tie that in any case came naturally for cardoso the united states was now the central point of external reference in every sense originally his culture he was after all a leading marxist intellectual in the 1960s had been much more european than american but in the years of exile under the dictatorship there was a significant change us foundations made possible the research centre he set up on returning to brazil in 1979 and when he entered the political arena he made no secret of his belief that what brazil needed was an equivalent of the democratic party by the time he was president a decade and a half later the power of the united states in the world had increased enormously victory in the cold war creating global hegemony of a kind never seen before ideologically cardoso had adapted to this ascendancy well before he entered the palácio do planalto sporadic friction over lesser tariffs or patents aside matter for commercial attachés the result was more or less complete alignment with washington on all major international issues in effect brazil had no foreign policy worth speaking of historically this was scarcely a novelty the military regime of the 1960s and 1970s which possessed some sense of geopolitics and pursued a line in africa at sharp variance with the united states was in this respect an exception but cardoso came to power promising that brazil would play a role in the world commensurate with the size of its new found democracy in office however he might have been a ruler of honduras for all his effect at large his contemporary guido di tella argentina s foreign minister under menem a scholar of no less charm and distinction once publicly described his country s foreign policy with the terse words we have carnal relations with the united states the rest of the world doesn t count cardoso is incapable of such hispanic tranchant portuguese is a more edulcorating idiom but his diplomatic practice was the same the principal difference was in rhetorical pretension abroad he will be remembered mainly for those fatuous gatherings in new york florence and berlin solemnly discussing the third way at which clinton and blair conferred with companions and underlings to increasing ridicule even among media well disposed to them the comical windbaggery of these occasions did more to discredit cardoso than he can have imagined for someone of his past they were the intellectual equivalent of gorbachev s sale of pizzas on tv within brazil such matters have been of little moment there cardoso continues to be widely respected for another side of his tenure in the eyes of admirers his greatest civilising achievement has been the consolidation of brazilian democracy courteous to opponents constitutional in conduct cardoso has presided it is argued over a nation that has become more mature in its politics and stable in its attachment to values of liberty and civility the peaceful transfer of power to lula due to take place in january after an election cleansed of calumny or violence will set the seal on his most enduring legacy to the country a normal democratic life has finally taken root in soil long poisoned by brazil s inheritance of racial slavery rural oligarchy populist demagogy and last but not least military tyranny this now standard defence of the cardoso years reveals more about brazilian identity than it does about democracy empires tend to give peoples who have enjoyed them a markedly self absorbed provincial outlook a fate brazilians have no more been able to escape than britons or americans for the fact obvious enough in any comparative perspective is that the local preservation of democracy is no particular merit of cardoso s since it was never seriously threatened after the generals withdrew from power all the other latin american societies argentina chile uruguay that underwent military dictatorships in the 1960s and 1970s have done just the same under colourless or conservative or even corrupt and autocratic rulers from aylwin to frei to lagos sanguinetti to lacalle to batlle no big deal even menem whose temperament could hardly have been less democratic handed over power to de la rua just as routinely as cardoso will do many brazilians still find it difficult to realise they have neighbours reminded of such common experiences however loyalists will concede that formally speaking constitutional legality has been respected throughout the southern cone and in that sense cardoso s rule may seem nothing special but substantively the quality of brazilian democracy so the reply goes has vastly improved during his presidency compared with the chaotic turbulent years under sarney collor and itamar his government has been a model of rational conduct and orderly dialogue how is this claim to be judged there is no doubt that brazilian politics became calmer and more predictable under cardoso or that the conventions of the new republic that emerged after the dictatorship whose constitution dates from 1988 became steadily more anchored in custom and habit to that extent it could even be said that not monetary but political stabilisation was the trademark of the presidency the one plainly outlasting the downfall of the other on the other hand a glance at the statistics or stories of steadily escalating crime in the press is enough to indicate the limits of the new civility while urbanities are swapped in the cupolas of power violence rages on the beaches and streets a week before the second round of the presidential polls this october the jornal do brasil bannered its monday edition shoot outs in restaurant bus school 8 dead a normal day in rio in a single morning sub machine guns were blasting at the corner of the avenida atlantica in tourist copacabana in petty bourgeois niteroi across the bay and in the slums of the zona norte anglo american viewers will soon be able to get a sense of such nightmares with the release of the movie city of god based on paulo lins s novel they are unlikely to think the country is being civilised it is not just the contrast between elite arrangements and popular misery that makes talk of a transformation of brazilian political mores seem one sided something more ideologically pointed is also at stake for when people speak of the civilising effect of cardoso s government what they are often actually referring to is the way it has tamped down the conflictual potential of brazilian democracy by setting the parameters of a consensus the local version of la pensée unique in which all serious dissent is disqualified in advance as outlandish and anachronistic naturally within this conformist corral in which neo liberal platitudes are taken as read exchanges are well mannered but if we look at the institutional structures of power a different picture emerges in brazil parties are often little more than labels of pecuniary convenience alliances for dubious ends between the most incongruous partners in which deputies can transfer allegiances with the abandon of football players before and even for a short while after he became president cardoso spoke of the urgent need for political reform to render the party system more principled and coherent at the end of eight years what is the balance sheet there has been no change of any kind in power cardoso preferred to maintain the existing amorphous promiscuity which afforded much scope for his own outstanding skills in corridor negotiation and manoeuvre the reform he forced through instead was the exact opposite changing the constitution to permit his own re election as president politically speaking this was certainly the worst single act of his rule and the one which will have the longest effects it places him alongside fujimori and menem whose example he imitated as another self important egoist who degraded the legal traditions and democratic prospects of his country latin america has always suffered from the bane of over powerful presidentialism historically the worst single import from the united states aggravated by the lack of northern checks and balances and forming the seedbed of every kind of mystagogy and autocracy but at least the liberal oligarchs of the 19th century and their successors in the 20th typically saw the sense of single term limits in brazil even the military dictatorship of the 1960s and 1970s did not tamper with this rule there was no compelling reason other than vainglory for cardoso to insist on re election malan or serra could perfectly well have continued his regime in 1998 when they would have been elected without difficulty in ramming through such a fundamental change for such picayune motives cardoso dealt a triple blow to brazilian democracy first by resorting to corruption to attain his ends deputies from the depths of the amazonian jungle were purchased to secure the necessary legislative majority and later dismissed by their beneficiary with the immortal words someone may have sold their vote the government didn t buy it second by reinforcing an executive that already enjoys vast powers of patronage and manipulation and intensifying the personalisation of politics in the most deteriorated sense around it finally and perhaps most fatally by the hypocrisy with which cardoso orchestrated the campaign for his continuism telling the nation again and again that he had nothing to do with the spontaneous desire that had arisen within congress to permit a second term a matter about which he was quite neutral lying as brazen as this is an act of contempt showing all too clearly the cynical realities behind the façade of an improved brazilian democracy if there was a turning point in cardoso s rule it was here to see the political decay to which it has contributed one only had to glance at the commercials with which every presidential candidate thought fit to deluge the nation this autumn in the end re election rebounded even against cardoso himself if he had stepped down in 1998 his performance though its underlying logic was already plain enough would have looked far better than it does in 2002 by clinging to power he has ensured that he will be remembered for his economic myopia he will exit in mexican style like lópez portillo or carlos salinas able to defer the reckoning for his policies till he is out of office but unlikely to be able to protect his reputation from what ensues unlike them he never took financial advantage of his position the treasury was not looted on the other hand unlike them he didn t give the nation any passing period of growth either this is not to say that history will judge him a failure his very economic mismanagement could paradoxically engender a long term political success for the legacy of debt he has left will lay such excruciating constraints on his successor that he has good reason to hope as he proclaims that his policies will live on after him nor is this the only way he has locked in those who will follow him the brand of conventional wisdom he came to represent remains if not quite intact still largely dominant in brazil today and the personalisation of power he intensified along with it so just as thatcher can regard blair as her most durable achievement cardoso may still be able to congratulate himself that he rendered a neo liberal order in brazil irreversible for some time to come on the face of it lula would seem an improbable candidate for the role that cardoso has so clearly cast him in yet latin america abounds with examples of politicians or parties winning elections on platforms fiercely opposed to neo liberalism but once in power implementing neo liberal policies often more drastically than those they denounced for doing so in the first place in venezuela carlos andrés pérez was the first to follow this parabola campaigning passionately against foreign debt and austerity and then imposing an imf dictated package so savage it detonated weeks of deadly rioting the caracazo of 1989 in a society then substantially richer per capita than brazil is today in the same year fujimori beat mario vargas llosa in peru by attacking his financial orthodoxy with a violence far exceeding any pt discourse today and then became the architect of a particularly corrupt and cruel version of it in argentina menem s trajectory was essentially the same none of these figures situated himself exactly on the left but in europe we have seen the same cycle played out between left and right alike france is the most eloquent case chirac came to power in 1995 denouncing la pensée unique it was he who popularised the term of the mitterrand years once elected his government promptly tried to impose classic neo liberal reforms which set off the great strikes of 1996 and lost him the elections of 1998 won by jospin promising to do the opposite four years later jospin had privatised more than all previous governments put together and the socialist party was in turn rejected at the polls this spring time and again promises were so much electoral confetti to note these precedents is not to say that brazil is doomed to repeat the same cycle potentially lula s capture of the presidency marks a far deeper and more hopeful political change than any rotation of office in france the symbolism of a former shoeshine boy and street vendor achieving supreme power in the most unequal major society on earth speaks for itself although other brazilian presidents have been of comparatively humble origin they all made their way to the top through further military or civilian education lula a trade union leader in his twenties remains culturally a worker from a poor rural family raised in the industrial belt round são paulo whose portuguese is imperfect and formal learning minimal in private with a nice touch of irony he has remarked bush and i must be the two most ignorant presidents in the world like his northern counterpart he has a streak of laziness alongside a by now considerable acquired shrewdness across successive presidential campaigns he has honed a macho charm capable of seducing middle class audiences and disarming opponents as well as electrifying the masses to see him at the microphone in the canecão a traditional music hall in botafogo in the last days of the campaign surrounded by composers singers actresses writers labour wooing culture explaining to the crowd that he had been to rio for political meetings many times but had never been able to wander barefoot on the sand of its beaches like any other citizen was to watch a theatrical performance as professional as any in that setting all this can encourage myth making brazilian culture is sentimental as well as cynical the two as one would expect going together and the local media are currently in biographical overdrive as if social origins were a safe guide to political conduct the example of walesa should be warning enough against excesses in this department that said it remains the case that lula embodies a life experience of popular hardship and social struggle that no other ruler in the world approaches his bond with the poor sets him apart this is his primary constituency and he will care how they rate him in power behind him moreover is the only new mass party to have been created out of the labour movement since the second world war an organisation that in numbers influence and relative cohesion has no equal in latin america the pt which claims some 300 000 members though criteria are not strict is now after administering a string of brazil s largest cities são paulo belém recife brasília pôrto alegre a much more moderate organisation than it was in the 1980s but it is still relatively free form without a centralised bureaucratic apparatus and contains many militants who have not forgotten their radical past last but not least there is the mass sentiment expressed in the presidential poll itself the wretched of the brazilian earth those officially classified as poor and indigent who make up nearly half the population cast their votes for him in huge numbers in the coastal cities of rio and salvador with their black populations he had landslide majorities 79 and 89 per cent respectively a climate of popular expectation surrounds lula that no president of the new republic has ever enjoyed at the outset of his mandate hope of relief from the misery of the last years will not vanish overnight on the other hand against all such subjective build up must be set the objective constraints of the situation in which president and party will now find themselves first and foremost there is the landscape of economic wreckage left by malan and cardoso already before taking office the pt leadership has strapped itself in some cases with well nigh masochistic zest into the procrustean bed made by the imf a primary surplus of 3 75 per cent of gdp which will not only exclude any significant increase of social spending but is likely to dictate a severe contraction to win the confidence of foreign creditors and keep interest rates from climbing still higher if it is all but taboo to say so in brazil abroad the financial press makes no secret of its conclusion that a moratorium on the debt mountain currently running at r885 billion is sooner or later inevitable in short the economic crisis is likely to deepen at the same time social mobilisation remains depressed at levels far below those of the 1980s one of the effects of the cardoso years having been to weaken the collective energies needed to confront emergencies here the scale of lula s victory at the polls is a mixed blessing in the second round he piled up 52 million votes crushing serra by 61 to 39 per cent in part this plebiscite was a tribute to lula s tireless criss crossing of the remotest corners of the country something no other candidate attempted but it was also the product of a saccharine public relations and propaganda campaign orchestrated around the sickly watchword lula peace and love and projected through television commercials of uninhibited effrontery designed by a leading media pander of the right brazilian political advertisements because publicly funded are longer than american ones allowing for more serious argument but also for more flamboyantly manipulative kitsch lula s outclassed serra s in every respect not least in the sums of money spent on them their signature gesture was the beckoning hand of nubile nymphs sports stars average joes inviting the viewer to the rhythms of exuberant music onto bandwagon or into bed in the name of the motto once lula had established a commanding lead in the opinion polls the globo empire brazil s news international started to smile on him and money poured into his campaign coffers from banks and corporations making him paradoxically far the best financed of the candidates such support is not given free in addition powerful though the presidency is legislation must pass congress there the pt has become for the first time the largest party but in a fragmented spectrum in which it commands less than a fifth of the seats lula s national vote was double that of his party which failed to gain the governorship of any important state the imbalance between executive and legislative scores will be accentuated by the enhanced presidency whose vast powers of patronage some 15 000 posts are in its favour anyway risk absorbing too many pt militants for his electoral campaign lula adopted a paternalist textile millionaire from a small evangelical party as his vice presidential candidate and picked up the endorsement of not a few disgruntled or opportunist oligarchs from the north east for a workable majority in congress he has already had to extend such alliances coming to an arrangement with the corrupt and inchoate pmdb perpetual prostitute of the party system till yesterday a prop of cardoso s regime the pt s political manager josé dirceu sprung from a military jail by a famous kidnapping of the us ambassador in rio flown to exile in cuba underground operative for a decade on his return to brazil when not even the mother of his child knew his real identity tactical architect of lula s victory will no doubt control this front with an expert hand but it would be naive to imagine much radical legislation speeding out of the new chamber beyond these liabilities there is also the weight of cultural tradition that will bear on the agents of any renovation far more even than italy which gave the concept to the world brazil is par excellence the land of trasformismo the capacity of the established order to embrace and invert forces of change until they become indistinguishable from what they set out to oppose the dark side of the matchless brazilian conviviality the career of cardoso former marxist become a pillar of the centre right has been a typical expression of this culture of which he is both imprint and instrument lula s plebeian background is no bar to embrace by the establishment social hierarchy has always formed an easy connubium with affable informality in brazil and there is no reason to think that without precautions the backing of banks today could not become the neutering of an upstart tomorrow the rhetorical conditions for such an outcome have already been prepared peace and love are in advance a vocabulary of ingestion and defeat a cause can survive a slogan but without better ones than this objective pressures will crush subjective desires soon enough here programmes as distinct from catchwords become decisive what does the incoming government propose to the country if one were to consider its prospects statically it would be difficult to avoid pessimism in opposition the pt has not been uncreative the participatory budgets of pôrto alegre where voters determine the distribution of spending in their wards are an invention widely admired abroad pt economists were the first to point out the logic of malan s neo liberalism and predict its fatal consequences but overall it is obvious that neither party nor president has any articulated alternative to the reigning orthodoxy as their pre electoral adherence to the directives of the imf made clear on the other hand historically actual policy innovations in latin america have not followed preconceived schemes out of the great crisis that shook the continent in 1929 arose a set of pragmatic intuitive responses essentially different forms of import substituting populism getulismo in brazil peronism in argentina the mnr in bolivia that were highly creative and effective in their own time the doctrines later associated with them derived from the ideas of the argentinian economist raúl prebisch crystallised after the event more than guiding the actors in advance south america today faces once again a crisis of continental proportions why should not brazil or its neighbours find its way out of the impasse in similar fashion the difference of course lies in the immeasurably greater degree of integration of these economies societies and cultures in the global order of capital commanded from the north the material and ideological intermeshing of national agents and processes with the international structures that penetrate and mould them has no comparison with the situation in the depression when latin america was left largely to its own devices once wall street crashed to that extent the programmatic requirements for an escape from the present straitjacket appear much higher but if the central economies themselves should go into a tail spin were the united states to describe the trajectory of japan in the last decade then as the empire attends to its homelands the possibilities of improvised invention in the periphery might be released once more for the moment fingers crossed
on february 1 the economic information daily a newspaper owned by the xinhua news agency reported that various arms of the government including regional authorities and the state owned assets supervision and administration commission sasac the body that oversees all state assets are moving forward with liquidation plans in regions including hebei heilongjiang henan and shaanxi in december the chinese government set a goal of closing zombie state owned enterprises by the end of 2020 plans to liquidate china s thousands of zombie companies are underway in several of its provinces according to state media as the government moves towards an aggressive target of eliminating such firms by 2020 closing thousands of such companies consistently unprofitable firms that remain in operation only because of government subsidies or regular loans from state owned banks in less than two years would be an extremely ambitious undertaking in a strong economic environment but doing so in the midst of an economic slowdown exacerbated by the ongoing trade war with the united states raises questions as to how much the chinese government can actually accomplish an employee looks at an aluminium foil roll being lifted at a plant in binzhou shandong province photo reuters china s economy is growing at its lowest rate for three decades but analysts have warned that unless it addresses issues of debt and inefficiency the slump will be prolonged reducing the number of zombie companies could improve the efficiency of the economy in a number of ways closing unprofitable firms in industries with excess production capacity such as the steel sector would support prices and profits while easing tensions with trading partners it would also allow investment to shift to more productive uses in both the public and private sectors improving the country s longer term growth outlook and it would help address the us complaint that chinese government subsidies distort the domestic market giving chinese companies an unfair advantage over international counterparts however the closing of thousands of these companies could dramatically increase unemployment at a time when joblessness is already on the rise it is unclear if the services sector would be able to produce enough new jobs to absorb these laid off industrial workers the disposal of state owned zombie enterprises is closely related to the core tasks of supply side structural reform such as reducing excess capacity and deleveraging excess debt and risky lending said chen dafei senior financial analyst at shanghai based investment bank orient securities the risk associated with state owned enterprises is unemployment but a bigger risk with the move is that it will mistakenly hurt small and medium sized private enterprises chen warned chinese president xi jinping visits a workshop of china first heavy industries cfhi in qiqihar northeast china s heilongjiang province heilongjiang is among the provinces where it has been reported government authorities are closing zombie companies photo xinhua zombie companies in china s heavy industries are serviced by networks of smaller firms supplying everything from equipment to food services to transport if the zombie company is closed many of these small business would go bust with further consequences for employment chen said with beijing prioritising job growth as a means of maintaining social stability the government could reasonably be expected to take a go slow approach to closing zombie firms which would be counter to the ambitious target of closing them by 2020 in the past sasac has merged zombie firms with healthy state owned companies in a bid to avoid spikes in unemployment however this risks eroding the finances of the healthy firm this is not a new problem for china s authorities the dangers of zombie firms are well known reform of this part of the economy is at the core of the government s state sector structural reform effort until last summer that effort had been moving forward led by government campaigns to reduce excess industrial capacity and cut back on pollution the start of the trade war and the subsequent slowdown in the economy however sidelined those efforts as the government s focus shifted to stabilising economic growth recently though addressing the problem has re emerged as a top priority a december meeting between 11 top chinese government bodies including the national development and reform commission the powerful planning agency and the people s bank of china the central bank resulted in the 2020 pledge with a list of zombie companies to be closed set to be published within three months this message was reinforced from the very top last month must increase our efforts to appropriately handle the problems associated with zombie companies chinese president xi jinping said in a speech on january 22 china has reduced its excess steel production capacity by around 150 million tonnes some provinces still have a further 20 million tonnes to cut so we will urge these provinces to accelerate the process miao wei the minister of industry and information technology said in a press conference on january 29 in carrying out this mandate however government agencies face the challenges of a moving target both in relation to the number of zombie companies there are and the amount of debt they hold sasac s most recent data showed that there were 2 041 central government run zombie companies still operating in early 2016 including zombie state owned enterprises overseen by local governments the total climbs above 10 000 however in a recent report on bankruptcies maxime lemerle head of sector and insolvency research at trade credit insurer euler hermes suggested that the total number of zombie state owned enterprises may exceed 20 000 cases according to some studies a report by china s renmin university in 2016 meanwhile listed the industries with the highest proportion of zombie companies as steel 51 43 per cent real estate 44 53 per cent and architecture 31 76 per cent through its deleveraging programme of the last two years china has made progress on stabilising its huge pile of corporate debt corporate debt as a percentage of gross domestic product gdp fell to 155 1 at the end of june 2018 from 157 1 at the end of march it was still well above the 93 1 per cent of gdp at the end of 2008 at the very start of the global financial crisis but the initiative to close the thousands of zombie companies in such a short period of time threatens to sharply reverse that progress elimination of zombie companies is a double edged sword said zhang yongjun deputy chief economist at the china centre for international economic exchanges a beijing based think tank on the one hand it will mean more efficient allocation of investment on the other hand a surge in insolvencies in a short period of time will definitely affect economic behaviour and market operations resulting in an increase in bad debt the international monetary fund imf using 2016 data calculated that zombie companies accounted for 9 per cent of china s total corporate debt however nicholas lardy senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics in washington said the imf probably underestimates the share of zombie firms given the decline by two thirds in the average return on assets of state industrial companies between the pre global financial crisis period before 2008 and the 2016 data presented in the imf study it is surprising that the imf estimate of the share of zombie industrial companies in 2016 6 5 per cent was less than half that in the earlier period 15 per cent in 2005 07 lardy wrote in his new book the state strikes back the end of economic reform in china given that a large share of the losses of state firms is generated by firms in the service sector one would expect that the share of the total debt of all non financial corporations accounted for by all zombie firms would be substantially higher than the share of debt of industrial firms accounted for by zombie industrial firms the latest data from the ministry of finance shows that china s state owned enterprises had 115 64 trillion yuan us 17 14 trillion in total debt as of the end of december an increase of 8 1 from a year earlier

thank you charles and thank all of you for listening in today for 2018 mpt achieved a total shareholder return of more than 25 compared to a negative 4 5 for the msci us reit index our two year total shareholder return was more than 50 compared to the snl u s reit healthcare index of 6 and less than 0 5 for the msci us reit index for the 10 year total shareholder return mpt ranked number 1 for all healthcare reits with a 445 return which was more than 2 5 times that of the snl u s reit healthcare index during 2018 mpt had another year of milestones and records we once again saw the value of our portfolio validated through multiple and exciting transactions including our highly valued joint venture in germany with the primonial group the successful buyout of our equity ownership in earnest health and several other profitable exits such as the sale of north cypress medical center to hca these and other 2018 transactions provided record proceeds of 1 5 billion of which more than 500 million of those proceeds were over and above our original investment the proceeds were used to reduce debt and to put mpt in prime position for accretive capital deployment in 2019 like that of the transaction in australia we just announced advertisement advertisement we were pleased to kick off 2019 with our announcement last week of our agreement to acquire 11 australian hospitals from healthscope since our inception australia was a location with which we have targeted for growth like other european countries where we have expanded into australia has a healthcare system that is similar to the united states healthcare in australia is among the best in the world and we are delighted to add these quality healthscope assets to our portfolio we ve been watching and analyzing the healthscope assets for more than 10 years now the portfolio of 11 healthscope hospitals are truly some of the finest hospitals in australia of the 11 facilities eight are general acute care hospitals representing 86 of our total investment one is a rehab hospital representing 6 and two are psychiatric facilities representing 7 they are primarily located along the east coast concentrated around sydney and melbourne and in perth on the west coast we work directly with the current management team of healthscope since late summer of 2018 and have been working with brookfield since the early part of the summer we are excited to team up with brookfield on this transaction and look forward to growing this portfolio with them 2018 included continued work on exciting construction developments of over 187 million with surgery partners and circle health the latter providing another milestone as the first of its kind private stand alone inpatient rehabilitation hospital in the united kingdom mpt continues to be the leader in acute care real estate and has amassed approximately 10 billion pro forma gross assets with 30 different operators now spanning three continents our existing portfolio also continued to perform well with this quarter s reporting we added 10 properties to our same store reporting all of the additions to the same store reporting were general acute care hospitals our same store total portfolio ebitdarm coverage for the trailing 12 months q3 2018 is 3 1 times which represents a 10 increase year over year same store acute care ebitdaram coverage is 3 6 times which represents a 12 increase year over year inpatient rehabilitation ebitdarm coverage increased to 1 9 times which represents a 2 5 times 2 5 year over year coverage improvement usrs represent about 4 6 of our total portfolio ltac ebitdarm coverage decreased to 1 5 times which represents a 7 4 year over year decline it s important to note that this coverage decline is driven by one facility whose ebitdarm coverage declined from over 9 times to a still very strong coverage of 5 times ltac represents approximately 3 of our total portfolio advertisement advertisement united states represents 77 of the total portfolio acute care hospitals continue to make up the bulk of our investments domestically at 80 which is right in line with our target range it is an important reminder that approximately 93 6 of our same store portfolio is master leased cross defaulted or includes a parent guarantee mpt has never been in a stronger position than the present as we continue to grow in size and reputation as the global leader in hospital real estate and the industry s preeminent source of capital we are actively engaged in billions of dollars of domestic and international acquisitions with more opportunities coming our way steve r steven hamner chief financial officer executive vice president director advertisement advertisement thank you ed on our last quarter s call we reported that we had completed the capital and portfolio repositioning strategy that we had been focused on for more than a year resulting in record profitability liquidity and financial flexibility along with an actionable 2019 acquisition pipeline of 2 0 billion since then our acquisition expectations have grown even further and last week we demonstrated the strength of that pipeline by announcing agreements to acquire and expand 11 premier hospitals in australia for as much as 1 2 billion we ll focus on our outlook for 2019 momentarily but first i ll review the fourth quarter and full year 2018 results as expected this morning we reported normalized ffo of 0 31 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2018 and 1 37 for the year these annual results do not of course include approximately 671 million in gains on the sale of real estate including a 1 4 million fourth quarter true up of the previously completed german joint venture transaction the only material adjustment from nareit ffo to normalized ffo was a fourth quarter 4 4 million tax valuation adjustment caused by the continued profitability of our taxable investments we have previously noted that our estimate provide for general and administrative expenses to be about 9 5 of total revenue however we now report revenue from our joint venture assets through the other income line making prior periods not comparable for 2018 this revenue approximated 32 million moreover non cash straight line rent adjustments during the year reduced revenue by a further 17 5 million and finally in 2018 we adopted new accounting policies that reclassified about 6 2 million to g a with these movements our 2018 g a represents about 8 9 of comparable revenue going forward we remain confident in our estimates of 9 to 9 5 g a advertisement advertisement before moving on to the update to our 2019 estimates i will point out that in december and january and in anticipation of capital needs for our australian and other likely acquisitions we activated our 750 million at the market equity program and sold approximately 11 9 million shares at an average price of 16 75 for about 200 million in proceeds recently as a result we had cash balances approximating 900 million along with a 1 3 billion availability under our revolving credit facility given our estimate of in place ebitda and outstanding borrowings our current net debt to ebitda ratio approximates 4 4 times this morning we reported that we have increased our 2019 acquisitions expectations by about 500 million to 2 5 billion over our estimate from last quarter consequently we now estimate that upon completion of the 2 5 billion in expected 2019 acquisitions our annualized in place normalized ffo will be about 1 54 per share last quarter our estimate was for approximately 1 50 per share built into last quarter s 1 42 to 1 46 calendar 2019 normalized ffo estimate was an assumption of a late december acquisition that is now not included in our 2019 estimates however due to the growing pipeline we are maintaining our 1 42 to 1 46 calendar 2019 normalized ffo estimate the calendar year estimate is of course sensitive to timing and we intend to periodically update our estimates as we gain clarity into likelihood of closings we continue to estimate that the blended gaap yield of our 2019 acquisitions will fall between 7 5 and 8 5 to be clear that is not a range of targeted deal terms but an average portfolio yield weighted by investment value we also continue to expect that nominal capitalization rates will likely be lower in areas outside the united states where the cost of capital is similarly lower than in the u s the australian opportunity is a good example wherein we invest to achieve yield substantially above our cost of capital and just to clarify this investment will be strongly and immediately accretive for our shareholders advertisement advertisement importantly certain investments can also deliver intangible value that leads directly to even lower cost of capital and higher long term ffo these intangibles include diversification from geographic tenant and credit perspectives extension of our portfolio average lease terms improvement of mpt s own credit ratings and borrowing cost and attraction of other forms of long term permanent and inexpensive equity like capital the best recent example of this last benefit is the creation of 600 million in virtually free capital through our german joint venture we do not focus solely on the year one cash capitalization rate when we underwrite a potential acquisition we will continue to grow medical properties trust as the unchallenged and sustainable global leader in hospital real estate finance this requires that rather than simply building a collection of stand alone leases we create a portfolio of many assets providing diversity in geographies operators and property types that create predictable inflation protected cash returns for our shareholders along with the initial cap rate and immediate accretion we consider all of these characteristics and their effects on our portfolio taken as a whole the healthscope transaction will in addition to creating a medium and long term accretive returns substantially improve the mpt portfolio considered as a whole and with that we will be happy to take any questions operator questions and answers operator thank you operator s instructions our first question comes from jordan sadler from keybanc capital markets your line is now open advertisement advertisement jordan sadler keybanc capital markets analyst thank you and thanks for all the color if you guys could a little bit you ve increased the acquisition guidance a little bit seems that healthscope was probably a driver of that as you mentioned is the character of the remaining acquisition pipeline the same as it was last quarter as well or have there been other some puts and takes in terms of what you re focused on edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer well jordan it s probably very similar the only difference that would make is probably more here in the u s than internationally after post the healthscope transaction but it is all general acute care hospitals jordan sadler keybanc capital markets analyst a little bit more active domestically did you say edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer correct jordan sadler keybanc capital markets analyst okay and the size of that aggregate pipeline is still in the 5 billion range would you say edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer that s correct inaudible that healthscope was part of that original 5 billion that we talked about in the last call jordan sadler keybanc capital markets analyst okay and then steve for you on dry powder obviously you ve got quite a bit of liquidity i think you outlined north of 2 billion but as it relates to your debt to ebitda target what do you feel is your dry powder right about now before hitting that target r steven hamner chief financial officer executive vice president director well we re not constrained by a for example a 5 5 times leverage ratio on a temporary basis so i m not quite sure i m am answering your question but we can certainly exceed that because of the alternatives we have with the atm with other equity offerings with joint venture type arrangements so we have upwards of 2 billion available to us that would likely put us at about the 5 5 times range in itself jordan sadler keybanc capital markets analyst okay i guess i the way i was looking at it is and i don t know if you view it similarly but just based on where you stood at the end of the year and where you stand today because you ve obviously been using the atm just how much you could spend before hitting that threshold i think that is still your the upper limit of your threshold i don t know maybe you ve had some temporary flexibility around it but i think you want to target being around there i m just curious how much you would need to how much you could spend before hitting that in your view based on the returns that you achieve on your investment is it probably 1 billion plus or minus r steven hamner chief financial officer executive vice president director it s unlikely that we would get close to that we re not going to run right up to the edge and then began thinking about replenishing equity or other types of non debt capital so it s just not the way we manage the balance sheet or manage the acquisition pipeline edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer you know jordan part of the advantage we have is that all of that acquisitions inaudible going to come in one big chunk so we got the ability to manage the capital needs fairly well jordan sadler keybanc capital markets analyst okay is your last question inaudible the timing what does it look like healthscope plus or minus and the rest of the pipeline how should we be thinking about that timing edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer the brookfield and healthscope people seem pretty confident second quarter and so we are following their their guidance on that the other major opportunities in the pipeline we are on a weighted average expecting some time a little earlier than mid year but those are very often beyond our control and can accelerate or as you well know sometimes go beyond what where we expect it okay thank you guys jordan sadler keybanc capital markets analyst okay thank you guys edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer thanks jordan operator thank you and our next question comes from drew babin from baird your line is now open drew babin baird analyst hey good morning edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer morning drew drew babin baird analyst a question again on sources of capital obviously you hit the atm in the first quarter or toward the end of last year i should say is the steward potential jv the massachusetts portfolio something that could be kind of reignite it potentially now that the properties are all leased or is that then kind of moved on from as a potential source of capital r steven hamner chief financial officer executive vice president director no that is available for the reasons you described drew babin baird analyst and i guess how should we think about the cost of equity on doing something like that relative to where your stock trades right now obviously is one if you had to raise capital today which would you prefer multiple speakers edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer well i think multiple speakers yeah on a strictly cost basis the joint venture with would be less expensive but that s not necessarily the sole or the primary focus drew babin baird analyst okay and one more question on healthscope the development investments that come along with that would the lease terms on those be the same as the acquisition itself or would the yields potentially be higher on the developments edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer no the yields are higher contractually higher drew babin baird analyst okay and one more question just going back to steward i guess how much of the steward portfolio in place right now is in the same store coverage ratios that you report and i guess if you can give us an update on kind of where steward stands as a whole and or just by market as it stands right now edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer yeah drew i don t have that first to answer right off the top of my head but from and how is steward doing it s doing exceptionally well their coverage is over 2 times drew babin baird analyst okay so is any of it in the same store numbers that are in the supplemental r steven hamner chief financial officer executive vice president director yes there are a total of 13 hospitals that are in the same store drew babin baird analyst okay that s helpful thank you very much that s it for me operator thank you and our next question comes from michael lewis from suntrust your line is now open michael lewis suntrust analyst thank you your stock price is obviously now higher than when you tapped the atm somebody once said to me you shoot the bear when the bear is there i m curious if you have thoughts of kind of you don t need to but you could over equitize the deal and if you have any specific kind of funding assumptions in your guidance that you could share in terms of equity edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer no the only guidance is again we intend to maintain in the model it s constrained by the 5 5 times leverage and depending on timing on pricing on the overall pipeline because we do look at the 2 5 billion fungibly then that leverage could be lower than that michael lewis suntrust analyst okay in terms of the 350 million of potential redevelopment or expansion opportunities what will determine if those come to fruition or not do you expect all of that to come to fruition and it sounds like you re not giving specific returns but is it something well maybe you won t answer is it 6 plus returns you expect on this edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer most of that development i think will come to fruition the question is more of a timing standpoint when all the approvals happen and i think that if you look at the where we think the yields will be on that is it will be higher than the 6 range michael lewis suntrust analyst okay great thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from derek johnston of deutsche bank your line is now open shivani sood deutsche bank analyst hi this is shivani sood on for derek johnson you guys mentioned that the australian healthcare system has similarities with the u s so can you give us sort of an overview of how you view it versus the u s and the eu in terms of a little more details and the mix between private and public insurance edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer sure the similarities are that they actually call some of their government reimbursement medicare they have the same three buckets that we have they have the federal reimbursement they have the medicaid similar type reimbursement and they obviously have the private healthcare insurance reimbursement the coverage provided by the three different buckets are essentially what they are here in the u s about 50 being private insurance and the rest of it being some form of governmental insurance the biggest difference is that they do have a universal coverage as opposed to what we have here in the u s shivani sood deutsche bank analyst thanks and then how do you managed plan to manage or mitigate any sort of foreign exchange risk as it becomes a bigger factor of the exposure edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer so it s upwards of 100 year lease so we re not obviously trying to hedge out even the initial term which is of about 20 years we do expect that to the extent of any debt that we use it will be denominated in the australian dollar shivani sood deutsche bank analyst thanks so much edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from chad vanacore from stifel todd stifel analyst hi good morning this is todd ph in for chad vanacore edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer good morning todd stifel analyst morning so could you help me ph get the size of the market and investment opportunities in australia and new zealand edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer i m sorry would you repeat the question would about the size of the total market todd stifel analyst yeah yeah exactly edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer yes it is substantially larger than the the roughly 900 million that we ve committed to at this particular point multiple speakers and healthscope in particular they ve got about 43 hospitals the transaction that they re doing here is 11 with us and 11 with with another healthcare reit so there are more opportunities there they have more greenfield opportunities with them there and obviously there are other operators so we think that we ve got good opportunity to grow in australia we don t think that we re limited to the roughly 1 billion that we re putting in at this point todd stifel analyst okay so what would be the geographic makeup of your portfolio at the end of 2019 or 2020 edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer well that s a good question it depends on how successful we are in all the various things that we re working on right now i think that we probably will be more heavily weighted in the u s than i had anticipated at the end of the last quarter i d like to see our mix being closer to a 70 30 type range 70 30 65 35 something like that but i think that we probably will be much closer to a 75 25 ratio by the end of the year todd stifel analyst so there is a 350 million development opportunities embedded with this transaction how much would you take on in 2019 and what is the timing of that r steven hamner chief financial officer executive vice president director very little relatively speaking would be in 2019 especially considering that that the earliest the transaction closes at mid year so most of this will be in the early years of the lease but relatively little in 2019 we expect todd stifel analyst okay that s helpful you also mentioned the cap rates and the cost of capital are both lower outside the u s could you comment on spread in this transaction and how does that compare to sort of your us opportunities edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer you know the spreads are very similar to what we are getting in the u s where our spreads range anywhere from our total portfolio from 200 basis points to 350 basis points and we think that we ll continue to get those types of spreads internationally as well as domestically todd stifel analyst and how would the portfolio coverage change with the healthscope transaction edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer how would the portfolio coverage the ebitdarm coverage i don t think it will change it at all i think it will still be in the same range todd stifel analyst okay and you are still expecting a 7 5 average yield for the acquisitions still should we model kind of a higher cap rate for the reminder of the acquisition pipeline this year edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer no i think that s still the right range for on a gaap basis todd stifel analyst okay that s great thank you operator thank you our next question comes from tayo okusanya from jefferies your line is now open tayo okusanya jefferies group analyst hi yes good morning gentlemen edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer good morning tayo tayo okusanya jefferies group analyst congratulations on the transaction edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer thank you very much tayo okusanya jefferies group analyst it s good to see you in another part of the world questions so i know that northwest also kind of did a similar transaction with healthscope 11 properties 1 2 billion as well but i m trying to understand if there are any key differences between your transaction and theirs given that on their deal they re quoting a 5 cap rate edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer tayo i think the transactions are very similar some of the biggest differences i think are our cost of capital is much cheaper than northwest but i obviously haven t seen the documentation for theirs but i would imagine that it was very similar tayo okusanya jefferies group analyst the inaudible it was very similar that means is the cap rates similar then versus your transaction or i mean you guys have kind of talked about a range of that 7 5 to 8 5 on this deal they re kind of quoting 5 so i m just i think the northwest deal is closing quoting 5 multiple speakers r steven hamner chief financial officer executive vice president director to be clear tayo the 7 5 to 8 5 is the blended rate what we said last quarter when we announced the 1 42 to 1 46 that s based on a pipeline that would on the average yield a gaap blended rate of 7 5 to 8 5 so for example if the first deal we did was a 6 5 depending on how big that deal was the next deal maybe a 7 5 or an 8 and be much bigger that would continue then to yield the blended rate of 7 5 to 8 5 tayo okusanya jefferies group analyst okay that s multiple speakers edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer and tayo it s obviously a very important for us in our negotiations with existing and future clients not to give specific about every single transaction because every single transaction is different and you can t just point out one particular part of the transaction and so that s why we re not giving you everyone specifics about the cap rate on this transaction or others tayo okusanya jefferies group analyst that is perfectly fair totally understand that okay so that s number one and then number two could you just inaudible a bit again of why guidance didn t change it sounded like there was a december deal you dropped out of your guidance range and now you maybe brought this transaction into 2019 just inaudible about the puts and the puts the pluses and minuses and then why guidance overall didn t change for 19 despite the higher acquisition outlook edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer well the biggest issue as steve pointed out in his previous wording was that we had a transaction that we thought was going to close at the end the year and be producing income for us for all of 2019 that didn t happen so that was the only negative that we had the other positives that we ve had is that we ve had reductions in cost of capital and a much quicker healthscope transaction than we thought we were going to have and a larger amount of acquisitions than we thought we were going to have in 2018 i mean 19 tayo okusanya jefferies group analyst okay and i know inaudible ok that is helpful and then one more again i know you are very close to being superman but again it s australia germany and alabama how do you kind of plan to manage all these given your current staff edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer well remember tayo that it s all triple net leased properties so we don t have to be there on a daily basis we obviously will be there to review our properties on a regular basis but it s not something we have to be there on a daily basis our team is very well versed in the australian market they are very well versed in healthscope and not just these properties but all of the healthscope properties and we ll get the same type of reporting that we get from our other properties so we have our we now have a staff in luxembourg that s about 15 people and obviously we ve got a much larger staff here in the united states in birmingham and in new york and we have the ability to get there not on a moment s notice it does take a little bit longer but we do plan on being there on a regular basis tayo okusanya jefferies group analyst sounds good there thank you very much edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer thanks tayo operator thank you our next question is going to come from karin ford from mufg securities your line is now open karin ford mufg securities analyst hi good morning edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer hi karin karin ford mufg securities analyst hi can you tell us where you think what rate you think you could raise long term debt today in australia and in the u s and have you issued anything under the atm in january edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer 10 year unsecured bonds in the u s karin probably in the low to mid fives unsecured loans in australia in the low threes karin ford mufg securities analyst got it and should we model in any more atm edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer i m sorry didn t answer that part of it yes that s half of the raise the 200 million raise was in january karin ford mufg securities analyst okay got it next question was just also more for modeling than anything else it looks like the depreciation and amortization add back for ffo purposes was about 6 5 million higher than the expense line i assume that s due to the primonial jv that s now in other income i wanted to see if i could reiterate the request that you guys got last quarter for more jv disclosure just so we can more effectively model out those lines edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer yes you may renew the request and i will commit to next quarter meeting that request karin ford mufg securities analyst okay great and am i correct that the reason for the discrepancies to jv multiple speakers r steven hamner chief financial officer executive vice president director yeah you re correct in your assumption edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer ye karin ford mufg securities analyst okay great and then just last question do you have any update on waterland sale of the operations for median edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer no they haven t announced anything and there s just not enough to report there at this point karin ford mufg securities analyst okay thank you edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer thanks karin operator thank you our next question comes from todd stender from wells fargo your line is now open todd stender wells fargo analyst hi good morning thank you edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer good morning todd todd stender wells fargo analyst i don t know if i missed this how many master leases and i guess that was the wording are the 11 healthscope hospitals spread across edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer three of which the the first and primary master lease has about 80 of the portfolio todd stender wells fargo analyst okay got it and have you guys disclosed the ebitdarm coverage that those are underwritten at edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer i think it s out there and it s about 2 25 times todd stender wells fargo analyst okay with expectations that it rises closer to your portfolio average or generically it s going to be tighter like it is in europe i guess in australia edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer yeah generically it will be tighter it won t get up to the 3 6 times we are now todd stender wells fargo analyst okay thank you and then probably for steve the cash you re holding on the balance sheet if that s from the german post acute care hospitals that you sold into the joint venture if that s held in europe can that be deployed into the australian acquisition i wasn t sure if there was any tax ramifications or repatriating the cash any nuances to that r steven hamner chief financial officer executive vice president director well a portion frankly a minority portion is held in europe most of it s in u s dollars and we have some flexibility the fact is we need the euros there so it s unlikely that we would take euros and convert australian dollars it s just not necessary again keeping in mind that we look upon this entire 2 5 billion 2019 pipeline fungibly todd stender wells fargo analyst so deploying a lot of that cash is fair to say from q4 the q4 balance ok r steven hamner chief financial officer executive vice president director right that plus 200 million in u s dollars raised in the atm todd stender wells fargo analyst in equity ok okay great thank you edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer thanks todd operator thank you and our next question comes from jason idoine from rbc capital markets your line is now open jason idoine rbc capital markets analyst hi thanks yeah i was wondering what the main attributes that you guys look for before you enter into international markets are edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer yeah well the first one is rule of law the second one is their commitment to healthcare and the third one is how the healthcare is funded and historically and how it s done jason idoine rbc capital markets analyst and so with australia you thought that all of those were relatively similar to the u s so it s a natural fit edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer yeah don t necessarily have to be similar to the u s obviously rule of law does they obviously passed that one easily their commitment to healthcare is probably better than what we ve seen here in the u s and we re very comfortable and had been watching australia for over 10 years from a historical and where we think it is going forward jason idoine rbc capital markets analyst okay and in terms of competition for deals could you provide some details on the differences between international and domestic markets edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer internationally we see a lot more sovereign wealth funds and big insurance companies they move very slow we are still much more nimble than they are even at 10 billion in assets but that s primarily what our competition is jason idoine rbc capital markets analyst got you okay thank you very much edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question is going to be from michael mueller from jpmorgan your line is now open michael mueller jpmorgan analyst thanks just a quick one for steve from an accounting standpoint are you straight lining just the 20 year lease the initial term or are you factoring in some option periods as well r steven hamner chief financial officer executive vice president director it s only the initial term michael mueller jpmorgan analyst got it ok that was it thank you r steven hamner chief financial officer executive vice president director thank you edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer thanks mike operator thank you our next question comes from jordan sadler from keybanc capital markets your line is now open jordan sadler keybanc capital markets analyst i just wanted to come back to a question on healthscope did you guys have the opportunity or the interest level to look at the entire property portfolio that ended up getting split up edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer well we certainly had the interest level and continue to think that we ll be able to grow with brookfield in this particular portfolio but the only 50 of it is what we were offered jordan sadler keybanc capital markets analyst okay and did you say that the escalate did you give the number on the escalators is it similar to what was disclosed by the other capital provider edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer yes jordan sadler keybanc capital markets analyst i think it was maybe 2 5 r steven hamner chief financial officer executive vice president director yeah i think inaudible that other press release yes jordan sadler keybanc capital markets analyst okay and i think that was that was all i had for you appreciate it edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer thanks jordan operator thank you i m not showing any further questions i would now like to turn the call over to ed aldag for further remarks edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer thank you very much operator and we appreciate all of your interest today and as always if you have any further questions after the call don t hesitate to give us a call thank you very much duration 40 minutes call participants charles

third quarter of 2018 and probably grew only slightly in the fourth over the year as a whole gdp grew by 1 5 down from 2 2 in 2017 and below the euro zone average see chart 1 new emissions tests slammed the brakes on car production in the summer low water levels in the rhine delayed shipments but even without these temporary disturbances says holger schmieding from berenberg a bank annualised gdp growth would have slowed to below 1 in the second half domestic facing sectors and planned rises in public spending should help germany avoid outright recession but the flip side of exporting success is vulnerability to conditions abroad exports make up half of gdp compared with 12 for america and 30 for britain the risks of increasing protectionism and a hard brexit mean that manufacturers expect another poor year after a robust 2017 net exports detracted from gdp growth in 2018 which probably slightly lowered germany s mammoth current account surplus of 8 of gdp exports

demand seen in the second half of 2018 analysts at deutsche bank think that data for january are consistent with gdp shrinking in the first quarter both the imf and germany s economy ministry have marked down their forecasts for gdp growth this year to 1 1 3 worse is quite possible three of germany s five biggest export markets america china and britain could suffer sharp slowdowns this year trade tensions could heat up if president donald trump acts on his threat to whack tariffs on imports of european cars it could knock 0 2 off german gdp says the institute for economic research a think tank in munich some cooling german officials say is only to be expected in an expansion s tenth year reports of rising capacity utilisation and skills shortages had stoked fears of overheating even though price pressures remain subdued in january jens weidmann the head of the bundesbank said he saw no need for the european central bank to loosen monetary policy philipp steinberg the chief economist at the economy ministry points out that social security spending and income tax relief will support demand tax incentives for research and development have also been agreed on and if recession looms germany has plenty of room for stimulus a fifth consecutive budget surplus last year brought government debt to below 60 of gdp but behind these short term considerations looms a bigger worry that germany could lose its competitive edge despite recent high immigration the imf expects the workforce to start shrinking in 2020 together with lacklustre productivity growth that will limit the economy s potential businesses and economists want to spur investment which has been chronically weak and to upgrade public infrastructure from roads to broadband in an industrial strategy published on february 5th peter altmaier the economy minister warns that germany s economic strengths are not god given and must be earned particularly as china shifts from consumer to competitor proposals include lowering energy prices and supporting industry and increasing investment with tax incentives more controversially mr altmaier wants to loosen antitrust rules and protect national champions from foreign takeovers so that they can compete with chinese behemoths for all that other countries may want to learn from germany its government is looking east

thank all of you for listening in today for 2018 mpt achieved a total shareholder return of more than 25 compared to a negative 4 5 for the msci us reit index our two year total shareholder return was more than 50 compared to the snl u s reit healthcare index of 6 and less than 0 5 for the msci us reit index for the 10 year total shareholder return mpt ranked number 1 for all healthcare reits with a 445 return which was more than 2 5 times that of the snl u s reit healthcare index during 2018 mpt had another year of milestones and records we once again saw the value of our portfolio validated through multiple and exciting transactions including our highly valued joint venture in germany with the primonial group the successful buyout of our equity ownership in earnest health and several other profitable exits such as the sale of north cypress medical center to hca these and other 2018 transactions provided record proceeds of 1 5 billion of which more than 500 million of those proceeds were over and above our original investment the proceeds were used to reduce debt and to put mpt in prime position for accretive capital deployment in 2019 like that of the transaction in australia we just announced we were pleased to kick off 2019 with our announcement last week of our agreement to acquire 11 australian hospitals from healthscope since our inception australia was a location with which we have targeted for growth like other european countries where we have expanded into australia has a healthcare system that is similar to the united states healthcare in australia is among the best in the world and we are delighted to add these quality healthscope assets to our portfolio we ve been watching and analyzing the healthscope assets for more than 10 years now the portfolio of 11 healthscope hospitals are truly some of the finest hospitals in australia of the 11 facilities eight are general acute care hospitals representing 86 of our total investment one is a rehab hospital representing 6 and two are psychiatric facilities representing 7 they are primarily located along the east coast concentrated around sydney and melbourne and in perth on the west coast we work directly with the current management team of healthscope since late summer of 2018 and have been working with brookfield since the early part of the summer we are excited to team up with brookfield on this transaction and look forward to growing this portfolio with them 2018 included continued work on exciting construction developments of over 187 million with surgery partners and circle health the latter providing another milestone as the first of its kind private stand alone inpatient rehabilitation hospital in the united kingdom mpt continues to be the leader in acute care real estate and has amassed approximately 10 billion pro forma gross assets with 30 different operators now spanning three continents our existing portfolio also continued to perform well with this quarter s reporting we added 10 properties to our same store reporting all of the additions to the same store reporting were general acute care hospitals our same store total portfolio ebitdarm coverage for the trailing 12 months q3 2018 is 3 1 times which represents a 10 increase year over year same store acute care ebitdaram coverage is 3 6 times which represents a 12 increase year over year inpatient rehabilitation ebitdarm coverage increased to 1 9 times which represents a 2 5 times 2 5 year over year coverage improvement usrs represent about 4 6 of our total portfolio ltac ebitdarm coverage decreased to 1 5 times which represents a 7 4 year over year decline it s important to note that this coverage decline is driven by one facility whose ebitdarm coverage declined from over 9 times to a still very strong coverage of 5 times ltac represents approximately 3 of our total portfolio united states represents 77 of the total portfolio acute care hospitals continue to make up the bulk of our investments domestically at 80 which is right in line with our target range it is an important reminder that approximately 93 6 of our same store portfolio is master leased cross defaulted or includes a parent guarantee mpt has never been in a stronger position than the present as we continue to grow in size and reputation as the global leader in hospital real estate and the industry s preeminent source of capital we are actively engaged in billions of dollars of domestic and international acquisitions with more opportunities coming our way steve r steven hamner chief financial officer executive vice president director thank you ed on our last quarter s call we reported that we had completed the capital and portfolio repositioning strategy that we had been focused on for more than a year resulting in record profitability liquidity and financial flexibility along with an actionable 2019 acquisition pipeline of 2 0 billion since then our acquisition expectations have grown even further and last week we demonstrated the strength of that pipeline by announcing agreements to acquire and expand 11 premier hospitals in australia for as much as 1 2 billion we ll focus on our outlook for 2019 momentarily but first i ll review the fourth quarter and full year 2018 results as expected this morning we reported normalized ffo of 0 31 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2018 and 1 37 for the year these annual results do not of course include approximately 671 million in gains on the sale of real estate including a 1 4 million fourth quarter true up of the previously completed german joint venture transaction the only material adjustment from nareit ffo to normalized ffo was a fourth quarter 4 4 million tax valuation adjustment caused by the continued profitability of our taxable investments we have previously noted that our estimate provide for general and administrative expenses to be about 9 5 of total revenue however we now report revenue from our joint venture assets through the other income line making prior periods not comparable for 2018 this revenue approximated 32 million moreover non cash straight line rent adjustments during the year reduced revenue by a further 17 5 million and finally in 2018 we adopted new accounting policies that reclassified about 6 2 million to g a with these movements our 2018 g a represents about 8 9 of comparable revenue going forward we remain confident in our estimates of 9 to 9 5 g a before moving on to the update to our 2019 estimates i will point out that in december and january and in anticipation of capital needs for our australian and other likely acquisitions we activated our 750 million at the market equity program and sold approximately 11 9 million shares at an average price of 16 75 for about 200 million in proceeds recently as a result we had cash balances approximating 900 million along with a 1 3 billion availability under our revolving credit facility given our estimate of in place ebitda and outstanding borrowings our current net debt to ebitda ratio approximates 4 4 times this morning we reported that we have increased our 2019 acquisitions expectations by about 500 million to 2 5 billion over our estimate from last quarter consequently we now estimate that upon completion of the 2 5 billion in expected 2019 acquisitions our annualized in place normalized ffo will be about 1 54 per share last quarter our estimate was for approximately 1 50 per share built into last quarter s 1 42 to 1 46 calendar 2019 normalized ffo estimate was an assumption of a late december acquisition that is now not included in our 2019 estimates however due to the growing pipeline we are maintaining our 1 42 to 1 46 calendar 2019 normalized ffo estimate the calendar year estimate is of course sensitive to timing and we intend to periodically update our estimates as we gain clarity into likelihood of closings we continue to estimate that the blended gaap yield of our 2019 acquisitions will fall between 7 5 and 8 5 to be clear that is not a range of targeted deal terms but an average portfolio yield weighted by investment value we also continue to expect that nominal capitalization rates will likely be lower in areas outside the united states where the cost of capital is similarly lower than in the u s the australian opportunity is a good example wherein we invest to achieve yield substantially above our cost of capital and just to clarify this investment will be strongly and immediately accretive for our shareholders importantly certain investments can also deliver intangible value that leads directly to even lower cost of capital and higher long term ffo these intangibles include diversification from geographic tenant and credit perspectives extension of our portfolio average lease terms improvement of mpt s own credit ratings and borrowing cost and attraction of other forms of long term permanent and inexpensive equity like capital the best recent example of this last benefit is the creation of 600 million in virtually free capital through our german joint venture we do not focus solely on the year one cash capitalization rate when we underwrite a potential acquisition we will continue to grow medical properties trust as the unchallenged and sustainable global leader in hospital real estate finance this requires that rather than simply building a collection of stand alone leases we create a portfolio of many assets providing diversity in geographies operators and property types that create predictable inflation protected cash returns for our shareholders along with the initial cap rate and immediate accretion we consider all of these characteristics and their effects on our portfolio taken as a whole the healthscope transaction will in addition to creating a medium and long term accretive returns substantially improve the mpt portfolio considered as a whole and with that we will be happy to take any questions operator questions and answers operator thank you operator s instructions our first question comes from jordan sadler from keybanc capital markets your line is now open jordan sadler keybanc capital markets analyst thank you and thanks for all the color if you guys could a little bit you ve increased the acquisition guidance a little bit seems that healthscope was probably a driver of that as you mentioned is the character of the remaining acquisition pipeline the same as it was last quarter as well or have there been other some puts and takes in terms of what you re focused on edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer well jordan it s probably very similar the only difference that would make is probably more here in the u s than internationally after post the healthscope transaction but it is all general acute care hospitals jordan sadler keybanc capital markets analyst a little bit more active domestically did you say edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer correct jordan sadler keybanc capital markets analyst okay and the size of that aggregate pipeline is still in the 5 billion range would you say edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer that s correct inaudible that healthscope was part of that original 5 billion that we talked about in the last call jordan sadler keybanc capital markets analyst okay and then steve for you on dry powder obviously you ve got quite a bit of liquidity i think you outlined north of 2 billion but as it relates to your debt to ebitda target what do you feel is your dry powder right about now before hitting that target r steven hamner chief financial officer executive vice president director well we re not constrained by a for example a 5 5 times leverage ratio on a temporary basis so i m not quite sure i m am answering your question but we can certainly exceed that because of the alternatives we have with the atm with other equity offerings with joint venture type arrangements so we have upwards of 2 billion available to us that would likely put us at about the 5 5 times range in itself jordan sadler keybanc capital markets analyst okay i guess i the way i was looking at it is and i don t know if you view it similarly but just based on where you stood at the end of the year and where you stand today because you ve obviously been using the atm just how much you could spend before hitting that threshold i think that is still your the upper limit of your threshold i don t know maybe you ve had some temporary flexibility around it but i think you want to target being around there i m just curious how much you would need to how much you could spend before hitting that in your view based on the returns that you achieve on your investment is it probably 1 billion plus or minus r steven hamner chief financial officer executive vice president director it s unlikely that we would get close to that we re not going to run right up to the edge and then began thinking about replenishing equity or other types of non debt capital so it s just not the way we manage the balance sheet or manage the acquisition pipeline edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer you know jordan part of the advantage we have is that all of that acquisitions inaudible going to come in one big chunk so we got the ability to manage the capital needs fairly well jordan sadler keybanc capital markets analyst okay is your last question inaudible the timing what does it look like healthscope plus or minus and the rest of the pipeline how should we be thinking about that timing edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer the brookfield and healthscope people seem pretty confident second quarter and so we are following their their guidance on that the other major opportunities in the pipeline we are on a weighted average expecting some time a little earlier than mid year but those are very often beyond our control and can accelerate or as you well know sometimes go beyond what where we expect it okay thank you guys jordan sadler keybanc capital markets analyst okay thank you guys edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer thanks jordan operator thank you and our next question comes from drew babin from baird your line is now open drew babin baird analyst hey good morning edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer morning drew drew babin baird analyst a question again on sources of capital obviously you hit the atm in the first quarter or toward the end of last year i should say is the steward potential jv the massachusetts portfolio something that could be kind of reignite it potentially now that the properties are all leased or is that then kind of moved on from as a potential source of capital r steven hamner chief financial officer executive vice president director no that is available for the reasons you described drew babin baird analyst and i guess how should we think about the cost of equity on doing something like that relative to where your stock trades right now obviously is one if you had to raise capital today which would you prefer multiple speakers edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer well i think multiple speakers yeah on a strictly cost basis the joint venture with would be less expensive but that s not necessarily the sole or the primary focus drew babin baird analyst okay and one more question on healthscope the development investments that come along with that would the lease terms on those be the same as the acquisition itself or would the yields potentially be higher on the developments edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer no the yields are higher contractually higher drew babin baird analyst okay and one more question just going back to steward i guess how much of the steward portfolio in place right now is in the same store coverage ratios that you report and i guess if you can give us an update on kind of where steward stands as a whole and or just by market as it stands right now edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer yeah drew i don t have that first to answer right off the top of my head but from and how is steward doing it s doing exceptionally well their coverage is over 2 times drew babin baird analyst okay so is any of it in the same store numbers that are in the supplemental r steven hamner chief financial officer executive vice president director yes there are a total of 13 hospitals that are in the same store drew babin baird analyst okay that s helpful thank you very much that s it for me operator thank you and our next question comes from michael lewis from suntrust your line is now open michael lewis suntrust analyst thank you your stock price is obviously now higher than when you tapped the atm somebody once said to me you shoot the bear when the bear is there i m curious if you have thoughts of kind of you don t need to but you could over equitize the deal and if you have any specific kind of funding assumptions in your guidance that you could share in terms of equity edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer no the only guidance is again we intend to maintain in the model it s constrained by the 5 5 times leverage and depending on timing on pricing on the overall pipeline because we do look at the 2 5 billion fungibly then that leverage could be lower than that michael lewis suntrust analyst okay in terms of the 350 million of potential redevelopment or expansion opportunities what will determine if those come to fruition or not do you expect all of that to come to fruition and it sounds like you re not giving specific returns but is it something well maybe you won t answer is it 6 plus returns you expect on this edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer most of that development i think will come to fruition the question is more of a timing standpoint when all the approvals happen and i think that if you look at the where we think the yields will be on that is it will be higher than the 6 range michael lewis suntrust analyst okay great thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from derek johnston of deutsche bank your line is now open shivani sood deutsche bank analyst hi this is shivani sood on for derek johnson you guys mentioned that the australian healthcare system has similarities with the u s so can you give us sort of an overview of how you view it versus the u s and the eu in terms of a little more details and the mix between private and public insurance edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer sure the similarities are that they actually call some of their government reimbursement medicare they have the same three buckets that we have they have the federal reimbursement they have the medicaid similar type reimbursement and they obviously have the private healthcare insurance reimbursement the coverage provided by the three different buckets are essentially what they are here in the u s about 50 being private insurance and the rest of it being some form of governmental insurance the biggest difference is that they do have a universal coverage as opposed to what we have here in the u s shivani sood deutsche bank analyst thanks and then how do you managed plan to manage or mitigate any sort of foreign exchange risk as it becomes a bigger factor of the exposure edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer so it s upwards of 100 year lease so we re not obviously trying to hedge out even the initial term which is of about 20 years we do expect that to the extent of any debt that we use it will be denominated in the australian dollar shivani sood deutsche bank analyst thanks so much edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from chad vanacore from stifel todd stifel analyst hi good morning this is todd ph in for chad vanacore edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer good morning todd stifel analyst morning so could you help me ph get the size of the market and investment opportunities in australia and new zealand edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer i m sorry would you repeat the question would about the size of the total market todd stifel analyst yeah yeah exactly edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer yes it is substantially larger than the the roughly 900 million that we ve committed to at this particular point multiple speakers and healthscope in particular they ve got about 43 hospitals the transaction that they re doing here is 11 with us and 11 with with another healthcare reit so there are more opportunities there they have more greenfield opportunities with them there and obviously there are other operators so we think that we ve got good opportunity to grow in australia we don t think that we re limited to the roughly 1 billion that we re putting in at this point todd stifel analyst okay so what would be the geographic makeup of your portfolio at the end of 2019 or 2020 edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer well that s a good question it depends on how successful we are in all the various things that we re working on right now i think that we probably will be more heavily weighted in the u s than i had anticipated at the end of the last quarter i d like to see our mix being closer to a 70 30 type range 70 30 65 35 something like that but i think that we probably will be much closer to a 75 25 ratio by the end of the year todd stifel analyst so there is a 350 million development opportunities embedded with this transaction how much would you take on in 2019 and what is the timing of that r steven hamner chief financial officer executive vice president director very little relatively speaking would be in 2019 especially considering that that the earliest the transaction closes at mid year so most of this will be in the early years of the lease but relatively little in 2019 we expect todd stifel analyst okay that s helpful you also mentioned the cap rates and the cost of capital are both lower outside the u s could you comment on spread in this transaction and how does that compare to sort of your us opportunities edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer you know the spreads are very similar to what we are getting in the u s where our spreads range anywhere from our total portfolio from 200 basis points to 350 basis points and we think that we ll continue to get those types of spreads internationally as well as domestically todd stifel analyst and how would the portfolio coverage change with the healthscope transaction edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer how would the portfolio coverage the ebitdarm coverage i don t think it will change it at all i think it will still be in the same range todd stifel analyst okay and you are still expecting a 7 5 average yield for the acquisitions still should we model kind of a higher cap rate for the reminder of the acquisition pipeline this year edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer no i think that s still the right range for on a gaap basis todd stifel analyst okay that s great thank you operator thank you our next question comes from tayo okusanya from jefferies your line is now open tayo okusanya jefferies group analyst hi yes good morning gentlemen edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer good morning tayo tayo okusanya jefferies group analyst congratulations on the transaction edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer thank you very much tayo okusanya jefferies group analyst it s good to see you in another part of the world questions so i know that northwest also kind of did a similar transaction with healthscope 11 properties 1 2 billion as well but i m trying to understand if there are any key differences between your transaction and theirs given that on their deal they re quoting a 5 cap rate edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer tayo i think the transactions are very similar some of the biggest differences i think are our cost of capital is much cheaper than northwest but i obviously haven t seen the documentation for theirs but i would imagine that it was very similar tayo okusanya jefferies group analyst the inaudible it was very similar that means is the cap rates similar then versus your transaction or i mean you guys have kind of talked about a range of that 7 5 to 8 5 on this deal they re kind of quoting 5 so i m just i think the northwest deal is closing quoting 5 multiple speakers r steven hamner chief financial officer executive vice president director to be clear tayo the 7 5 to 8 5 is the blended rate what we said last quarter when we announced the 1 42 to 1 46 that s based on a pipeline that would on the average yield a gaap blended rate of 7 5 to 8 5 so for example if the first deal we did was a 6 5 depending on how big that deal was the next deal maybe a 7 5 or an 8 and be much bigger that would continue then to yield the blended rate of 7 5 to 8 5 tayo okusanya jefferies group analyst okay that s multiple speakers edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer and tayo it s obviously a very important for us in our negotiations with existing and future clients not to give specific about every single transaction because every single transaction is different and you can t just point out one particular part of the transaction and so that s why we re not giving you everyone specifics about the cap rate on this transaction or others tayo okusanya jefferies group analyst that is perfectly fair totally understand that okay so that s number one and then number two could you just inaudible a bit again of why guidance didn t change it sounded like there was a december deal you dropped out of your guidance range and now you maybe brought this transaction into 2019 just inaudible about the puts and the puts the pluses and minuses and then why guidance overall didn t change for 19 despite the higher acquisition outlook edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer well the biggest issue as steve pointed out in his previous wording was that we had a transaction that we thought was going to close at the end the year and be producing income for us for all of 2019 that didn t happen so that was the only negative that we had the other positives that we ve had is that we ve had reductions in cost of capital and a much quicker healthscope transaction than we thought we were going to have and a larger amount of acquisitions than we thought we were going to have in 2018 i mean 19 tayo okusanya jefferies group analyst okay and i know inaudible ok that is helpful and then one more again i know you are very close to being superman but again it s australia germany and alabama how do you kind of plan to manage all these given your current staff edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer well remember tayo that it s all triple net leased properties so we don t have to be there on a daily basis we obviously will be there to review our properties on a regular basis but it s not something we have to be there on a daily basis our team is very well versed in the australian market they are very well versed in healthscope and not just these properties but all of the healthscope properties and we ll get the same type of reporting that we get from our other properties so we have our we now have a staff in luxembourg that s about 15 people and obviously we ve got a much larger staff here in the united states in birmingham and in new york and we have the ability to get there not on a moment s notice it does take a little bit longer but we do plan on being there on a regular basis tayo okusanya jefferies group analyst sounds good there thank you very much edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer thanks tayo operator thank you our next question is going to come from karin ford from mufg securities your line is now open karin ford mufg securities analyst hi good morning edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer hi karin karin ford mufg securities analyst hi can you tell us where you think what rate you think you could raise long term debt today in australia and in the u s and have you issued anything under the atm in january edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer 10 year unsecured bonds in the u s karin probably in the low to mid fives unsecured loans in australia in the low threes karin ford mufg securities analyst got it and should we model in any more atm edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer i m sorry didn t answer that part of it yes that s half of the raise the 200 million raise was in january karin ford mufg securities analyst okay got it next question was just also more for modeling than anything else it looks like the depreciation and amortization add back for ffo purposes was about 6 5 million higher than the expense line i assume that s due to the primonial jv that s now in other income i wanted to see if i could reiterate the request that you guys got last quarter for more jv disclosure just so we can more effectively model out those lines edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer yes you may renew the request and i will commit to next quarter meeting that request karin ford mufg securities analyst okay great and am i correct that the reason for the discrepancies to jv multiple speakers r steven hamner chief financial officer executive vice president director yeah you re correct in your assumption edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer ye karin ford mufg securities analyst okay great and then just last question do you have any update on waterland sale of the operations for median edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer no they haven t announced anything and there s just not enough to report there at this point karin ford mufg securities analyst okay thank you edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer thanks karin operator thank you our next question comes from todd stender from wells fargo your line is now open todd stender wells fargo analyst hi good morning thank you edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer good morning todd todd stender wells fargo analyst i don t know if i missed this how many master leases and i guess that was the wording are the 11 healthscope hospitals spread across edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer three of which the the first and primary master lease has about 80 of the portfolio todd stender wells fargo analyst okay got it and have you guys disclosed the ebitdarm coverage that those are underwritten at edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer i think it s out there and it s about 2 25 times todd stender wells fargo analyst okay with expectations that it rises closer to your portfolio average or generically it s going to be tighter like it is in europe i guess in australia edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer yeah generically it will be tighter it won t get up to the 3 6 times we are now todd stender wells fargo analyst okay thank you and then probably for steve the cash you re holding on the balance sheet if that s from the german post acute care hospitals that you sold into the joint venture if that s held in europe can that be deployed into the australian acquisition i wasn t sure if there was any tax ramifications or repatriating the cash any nuances to that r steven hamner chief financial officer executive vice president director well a portion frankly a minority portion is held in europe most of it s in u s dollars and we have some flexibility the fact is we need the euros there so it s unlikely that we would take euros and convert australian dollars it s just not necessary again keeping in mind that we look upon this entire 2 5 billion 2019 pipeline fungibly todd stender wells fargo analyst so deploying a lot of that cash is fair to say from q4 the q4 balance ok r steven hamner chief financial officer executive vice president director right that plus 200 million in u s dollars raised in the atm todd stender wells fargo analyst in equity ok okay great thank you edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer thanks todd operator thank you and our next question comes from jason idoine from rbc capital markets your line is now open jason idoine rbc capital markets analyst hi thanks yeah i was wondering what the main attributes that you guys look for before you enter into international markets are edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer yeah well the first one is rule of law the second one is their commitment to healthcare and the third one is how the healthcare is funded and historically and how it s done jason idoine rbc capital markets analyst and so with australia you thought that all of those were relatively similar to the u s so it s a natural fit edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer yeah don t necessarily have to be similar to the u s obviously rule of law does they obviously passed that one easily their commitment to healthcare is probably better than what we ve seen here in the u s and we re very comfortable and had been watching australia for over 10 years from a historical and where we think it is going forward jason idoine rbc capital markets analyst okay and in terms of competition for deals could you provide some details on the differences between international and domestic markets edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer internationally we see a lot more sovereign wealth funds and big insurance companies they move very slow we are still much more nimble than they are even at 10 billion in assets but that s primarily what our competition is jason idoine rbc capital markets analyst got you okay thank you very much edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question is going to be from michael mueller from jpmorgan your line is now open michael mueller jpmorgan analyst thanks just a quick one for steve from an accounting standpoint are you straight lining just the 20 year lease the initial term or are you factoring in some option periods as well r steven hamner chief financial officer executive vice president director it s only the initial term michael mueller jpmorgan analyst got it ok that was it thank you r steven hamner chief financial officer executive vice president director thank you edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer thanks mike operator thank you our next question comes from jordan sadler from keybanc capital markets your line is now open jordan sadler keybanc capital markets analyst i just wanted to come back to a question on healthscope did you guys have the opportunity or the interest level to look at the entire property portfolio that ended up getting split up edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer well we certainly had the interest level and continue to think that we ll be able to grow with brookfield in this particular portfolio but the only 50 of it is what we were offered jordan sadler keybanc capital markets analyst okay and did you say that the escalate did you give the number on the escalators is it similar to what was disclosed by the other capital provider edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer yes jordan sadler keybanc capital markets analyst i think it was maybe 2 5 r steven hamner chief financial officer executive vice president director yeah i think inaudible that other press release yes jordan sadler keybanc capital markets analyst okay and i think that was that was all i had for you appreciate it edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer thanks jordan operator thank you i m not showing any further questions i would now like to turn the call over to ed aldag for further remarks edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer thank you very much operator and we

reserve advisory the recovery and reserve estimates of crude oil reserves provided in this news release are estimates only and there is no guarantee that the estimated reserves will be recovered actual crude oil reserves may eventually prove to be greater than or less than the estimates provided herein all december 31 2018 reserves presented are based on glj s forecast pricing effective

effective january 1 2017 it should not be assumed that the estimates of future net revenues presented herein represent the fair market value of the reserves there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil reserves and the future cash flows attributed to such reserves proved developed producing reserves are those reserves that are expected to be recovered from completion intervals open at the time of the estimate these reserves may be currently producing or if shut in they must have previously been on production and the date of resumption of production must be known with reasonable certainty proved developed non producing reserves are those reserves that either have not been on production or have previously been on production but are shut in and the date of resumption of production is unknown proved undeveloped reserves are those reserves expected to be recovered from known accumulations where a significant expenditure e g when compared to the cost of drilling a well is required to render them capable of production they must fully meet the requirements of the reserves category proved probable possible to which they are assigned proved reserves are those reserves that can be estimated with a high degree of certainty to be recoverable it is likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the estimated proved reserves probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves it is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the sum of the estimated proved plus probable reserves possible reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves there is a 10 percent probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the sum of proved plus probable plus possible reserves it is unlikely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the sum of the estimated proved plus probable plus possible reserves the term boe means a barrel of oil equivalent on the basis of 6 mcf of natural gas to 1 barrel of oil bbl boe s may be misleading particularly if used in isolation a boe conversation ratio of 6 mcf 1 bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead given the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6 1 utilizing a conversion ratio at 6 1 may be misleading as an indication of value light crude oil is crude oil with a relative density greater than 31 1 degrees api gravity medium crude oil is crude oil with a relative density greater than 22

ottawa the effects of u s trade unknowns lower oil prices and weaker housing and consumer spending are behind the recent deceleration in economic growth a bank of canada deputy governor said in a speech wednesday ottawa the effects of u s trade unknowns lower oil prices and weaker housing and consumer spending are behind the recent deceleration in economic growth a bank of canada deputy governor said in a speech wednesday to help the economy get through this temporary soft patch timothy lane is expecting the lower canadian dollar to provide support lane told a washington audience that the loonie has been influenced by these factors as well as the indirect effects related to fiscal stimulus that has energized the american economy the results have led the u s federal reserve to raise interest rates he added this combination of factors has been putting downward pressure on the canadian dollar lane said in his address to the peterson institute for international economics the lower canadian dollar in turn will help support the economy through this period last month bank of canada governor stephen poloz kept his benchmark interest rate unchanged at 1 75 per cent as the economy navigates what he described as a temporary period of softness created by a recent sharp decline in world oil prices poloz said the central bank will continue raising rates once canada the economy builds new momentum a stronger economy has prompted him to hike the rate target five times since mid 2017 to keep inflation from running too hot on wednesday lane also said uncertainty related to u s trade policies has kept business investment lower than where it should be at this point given the overall strength in the canadian economy lane s speech focused on explaining how canada manages its foreign reserves which he noted are about us 85 billion or five per cent of the country s gross domestic product he described the size of canada s foreign reserves as modest yet adequate because the country has a freely floating exchange rate lane noted that other central banks and monetary authorities have started adding canadian dollar assets to their reserve portfolios following the global financial crisis about a decade ago reserves in canadian dollars are now about 200 billion he said the move to hold a portion of reserves in canadian dollars is part of a broader strategy of reserve diversification he said it is also in some sense a vote of confidence in canada reserve managers tell us they are attracted by canada s sound financial system and fiscal position as reflected in its high credit ratings
pittsburgh feb 7 2019 prnewswire cnx resources corporation nyse cnx cnx or the company announced today total proved reserves of 7 9 tcfe as of december 31 2018 which is a 4 increase compared to the previous year despite selling approximately 825 bcfe in proved reserves in the year through the divestiture of the company s shallow oil and gas and ohio utica joint venture assets pro forma for asset divestitures in 2018 reserves grew 15 compared to the previous year during 2018 cnx added 960 bcfe of proved reserves through extensions and discoveries which resulted in the company replacing 189 of its 2018 net production of 507 bcfe in 2018 drilling and completion costs incurred directly attributable to extensions and discoveries were 490 million when divided by the extensions and discoveries of 960 bcfe this yields a drill bit f d cost of 0 51 per mcfe future development costs for proved undeveloped reserves puds are estimated to be approximately 1 434 billion or 0 42 per mcfe the

netherland sewell associates inc during the year total net revisions were positive 349 bcfe the revisions included 151 bcfe of reductions primarily due to less planned development in the company s virginia coal bed methane cbm field 28 bcfe positive pricing revision from increased natural gas prices compared to year end 2017 and 472 bcfe positive revisions due to improved well performance in both proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves sales of reserves in place totaled 825 bcfe and were partially offset by 322 bcfe of additions resulting from miscellaneous leasehold acquisitions proved developed reserves of 4 494 bcfe in 2018 comprised 57 of total proved reserves compared to 58 in 2017 puds were 3 386 bcfe at december 31 2018 or 43 of total proved reserves compared to 42 at year end 2017 puds at year end 2018 represent 34 of the total wells the company expects to drill over the next five years the low pud to five year plan percentage implies meaningful future upside in both the marcellus and utica shales in pennsylvania and west virginia during 2018 in the marcellus shale cnx turned in line til 46 gross wells with an average completed lateral length of approximately 8 300 feet and expected ultimate recoveries eurs ranging between 1 7 and 3 5 bcfe per thousand feet of completed lateral production and completion optimization initiatives continued to drive performance increases in the marcellus shale throughout the year these performance increases have allowed the company to book marcellus shale puds with average eurs of over 2 4 bcfe per thousand feet of completed lateral compared to 2 3 bcfe per thousand feet booked during the previous year cnx will continue to explore optimization possibilities with an ongoing review of development processes and employ new technology that could provide eur uplift relative to current estimates as of december 31 2018 the marcellus shale proved reserves were 5 595 bcfe which included 3 030 bcfe of proved developed reserves during 2018 in the utica shale cnx til 17 gross wells with an average completed lateral length of approximately 8 200 feet and eurs averaging over 2 5 bcfe per thousand feet of completed lateral in 2018 the company s type curves that were applied to puds increased from the previous year due to production and completion optimization initiatives along with performance repeatability which allowed the company to book utica shale puds with eurs averaging over 3 2 bcfe per thousand feet of completed lateral compared to 2 6 bcfe per thousand feet of completed lateral during the previous year in 2018 cnx booked 1 068 bcfe of utica shale proved reserves after accounting for the reduction of 342 bcfe due to the sale of ohio utica joint venture reserves in place the company was able to modestly increase total reserves year over year despite the asset divestiture due to continued drilling success in the deep dry utica shale in pennsylvania as of december 31 2018 cnx has total proved probable and possible reserves also known as 3p reserves of 12 8 tcfe which are comprised only of reserves expected to be developed in the company s five year plan there are an additional 111 tcfe of recoverable resources in the other resource potential that the company expects to develop beyond the five year plan the company continues drilling and completing marcellus wells

the financial accounting standards board s accounting standards update no 2010 03 extractive activities oil and gas topic 932 this topic requires the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows to be based on the average first day of the month price for the year ended december 31 2018 because prices used in the calculation are average prices for that year the standardized measure could vary significantly from year to year based on the market conditions that occurred the projections should not be viewed as realistic estimates of future cash flows nor should the standardized measure be interpreted as representing current value to cnx material revisions to estimates of proved reserves may occur in the future development and production of the reserves may not occur in the periods assumed actual prices realized are expected to vary significantly from those used and actual costs may vary cnx s investment and operating decisions are not based on the information presented but on a wide range of reserve estimates that include probable as well as proved reserves and on different price and cost assumptions the standardized measure is intended to provide a better means for

to be paid the use of a pre tax measure is valuable when comparing companies based on reserves pv 10 is not a measure of the financial or operating performance under gaap pv 10 should not be

current expectations and assumptions about future events while our management considers these expectations and assumptions to be reasonable they are inherently subject to significant business economic competitive regulatory and other risks contingencies and uncertainties most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control these risks contingencies and uncertainties relate to among other matters the following prices for natural gas and natural gas liquids are volatile and can fluctuate widely based upon a number of factors beyond our control including oversupply relative to the demand for our products weather and the price and availability of alternative fuels an extended decline in the prices we receive for our natural gas and natural gas liquids affecting our operating results and cash flows our dependence on gathering processing and transportation facilities and other midstream facilities owned by cnxm and others disruption of capacity constraints in or proximity to pipeline systems that could limit sales of our natural gas and natural gas liquids and decreases in availability of third party pipelines or other midstream facilities interconnected to cnxm s gathering systems uncertainties in estimating our economically recoverable natural gas reserves and inaccuracies in our estimates the high risk nature of drilling natural gas wells our identified drilling locations are scheduled out over multiple years making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling challenges associated with strategic determinations including the allocation of capital and other resources to strategic opportunities our development and exploration projects as well as cnxm s midstream system development require substantial capital expenditures the impact of potential as well as any adopted environmental regulations including any relating to greenhouse gas emissions on our operating costs

per unit in 2017 company ffo was 416 million 0 43 per unit for the quarter ended december 31 2018 compared with 286 million 0 41 per unit for the same period in 2017 company ffo was 1 18 billion 1 48 per unit for the year ended december 31 2018 compared with 1 02 billion 1 44 per unit in 2017 the increases in company ffo for the quarter and year are primarily attributable to our increased investment in core retail and its seasonally strong performance in the fourth quarter along with same property income growth in the core office business this strong operating performance more than offset the impact of a higher interest rate environment and the negative impact of converting foreign currency into u s dollars operating highlights our core office operations generated company ffo of 170 million for the quarter ended december 31 2018 compared to 148 million in the same period in 2017 and 608 million for the year ended december 31 2018 compared to 532 million on a comparable basis in 2017 the increases over the prior year reporting periods are primarily attributable to same property growth offset in part by the negative impact of converting foreign currency into u s dollars and the reallocation of capital from asset sales to our other businesses occupancy in our core office portfolio increased 60 basis points during the fourth quarter to 93 5 on 3 3 million square feet of total leasing leases signed in the fourth quarter were at average rents 8 higher than leases that expired in the period total leasing for the year was 7 8 million square feet and occupancy increased 90 basis points during the year our core retail operations generated company ffo of 270 million for the quarter ended december 31 2018 compared to 158 million in the comparable period in 2017 and 651 million for the year ended december 31 2018 compared to 515 million in 2017 the increases in company ffo over the prior quarter and year periods are primarily attributable to the acquisition of ggp in august 2018 core same property retail occupancy finished the year at 96 5 on 9 6 million square feet of total leasing with average initial suite to suite rent spreads of 11 on an noi weighted basis noi weighted tenant sales per square foot increased 6 in 2018 to 746 our lp investments generated company ffo of 77 million for the quarter ended december 31 2018 compared to 89 million in the comparable period in 2017 and 330 million for the year ended december 31 2018 compared to 335 million in 2017 the decrease in company ffo over the prior reporting periods was largely a result of the sale of stabilized investments in this segment where proceeds were reinvested but are not yet yielding comparable income this was offset in part by strong same property growth in existing investments

of the partnership are set forth in regulatory filings a copy of the filings may be obtained through the website of the sec at www sec gov and on the partnership s sedar profile at www sedar com the partnership s quarterly letter to unitholders and supplemental information package can be accessed before the market open on february 7 2019 at bpy brookfield com this additional information should be read in conjunction with this press release basis of presentation this press release and accompanying financial information make reference to net operating income noi same property noi funds from operations ffo company ffo company ffo and net income attributable to unitholders company ffo and net income attributable to unitholders are also presented on a per unit basis noi same property noi ffo company ffo and net income attributable to unitholders do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by international financial reporting standards ifrs and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies the partnership uses noi same property noi ffo company ffo and net income attributable to unitholders to assess its operating results these measures should not be used as alternatives to net income and other operating measures determined in accordance with ifrs but rather to provide supplemental insights into performance further these measures do not represent liquidity measures or cash flow from operations and are not intended to be representative of the funds available for distribution to unitholders either in aggregate or on a per unit basis where presented noi is defined as revenues from commercial and hospitality operations of consolidated properties less direct commercial property and hospitality expenses as noi includes the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and operating commercial property and hospitality assets it provides a measure to evaluate the performance of the property operations same property noi is a subset of noi which excludes noi that is earned from assets acquired disposed of or developed during the periods presented or not of a recurring nature and from opportunistic assets same property noi allows the partnership to segregate the performance of leasing and operating initiatives on the portfolio from the impact to performance from investing activities and one time items which for the historical periods presented consist primarily of lease termination income ffo is defined as income including equity accounted income before realized gains losses from the sale of investment property except gains losses related to properties developed for sale fair value gains losses including equity accounted fair value gains losses depreciation and amortization of real estate assets income tax expense benefit and less non controlling interests of others in operating subsidiaries and properties ffo is a widely recognized measure that is frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of real estate entities particularly those that own and operate income producing properties the partnership s definition of ffo includes all of the adjustments that are outlined in the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition of ffo in addition to the adjustments prescribed by nareit the partnership also makes adjustments to exclude any unrealized fair value gains or losses that arise as a result of reporting under ifrs and income taxes that arise as certain of its subsidiaries are structured as corporations as opposed to real estate investment trusts reits these additional adjustments result in an ffo measure that is similar to that which would result if the partnership was organized as a reit that determined net income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states u s gaap which is the type of organization on which the nareit definition is premised the partnership s ffo measure will differ from other organizations applying the nareit definition to the extent of certain differences between the ifrs and u s gaap reporting frameworks principally related to the recognition of lease termination income ffo provides a performance measure that when compared year over year reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates rental rates operating costs and interest costs company ffo is defined as ffo before the impact of depreciation and amortization of non real estate assets transaction costs gains losses associated with non investment properties imputed interest and the ffo that would have been attributable to unitholders shares of ggp inc ggp if all outstanding warrants of ggp were exercised prior to the third quarter of 2017 the adjustment assumed net settlement of the outstanding warrants for the third quarter 2017 the adjustment is based on the cash settlement for all applicable warrants to reflect the partnership s stated plans for settling the warrants on such a basis the warrants were exercised in the fourth quarter of 2017 company ffo similar to ffo discussed above provides a performance measure that reflects the impact on operations of trends in occupancy rates rental rates operating costs and interest costs in addition the adjustments to company ffo relative to ffo allow the partnership insight into these trends for the real estate operations by adjusting for non real estate components net income attributable to unitholders is defined as net income attributable to holders of general partnership units and limited partnership units of the partnership redeemable exchangeable and special limited partnership units of brookfield property l p and limited partnership units of brookfield office properties exchange lp net income attributable to unitholders is used by the partnership to evaluate the performance of the partnership as a whole as each of the unitholders participates in the economics of the partnership equally in calculating net income attributable to unitholders per unit the partnership excludes the impact of mandatorily convertible preferred units in determining the average number of units outstanding as the holders of mandatorily convertible preferred units do not participate in current earnings the partnership reconciles this measure to basic net income attributable to unitholders per unit determined in accordance with ifrs which includes the effect of mandatorily convertible preferred units in the basic average number of units outstanding about brookfield property partners brookfield property partners through brookfield property partners l p and its subsidiary brookfield property reit inc is one of

a 445 return which was more than 2 5 times that of the snl u s reit healthcare index during 2018 mpt had another year of milestones and records we once again saw the value of our portfolio validated through multiple and exciting transactions including our highly valued joint venture in germany with the primonial group the successful buyout of our equity ownership in earnest health and several other profitable exits such as the sale of north cypress medical center to hca these and other 2018 transactions provided record proceeds of 1 5 billion of which more than 500 million of those proceeds were over and above our original investment the proceeds were used to reduce debt and to put mpt in prime position for accretive capital deployment in 2019 like that of the transaction in australia we just announced we were pleased to kick off 2019 with our announcement last week of our agreement to acquire 11 australian hospitals from healthscope since our inception australia was a location with which we have targeted for growth like other european countries where we have expanded into australia has a healthcare system that is similar to the united states healthcare in australia is among the best in the world and we are delighted to add these quality healthscope assets to our portfolio we ve been watching and analyzing the healthscope assets for more than 10 years now the portfolio of 11 healthscope hospitals are truly some of the finest hospitals in australia of the 11 facilities eight are general acute care hospitals representing 86 of our total investment one is a rehab hospital representing 6 and two are psychiatric facilities representing 7 they are primarily located along the east coast concentrated around sydney and melbourne and in perth on the west coast we work directly with the current management team of healthscope since late summer of 2018 and have been working with brookfield since the early part of the summer we are excited to team up with brookfield on this transaction and look forward to growing this portfolio with them 2018 included continued work on exciting construction developments of over 187 million with surgery partners and circle health the latter providing another milestone as the first of its kind private stand alone inpatient rehabilitation hospital in the united kingdom mpt continues to be the leader in acute care real estate and has amassed approximately 10 billion pro forma gross assets with 30 different operators now spanning three continents our existing portfolio also continued to perform well with this quarter s reporting we added 10 properties to our same store reporting all of the additions to the same store reporting were general acute care hospitals our same store total portfolio ebitdarm coverage for the trailing 12 months q3 2018 is 3 1 times which represents a 10 increase year over year same store acute care ebitdaram coverage is 3 6 times which represents a 12 increase year over year inpatient rehabilitation ebitdarm coverage increased to 1 9 times which represents a 2 5 times 2 5 year over year coverage improvement usrs represent about 4 6 of our total portfolio ltac ebitdarm coverage decreased to 1 5 times which represents a 7 4 year over year decline it s important to note that this coverage decline is driven by one facility whose ebitdarm coverage declined from over 9 times to a still very strong coverage of 5 times ltac represents approximately 3 of our total portfolio united states represents 77 of the total portfolio acute care hospitals continue to make up the bulk of our investments domestically at 80 which is right in line with our target range it is an important reminder that approximately 93 6 of our same store portfolio is master leased cross defaulted or includes a parent guarantee mpt has never been in a stronger position than the present as we continue to grow in size and reputation as the global leader in hospital real estate and the industry s preeminent source of capital we are actively engaged in billions of dollars of domestic and international acquisitions with more opportunities coming our way steve r steven hamner chief financial officer executive vice president director thank you ed on our last quarter s call we reported that we had completed the capital and portfolio repositioning strategy that we had been focused on for more than a year resulting in record profitability liquidity and financial flexibility along with an actionable 2019 acquisition pipeline of 2 0 billion since then our acquisition expectations have grown even further and last week we demonstrated the strength of that pipeline by announcing agreements to acquire and expand 11 premier hospitals in australia for as much as 1 2 billion we ll focus on our outlook for 2019 momentarily but first i ll review the fourth quarter and full year 2018 results as expected this morning we reported normalized ffo of 0 31 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2018 and 1 37 for the year these annual results do not of course include approximately 671 million in gains on the sale of real estate including a 1 4 million fourth quarter true up of the previously completed german joint venture transaction the only material adjustment from nareit ffo to normalized ffo was a fourth quarter 4 4 million tax valuation adjustment caused by the continued profitability of our taxable investments we have previously noted that our estimate provide for general and administrative expenses to be about 9 5 of total revenue however we now report revenue from our joint venture assets through the other income line making prior periods not comparable for 2018 this revenue approximated 32 million moreover non cash straight line rent adjustments during the year reduced revenue by a further 17 5 million and finally in 2018 we adopted new accounting policies that reclassified about 6 2 million to g a with these movements our 2018 g a represents about 8 9 of comparable revenue going forward we remain confident in our estimates of 9 to 9 5 g a before moving on to the update to our 2019 estimates i will point out that in december and january and in anticipation of capital needs for our australian and other likely acquisitions we activated our 750 million at the market equity program and sold approximately 11 9 million shares at an average price of 16 75 for about 200 million in proceeds recently as a result we had cash balances approximating 900 million along with a 1 3 billion availability under our revolving credit facility given our estimate of in place ebitda and outstanding borrowings our current net debt to ebitda ratio approximates 4 4 times this morning we reported that we have increased our 2019 acquisitions expectations by about 500 million to 2 5 billion over our estimate from last quarter consequently we now estimate that upon completion of the 2 5 billion in expected 2019 acquisitions our annualized in place normalized ffo will be about 1 54 per share last quarter our estimate was for approximately 1 50 per share built into last quarter s 1 42 to 1 46 calendar 2019 normalized ffo estimate was an assumption of a late december acquisition that is now not included in our 2019 estimates however due to the growing pipeline we are maintaining our 1 42 to 1 46 calendar 2019 normalized ffo estimate the calendar year estimate is of course sensitive to timing and we intend to periodically update our estimates as we gain clarity into likelihood of closings we continue to estimate that the blended gaap yield of our 2019 acquisitions will fall between 7 5 and 8 5 to be clear that is not a range of targeted deal terms but an average portfolio yield weighted by investment value we also continue to expect that nominal capitalization rates will likely be lower in areas outside the united states where the cost of capital is similarly lower than in the u s the australian opportunity is a good example wherein we invest to achieve yield substantially above our cost of capital and just to clarify this investment will be strongly and immediately accretive for our shareholders importantly certain investments can also deliver intangible value that leads directly to even lower cost of capital and higher long term ffo these intangibles include diversification from geographic tenant and credit perspectives extension of our portfolio average lease terms improvement of mpt s own credit ratings and borrowing cost and attraction of other forms of long term permanent and inexpensive equity like capital the best recent example of this last benefit is the creation of 600 million in virtually free capital through our german joint venture we do not focus solely on the year one cash capitalization rate when we underwrite a potential acquisition we will continue to grow medical properties trust as the unchallenged and sustainable global leader in hospital real estate finance this requires that rather than simply building a collection of stand alone leases we create a portfolio of many assets providing diversity in geographies operators and property types that create predictable inflation protected cash returns for our shareholders along with the initial cap rate and immediate accretion we consider all of these characteristics and their effects on our portfolio taken as a whole the healthscope transaction will in addition to creating a medium and long term accretive returns substantially improve the mpt portfolio considered as a whole and with that we will be happy to take any questions operator questions and answers operator thank you operator s instructions our first question comes from jordan sadler from keybanc capital markets your line is now open jordan sadler keybanc capital markets analyst thank you and thanks for all the color if you guys could a little bit you ve increased the acquisition guidance a little bit seems that healthscope was probably a driver of that as you mentioned is the character of the remaining acquisition pipeline the same as it was last quarter as well or have there been other some puts and takes in terms of what you re focused on edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer well jordan it s probably very similar the only difference that would make is probably more here in the u s than internationally after post the healthscope transaction but it is all general acute care hospitals jordan sadler keybanc capital markets analyst a little bit more active domestically did you say edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer correct jordan sadler keybanc capital markets analyst okay and the size of that aggregate pipeline is still in the 5 billion range would you say edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer that s correct inaudible that healthscope was part of that original 5 billion that we talked about in the last call jordan sadler keybanc capital markets analyst okay and then steve for you on dry powder obviously you ve got quite a bit of liquidity i think you outlined north of 2 billion but as it relates to your debt to ebitda target what do you feel is your dry powder right about now before hitting that target r steven hamner chief financial officer executive vice president director well we re not constrained by a for example a 5 5 times leverage ratio on a temporary basis so i m not quite sure i m am answering your question but we can certainly exceed that because of the alternatives we have with the atm with other equity offerings with joint venture type arrangements so we have upwards of 2 billion available to us that would likely put us at about the 5 5 times range in itself jordan sadler keybanc capital markets analyst okay i guess i the way i was looking at it is and i don t know if you view it similarly but just based on where you stood at the end of the year and where you stand today because you ve obviously been using the atm just how much you could spend before hitting that threshold i think that is still your the upper limit of your threshold i don t know maybe you ve had some temporary flexibility around it but i think you want to target being around there i m just curious how much you would need to how much you could spend before hitting that in your view based on the returns that you achieve on your investment is it probably 1 billion plus or minus r steven hamner chief financial officer executive vice president director it s unlikely that we would get close to that we re not going to run right up to the edge and then began thinking about replenishing equity or other types of non debt capital so it s just not the way we manage the balance sheet or manage the acquisition pipeline edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer you know jordan part of the advantage we have is that all of that acquisitions inaudible going to come in one big chunk so we got the ability to manage the capital needs fairly well jordan sadler keybanc capital markets analyst okay is your last question inaudible the timing what does it look like healthscope plus or minus and the rest of the pipeline how should we be thinking about that timing edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer the brookfield and healthscope people seem pretty confident second quarter and so we are following their their guidance on that the other major opportunities in the pipeline we are on a weighted average expecting some time a little earlier than mid year but those are very often beyond our control and can accelerate or as you well know sometimes go beyond what where we expect it okay thank you guys jordan sadler keybanc capital markets analyst okay thank you guys edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer thanks jordan operator thank you and our next question comes from drew babin from baird your line is now open drew babin baird analyst hey good morning edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer morning drew drew babin baird analyst a question again on sources of capital obviously you hit the atm in the first quarter or toward the end of last year i should say is the steward potential jv the massachusetts portfolio something that could be kind of reignite it potentially now that the properties are all leased or is that then kind of moved on from as a potential source of capital r steven hamner chief financial officer executive vice president director no that is available for the reasons you described drew babin baird analyst and i guess how should we think about the cost of equity on doing something like that relative to where your stock trades right now obviously is one if you had to raise capital today which would you prefer multiple speakers edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer well i think multiple speakers yeah on a strictly cost basis the joint venture with would be less expensive but that s not necessarily the sole or the primary focus drew babin baird analyst okay and one more question on healthscope the development investments that come along with that would the lease terms on those be the same as the acquisition itself or would the yields potentially be higher on the developments edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer no the yields are higher contractually higher drew babin baird analyst okay and one more question just going back to steward i guess how much of the steward portfolio in place right now is in the same store coverage ratios that you report and i guess if you can give us an update on kind of where steward stands as a whole and or just by market as it stands right now edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer yeah drew i don t have that first to answer right off the top of my head but from and how is steward doing it s doing exceptionally well their coverage is over 2 times drew babin baird analyst okay so is any of it in the same store numbers that are in the supplemental r steven hamner chief financial officer executive vice president director yes there are a total of 13 hospitals that are in the same store drew babin baird analyst okay that s helpful thank you very much that s it for me operator thank you and our next question comes from michael lewis from suntrust your line is now open michael lewis suntrust analyst thank you your stock price is obviously now higher than when you tapped the atm somebody once said to me you shoot the bear when the bear is there i m curious if you have thoughts of kind of you don t need to but you could over equitize the deal and if you have any specific kind of funding assumptions in your guidance that you could share in terms of equity edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer no the only guidance is again we intend to maintain in the model it s constrained by the 5 5 times leverage and depending on timing on pricing on the overall pipeline because we do look at the 2 5 billion fungibly then that leverage could be lower than that michael lewis suntrust analyst okay in terms of the 350 million of potential redevelopment or expansion opportunities what will determine if those come to fruition or not do you expect all of that to come to fruition and it sounds like you re not giving specific returns but is it something well maybe you won t answer is it 6 plus returns you expect on this edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer most of that development i think will come to fruition the question is more of a timing standpoint when all the approvals happen and i think that if you look at the where we think the yields will be on that is it will be higher than the 6 range michael lewis suntrust analyst okay great thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from derek johnston of deutsche bank your line is now open shivani sood deutsche bank analyst hi this is shivani sood on for derek johnson you guys mentioned that the australian healthcare system has similarities with the u s so can you give us sort of an overview of how you view it versus the u s and the eu in terms of a little more details and the mix between private and public insurance edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer sure the similarities are that they actually call some of their government reimbursement medicare they have the same three buckets that we have they have the federal reimbursement they have the medicaid similar type reimbursement and they obviously have the private healthcare insurance reimbursement the coverage provided by the three different buckets are essentially what they are here in the u s about 50 being private insurance and the rest of it being some form of governmental insurance the biggest difference is that they do have a universal coverage as opposed to what we have here in the u s shivani sood deutsche bank analyst thanks and then how do you managed plan to manage or mitigate any sort of foreign exchange risk as it becomes a bigger factor of the exposure edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer so it s upwards of 100 year lease so we re not obviously trying to hedge out even the initial term which is of about 20 years we do expect that to the extent of any debt that we use it will be denominated in the australian dollar shivani sood deutsche bank analyst thanks so much edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from chad vanacore from stifel todd stifel analyst hi good morning this is todd ph in for chad vanacore edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer good morning todd stifel analyst morning so could you help me ph get the size of the market and investment opportunities in australia and new zealand edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer i m sorry would you repeat the question would about the size of the total market todd stifel analyst yeah yeah exactly edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer yes it is substantially larger than the the roughly 900 million that we ve committed to at this particular point multiple speakers and healthscope in particular they ve got about 43 hospitals the transaction that they re doing here is 11 with us and 11 with with another healthcare reit so there are more opportunities there they have more greenfield opportunities with them there and obviously there are other operators so we think that we ve got good opportunity to grow in australia we don t think that we re limited to the roughly 1 billion that we re putting in at this point todd stifel analyst okay so what would be the geographic makeup of your portfolio at the end of 2019 or 2020 edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer well that s a good question it depends on how successful we are in all the various things that we re working on right now i think that we probably will be more heavily weighted in the u s than i had anticipated at the end of the last quarter i d like to see our mix being closer to a 70 30 type range 70 30 65 35 something like that but i think that we probably will be much closer to a 75 25 ratio by the end of the year todd stifel analyst so there is a 350 million development opportunities embedded with this transaction how much would you take on in 2019 and what is the timing of that r steven hamner chief financial officer executive vice president director very little relatively speaking would be in 2019 especially considering that that the earliest the transaction closes at mid year so most of this will be in the early years of the lease but relatively little in 2019 we expect todd stifel analyst okay that s helpful you also mentioned the cap rates and the cost of capital are both lower outside the u s could you comment on spread in this transaction and how does that compare to sort of your us opportunities edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer you know the spreads are very similar to what we are getting in the u s where our spreads range anywhere from our total portfolio from 200 basis points to 350 basis points and we think that we ll continue to get those types of spreads internationally as well as domestically todd stifel analyst and how would the portfolio coverage change with the healthscope transaction edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer how would the portfolio coverage the ebitdarm coverage i don t think it will change it at all i think it will still be in the same range todd stifel analyst okay and you are still expecting a 7 5 average yield for the acquisitions still should we model kind of a higher cap rate for the reminder of the acquisition pipeline this year edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer no i think that s still the right range for on a gaap basis todd stifel analyst okay that s great thank you operator thank you our next question comes from tayo okusanya from jefferies your line is now open tayo okusanya jefferies group analyst hi yes good morning gentlemen edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer good morning tayo tayo okusanya jefferies group analyst congratulations on the transaction edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer thank you very much tayo okusanya jefferies group analyst it s good to see you in another part of the world questions so i know that northwest also kind of did a similar transaction with healthscope 11 properties 1 2 billion as well but i m trying to understand if there are any key differences between your transaction and theirs given that on their deal they re quoting a 5 cap rate edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer tayo i think the transactions are very similar some of the biggest differences i think are our cost of capital is much cheaper than northwest but i obviously haven t seen the documentation for theirs but i would imagine that it was very similar tayo okusanya jefferies group analyst the inaudible it was very similar that means is the cap rates similar then versus your transaction or i mean you guys have kind of talked about a range of that 7 5 to 8 5 on this deal they re kind of quoting 5 so i m just i think the northwest deal is closing quoting 5 multiple speakers r steven hamner chief financial officer executive vice president director to be clear tayo the 7 5 to 8 5 is the blended rate what we said last quarter when we announced the 1 42 to 1 46 that s based on a pipeline that would on the average yield a gaap blended rate of 7 5 to 8 5 so for example if the first deal we did was a 6 5 depending on how big that deal was the next deal maybe a 7 5 or an 8 and be much bigger that would continue then to yield the blended rate of 7 5 to 8 5 tayo okusanya jefferies group analyst okay that s multiple speakers edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer and tayo it s obviously a very important for us in our negotiations with existing and future clients not to give specific about every single transaction because every single transaction is different and you can t just point out one particular part of the transaction and so that s why we re not giving you everyone specifics about the cap rate on this transaction or others tayo okusanya jefferies group analyst that is perfectly fair totally understand that okay so that s number one and then number two could you just inaudible a bit again of why guidance didn t change it sounded like there was a december deal you dropped out of your guidance range and now you maybe brought this transaction into 2019 just inaudible about the puts and the puts the pluses and minuses and then why guidance overall didn t change for 19 despite the higher acquisition outlook edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer well the biggest issue as steve pointed out in his previous wording was that we had a transaction that we thought was going to close at the end the year and be producing income for us for all of 2019 that didn t happen so that was the only negative that we had the other positives that we ve had is that we ve had reductions in cost of capital and a much quicker healthscope transaction than we thought we were going to have and a larger amount of acquisitions than we thought we were going to have in 2018 i mean 19 tayo okusanya jefferies group analyst okay and i know inaudible ok that is helpful and then one more again i know you are very close to being superman but again it s australia germany and alabama how do you kind of plan to manage all these given your current staff edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer well remember tayo that it s all triple net leased properties so we don t have to be there on a daily basis we obviously will be there to review our properties on a regular basis but it s not something we have to be there on a daily basis our team is very well versed in the australian market they are very well versed in healthscope and not just these properties but all of the healthscope properties and we ll get the same type of reporting that we get from our other properties so we have our we now have a staff in luxembourg that s about 15 people and obviously we ve got a much larger staff here in the united states in birmingham and in new york and we have the ability to get there not on a moment s notice it does take a little bit longer but we do plan on being there on a regular basis tayo okusanya jefferies group analyst sounds good there thank you very much edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer thanks tayo operator thank you our next question is going to come from karin ford from mufg securities your line is now open karin ford mufg securities analyst hi good morning edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer hi karin karin ford mufg securities analyst hi can you tell us where you think what rate you think you could raise long term debt today in australia and in the u s and have you issued anything under the atm in january edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer 10 year unsecured bonds in the u s karin probably in the low to mid fives unsecured loans in australia in the low threes karin ford mufg securities analyst got it and should we model in any more atm edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer i m sorry didn t answer that part of it yes that s half of the raise the 200 million raise was in january karin ford mufg securities analyst okay got it next question was just also more for modeling than anything else it looks like the depreciation and amortization add back for ffo purposes was about 6 5 million higher than the expense line i assume that s due to the primonial jv that s now in other income i wanted to see if i could reiterate the request that you guys got last quarter for more jv disclosure just so we can more effectively model out those lines edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer yes you may renew the request and i will commit to next quarter meeting that request karin ford mufg securities analyst okay great and am i correct that the reason for the discrepancies to jv multiple speakers r steven hamner chief financial officer executive vice president director yeah you re correct in your assumption edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer ye karin ford mufg securities analyst okay great and then just last question do you have any update on waterland sale of the operations for median edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer no they haven t announced anything and there s just not enough to report there at this point karin ford mufg securities analyst okay thank you edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer thanks karin operator thank you our next question comes from todd stender from wells fargo your line is now open todd stender wells fargo analyst hi good morning thank you edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer good morning todd todd stender wells fargo analyst i don t know if i missed this how many master leases and i guess that was the wording are the 11 healthscope hospitals spread across edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer three of which the the first and primary master lease has about 80 of the portfolio todd stender wells fargo analyst okay got it and have you guys disclosed the ebitdarm coverage that those are underwritten at edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer i think it s out there and it s about 2 25 times todd stender wells fargo analyst okay with expectations that it rises closer to your portfolio average or generically it s going to be tighter like it is in europe i guess in australia edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer yeah generically it will be tighter it won t get up to the 3 6 times we are now todd stender wells fargo analyst okay thank you and then probably for steve the cash you re holding on the balance sheet if that s from the german post acute care hospitals that you sold into the joint venture if that s held in europe can that be deployed into the australian acquisition i wasn t sure if there was any tax ramifications or repatriating the cash any nuances to that r steven hamner chief financial officer executive vice president director well a portion frankly a minority portion is held in europe most of it s in u s dollars and we have some flexibility the fact is we need the euros there so it s unlikely that we would take euros and convert australian dollars it s just not necessary again keeping in mind that we look upon this entire 2 5 billion 2019 pipeline fungibly todd stender wells fargo analyst so deploying a lot of that cash is fair to say from q4 the q4 balance ok r steven hamner chief financial officer executive vice president director right that plus 200 million in u s dollars raised in the atm todd stender wells fargo analyst in equity ok okay great thank you edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer thanks todd operator thank you and our next question comes from jason idoine from rbc capital markets your line is now open jason idoine rbc capital markets analyst hi thanks yeah i was wondering what the main attributes that you guys look for before you enter into international markets are edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer yeah well the first one is rule of law the second one is their commitment to healthcare and the third one is how the healthcare is funded and historically and how it s done jason idoine rbc capital markets analyst and so with australia you thought that all of those were relatively similar to the u s so it s a natural fit edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer yeah don t necessarily have to be similar to the u s obviously rule of law does they obviously passed that one easily their commitment to healthcare is probably better than what we ve seen here in the u s and we re very comfortable and had been watching australia for over 10 years from a historical and where we think it is going forward jason idoine rbc capital markets analyst okay and in terms of competition for deals could you provide some details on the differences between international and domestic markets edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer internationally we see a lot more sovereign wealth funds and big insurance companies they move very slow we are still much more nimble than they are even at 10 billion in assets but that s primarily what our competition is jason idoine rbc capital markets analyst got you okay thank you very much edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question is going to be from michael mueller from jpmorgan your line is now open michael mueller jpmorgan analyst thanks just a quick one for steve from an accounting standpoint are you straight lining just the 20 year lease the initial term or are you factoring in some option periods as well r steven hamner chief financial officer executive vice president director it s only the initial term michael mueller jpmorgan analyst got it ok that was it thank you r steven hamner chief financial officer executive vice president director thank you edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer thanks mike operator thank you our next question comes from jordan sadler from keybanc capital markets your line is now open jordan sadler keybanc capital markets analyst i just wanted to come back to a question on healthscope did you guys have the opportunity or the interest level to look at the entire property portfolio that ended up getting split up edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer well we certainly had the interest level and continue to think that we ll be able to grow with brookfield in this particular portfolio but the only 50 of it is what we were offered jordan sadler keybanc capital markets analyst okay and did you say that the escalate did you give the number on the escalators is it similar to what was disclosed by the other capital provider edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer yes jordan sadler keybanc capital markets analyst i think it was maybe 2 5 r steven hamner chief financial officer executive vice president director yeah i think inaudible that other press release yes jordan sadler keybanc capital markets analyst okay and i think that was that was all i had for you appreciate it edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer thanks jordan operator thank you i m not showing any further questions i would now like to turn the call over to ed aldag for further remarks edward k aldag chairman president and chief executive officer thank you very much operator and we appreciate all of your interest today and as always if you have any further questions after the call don t hesitate to give us a call thank you very much duration 40 minutes call participants charles

fuller said market conditions have remained constructive through the fourth quarter of 2018 and into the first quarter of 2019 since october we have contractually agreed to rate renewals for approximately 20 of our anticipated truckload revenue for 2019 with an average rate increase of approximately 7 and we expect full year contract rates to increase between 5 8 the truckload segment achieved an adjusted operating ratio of 91 9 for the fourth quarter of 2018 a 340 bps improvement compared to the adjusted operating ratio of 95 3 achieved in the fourth quarter of 2017 this improvement was a result of the continued successful implementation of the company s strategic initiatives disciplined cost management and increased rates in the over the road division as a result of a change in business mix the company maintained average revenue per tractor per week in 2018 consistent with the fourth quarter of 2017 while increasing average revenue per mile by 5 3 despite a reduction in average miles per tractor by 4 4 the dedicated division s average revenue per tractor per week increased 10 0 in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 the increase was primarily the result of a 9 1 increase in the division s revenue per mile the highlight in the fourth quarter of 2018 was the improvement in utilization compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 the company believes significant progress was achieved during the third quarter through rate increases and adjusting to the change in shipping patterns which contributed to the fourth quarter s sequential utilization improvement this compares to general fourth quarter seasonality that historically has resulted in an approximate 5 reduction in utilization sequentially brokerage segment

increased 16 2 to 64 9 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 55 8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 the increase was primarily the result of higher average revenue per load due in part to higher fuel prices liquidity and capital resources as of december 31 2018 u s xpress had 139 9 million of liquidity defined as cash plus availability under the company s revolving credit facility 416 0 million of net debt defined as long term debt including current maturities less cash balances and 238 4 million of total stockholders equity capital expenditures net of proceeds related primarily to tractors and trailers and were 79 9 million in the fourth quarter and 168 6 million for full year 2018 outlook mr fuller commented on the company s outlook for 2019 we continue to expect to achieve four quarters of year over year adjusted operating ratio improvement with a targeted full year adjusted operating ratio of 93 0 from a revenue perspective we anticipate moderate economic growth and a more balanced relationship of freight demand and available truckload capacity in this environment we anticipate holding our asset based fleet size approximately even and optimizing our consolidated revenue base over our truckload and brokerage capacity for the full year we expect mid single digit rate increases in our truckload segment based on a combination of contract rate increases and network management partially offset by a less robust spot market which represents approximately 10 of our revenues in our brokerage segment we anticipate flattening revenue due to a combination of tougher comparisons rate pressure and an emphasis on truckload selection of available loads outside of market forces we see multiple company specific opportunities we expect to realize in 2019 at least 50 of the expected 10 million of annualized benefits from exiting our fixed cost investment in the mexico cross border business market and reallocating our north of the border capacity in addition new tractor technology and internal initiatives afford us opportunities in the areas of safety maintenance and fuel savings we also continue to examine new ways to use technology

with that out of the way we ll begin with our chairman and ceo tom linebarger tom linebarger chairman chief executive officer very compelling thank you james good morning everybody i ll start with a summary of our fourth quarter and full year results and finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2019 that will then take more details of both our fourth quarter performance and forecast for the year revenues for the fourth quarter of 2018 were 6 1 billion an increase of 12 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 with growth in all of our operation segments and major geographic markets ebitda was 896 million or 14 6 compared to 769 million or 14 a year ago ebitda increased as a percent of sales due to the benefit of higher volumes improved pricing lower working costs and the absence of tax reform impact on jv earnings in the fourth quarter last year these positive factors more than offset an increase in research and engineering to support new product development and the negative impact of tariffs for the full year cummins sales were a record 23 8 billion up 16 year over year our ebitda margins were 14 6 compared to 14 8 in 2017 with the impact of higher sales improved pricing and the benefit of cost reduction programs offset by product campaign charges in the first half of the year and the increase in research and engineering ebitda dollars were a record 3 5 billion engine business sales increased by 18 in 2018 due to stronger production of heavy and medium duty in north america and higher demand for construction equipment globally ebitda was 13 7 compared to 12 8 in 2017 due to the positive impact of higher revenues and improved pricing partially offset by product campaign charges sales for our distribution business grew by 11 driven by increased demand in north america and europe full year ebitda was 7 2 compared to 7 1 in 2017 with the benefit of improved pricing offset by the impact of strong us dollar and currency volatility in africa full year revenues for the component segment increased by 22 due to higher truck production in north america europe india and brazil the automated transmission business contributed 6 to segment growth for the full year ebitda was 14 4 compared to 15 6 in 2017 as the benefits of higher sales and material cost reduction programs were more than offset by product campaign costs and the dilutive effect of the new automated transmission business the automated transmission business delivered revenues of 543 million in 2018 driven by stronger demand in the north american heavy duty truck market as well as higher than expected penetration rates of automatic manual transmissions which reached 73 of new heavy duty trucks in 2018 customer feedback on the new endurant transmission has been very positive and joint venture profitability is benefiting from transitioning to selling the new and improved products power systems sales increased by 14 in 2018 driven by higher demand for power generation equipment and an increase in sales to oil and gas and mining customers ebitda was 13 3 compared to 10 1 in 2017 driven by the positive impact of higher sales lower warranty costs and improved pricing while ebitda margins improved significantly for the full year they were below our expectations in the fourth quarter due to stronger than anticipated demand for power generation equipment our alternator business which is still in the restructuring process incurred additional production costs and premium freight to meet deliver commitments ebitda percent in the fourth quarter was also negatively impacted by lower joint venture earnings in africa the impact of tariffs and a lower mix of parts sales we do though expect to grow earnings in 2019 as a result of stronger power generation sales improved pricing and sustained improvement in our alternator operations all of which will offset weaker demand from oil and gas customers in our electrified power business full year ebitda was a loss of 90 million in line with our forecast we continue our targeted investments in areas which we expect to see broad market adoption primarily in urban and short range applications included in the fourth quarter results were two non recurring items with combined negative impact of 58 million of ebitda these items were costs related to closing a start up electronic logging device business and the impact of marking to market assets that underpin our non qualified benefit plans the mark to market loss was driven by volatility in debt and equity markets in the fourth quarter the eld business was part of our strategy effort to increase digital services to customers and included the design of the smartphone voiced app that helped truckers meet electronic logging requirements in the us while this specific market didn t materialize as we expected we continue to launch new digital products that serve our end customers needs now i will comment on some of our key markets in 2018 starting with north america and then i ll comment on some of our largest international markets our revenues in north america increased 19 in 2018 primarily due to higher levels of truck production we also experienced growth in sales of engines and parts to customers in oil and gas construction and mining markets as well as the full year impact of the automated transmission business industry production of heavy duty trucks increased to 286 000 units an increase of 29 from 2017 levels supported by strong freight rates improved fuel economy in new trucks our market share was 34 for the full year up from 33 in 2017 the market size for medium duty trucks was 132 000 units in 2018 an increase of 9 from 2017 and the highest level of production in over a decade we maintained our clear leadership in the market with a full year market share of 80 up from 78 a year ago 2018 marked another strong year for pickup truck sales in north america we shipped 150 000 engines to pickup truck in 2018 and recently unveiled the next generation 6 7l turbo diesel engine boasting a first in class 1 000 feet pound of torque in a ram truck at the detroit auto show 2019 marks the 30th anniversary of cummins availability in ram trucks engine sales to construction customers in north america increased by 31 driven by record levels of non residential construction and the strongest year of residential construction spending since 2006 engine shipments to high horsepower markets in north america increased by 18 from last year driven by demand from oil and gas and mining customers while power generation revenues increased by 10 year over year with particular strength in demand from data center customers our international revenues increased 12 in 2018 full year revenues in china including joint ventures were 4 8 billion down 2 compared with 2017 with lower sales in on highway markets partially offset by strong construction markets industry demand for medium and heavy duty trucks in china decreased by 2 from the record level experience in 2017 within the truck market construction related dump truck and specialty vehicle sales were up 45 in 2018 while tractor and flatbed sales utilized primarily for line haul applications were down 10 our market share in 2018 was 12 7 down from 14 8 in 2017 due to lower market share at our oem partners mostly driven by the change in market mix toward construction related vehicles the light duty market in china grew 10 in 2018 and our share ended the year at 7 in line with our guidance industry demand for excavators set a new record of 203 000 units in 2018 an increase of 45 from 2017 levels our market share ended the year at 15 1 5 higher than in 2017 due to market share gains made by several of our key domestic oem partners revenues for our power systems business in china increased by 29 due to increased demand for power generation equipment and growth in industrial engine shipments to mining customers full year revenues in india including joint ventures were 2 2 billion a 23 increase over 2017 industry truck production was a record in 2018 and increased 22 from the year previous our truck market share ended at 40 which was flat compared to last year sales in our component segment increased more than 40 due to increased content associated with the transition to bs4 emission standards in the truck market beginning in april last year strong economic growth and infrastructure investment also led to a 10 increase in power generation sales during the year in brazil our revenues increased by 27 mainly driven by a 27 increase in truck production now let me provide an overall outlook for 2019 and then comment on some individual regions and end markets we are forecasting total company revenues for 2019 to be flat to up 4 from 2018 driven by an increase in heavy and medium duty truck production in north america and brazil as well as increased demand in power generation markets we expect most of our end markets in china to decline in 2019 while european and indian end markets are expected to remain relatively flat industry production for heavy duty trucks in north america is projected to be 292 000 units in 2019 a 2 increase year over year the industry enters 2019 with a record backlog and high visibility of production levels in the first half of the year we expect our market share to be in the range of 32 34 in the medium duty truck market we expect market size to be 134 000 units a 2 increase from 2018 with our market share projected to be in the range of 74 76 our engine shipments for pickup trucks in north america are expected to be flat compared to a very strong 2018 in china we project domestic revenues including joint ventures to be flat in 2019 we are currently projecting a 10 reduction in heavy and medium duty truck demand and a 7 reduction in light duty truck demand we expect our market share in the medium and heavy duty truck market to be in the range of 13 14 in 2019 up from 2018 our share in the light duty market will be 8 9 up from 7 with growth coming from our new joint venture with jac which became operational in december there continues to be uncertainty around the adoption of national standard 6 in china this year our projection for industry truck sales to decline by 10 in 2019 assumes low industry demand for ns6 compliant products with adoption concentrated in urban use vehicles for tier 1 fittings in the event that the enforcement of ns6 standards accelerates adoption we anticipate that overall truck sales could decline an additional 10 below our current forecast but our content per engine would increase industry sales of excavators in china are expected to decline 25 from record levels in 2018 while 2019 demand will be down it will still represent the third highest year of sales on record in india we project total revenue including joint ventures to be flat in 2019 we anticipate industry demand for trucks to be 5 lower than the record levels experienced in 2018 demand will be muted in the first half of 2019 as elections take place but we expect strong growth in the second half of 2019 ahead of the planned implementation of bharat stage 6 standards in april of 2020 we also expect 5 10 growth in construction and power generation markets as continued infrastructure investment drives incremental demand we expect to see growth in all of our businesses in brazil this year due to improved economic conditions we expect truck production to be up 13 in 2019 and power generation demand to increase 15 we project our global high horsepower engine shipments to be flat in 2019 with a 5 improvement in new engine orders from mining customers as they replace aging equipment demand for new oil and gas engines is expected to decline by 40 with sales continuing at levels experienced in the second half of 2018 following robust fleet replacement in the first half of last year in summary we expect full year sales to be flat to up 4 and ebitda to be in the range of 15 75 16 25 of sales the improvement in ebitda this year will be driven by positive pricing material cost reduction lower warranty and variable compensation costs partially offset by metal markets and tariffs we returned a record 1 9 billion in cash to shareholders in 2018 in the form of dividends and share repurchases and currently plan to return 75 of operating cash flow to shareholders in 2019 as well before moving on to pat who will discuss our financial results in more detail i d like to take a few minutes to share some of the progress that s been made in our electrified power business unit this year 2018 marked the first full year of operations of our electrified power business unit in 2018 we announced partnerships of on and off highway oem and are working on electrification solutions in products ranging from bus to medium duty trucks light commercial vehicles excavators and dredge trucks vehicles with cummins electrification content were on display at several industry events and to date we have over 11 million miles of testing and development on vehicles with our electrified power technology they have begun selling battery electric powertrain systems to bluebird for use in school bus markets in the united states and are progressing toward launches with additional customers including gillig for transit buses later this year we are continually assessing and innovating across a broad portfolio of power solutions from diesel to natural gas fuel cells hybrid and full electric options we plan to provide our customers with the right technical solutions for their application at the right time and to continue to be the leader in power for commercial and industrial equipment as we begin 2019 and the 100th anniversary of our company we continue to see the benefit of our leadership in diesel technology as well the next generation 6 7l turbo diesel engine in dodge ram pickup trucks boasts a first in class 1 000 foot pound of torque and was announced at the detroit auto show in january the new lightweight cummins x12 engine will be available on a number of chassis in 2019 including several of daimler trucks north america customer demand for our industry leading isx 15l engine remains strong and we are producing at all time record levels finally amtrak announced on december 21st that it would be purchasing 75 charger locomotives for delivery starting in 2021 equipped with our qsk95 engine i want to close with a brief salute to our cfo pat ward pat has served our company with distinction for more than 30 years including the last ten as cfo

been working closely with mark smith to ensure a smooth transition congratulations pat on your well earned retirement and also to mark as our new cfo now let me turn it over to pat for the last time patrick ward chief financial officer thank you tom good morning everyone i will start with a review of our fourth quarter results before moving on to the full year 2018 performance and then finishing up with outlook for 2019 fourth quarter revenues were 6 1 billion an increase of 12 from a year ago and a record fourth quarter for the company sales in north america increased 17 as a result of higher commercial truck production and improved demand for construction and power generation equipment international sales grew by 6 mainly driven by stronger demand in europe and asia pacific from power generation and construction customers a stronger us dollar negatively impacted international sales by 4 gross margins were 25 2 of sales ten basis points higher than a year ago the positive impact of higher volumes favorable pricing and lower warranty expense were offset by increased supply chain and operational costs along with a less favorable mix of sales in our power systems segment while selling development costs of 887 million increased by 36 million with all the increase coming in research and development we were 100 basis points lower as a percent of sales joint venture income of 79 million was 23 million higher than last year due to the absence 40 million tax charge related to the tax cuts and jobs act passed in december of 2017 excluding that tax charge earnings declined mainly due to reduced sales at our on highway joint ventures in china earnings before interest and tax depreciation and amortization were 896 million or 14 6 of sales for the quarter compared to 769 million or 14 of sales last year as tom just mentioned included in the fourth quarter ebitda results were a 24 million write off of an investment in our very own electronic data logging company and a 44 million adjustment of mark to market losses in job and company owned life insurance investments which we used to fund our non qualified benefit plans experienced in financial markets in the fourth quarter net earnings for the quarter were 579 million or 3 63 per diluted share and included a 0 43 negative impact from the two investment losses i just mentioned partially offset by a 0 15 benefit related to the 2017 tax legislation and other discrete tax items this compares to net earnings last year of 503 million or 3 03 per diluted share excluding the 777 million in one time charges related to tax legislation our tax rate in the quarter was 14 1 which included 51 million or 0 33 per share of variable discrete tax items excluding the discrete items the operational rate was 21 3 in the quarter now let me comment on our full year results and provide some more details on our performance full year revenues for the company were a record 23 8 billion an increase of 16 compared to the prior year sales improved in each of our operating segments driven by higher commercial truck production in north america strong demand in global construction and power generation markets as well as improved demand in oil and gas and the mining markets north american revenues increased by 19 in 2018 and represented 51 of our total revenues international revenues improved by 4 with higher sales in most regions including europe brazil china india japan and australia gross margins of 24 1 were 90 basis points lower than last year the 368 million after treatment campaign in the first half of 2018 and headwinds from were partially offset by higher volumes favorable pricing actions and material cost reductions selling admin and research and development costs increased by 156 million with almost all the increase coming from increased investments in research and development and about 160 basis points lower as a percent of sales joint venture income increased by 47 million compared to last year the 2017 joint venture income included a 39 million tax charge related to the tax legislation that i discussed earlier excluding that tax charge 2018 joint venture income results were flat year over year other income was 97 million lower than 2017 as a result of the mark to market losses incurred on company owned life insurance investments recorded on the sale of assets in 2017 and some losses in total ebitda was a record 3 5 billion or 14 6 of sales compared to 3 billion or 14 8 a year ago net earnings were 2 1 billion or 13 15 per diluted share both full year records for the company this compares to 1 8 billion or 10 62 per share in 2017 excluding the 777 million in one time charges related to tax legislation the operating tax rate for the full year excluding 14 million of discrete benefits was 21 1 compared to 58 last year or 24 5 adjusted for the tax legislation moving on to the operating segments let me summarize their performance in the quarter and for the full year 2018 and then provide a forecast for 2019 i ll then review the full year cash flow and conclude with the company s revenue and profitability expectations for the upcoming year in the engine segment revenues were 2 7 billion in the quarter an increase of 18 from last year on highway revenues grew by 17 from higher heavy and medium duty truck engine sales primarily in north america off highway revenues increased by 21 as a result of stronger demand for construction equipment in china north america and in europe segment ebitda in the quarter was 393 million or 14 6 of sales this compares to 271 million or 11 8 of sales a year ago the improvement in ebitda percent was driven by benefits from the highway volumes and from favorable pricing actions so for the full year revenues increased 18 from a year ago and ebitda increased from 12 8 to 13 7 of sales for 2019 we expect revenues to be flat to up 4 with growth in north american truck markets and improving demand in brazil partially offset by more construction demand in china ebitda is projected to be in the range of 14 5 15 5 compared to 13 7 of sales in 2018 driven primarily by lower warranty expense for the distribution segment fourth quarter revenues were a record 3 1 billion increasing 6 compared to last year the growth in sales was primarily driven by stronger demand for power generation equipment and parts and service in north america partially offset by reduced demand for engines in oil and gas markets ebitda for the fourth quarter was 140 million or 6 8 of sales compared to last year the fourth quarter ebitda margin increased by 50 basis points as a result of higher sales and favorable pricing actions partially offset by the negative impact of a stronger us dollar for 2018 the distribution segment concluded with record sales and ebitda sales grew by 11 compared to last year and ebitda increased by 13 to 563 million or 7 2 of sales we expect 2019 revenues in the segment to be flat to up 4 primarily due to increased demand for parts and service and power generation in north america along with favorable pricing partially offset by the impact of a stronger us dollar ebitda margins are projected to be in the range of 7 8 of sales compared to 7 2 in 2018 for the components segment revenues were 1 8 billion in the fourth quarter an increase of 14 from a year ago sales in north america increased by 23 due to higher heavy and medium duty truck production and the impact of the automated transmission business international sales grew by 3 with lower demand in china more than offset by standard sales in europe and india segment ebitda was 278 million or 15 7 of sales compared to 314 million or 13 7 of sales a year ago ebitda improved driven by the benefits from the higher sales lower warranty expense and material cost reductions for 2018 our components segment delivered record revenue which grew by 22 due to stronger on highway demand in north america europe and india in addition to the impact of revenues from the automated transmission business ebitda decrease from 15 6 last year to 14 4 in 2018 primarily driven by higher warranty costs recorded in the first half of the year for 2019 we expect components revenue to increase 1 5 as a result of growth in north american and brazilian on highway truck markets partially offset by weaker demand in china the ebitda margin is projected to be in the range of 15 16 of sales up from 14 4 in 2018 more warranty expense will be partially offset by increased investment and preparation for the upcoming india bharat stage 6 and china national standard 6 emission regulations in the power systems segment fourth quarter revenues were 1 3 billion up 9 from a year ago power generation sales grew by 14 driven by increased demand for power generation equipment in north america asia pacific and in india investor sales were unchanged compared to last year ebitda margins were 10 3 in the quarter down from 11 3 last year the ebitda margin decline year over year is primarily due to the increased supply chain and operational costs that along with a less favorable mix of sales and lower joint venture earnings 2018 was a record year for our power systems segment in terms of revenues which grew by 14 primarily driven by increased demand for power generation equipment and stronger demand in mining and oil and gas markets ebitda increased by 49 to 640 million with margins expanding from 10 1 to 13 3 of sales driven by the higher volumes lower warranty expense and favorable pricing for 2019 revenues are expected to increase 3 7 with growth in data center markets increased military revenue and higher demand for mining engines partially offset by lower demand in oil and gas markets ebitda is projected to be in the range of 14 15 of sales up from 13 3 in 2018 primarily due to the positive impact of standard returns standard revenues and the benefits of actions taken in 2018 to rationalize the manufacturing footprint of our automated business in the electrified power segment ebitda losses were 29 million in the fourth quarter and 90 million for the full year in line with our guidance for 2019 we expect a net expense of 120 150 million as we continue to make targeted investments in this space and as tom mentioned we re now projecting total company revenues to be flat to up 4 in 2019 increased demand globally for power generation equipment primarily at data centers and improvements in truck production in north america and latin america drive the majority of the growth in revenue foreign are expected to negatively impact revenues by approximately 300 million income from our joint ventures is expected to decline approximately 5 as a result of lower demand for heavy and medium duty trucks in china and in india ebitda margins are projected to be between 15 75 16 35 of sales for 2019 up from the 14 6 recorded in 2018 we expect ebitda margins in the first quarter will be at the low point for the year due to seasonal weak demand in our power systems and distribution businesses if reduced warranty and variable compensation expense along with pricing and material cost improvement will positively impact margins partially offset by tariffs and investments in the automated transmission business electrified power segment and in components primarily related to china national standard 6 and india bharat stage 6 emissions we re currently projecting our effective tax rate to be 21 5 in 2019 excluding any discrete items turning to cash flow cash generated from operations was 990 million in the fourth quarter and a record 2 4 billion for the full year we anticipate operating cash flow in 2019 will be within our long term guidance range of 10 15 of sales capital expenditure for the full year was 709 million and we expect our 2019 capital investments will be in the range of 650 700 million in 2019 we ll return a record 9 1 billion to our shareholders or 78 of operating cash flow we repurchased almost 8 million shares and increased our dividend by 5 6 our capital allocation plans remain consistent with what we ve told you previously we will maintain a strong financial position to sustain us across cycles and variation in business levels we will focus on growth targeting high return investments both organic and inorganic and for 2019 we plan to return 75 of the operating cash flow to shareholders we are pleased with the record sales ebitda and operating cash flow in 2018 and the returns on invested capital were top quarter that being said there are clearly areas where we could have done better and you can see from our guidance that we expect improvement in operating margins in2019 and just before i finish i do want to thank you all for your interest in cummins throughout my time there as cfo the company is in a very strong position and i look forward to following cummins continuing success as a shareholder now let me turn it back over to james james hopkins executive director of investor relations thanks pat out of consideration to others on the call i d ask that you limit yourselves to one question and a related follow up and if you have additional questions please rejoin the queue chelsea we re now ready for our first question questions and answers operator certainly ladies and gentlemen if you have a question at this time please press the then the no 1 key on your telephone keypad if your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue please press the key to prevent any background noise we do ask that you please place your line on mute once your question has been stated thank you and our first question comes from the line of alex potter with piper jaffray your line is open alex potter piper jaffray analyst hi guys i guess first of all it sounds like pricing has been a tailwind in 2018 across a number of your segments you called it out multiple times just wondering the extent to which you expect that to be a tailwind again in 2019 and which areas do you think the biggest opportunities are thanks rich freeland president and chief operating officer yeah alex it s rich you have a tailwind in 2018 in fact it ll be a bigger tailwind in 2019 and the primary areas where we re able to get some pricing is in the parts business and some of our prior generation markets again some of that will be needed to offset the impact of tariffs that we have also coming into our 2019 alex potter piper jaffray analyst okay thanks also i was wondering if you could comment on nissan you mentioned the big that monster diesel engine you re putting in the ram pickup if you can comment i guess on both of those platforms both ram and nissan how those have developed relative to your initial expectations and what the outlook is there over not just in 2019 but over the next couple years diesel penetration for that type of vehicle as well as cummins market share thanks rich freeland president and chief operating officer okay thanks let me start with the chrysler so we re really excited about this we re gonna be in the lead in the torque with this engine and that market remains strong it was 150 000 last year and we see that continuing i mean we re basically it s the supply chain trying to keep up to produce them we will see that in q1 will be the low point though so it ll be lower than that run rate in q1 as we go through the model year change and the transition there and some issues in working that out but we re excited and basically the whole industry s trying to add capacity to meet the demand on the nissan front that one still remains below our expectations what would be our projections someone correct me here but we re in the 15 20 000 engine range for that which has been relatively flat so that one continues to has not gotten the traction that we wanted on the 5l v 8 and so i d say from a chrysler standpoint we see only upside in 19 and continuing as we get into gross share and the nissan relatively flat at the low levels alex potter piper jaffray analyst okay great that s very helpful and congratulations pat patrick ward chief financial officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jerry revich with goldman sachs your line is open jerry revich goldman sachs analyst hi good morning everyone and pat and mark congratulations we ll miss working with you i m wondering tom if you can talk about the major electric rotation product milestones that you expect over the next year you mentioned something about the highlights on a trailing basis can you just talk about the number of new platforms that you folks are going to be participating on over the next 12 months what your win rate has been to get on additional platforms and then any updated thoughts on when the revenue contributions here will accelerate obviously they provided guidance for 19 but i m wondering if your longer term thoughts have developed at all tom linebarger chairman and chief executive officer yeah thanks a lot jerry so big milestones this year of course are the transit bus launch with gillig that s something we been working to really since the beginning of the business we see the transit bus market as kind of the maybe the most obvious adopter the one where there s significant incentives in the cities to drive toward electrification the application lends itself toward electrification either pure bevs or potentially with a small engine to get you back to base so we think it s a good application for electric vehicles so that s where we re targeting the gillig launch is a big one we ve got a good order for that and so we re pretty excited about that and pretty focused on that i mentioned dredge trucks and frankly dredge trucks have a very similar application in terms of their relatively short range pretty easy to charge loads are pretty predictable so we think that s another area that s gonna go we ve got a launch partner there i don t want to announce ahead of them so i think those are really our major two platform milestones i mentioned that we re already working with bluebird and we are trying to get some more launch partners on the school bus side all those just reflect the ones that we think will early adopt and kind of one level lower jerry there s a pretty big milestone for us to have our battery pack that we re developing meet the performance standards at least for a first generation that we re looking for that s a pretty big deal too so we ve got a milestone related to our battery pack then related to the entire electrical system launch further out there s a number of applications we re looking at that i would say we re pretty strongly focused on these year term milestones there s a lot of development work going on it s a big effort for us to get right and then we ll look for and with regard to revenues i would say we re still in the market development phase i d be remiss to give you a good view on revenues i think market adoption in the markets that i mentioned is likely to move with some steadiness but still i ve heard people project that the transit buses which i ve mentioned is one of the best markets might be 50 electric in ten or more years that s a long time and that s for new buses which means you ve got all the diesel buses still selling so i m still loath to call the transitions i think what we re thinking about is trying to get our products ready to convert in these markets that are moving fast and then see what kind of adoption rates we get and then we ll be able to start calling more of the financial side about what we think ramp our revenues i know that s a little dissatisfying it is to me anyway but we re still trying to manage these launches and make sure that we re available and then we ll be able to figure out where launches go jerry revich goldman sachs analyst okay i really appreciate the color and on the x12 i m wondering if you can update us on any traction with additional oems nice to hear the data point on daimler how close are you to rolling out with the others and do i remember correctly you had spoken about that platform potentially adding two to four points of market shares that still the way to think about it when it s rolled out rich freeland president and chief operating officer hi jerry this is rich we ve added daimler of course we ll let oems make their own announcements on that but currently it is daimler and some smaller distributer oems that we ve signed up and tom linebarger chairman and chief executive officer and autocar rich you know autocar is the refuse specialty vehicle and they re kind of using the isx12 as the big launch vehicle for them and they launched the engine for them on some new platforms and they re pretty excited about it too so i think that and it the isx12 fits their applications really well so i think that will be another important launch for us rich freeland president and chief operating officer yeah and so we re looking at close to 5 000 this year jerry and so i think the market share gain of a couple points i think that s still out there i think it s kind of a couple years out there though where we d need to add some more jerry revich goldman sachs analyst okay thank you rich freeland president and chief operating officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of david raso with evercore isi your line is open david raso evercore isi analyst hi good morning and congrats to both pat and mark regarding the comment about north america tom not to nitpick on the choice of words but i thought it was interesting you said visibility to the first half of 2019 some of your key customers are saying visibility with the backlog as far as it is kinda the late half of 2019 and so i m just trying to clarify how you re viewing the current backlog how long it can carry us what do you think of orders and any thoughts around american truck production in the back half of the year tom linebarger chairman and chief executive officer yeah i ll let rich talk about that rich freeland president and chief operating officer i ll start that and then you can chime in here tom yeah the backlog s big it s close to 300 000 units and we re projecting a 290 market with our projections so i think it s just our we might be being a bit conservative because we did strong through the whole year we re just gonna pay attention to what s going on with cancellations what s going on with freight rates but i would say we don t have any insight beyond that it actually looks pretty strong and i d say there s growing confidence we had projected a bit of a reduction in the second half of the year a slight one there s more and more confidence that could fill in though jerry so we re just paying attention to it and so you know what our assumptions are is what we try to do here tom linebarger chairman and chief executive officer i think your question about the words is a good one we weren t trying to call a difference between us and the truck makers it s just that we are always we ve seen a lot of these cycles before and we ve seen sometimes when order board cancellations start they can happen fast we don t have any reason to think that s gonna happen here but we re watching the truck orders just like you guys are and we got two not such great orders and we just wanna keep our eyes on it but we are planning that this as we said that the year s gonna be a good year and definitely the order board s filling up if we don t see cancellations that we ll have a terrific year david raso evercore isi analyst okay i appreciate the clarification and also on truck in china we all know you re not that exposed to the dump truck market you re more about freight flatbed so within that industry baseline view you have of down ten where you re more exposed the freight haul kinda flatbed market can you help us with the mix like how do you view that market which is obviously the more relevant one for you tom linebarger chairman and chief executive officer we re not forecasting a big mix shift year over year i mean again one of the things that has to happen is in china they re clearly stimulating construction growth and there was also some changes in regs inside the truck market which drove more of those construction trucks so you ve got stimulus and this change in regs which drove this mix it s pretty dramatic i mean normally the mix shift is just not something that we would call out but frankly these two things combined shifted a bunch and as you said our engines are more for these longer range things so we got negatively surprised on market share that s what happened and so we were disappointed with the market share so we re thinking to ourselves that there may be a little mix shift back because of we won t have these special factors anymore but we re not thinking that there s a big there s certainly not any negative trends if anything the mix trend should be slightly positive for us the big news in china really is how does ns6 get enforced so what s gonna happen with the standard how tightly do they enforce it on the first day we were thinking we were heading into a time where now all these enforcements would be launched they d all be enforced aggressively across the country but because of the economic situation in china it looks like that s not gonna happen and we re gonna move back to some of those old enforcement plans where the cities ll go first and things ll move slower which means we ll be in a fair bit of uncertainty in the market we think for 12 or 18 months while the ns6 stuff gets enforced over time so that i think that s driving most of the uncertainty as opposed to the mix mark smith vice president of financial operations and freight s pretty flat tom linebarger chairman and chief executive officer yeah freight s flat that s good mark was just adding that freight is flat so again we re not calling for a disaster we think things are gonna continue along fine but mix is slightly favorable maybe is what we hope again we didn t call it that well last year but we think it s favorable this year and we think that this ns6 thing is really what we re having to manage david raso evercore isi analyst and i ll pass on the baton here but just so we re level set here on if there is downside risk to the volume due to ns6 how much is the offset of your content tom linebarger chairman and chief executive officer yeah that just depends on how it goes but i guess our feeling is that to the extent we re exposed at all on revenue related to the market that ll be to our benefit in the long run we think we gain share in ns6 we think we gain content and margin in ns6 so it s we think it s a win for cummins the faster it moves that said to project does it mean we d be down x points it s really hard to say given the ways it could go but let s just say that we re ready for it to be enforced as fast as it can go that would be the best thing for us financially patrick ward chief financial officer the content would be consolidated 100 tom linebarger chairman and chief executive officer whereas the engine sales at jv versus the components 100 david raso evercore isi analyst terrific thank you rich freeland president and chief operating officer yeah thanks a lot david operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of jamie cook with credit suisse your line is open jamie cook credit suisse analyst hi good morning first question just on the guide i know you ve talked bigger picture headwinds tailwinds in terms of price cost tariff warranty incentive comp is there any way you can quantify on a basis point level just so we can understand what your assumptions are there i think your top line assumptions are reasonable i just want to know what the other puts and takes are and then my second question tom or maybe to the whole team as we think about previous downturns i think cummins has always done a very good job supporting higher trough earnings through a number of different diversification initiatives or share repo whatever as we think about 2020 and if the downturn does come what are the puts and takes we should be thinking about because as i think about this next downturn i m more concerned investment costs are going to be higher and your only lever to help support eps would be repurchase and by the way congrats pat and mark sorry tom linebarger chairman and chief executive officer great great questions jamie thank you and as you said we are having a pretty forward stance on cash flow and repurchases as we ve had in previous times like this where we think if we start to see a financial downturn ahead we will be aggressive on making sure we support our stock and we re in a good position to do that and our cash flow will be strong i think just let me break the two questions up i ll have mark go through the detail that you asked about i think he can do a good job of explaining that and then maybe i ll have rich talk a little bit about how we re posturing the company to approach a time when business is strong but maybe over the horizon looks like a downturn so mark we ll start with you jamie cook credit suisse analyst great thank you mark smith vice president of financial operations okay so pricing s gonna be about 80 basis points plus and variable compensation 40 warranty 140 then we get to the less exciting part with all those tariffs takes about 50 basis points level markets 40 which if you combine the pricing level markets and tariff gm that leaves you about neutral on all of those and then slight tick up in research and a slight tick down in jv earnings as the balance is china markets we model currently we ll be a little bit low and those are the moving parts rich freeland president and chief operating officer okay and just a little comment on how we think about the cycles jamie internally we talk about the mantra is you embrace the cycles ok you win the upturn you win the downturn which means that you have improved earnings at the trough and you have improved earnings at the peak and so we re committed to that you can imagine we ve had a good run in a lot of our markets many of them are above replacement cycle we have plans ready for a downturn so we ll do what we always do which we ll flex down quickly when we see that s coming we already have plans in place to do that we ll also look to structurally change the company through the downturn some things you can t do when things are going fast on how we just change the way we structurally do business so we have those things that we re thinking about and then we ll continue to invest in growth areas through the downturn when others don t so we get a strong balance sheet so we try to do these three combinations and when we come out of this thing we come out stronger each time so we re committed to continually improving we commit to 25 decremental margins through the downturn and we ll do that again and then maybe i ll turn to tom just a little bit for a balance sheet and share repurchase how we think about that tom linebarger chairman and chief executive officer yeah and again we will continue to generate strong cash flow throughout the period and so that will manage that through of course making sure that we don t spend more capital than we need to and you saw we re watching that now as we see things level out and maybe heading down and we ll continue to step up share purchases where we think we don t need as much cash flow to invest so those things are the things you ve heard from us before and i think what we re trying to do is make sure each time we approach this we capture the things that worked well in the previous downturn improve the things that didn t work as well as we liked and the leadership team is already having significant discussions about that as we enter 2019 so our plan this year has steps is already taking steps and anticipating this thing turning back down at some point again we don t know when as my conversation with david outlined but we know it s coming jamie cook credit suisse analyst okay congrats again pat and mark pat i m sure you ll miss these earnings calls thanks patrick ward chief financial officer thanks jamie operator thank you our next question comes from the line of andy casey with wells fargo securities your line is open andrew casey wells fargo securities analyst thanks congrats pat and mark tough act to follow there after jamie s comment first a clarification on the segment reporting basis were the 58 million marked down in mark to market recorded in eliminations patrick ward chief financial officer 24 million in eliminations andy 16 million in the engine business and then the balance evenly distributed across distribution power systems and components andrew casey wells fargo securities analyst okay tom linebarger chairman and chief executive officer and the reason that some get distributed is we took the electronic logging device right off as a corporate cost and then we allocate across the businesses right that s why it ends up that way spread across it wasn t that those businesses had anything to do with it it just got allocated as part of corporate expense andrew casey wells fargo securities analyst okay that s helpful thank you and then just a on china truck you answered a lot of it with respect to david s question but are you looking for the full year drop to be driven mostly by the first half with flattish performance in the second half mark smith vice president of financial operations say that again tom linebarger chairman and chief executive officer on china truck do we have a view about this quarter to quarter seasonality view mark smith vice president of financial operations yep still the same seasonality with the second half tom linebarger chairman and chief executive officer yeah the second half weakness really is driven by this ns6 anticipation andy that s the part where frankly our visibility isn t so great i mean as i tried to highlight there we have a view and it s as reasoned a view as you can get but it s just gonna come down to are people s adoption rates gonna be faster or slower and i think what we re saying now is we re saying that we think they re gonna hit the tier one for these which will mean that there will be very little volume effect that s just not that many trucks purchased for that it s mostly buses and things maybe refuse vehicles so most of the trucks will remain to the old standard which means it ll kind of truck along at steady freight rates with a small decrease where we d see a significant move potentially downward is if people thought hey the ns6 standard comes in and the price goes up a fair bit and i think i ll just wait now and of course if people thought that that s gonna happen one month from now they might buy more coming up front so these are the things that are acting against each other plus a relatively weak economy all those coming together are just making it difficult to predict but right now what we ve got is a steady first half drop a little second half and that s about as best we could do sitting where we sit now andrew casey wells fargo securities analyst okay thanks tom and then one last one electrified power the expected losses in 2019 are stepping up a little bit i just wanna make sure are we still looking for that same 500 million investment that you outlined in the 17 investor day tom linebarger chairman and chief executive officer yeah no change in the overall investment plan the expense run rate you re seeing is we have a fourth quarter run rate that we re kinda running across the year so we have our team staffed up now for those milestones i talked about they are staffed they are working toward deliver we re not changing very much we re just kinda sticking to it as i mentioned these milestones are big deals we want to get those right we re not trying to get distracted by a lot of other things and so we still see that 500 million number to be ok i mean you can t predict it perfectly but it feels like the right place for us still and not too much change in what we re focused on what we re doing a lot of people are working hard though i m giving it a pretty steady picture but there s a lot of work going on to make sure that we get that batter pack where we want it and the overall electric vehicle system where we want it and so those people would be sad if i said it was all smooth they re working hard but again i think from an investment point of view you should think on the same plan on the same run rate no change andrew casey wells fargo securities analyst great and good luck again pat patrick ward chief financial officer thank you james hopkins executive director of investor relations thanks andy all right thank you everybody i appreciate your interest in

i d now like to turn the call over to nick pinchuk nick nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer thanks sara good morning everybody today i ll start with the view of our fourth quarter giving update on the environment and the trends we see take you through some of the turbulence we ve encountered and speak about the progress we ve made as usual aldo will then provide a more detailed review of the financials results for the quarter for the full year this time include a number of special non recurring legal tax and debt events that affected our as reported levels so to provide greater clarity we re going to refer to amounts excluding those onetime effects as an as adjusted number to make everything comparable from an overview level and when you look through it all snap on did see external turbulence in a number of areas but we offset those challenges by and large and made but i think it s recognizable progress we saw disparity from group to group and within each group but overall we re encouraged by our position for going forward fourth quarter sales of 952 5 million as reported were down 2 3 including 17 1 million or 180 basis point impact from unfavorable foreign currency much different than the beginning of the year organic sales were about flat down 0 6 generally shortfalls in the oem dealership arena and in our international franchise businesses including the uk we re about to offset by gains in critical industries our asia pacific region and the beginning growth in the us van channel from an earnings perspective our opco operating income for the quarter including the onetime benefit from a legal settlement and an offsetting impact of unfavorable foreign currency effects was 182 1 million increasing 15 3 compared to last year which were also included legal impacts oi margin for the quarter as reported was 19 1 up 290 basis points on an as adjusted basis excluding the non recurring items the oi margin was 18 7 compared with 19 4 in 2017 for financial services operating income of 56 1 million was up compared to last year s 54 4 million as reported oi margin including both the financial services and opco was 23 up 290 basis points the as adjusted oi margin was 22 6 compared to the as adjusted 23 1 recorded last year so we re trying to give you a comparable to comparable on this quarterly as reported eps of 3 09 was 0 85 or 37 9 above last year s on an as adjusted basis the eps was 3 03 exceeding the 2 69 from last year by 0 34 an increase of 12 6 those are the numbers now let s speak about the markets well we believe the automotive repair environment continues to be generally favorable having said that though in the areas serving vehicle oems and dealerships we have seen some pause we think that s likely associated with a multiple forecast for lower new car sales and the uncertainty that also in companies that transition from a strong vehicle industry to a more moderate sales environment based on our past experience though it s not clear how long that uncertainty continues lower new car sales can also ignite greater interest in dealership repair activity on the other hand we ve been hearing from our franchisees and from technicians and from the shop owners themselves that there s considerable optimism in the independent repair that the optimism in the independent repair shops is strong and unaffected by those the latest rounds oem forecast as you might expect so we believe vehicle repair remains a favorable place to operate for critical industries we re seeing progress significant progress strong activity in aviation and general industry in that arena for us categorization of orders can create variation from quarter to quarter but overall activity trend continues to look quite promising we do like the trajectory in critical industries it s very positive and that positive extended across fc i group including asia pacific double digit growth and at sna europe showing mixed but positive results across the continent more than offsetting the clear impact of brexit we do believe we re well positioned to confront the challenges of this particular period and to make progress along our runways for growth we re also confident that we have continuing potential on our runways for improvement snap on value creation processes safety quality customer connection innovation and rapid continuous improvement there are constant fuel for our progress especially customer connection understanding the work of professional technicians and innovation matching that insight with technology we believe i m talking about a little bit we believe our product lineup is growing stronger everyday and we keep investing to make it so because we believe in our potential so across the corporation i would characterize our markets as mixed positive with significant potential a turbulent from period to period now for the full year sales were 3 74 billion an increase of 1 5 as reported and 0 5 organically the critical industries overcoming shortfall in the vehicle oem dealership arena and relative flatness over the year in the tools group as reported opco margins for the year was 19 4 up 140 basis points excluding the onetime events the opco margin percent as adjusted was 19 3 compared with an as adjusted 19 3 for last year maintaining our profitability against the turbulence as reported earnings per share for the year was 11 87 up 24 7 and excluding the non recurring events the eps was 11 81 up 1 69 or 16 7 compared to last year s as adjusted number when we include the income from financial services of 230 1 million which rose 12 6 million in the year the consolidated operating margin for the corporation was 23 5 or an as adjusted or as adjusted 23 4 up 20 basis points that s the overview now let s talk about the individual operating groups and their fourth quarter results let s start with c i reported sales for the group including 400 000 of acquisition related volume and 9 9 million of unfavorable currency grew 2 million or 6 organic sales increased 11 5 million or 3 5 robust performances in our asia pacific operation in our specialty torque division i haven t talked about it very much before but torque is getting bigger where particularly those two are particularly encouraging beyond that sna europe the sna europe operation and the industrial division both registered low single digit growth with mixed results across the industries and the geographies sna europe recorded single digit increases in most of the core european markets that were partially offset by a double digit decline in the uk overall growth despite the well publicized uncertainty that s brexit in this time period there the industrial division also showed variation across the business up for aerospace and general industry partially offset by some softness in natural resources in military but overall showing a positive outlook c i operating income was about flat with 2017 50 8 million down about 500 000 from last year operating margin was 14 8 down 20 basis points reflecting the effect of the expansion in asia pacific and asia pacific did expand more than it expanded more than offsetting the turbulence in china by gains in other key markets particularly india but also thailand and indonesia advances that were made possible only by customer connection and innovation two of our snap on value creation processes driving new products in markets like india effective products like those in our blue point hand tool offering this year we added almost 300 new tools to the blue point lineup and it help drive those expanded sales on the subcontinent another success in india was the asian drag in imaging aligner ideal for tight spaces it s a high end imaging aligner and a compact package perfect for the really small footprints of the indian repair shops and the customers in india they seem to agree also strong in c i as i mentioned before is our specialty torque business it s making encouraging strides strong growth driven in part by widening array of new offerings developed by developed in combination with the sna europe and our specialty torque operations products like our new powerful wireless torque control unit that has been co developed by sna europe and specialty torque demand there s a demand for efficiency and autonomy across the critical markets and with that torque position the torque position is rising in importance and snap on combining our long held experience in that field with the capability of our new torque acquisitions like sturtevant richmont enrichment in norbar were poised to take advantage and you can see it in this new unit the new torque control unit is a great example it puts together snap on sna europe s industry leading ergonomic design capabilities with sturtevant richmont s wireless capabilities it also incorporates sturtevant richmont s unique din style rectangular connector accommodating a wide variety of interchangeable wrench ship allowing to engage a broad array of customers like no other product in aviation and natural resources and heavy duty and in general industry it s another timely add to snap on sna europe s lineup and it clearly matches the industry trends it s going to be a big seller now let s talk about the industrial division focused on critical industries outside the vehicle garage gains now accomplished for nine straight quarters and that trend has been driven by customer connection extending our understanding of critical work that progress the progress understanding the work can be measured in a number of new tools solutions we will offer each year well just last year we added over 5 000 new products to our critical industry lineup that s quite a few so i think you can say with we say with confidence we re rolling the snap on brand out of the garage extending to critical industries with greater strength than ever before critical industries is a favorable market environment and we re amplifying that opportunity with innovative new products aimed at solving the task of consequence that inhabit that space and the result is encouraging now let s talk about the tools group organic sales about flat up 0 4 but continued growth in the us operations up low single digit a positive that was again offset by decline in international operations including uk operating income in the quarter was 57 million comparing to 67 3 million in 2017 the oi margin was 14 a 240 basis point decrease you can see that in the recent swing to unfavorable foreign currency transaction from a positive position in the prior quarter in product mix and an increased spending to strengthen franchisees support those were all the drivers of that margin in the quarter and throughout the year however the tools group did confirm the strength and the market leading position of our van network i wasn t evident so clearly in the recent financials but it was somewhat visible in the franchisee sales gains after vans in the quarter and it was clear in the franchisee health metrics those health metrics is monitored each quarter the franchisees and the networks are strong and the position and that positivity was once again acknowledged by multiple publications all listing snap on as a franchise of choice this quarter we were once again ranked among the top franchise organizations both in the us and abroad we were again recognized by franchise business view which is latest ranking for franchisee satisfaction listed snap on as a top 50 franchise making the 12th marking the 12th consecutive year we received that award we were also ranked number 1 among all franchisees in entrepreneur magazine s 2018 list of top franchises for veterans in abroad snap on was ranked number 4 in the elite franchise magazine s top uk franchises for 2018 finishing above a number of prominent international and uk only franchises and this type of recognition reflects the fundamental strength of our franchisees and of our van business in general and it wouldn t have been achieved without continuously investing in a continuous stream of innovative new products and in 2018 we once again the tools group increased the number of hit products those 1 million sellers developed from a direct observation gains in the field one is our flex head ratcheting wrench we just launched the full complement of these powerful problem solvers the ratcheting wrenches and we ve been expanding our new line continuously and the flex head is the latest addition the flexibility of the head makes it possible to access fasteners in very difficult locations alternator brackets motor mounts serpentine belt and suspension bolts and we put that the new flex head together with snap on s durable gearing extraordinary length in low profile it all combines for industry leading strength power and accessibility it s another hit product and it makes the line of snap on ratcheting wrenches even stronger even more versatile and believe me we ve been working hard to strengthen our tool storage line up migrating some of the premium options like power drawer and speed organizers ph with midrange equipping our heavy duty shop with some of the advanced options like ac outlets and usb ports and introducing our kmp1422 the mid tier with high capacity and small footprint and this past quarter we introduced our new flip color schemes creating boxes at shift colors under different conditions and viewing angles three different patterns with three distinct color ships burgundy to bronze blue to purple to orange and grey to blue to gold they re brand new but they re catching attention and selling well the tools group may be below the growth trend but we keep investing we keep building its strength with new product and network vitality and it s starting to bring the us channel back to its growth trajectory well that s the tools group now let s move to rs i volume in the fourth quarter was 339 9 million down organically 3 5 primarily because of high single digit decreases and our business is focused on vehicle oems and the dealerships a turbulent it s a turbulent period in that lumpy project driven sector rs i operating earnings of 87 4 million decreased 2 8 million including 1 3 million of unfavorable foreign currency oi margin was strong 25 7 up 40 basis points from last year with growth in innovative software and information products driving that progress along those lines our mitchell1 division providing software to independent shops continues to pursue customer connection and innovation bringing great new products to improve shop efficiency an example as an example we just added our adas quick link to the mitchell lineup the new advanced driver assistance system or adas helps technicians diagnose repair and calibrate a variety of driver assist functions making the required repair information component locations wiring diagrams repair procedures and recalibration processes all available with ease with incredible ease and it offers data on products for all oem brands so it creates that date at the fingertips of the technicians for all oem brand our adas quick link is unique in the industry and it clearly drives shop and technicians productivity it makes the repair of lane departure warnings of that s of cruise control and other driver assist and other driver assist much easier it s already received and it will be quite popular in days ahead another example of how snap on value creation is authoring that continues upward trend at mitchell1 we keep driving to expand rs i position with repair shop owners and managers offering more new products to sell developed by the value our value creation processes or added by a strategic and coherent acquisitions and we re confident into winning formula well that s our quarter opco organic sales decreased 0 6 about flat to last year significant positives in the critical space that is c i favorable trends in the industrial business gains in india thailand and indonesia overcoming to china turbulence and the ongoing return of the us van channel to growth the impacts of near uncertainty transition to lower auto sales and a turbulence of brexit about offset by those positive gains oi margin as adjusted 18 7 down 70 basis points still strong but impacted by the shortfall in the van channel the unfavorable flip in the currency and the spending strengthening our us van channel and overall as adjusted eps of 3 03 up 12 6 that s our quarter now i ll turn the call over to aldo aldo aldo j pagliari senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer thanks nick our consolidated operating results are summarized on slide 6 net sales of 952 5 million in the quarter were down 2 3 reflecting a 0 6 organic sales decline 0 4 million of acquisition related sales and 17 1 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation the organic sales decrease this quarter principally reflected low single digit declines in sales to repair shop owners and managers in the repair systems and information segment largely offset by a low single digit growth in the commercial and industrial segment sales in the snap on tools segment were essentially flat but reflected low single digit gains in the us franchise operations consolidated gross margin of 48 grew 20 basis points primarily due to savings from rci initiatives partially offset by higher material and other costs the operating expense margin of 28 9 reflected 40 basis points of benefit from the 4 3 million legal settlement nick referred to earlier this compares to an operating expense margin of 31 6 last year which included 320 basis points of negative effect associated with a 30 9 million legal charge incurred during q4 of 2017 operating earnings before financial services of 182 1 million or 19 1 of sales compares to 158 million or 16 2 of sales in q4 2017 excluding the effects of the legal items in both years as adjusted operating margin before financial services of 18 7 compared to 19 4 last year financial services revenue of 82 7 million and operating earnings of 56 1 million increased 2 8 million and 1 7 million respectively from 2017 consolidated operating earnings of 238 2 million or 23 of revenues including 4 5 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to 212 4 million or 20 1 of revenues a year ago excluding the effects of the legal items in both years as adjusted operating margin of 22 6 compared to 23 1 last year our fourth quarter effective income tax rate of 22 compared to 33 last year our q4 2017 rate was reduced by 120 basis points as a result of the legal charge recorded in that period but it was increased by 360 basis points as a result of the 7 million charge related to the implementation of the new tax legislation in the us excluding both the legal and tax charges the effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2017 as adjusted was 30 6 finally net earnings on a reported basis of 175 million or 3 09 per share including a 0 06 unfavorable impact associated with foreign currency compared to 129 5 million or 2 24 per share a year ago excluding 0 06 per share for the legal settlement adjusted earnings per share were 3 03 up 12 6 compared to q4 2017 adjusted earnings per share of 2 69 which excluded the legal and tax charges last year now let s turn to our segment results starting with c i group on slide 7 sales of 343 7 million in the quarter increased 0 6 reflecting a 3 5 organic sales gain and 0 4 million of acquisition related sales partially offset by 9 9 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation the organic increase included a double digit gain in sales in both our asia pacific operations and specialty tools business as well as a low single digit gains in our european based hand tools business and in sales to customers in critical industries asia benefited from a strong sales performance in india and across southeast asia more than overcoming lower sales in china within the critical industries continued strength in sales into the aerospace segment as well as in general industry more than offset software sales to the military and natural resources gross margin of 38 5 decreased 80 basis points primarily due to this higher sales volumes of lower gross margin products principally in asia pacific as well as higher material and other cost partially offset by savings from rci initiatives the operating expense margin of 23 7 improved 60 basis points primarily as a result of sales volume leverage operating earnings for the c i segment of 50 8 million decreased 1 and the operating margin of 14 8 decreased 20 basis points from 15 in 2017 turning now to slide 8 sales in the snap on tools group of 407 4 million decreased 0 4 reflecting a 0 4 organic sales increase more than offset by 3 4 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation the organic sales change includes a low single digit increase in the us partially offset by a low single digit decline internationally gross margin of 40 2 decreased 120 basis points year over year primarily due to increased sales of lower gross margin products as well as 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects and higher material and other costs the operating expense margin of 26 2 increased to 120 basis points year over year primarily due to higher cost including efforts to provide greater levels of field marketing and technical support for our franchisees operating earnings for the snap on tools group of 57 million decreased 15 3 and the operating margin of 14 compared to 16 4 in 2017 turning to the rs i group shown on slide 9 sales of 339 9 million decreased 4 7 reflecting a 3 5 organic sales decline and 4 7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation the lower organic sales reflects a high single digit decline in sales to oem dealerships and a low single digit decrease in sales of undercar equipment gross margin of 47 5 improved 210 basis points primarily as a result of the shift in sales that included reduced volumes within our oem facilitation programs which typically feature lower gross margin products gross margin also benefited from rci the operating expense margin of 21 8 increased to 170 basis points year over year primarily due to the effect of lower oem facilitation sales volumes and higher other costs operating earnings for the rs i group of 87 4 million decreased 3 1 from prior year levels however the operating margin of 25 7 improved 40 basis points from last year now turning to slide 10 operating earnings from financial services of 56 1 million on revenue of 82 7 million increased 3 1 and 3 5 respectively from a year ago fourth quarter financial services expenses of 26 6 million increased 1 1 million primarily due to a 500 000 year over year increase in provisions for losses on contract receivables and increases in other operating expenses total provision expense for finance receivables of 16 million in the fourth quarter was the same as in 2017 as a percentage of the average portfolio financial services expenses were 1 3 in both of the fourth quarters of 2018 and 2017 the average yield on finance receivables in the fourth quarter was 17 7 compared to 17 8 in 2017 driven principally by product mix and a reflective of the credit quality of customers originating loans over the past several months the respective average yield on contract receivables was 9 2 for both 2017 and 2018 total loan originations of 267 1 million increased 2 1 million or 0 8 year over year due to higher origination of contract receivables principally franchise finance while finance receivable originations were essentially flat we did see some sequential year over year improvement in the united states moving to slide 11 our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately 2 1 billion of gross financing receivables including 1 8 billion from our us operation our worldwide gross financial services portfolio grew 16 8 million in the fourth quarter as for the 60 day plus delinquency trends they are stable year over year and also reflect the seasonal increase we typically experience in q4 as it relates to extended credit or finance receivables the largest portion of the portfolio trailing 12 month net losses of 52 3 million represented 3 16 of outstandings at quarter end up 24 basis points year over year but essentially flat sequentially again this quarter further supporting continued stabilization in the portfolio s credit metric performance now turning to slide 12 cash provided by operating activities of 215 9 million in the quarter increased 22 4 million or 11 6 from comparable 2017 levels primarily reflecting higher net earnings partially offset by the settlement of the employment related litigation matter net cash used by investing activities of 60 8 million included net additions to finance receivables of 38 4 million and capital expenditures of 22 4 million net cash used by financing activities of 135 1 million included cash dividends of 53 1 million

17 million from 2017 year end including 20 8 million of unfavorable currency translation days sales outstanding of 67 days compared to 66 days of 2017 year end inventories increased 35 million including 23 2 million of unfavorable foreign currency from 2017 year end as a reminder the increase in inventory from 2017 year end included 20 9 million related to the recognition of an inventory asset associated with the adoption of asu topic 606 on revenue recognition on a trailing 12 month basis inventory turns of 2 9 compared to 3 2 at year end 2017 inventories decreased approximately 17 million from the end of the third quarter our year end cash position of 140 9 million increased 48 9 million from 2017 year end levels our net debt to capital ratio decreased to 24 5 from 27 at year end 2017 in addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations we have more than 700 million in available credit facilities as of quarter end we had 177 1 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding that concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance i ll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2019 we anticipate that capital expenditures will be in the range of 90 million to 100 million we currently anticipate that our full year 2019 effective income tax rate will be comparable to our full year 2018 effective tax rate of 24 i ll now turn the call back to nick for his closing thoughts nick nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer thanks aldo snap on fourth quarter near term turbulence the auto sales transition and associated uncertainty and the effect of brexit all of that about to offset by c i s favorable trajectory continuing favorable trajectory of c i continually extend in critical industries asia pacific progressing overcoming china s turbulence and the tools us recovery we believe strongly in our opportunities for growth and improvement that s why we re keeping increasing our customer connection and working on innovation and launching new products looking forward we see attractive opportunity and we believe we have a strong position to take advantage our position in products in an optimistic and capable van network in a growing penetration of critical industry in a building array of unique repair databases and in expanding capability in the broad markets of asia pacific all serving as an effective base for moving forward for offsetting turbulence and for achieving a positive trajectory through 2019 and beyond before i turn the call over to the operator i ll speak directly to our franchisees and associates around the world i know you more than anyone see the turbulence of the day and i know that we ve been able to prevail because of your extraordinary capability energy and dedication for your role and our progress you have my admiration and for your unfailing commitment to our team you have my thanks now i ll turn the call over to the operator operator questions and answers operator thank you ladies and gentlemen at this time we will open the floor for questions operator instructions we ll take our first question from curtis nagle with bank of america curtis nagle bank of america merrill lynch analyst good morning and thanks very much for taking the question nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer hi curtis nagle bank of america merrill lynch analyst so i guess the first one good morning nick how are you nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer fine curtis nagle bank of america merrill lynch analyst could you guys good maybe speak just a little bit more specifically about why you guys are it sounds like pretty confident that us franchise business is on a trajectory of sustaining growth after a couple of years of fairly modest results on a revenue basis nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer yeah look i think this is the thing i mean there are a lot goes in and goes out in this quarter as you can listen but the thing is if we look at our franchise business second quarter this is second quarter of positivity positive growth we re returning to positive growth and we think if you look at the sales of the van they exceeded the numbers they were now over time sales of the van generally equal our numbers but sales our sales aren t sales of the van they re sales too our sales are the sales of the franchisees than they sell to end customers the end customer sales were pretty strong in this quarter and they started to approach where we want the tools business to be so we were encouraged by that it s one data point but we re encouraged and then we saw how we came out of 2018 toward the end of the year they were positive so i think we feel good about that more than that when you talk to the franchisees they re optimistic i spent a lot of time talking to and i look at our product line i think or product line is nonpareil and stronger again stronger everyday in the franchisee degree curtis nagle bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it and then just quickly shifting to rs i i don t know if you specifically commented on this but how did the diagnostics businesses fair in and how you are looking at next year and when does the modis launch nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer yeah well first of all couple of things modis is an existing product it s not a launch it s sold very well in the quarter the diagnostics business diagnostics sales primarily to the tools group the tools group sales of diagnostics were up year over year it was a less rich mix which is one of the product mix problems associated with tools group margins but modis and solus are sold very well through in diagnostic in terms of the tools group if you signal back to the rs i business itself there is the sales for the tools group were less than last year but that just had to do with the inventory adjustments between the tools group and rs i i would suggest that diagnostics had a pretty robust selling period in this quarter if you look at repair systems and information we usually how we described that is the repair systems and information sold independent shops at fairly positive and they re good margin drivers for rs i which is part of the reason why you see rs i 25 7 up 40 basis points curtis nagle bank of america merrill lynch analyst and then how you think about this year nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer i feel i kind of like our product line when i see it coming out i like the momentum in this year so quarter to quarter you can one of the things you ll find as you follow us over time it can t really hang yourself in any one quarter in terms of products as you break it down by product but we like our diagnostic offering they are better than anything in the market and it s only getting stronger in providing more options for customers for technicians and no one can match them and we have enhancements coming in the next year curtis nagle bank of america merrill lynch analyst all right thanks very much i appreciate it nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer okay operator we ll take our next question from christopher glynn with oppenheimer christopher d glynn oppenheimer co inc analyst thank you good morning can you hear me nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer yeah sure good morning christopher d glynn oppenheimer co inc analyst okay great hey so at c i the 3 5 organic was particularly striking on the comparison you re up 10 last year so that s i m just wondering if that equates as comparisons normalize to increase the organic confidence and ability and visibility for c i as you contemplate 2019 nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer actually 3 5 was nice i mean i think if you look at over five c i is one of those businesses which tends to be more variable in terms of the even though it s got positive trajectory our c i has grown take a look at our industrial business it s grown over the last five quarters like at 7 7 or 8 organically but quarter by quarter it s been all over the map mid teens and some low single digits because of the categorization of those orders that was a basis of my comment so we thought this quarter was nice we had great order activity we did well in aviation and other places but in general industry but we it wasn t as strong as some other quarters so this was kind of a little bit of a flat period for c i it s still was a good if you look at the overall trajectory it was very strong christopher d glynn oppenheimer co inc analyst okay yeah i thought multiple speaker nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer so i guess the other way to say that is we have expect positive expectations around c i christopher d glynn oppenheimer co inc analyst okay and then for sot between mix and investment margins were down quite a bit there i m just wondering how we think about the margin run rates currently that you experience for the full year 2018 nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer we don t think we sorry sorry go ahead sorry christopher d glynn oppenheimer co inc analyst yeah and just if there are any kind of sustained headwinds if we should expect a little continued pressure there nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer the currency is going to be the currency flipped on us they had 40 basis points of good news last quarter in currency that flipped to negative this quarter so part of the problem i usually don t mention currency but part of the problem is that flip you can t necessarily adjust in pricing and other things that quickly and so it was kind of an unusual flip for us we usually don t see it that quick we ll see continuing pressure but we ll learn we ll deal with that in terms of market pricing and so on in rci and so on you re going to see some pressure on material costs when that heats up some of our rci but we have rci against those the margin mix i think was more or less kind of a phenomena that is hard to forecast but this was a particularly low point of the quarter fundamentally last year you were selling you were pounding zeus into the marketplace diagnostics our highest priced diagnostic unit great margins this time we were pounding the we re pushing the non intelligent diagnostic portion of our lineup the modis and the solus so those are lower margins that was pretty must what drove that i wouldn t expect that to continue in that kind of level going forward so i suppose that s a long way of explaining why we thought this was kind of a lower point christopher d glynn oppenheimer co inc analyst got it thank you aldo j pagliari senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer sure operator thank you we ll take our next question from david macgregor david sutherland macgregor longbow research llc analyst nick i guess i m just looking at the relatively flat tool segment organic growth in both 3q and 4q and wondering why do you think the conversion of sfc orders were so disappointing and i guess overall now what kind of order order growth did you see from the 2019 regional kickoffs and any reason to believe you ll see it to be a better conversion rate on those orders than you did on the sfc orders nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer look i think we have said to look out from home that you can t really get sale from the sfc the sfc orders are up and they were up that s an encouraging event and part of it is i tell you the sales of the van have been pretty good so i kind of feel ok about that i think if you look at the us we feel even though the numbers aren t quite showing it yet we see the us making progress the thing that has bedeviled the tools group and these is the on look for effect of brexit on the uk and some softness internationally but it really has offset any kind of gain we see in the us and i think the us gain is somewhat muted compared to what the franchisees are seeing so i feel ok about that i don t think i think the sfc kind of did its job david sutherland macgregor longbow research llc analyst and the regional kickoffs your thoughts there nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer regional kickoffs if you look at the orders that are aren t coming out the original kickoffs into the first quarter they look pretty good so i feel ok about that of course there are always ups and downs when you go from region to region to region and from franchisee to franchisee but i think when we look at the effect and what we ve tried to do was bring the effect closer to those events as we did as you know we in the sfc and that seems to have worked some in the regional kickoffs as well as the sfc david sutherland macgregor longbow research llc analyst you ve got the lower inventory turns even adjusted for the 20 million year over year i guess do you feel like your over inventory right now in big ticket merchandise or just what s the makeup of that nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer no i wouldn t say we re over inventoried in big ticket merchandise i would say that we re adding a lot of tools we added 5 000 different line items for industrial last year so we ll keep adding the tools but now you could say ok we re not getting all sales we want but if you look at the trajectory of our businesses if you look at near term maybe you can getting twist but if you look at the trajectory of the tools group over a five six years you ll see that it s more than 5 if you look at the trajectory of c i it s a little bit below where we wanted to be if you look at rs i it is where we want it to be so you get those trajectories i don t think while we re working on the quarter to quarter we think we see the long term good and adding the number of products is part of that strategy and we see it working over time david sutherland macgregor longbow research llc analyst okay just a second question you d referenced the increase of 500 000 of provision for contract receivables can you what can you say right now about current trends in franchisee credit when you called out the franchisee health metrics i guess what would you say as being the most bullish of the franchisees aldo j pagliari senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer david it s aldo the contract receivable provision largely reflects the leased equipment into garages the franchisee health metrics have been steady and we experienced historically very very low losses on the franchise portion of that so because it come off of a little base it just you can get noise one quarter to a next when the k comes out you guys get to see in about a week but you ll see on a full year basis the provisions for contract receivable is actually lower on a full year basis so you just get some noise quarter to quarter but in this quarter mostly adjustment relates to leased equipment to garages david sutherland macgregor longbow research llc analyst are you comfortable with current trends in franchisee credit are you seeing any inflections there that multiple speakers aldo j pagliari senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer certainly i am comfortable i m certainly very comfortable nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer we are comfortable david sutherland macgregor longbow research llc analyst yeah you re not seeing any inflections nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer no we re not seeing any inflections aldo j pagliari senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer none nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer in fact if anything i think it s getting better so i mean i don t know multiple speakers yeah sure operator thank you we ll take our next question from david leiker with baird joseph d vruwink robert w baird co incorporated analyst good morning this is joe vruwink for david nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer yes joe joseph d vruwink robert w baird co incorporated analyst i wanted to drill in to tools group margin a bit more so i understand the dynamic with diagnostic product category can you talk about power tool s growth in the quarter and then was that subject additional tariffs pressures at all in the quarter nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer power tools had some tariff pressure in the quarter but its growth it was i wouldn t call it a factor in the quarter power tools except that power tools was one of the places that didn t grow in the quarter in the tools group so power tools didn t have a particularly robust quarter it had a pretty good quarter last quarter so we kind of didn t read anything into that but it didn t have particular growth so it wasn t if you re looking for the tariffs effect of that i wouldn t call that a factor here the factors are the ones i called out the flip if you look at the currency around the pound and the canadian dollar and so on where they went in the last quarter and particularly the end of the last quarter you can see that motion and so we just didn t maybe we should have been better at it but we didn t get our order quickly enough and so that 40 basis point to 20 basis point flip was the top one on them and then they do spin we want to spin them by the way we think that s paying off when you see the sales of the van and then if you look at the margins the product mix it was a particularly weak product mix compared to the zeus in the last quarter that s the way it played out and so yes you re rightly pointing out that that was a arithmetically that was a dominant number joseph d vruwink robert w baird co incorporated analyst and then on the franchisee support initiatives i understand those are going on all the time but they typically don t get called out in the quarterly deck so was it a larger than normal investment in the quarter and if that s the case why now nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer lt s somewhat larger but the thing is part of it is that we remember i said that i wouldn t say it s like what i would call a singularity in the quarter in this quarter but remember when you got when you have your intelligent diagnostics and we have more of these i would say more complex product offerings around the new hand tools around flex head ratchetings around the fdx the hand tools around flank drive extra and around the intelligent diagnostic you understand we made a conscious decision that we have to spend more time helping our franchisees communicate the value of those to the marketplace so that s been growing a little bit and we see the payoffs though i m telling you we think we see the payoffs i think the i like the sales of the van this quarter so i feel ok about that now if this is as you say arithmetically dominant you pointed out arithmetically dominating is that margin shortfall but part of it is that but also the margins the product mix is a big thing in that and the reversal on the currency and then of course yeah you have some tariffs and some materials eating up some of our rci joseph d vruwink robert w baird co incorporated analyst and i think snap on has a pretty good track record of making these corporate investments when you see a growth opportunity i m thinking about the rock n roll cabs and the techno vans and some of the early cycle studying the franchisees and increasing their productivity all of those investments ultimately drove inorganic growth improvement is what we re seeing this quarter calling out the investment and the technical skills sort of with your franchisees are better positioned to sell diagnostics would you expect that drives an acceleration in diagnostic growth during 2019 nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer i would expect it would drive a riching of our mix around software which it s doing and presumably a robust diagnostic sales but also robust hand tools sales and hand tools were nicely were nice in the quarter so i feel positive about that it s harder to it s not as easy as the rock n roll cabs because the rock n roll cabs was very palatable anyway we re pretty positive about the quarter if joe if the uk and the international businesses didn t find the problems associated with brexit this would look a lot to i think joseph d vruwink robert w baird co incorporated analyst and then my last question on rs i us auto sales have been plateauing around 70 million for four years this is probably going to be the fifth year around that level so it doesn t really seem like there is a major change in the end market outlook and yet you re getting feedback from your sales team that the oem dynamic has changed is there something else going on nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer no i don t know no i don t i think didn t ihs take down the market below 17 didn t inaudible take down the market below 17 so i think they forecasted down below 17 didn t gm announced that they re closing a bunch of plants and therefore drawing in their home i think everybody s been kind of demuring on this market a lot of very public announcements and i would suggest that that creates an aura i m not surprised at this at all i think that creates an aura of uncertainty i m not saying that this is a long term thing i think this is a shorter term thing i think we re feeling pretty good about next year in terms of projects i think eventually the shifts like gas prices when gas prices go up everybody stops driving for a couple of weeks so i think this is the same kind of thing that s how i view it now i could be wrong about this and we could be wrong but that s the way we see it the oem projects have been coming down and we see some opportunities next year so we think the effect was up but i think the it s the concern and conservatism over what s going to happen in the future joseph d vruwink robert w baird co incorporated analyst and then last question on the last question on this so even though there might be some questions around overall industry volume there are more new vehicles launching in 2019 versus 2018 and that typically is good for your facilitation business would you expect that to contribute more in 2019 versus 2018 was a down year versus 2017 does that come back for you nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer yes i think so i mean of course famous last words what i mean but yes joseph d vruwink robert w baird co incorporated analyst thank you nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer sure operator we ll take our next question from bret jordan with jefferies bret david jordan jefferies llc analyst good morning guys nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer good morning aldo j pagliari senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer hey bret bret david jordan jefferies llc analyst i guess on the tools group margin again i guess i was thinking about that franchise support spend and i guess also you talked about lower margin mix was there anything i guess either accelerate rate of promotions this quarter year over year or maybe you could talk specifically about tool storage and whether your volumes were up year over year and sequentially in that space nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer tool storage was ok tool storage volumes were up i don t think there was anything particularly special about the promotions around tool storage so i would suggest that there were special things around promotions around diagnostics and i don t think we see these things from time to time but remember what we did was we have been pushing the intelligent diagnostics the software packages the apollo and the zeus with the data packages for what three quarters and so we ve been pounding those and there are other customers who are little bit less software receptive and want to look at the non intelligent diagnostics the non enabled products that are modis and solus and so it came their time and so we pushed those and generally when you do that you do put promotions around that to get franchisee attention and give customers a reason to buy and that s what happened in this situation and the comparison to last year which was rolling out this new product zeus the best thing since sliced bread and it is it s a tough comparison bret david jordan jefferies llc analyst okay and then i guess one question on the oem side is there and this is sort of big picture but do you see the oem sort of pushing more toward an oe tool set in the sense that i guess via chrysler is now encrypting the obd port they haven t activated it yet but sort of trying to protect their software internally and are they are the oems pushing their own as opposed to outside buys now as the bigger structural trend nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer no i don t think that s a factor i don t think that s a factor for us it s always something we watch bret but i think for a dog s age they wanted to take more of the repair back but they haven t really been successful in doing that i mean this is what you re talking about in chrysler it s just the latest iteration of that effort i think we watch it carefully but i don t think it s an impact in what i m talking about what i m talking about i think is more or less that two of projects was done in the last couple of years in the last year and i think that has to do with the anticipation of uncertainty associated in the sense and the dealership themselves i mean autonation talked about restructuring i think the other day and they re talking about it that you say they talked about 40 less investment in dealerships and so you have all that stuff rolling through the industry i just think these guys are getting up every day and getting bad news for breakfast and they re pulling in their horns a little bit but that after a while they start saying wait a minute i don t have new car sales but i better get some parts and service sales bret david jordan jefferies llc analyst okay so you don t see it it s not it s just lower spending it s not a reallocation of where they are spending nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer i don t think so no we re not seeing that bret david jordan jefferies llc analyst all right thank you nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer sure great operator thank you ladies and gentlemen at this time there are no further questions in the queue i d now

financial position that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap the company believes these measures provide analysts investors and management with helpful information regarding the underlying operating performance of the company s business as they remove the impact of

more comparable measure of the underlying business additionally adjusted ebitda is a measure in the credit agreement governing our senior secured term loan facility term loan used to evaluate the company s ability to make certain investments incur additional debt and make restricted payments such as dividends and share repurchases as well as whether the company is required to make additional

financial position that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap the company believes these measures provide analysts investors and management with helpful information regarding the underlying operating performance of the company s business as they remove the impact of items that management believes are not reflective of underlying operating performance the company uses these measures to evaluate period over period performance as management believes they provide a more comparable measure of the underlying business additionally adjusted ebitda is a measure in the credit agreement governing our senior secured term loan facility term loan used to evaluate the company s ability to make certain investments incur additional debt and make restricted payments such as dividends and share repurchases as well as whether the company is required to make additional

narrowly won the presidential election last july promising to deliver economic reforms and democratic freedom after almost four decades of robert mugabe s oppressive rule but critics say the new administration has so far failed to resolve the economic woes it inherited and its security forces have launched brutal repression of the public the real issue is that is trying to reform the economy while he is maintaining an authoritarian system that is not going to work said dumisani muleya the editor of private business newspaper the zimbabwe independent he must stick to the agenda of total reform africa zimbabwe government cracks down after people protest gasoline prices zimbabwe government cracks down after people protest gasoline prices listen 3 52 3 52 one reform triggered major upheaval on jan 12 president mnangagwa announced a 150 percent increase of the price of gas saying it was needed to secure the nation s fuel supply that angered citizens already struggling with annual inflation estimated at more than 235 percent according to steve hanke an economist at johns hopkins university activists and labor unions called for a national shutdown and on jan 14 zimbabweans responded shops and businesses closed workers stayed away from work and students stayed out of school across the country protesters put stones and makeshift barricades in the streets to stop traffic within hours demonstrations escalated into violence as police tried to disperse the crowds with tear gas angered by the police clampdown people broke into stores thought to be linked to members of the ruling party the zimbabwe african national union patriotic front the looting spread from one neighborhood to another the state responded to the three day chaos with nighttime house raids by security forces henry dube a 54 year old entrepreneur was grazed by a bullet tear gassed and described being beaten by security forces the day the anti fuel price protests began he said the government was behaving like a military dictatorship the people who lead us are dictators they rule by command and everything a soldier does is by command and order he told npr after investigating the incidents the zimbabwe human rights commission concluded that the army and police instigated systematic torture of suspected looters and protesters another group the zimbabwe human rights ngo forum said the systematic and sustained nature of the violations raises fear that this is becoming a case of crimes against humanity in a series of tweets mnangagwa said that violence or misconduct by our security forces is unacceptable and warned that heads will roll in the ranks if they acted wrongly but he later dismissed condemnation of the security agents crackdown and said the use of force was justified to stop protesters from looting and destroying property the leader quickly returned from a foreign investment trip and skipped the annual world economic forum in davos switzerland to deal with the unrest on wednesday the president called for a national dialogue with his opponents but the leading opposition party the movement for democratic change alliance rejected the invitation in a statement the party listed minimum conditions the administration should fulfill for talks to begin such as releasing jailed activists and protesters and disclosing the real number of civilians killed during and following the unrest local human rights groups allege as many as 17 people have been killed while police put the number at three yet many zimbabweans are skeptical about prospects for fair dialogue the government doesn t seem to understand dialogue that s why people have resorted to strikes this situation will never be ok unless there is dialogue said dube piers pigou a senior consultant for southern africa at the international crisis group believes dialogue between the government and opposition could be a way forward but without clear demonstration of goodwill from mnangagwa toward activists in jail and in hiding there is little hope for resolution the country is polarized on multiple fronts ideally the government would commit to supporting the development and implementation of some form of national reconciliation strategy to at least start to heal these divisions pigou said for now however such a strategy is not even part of political discourse enlarge this image toggle caption zinyange auntony afp getty images zinyange auntony afp getty images pigou expects neighboring south africa could help mediate in the predicament as it has in zimbabwe s past crises many including south african opposition parties are irked that president cyril ramaphosa has not spoken out on the issue change is a faraway dream for zimbabwe because even the african leaders around us who should help are silent said dube they have adopted a system of quiet diplomacy as if they don t see what s happening here countries like south africa are letting the situation carry on as if everything is normal but it s not shops banks and factories reopened after the three day shutdown late last month but basic goods such as bread cooking oil and medicines are costly and in short supply meanwhile armed soldiers and police have set up security checkpoints in cities and are sometimes deployed to gas stations to maintain order in the long lines reports of alleged security abuse continue in the low income areas of harare and the city of bulawayo as zimbabwe sinks deeper into economic crisis the prospect of more protests against the government s austerity measures is strong which could lead to more government crackdowns this week mnangwaga reportedly accused western powers including the united states of stoking opposition and unrest in zimbabwe the u s has routinely urged zimbabwe to implement democratic reforms as a condition to dropping targeted sanctions against the government zimbabwe has been slow to change a 2002 public safety law the leadership has often used to empower the police and the military to crush revolts on aug 1 2018 soldiers fired live rounds at demonstrators in the capital who were protesting against delays in announcing the presidential election at least six people were killed and 23 injured according to a commission set up to investigate the incident before last year the standard response of the state was not the use of live ammunition and the use of the military on the street for security purposes said the international crisis group s pigou this development is deeply problematic and a reflection of the growing influence of the military in the governance of zimbabwe mnangagwa would need to take swifter measures toward meaningful political dialogue pass effective economic reform and rein in the security forces analysts say to stop tensions between the public and the state from boiling over once again journalist tendai marima reported from bulawayo zimbabwe

executive officer thanks bill good morning everyone and thanks for joining our fiscal 2019 first quarter earnings call our strong earnings and momentum from 2018 continued into our first quarter of fiscal 2019 despite most banks reporting a decline in trading revenues in the december quarter we reported a 25 increase in operating revenues from a year ago and up 9 sequentially from q4 all of our businesses recorded strong increases in transactional volumes with the only exception being fx prime brokerage all of our segments except commercial hedging showed double digit growth in both operating revenue and segment income commercial hedging had stronger transactional volume growth but reduced revenues segment income was a record in our global payments and clearing execution services segment as well as in our equity capital markets business because of increased volatility and market share we achieved an increase in pre tax income of 31 versus a year ago and up 19 sequentially from q4 net earnings were 18 2 million versus a loss of 6 9 million a year ago due to the impact of the new tax legislation in the prior year period this also represented a 16 growth in net income over the immediately preceding fourth quarter our eps was 0 94 a share and our roe was just over 14 on a trailing 12 month basis our eps is now 4 18 per share some highlights before i hand off to bill we had some noise in our numbers this quarter which i would like to highlight in our commercial hedging segment our structured product and otc business was negatively affected by approximately 11 million in unrealized mark to market losses at the end of the first quarter this was due to year end lack of liquidity which was more severe than normal this year which caused some longer dated positions to trade away from fair value these positions were directly directionally hedged as we always do and as of today the bulk of those unrealized losses reversed and we expect this will continue until these positions roll off later in the year in addition operating revenues in our precious metals business were affected by a 1 6 million unrealized mark to market loss on hedges placed against inventory carried at lower cost of market we had a similar situation in the prior quarter when we reported an unrealized mark to market loss of 1 3 million which reversed in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 on the positive side we recorded a 2 4 million bad debt recovery realized upon the final settlement of outstanding liabilities relating to the physical coal matter and also received a 2 million settlement in our favor net of legal fees which was related to the barclays last look foreign exchange class action matter the net impact of all of these items was to reduce our pre tax income for the quarter by approximately 8 2 million our core operating results excluding these items was well in excess of our target roe making this one of our better quarters to date our equity capital markets business also had a record quarter adding 20 million in operating revenues versus the prior year as we benefited from increased market share increased volatility and better revenue capture as we internalize more trading spreads dollar volume was up an impressive 75 from a year ago and revenue capture improved about 15 global payments achieved record quarterly operating revenues and record segment income which was up 27 from a year ago and up 18 consecutively this was due to an increase in both transactional volume and revenue capture this was the first time our global payments was the largest in terms of segment income over the past four quarters this business has generated an impressive 64 million in segment income with a 61 margin on operating revenues our clearing execution services segment also had a record segment income for the quarter with strong performances in futures securities clearing and voice brokerage in january we closed the acquisition we mentioned last quarter of gmp securities which brings over 2 400 institutional relationships and product capabilities focused in high yield convertibles emerging market debt and certain equities we have started integrating the two broker dealers and believe that there is a good cross sell opportunity between our rates business and gmp s business lastly on the optionsellers matter the aggregate receivable due from these clients declined modestly to 29 4 million we are continuing to aggressively pursue collection of amounts due to us we have done a detailed assessment of the collectability of visa counts and have concluded we do not have a sufficient basis to determine an allowance against these balances at this time as we move through the collection process and additional information becomes available we ll continue to evaluate the likelihood of collection and consider the need for an allowance against these amounts outstanding with that i will hand you over to bill dunaway for a more detailed discussion of our financial results bill william j dunaway chief financial officer thank you sean i ll be referring to slides and the information we have made available as part of the webcast specifically starting with slide number 3 which shows our performance over the last five fiscal quarters the chart depicts our net income earnings per share and roe over the last five quarters as shown net income in the first quarter of 2019 was 18 2 million which represents a 2 5 million improvement over the immediately preceding quarter in the prior year comparative quarter we reported a net loss of 6 9 million however in that period we recorded a charge to income tax expense related to the enactment of tax reform in the amount of 20 9 million moving onto slide number four which represents a bridge between operating revenues for the first quarter of last year to the current period operating revenues were a record 264 7 million in the current period up 52 1 million or 25 over the prior year as shown all operating segments showed revenue growth over the prior year with the exception of commercial hedging this growth was led by our securities segment which added 26 million or 60 in operating revenue versus the prior year within this segment equity capital markets had a record quarter adding 20 million in operating revenues versus the prior year as the dollar volume increased 75 in addition debt capital markets added 6 3 million in operating revenues primarily driven by an increase in interest income in our domestic business driven by higher short term interest rates which was partially offset by weaker revenues from our argentina and municipal securities businesses our clearing execution services segment added 23 million or 32 in operating revenue as compared to the prior year driven by a 14 5 million increase in exchange traded revenues as volumes increased by 57 versus the prior year also contributing to the growth in exchange traded revenues was a 4 3 million increase in interest income related to 7 growth in average client balances and higher short term interest rates also in this segment operating revenues and fx prime brokerage revenues increased 2 8 million primarily related to the class action settlement received as mentioned by sean higher interest rates drove a 2 3 million increase in correspondent clearing while independent wealth management and derivative voice brokerage each added 1 7 million in operating revenues versus the prior year operating revenues in our global payments segment added 5 1 million or 21 versus the prior year to a record 29 7 million as the number of payments increased 7 and the average revenue per payment increased 13 versus the prior year this growth was driven by increased activity from our international banking clients as well as increased activity from nongovernmental organizations physical commodities added to 3 7 million or 35 in operating revenues versus the prior year driven by a 2 4 million increase in precious metals off strong volume growth which was tempered by the 1 6 million unrealized mark to market loss sean mentioned earlier in addition physical ag energy operating revenues added 1 3 million versus the prior year finally operating revenues declined in our commercial hedging segment by 1 7 million versus the prior year to 59 8 million exchange traded volumes increased 8 and otc volumes grew by 25 versus the prior year however overall revenues declined due to the unrealized mark to market loss sean mentioned earlier exchange volumes increased as a result of increased client activity in the domestic grain markets latin american soft commodity and in our lme business otc volumes increased driven by increased client activity in energy grain and soft commodity markets in addition interest income in this business increased 83 to 7 7 million driven by short term rates and a 14 increase in average client equity to 1 billion the net decline in unallocated overhead operating revenues includes the 2 2 million loss on economic hedges in place against the effect of the devaluation of the argentine peso which was partially offset by revaluation gains in our debt capital markets and asset management businesses in that country the next slide number five represents a bridge from 2018 first quarter pre tax income of 18 6 million to pre tax income of 24 4 million in the current period commercial hedging segment income declined 7 8 million as a result of the decline in operating revenues i just mentioned combined with a 4 1 million increase in variable expenses and a 1 9 million increase in non variable direct expenses global payments added 4 million in segment income to a record 18 6 million while the ces segment added 7 2 million versus the prior year in addition off the back of strong gains in equity capital markets revenue somewhat tempered by higher interest expense in the debt capital markets business our securities segment added 5 million versus the prior year segment income the physical commodities segment added 4 8 million in segment income versus the prior year as a result of the increase in operating revenues combined with the 2 4 million bad debt recovery in the current period while the prior year period included a 1 million expense on bad debt on physical coal slide number 6 shows the interest in fee income on our investment of client funds and our exchange traded futures and options businesses as well as client balances held in our correspondent clearing and independent wealth management businesses as noted on this slide earnings on these balances have increased 7 1 million versus the prior year to 17 9 million as our yield on these balances has increased 76 basis points to 2 21 in the current period the bottom of this slide shows the potential annualized interest rate sensitivity which the balances held at the end of the current period have based upon an increase in short term rates at various levels as shown a 100 basis point increase in short term rate has the potential to increase our net income by 15 9 million or 0 83 per share on an annualized basis moving onto slide number 7 our quarterly financial dashboard i would just highlight a couple items of note variable expenses represented 62 9 of our total expenses for the quarter well above our average of keeping more than 50 of our total expenses variable in nature non variable expenses which are made up of both fixed expenses and bad debt expense increased 2 1 million excluding a 3 3 million positive swing in bad debt expense versus the prior year non variable expenses increased 5 4 million primarily driven by higher trade systems and market data costs non trading technology costs and non variable compensation and benefits we reported net income of 18 2 million in the first quarter for a 14 1 return on equity slightly below our stated target of 15 finally in closing out the review of the quarterly results our average revenue per employee increased 16 to 616 000 on an annualized basis and our book value per share increased 4 08 to close out the quarter at 27 64 per share we did not repurchase any of our common stock during the first quarter with that i would like to turn it back to sean to wrap up sean m o connor chief executive officer unlike many of our competitors and banks we recorded one of our best quarters in terms of core operating performance our model allows us to offer a wide range of products and capabilities to our clients making us more relevant to each client and in turn making each client more valuable to us with more diversified and predictable revenues furthermore unlike more narrowly focused firms we can leverage our central infrastructure and capital across many different business lines creating operational leverage and producing better returns on capital this business model offering our clients vertically integrated execution and clearing in all major asset classes is being validated both through our increased market share as well as through our financial performance which we believe is best in class we believe that this is a winning formula for both our clients and our investors with that i d like to turn it back to the operator and open up for a question and answer session operator questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions first question comes from paul dwyer from punch associates your line is now open paul dwyer punch associates analyst hey good morning guys sean m o connor chief executive officer hey paul paul dwyer punch associates analyst to start maybe can we talk about your ability to drive operating leverage on the unallocated cost relative to segment income and just kind of how you think about how fast unallocated costs will grow in the future sean m o connor chief executive officer good question we are very focused on trying to keep our central overhead cost increases well below the rate at which our segment income grows i mean that s what causes our operational leverage and to do that what we are working on is really two things to more tightly integrate our offerings systems wise and support wise to try and eliminate costs and create synergies so for example we ve acquired a lot of businesses over time we don t want to have a separate accounting team separate credit team separate compliance teams we re trying to sort of centralize those things and then the second thing we re doing which is probably costing us money in the short term is we need to build a much more scalable infrastructure so that and this is our objective is that every incremental transaction really cost us close to zero and at the moment we are trying to drive that through technology so if you look probably over the last three years or four years we ve had pretty substantial uplifts in our technology spend as we re trying to achieve that and we re not trying to do it sort of in a big bang approach i think that could be highly detrimental people who try to sort of introduce enterprisewide systems normally fail but we re spending a lot of money on trying to get to a more scalable infrastructure i think we are making progress on that side and i think that cost will start to flatten and hopefully that will allow us to achieve that objective of keeping our central overhead cost growth lower than the growth in our segment income so those are two things we re trying to do is create the internal synergies where we can and organize ourselves smarter and i think we ve done a reasonably good job of that and build better technology and we re sort of three years four years in to a pretty big incremental build and i think that will be ongoing for a while but i think we re starting to see some good progress on that side did that answer your question paul paul dwyer punch associates analyst yes it does i think and then so are there costs running through this that will fall off eventually or is it more that the things will moderate sean m o connor chief executive officer yes we always think when you sort of agree to these big it uplifts in costs that maybe they ll go away i don t think actually that s realistic what i m hoping is that will flatten and those costs will allow us to create more scalable infrastructure and they will flatten in absolute terms so i wouldn t think that you should anticipate our costs reducing but if we do our jobs right our cost should flatten at some point paul dwyer punch associates analyst okay two more questions if that s all right sean m o connor chief executive officer yes sure go ahead paul dwyer punch associates analyst what do you think is a reasonable timing to have some sort of estimate for this optionsellers potential bad debt sean m o connor chief executive officer okay i obviously can t go into too much detail because we re sort of involved in litigation all around here but honestly this is going to be multiple quarters before i think we have a clearer picture we are going through a legal process that s most likely going to involve an arbitration of some sort we are filing all that paperwork now so i think toward the end of this fiscal year we should have much greater clarity i mean that s the part of this that i can tell you right now it s certainly not going to be resolved in the next three months or something i mean that s for sure paul dwyer punch associates analyst okay that s fine and then can you talk so i understand short term interest rate movement of the business and how that impacts it can you talk a little bit about how the slope of the yield curve impacts earnings sean m o connor chief executive officer well two thoughts on that so firstly we have a float and our float is pretty much sitting at the 3 month t bill rate we invest that both with banks and in t bills so that s probably a good proxy so that s sort of the bulk of our net interest carry right we have historically and if i go back three four years ago when the t bill rate was basically zero we did see an opportunity to create a ladder after two years because we were basically getting 60 70 basis points at the two year mark so we created a ladder of treasuries which just sort of rolled off and we just replaced them which allowed us to actually capture on average about 50 basis points and this is from memory i may be a little bit off but about 50 basis points when the short term rate was zero we will use the yield curve if it presents an opportunity to us i don t think we ll ever want a ladder our exposure out beyond more than say two years as you know that s kind of very flat right now so it doesn t present us an opportunity to enhance our yield over what we re getting now on the short term basis so that s kind of one part of it the second part of it is in our rates business we carry fairly large inventories in mortgage backed and other things which are hedged and are funded and they are largely funded at about the three year three month rate and obviously they earn a rate that s slightly higher honestly the hedges end up probably negating a lot of that yield curve benefit we might get but oftentimes there s just a little dip we kind of squeeze out there but i don t think it s material so if we didn t hedge those positions obviously we d be getting kind of a carry on the yield curve if there was one but honestly we don t see much of that just because we hedge everything does that answer your question paul okay paul dwyer punch associates analyst yes they do and then just last for me is kind of what the m a landscape looks like for you going forward and kind of where do you what s interesting you and where do you want to go next for acquisitions sean m o connor chief executive officer yes this is always kind of a funny conversation we have with people because as you know we ve done maybe 20 m a deals over the last sort of 10 years but we certainly don t have a list on the wall somewhere of companies we d like to buy i mean i think that s very dangerous you end up sort of falling in love with things and overpaying but what we do do is we have got ourselves known as a potential buyer that can move quickly that executes and can close transactions and as a result of that we see what s going on so we re definitely in the flow of acquisitions and just to give you some sense of it during 2018 we probably were presented with roughly 50 opportunities that we looked at we probably got pretty seriously engaged on maybe 10 and we sort of did two i think so yes we re pretty disciplined and picky we will continue that process and what we re really looking for is businesses that either bring clients or capabilities we don t have first of all and businesses we can add value to there s no point in us buying something that we can t do a lot with so we want businesses that can do better on our platform we can add value to that can cross sell to our clients whatever it is so that s sort of our basic screen and we ll keep looking so we re pretty opportunistic i would say as we fill out our offering i think there s less things that fit and you start to look at things that are maybe more duplicative and then you re sort of just thinking about cost synergies up until now we really haven t done a lot of transactions that are just driven by cost synergies but we re probably going to start to see that a little more and i think as we ve grown and become known in the market we re also seeing talent just wanting to move across to us so we ve actually recruited a lot of pretty senior people that are bringing with them their relationships so that s obviously another way you grow your business i mean it s almost like buying small decks of business right so that s sort of our approach we don t have any big deals in the works we don t want to sort of chase anyone we want to be nimble we want to be disciplined and we want to be patient in how we build out our business and frankly our business is doing great so we don t feel compelled or under pressure to have to do something to change our trajectory i mean we are making better returns than any of our competitors we are seeing customers onboarding with us and we re seeing talent wanting to work here so it seems like what we re doing is good and therefore we are afforded the luxury of being disciplined and i think we want to stay that way is that helpful paul paul dwyer punch associates analyst okay yes yes that s very helpful i d agree really nice quarter guys that s all i have so thanks sean we will talk again soon sean m o connor chief executive officer thanks for the questions appreciate it paul dwyer punch associates analyst yeah bye bye operator operator instructions sean m o connor chief executive officer all right operator i don t see any questions up on the list here so i think we ll call it a day so thanks everyone for participating and we will speak to you

to grow in 2018 societe generale achieved several major milestones in the implementation of the transform to grow strategic plan with the success of the majority of growth initiatives the disciplined execution of the eur 1 1 billion cost savings plan with eur 0 4 billion already achieved over the period 2017 2018 for efficiency investments of eur 0 7 billion over the same period the rigorous management of the cost of risk at 21 basis points in 2018 towards the bottom end of the expected range of 20 25 basis points the removal of financial uncertainty related to the settlement of litigation issues the refocusing of the group with eight disposals already announced resulting in an overall positive impact of around 37 basis points 2 on the cet 1 ratio representing a contribution to net income of around eur 125 million in 2018 given a geopolitical environment marked by substantial uncertainty a still low interest rate environment in the eurozone the relative performance of its businesses and improved visibility on regulatory constraints the group has adapted the execution and financial targets of its transform to grow plan in particular the group expects the revision of interest rate assumptions used in its estimates to have an impact of around eur 500 million on the group s revenues in 2020 the adaptations are aimed at a more selective capital allocation prioritising fast growing and highly profitable businesses combined with an increased ambition to reduce costs especially in global banking investor solutions they will help consolidate the cet1 target of 12 in 2020 within global banking investor solutions the group has adjusted the operational set up in global markets which will be more focused on leadership and profitable franchises in which it has competitive advantages this refocusing will result in a reduction in risk weighted assets of around eur 8 billion between now and 2020 the group will implement an additional plan to reduce costs by around eur 500 million in global banking investor solutions and is now aiming for a decline of 6 5 3 in the division s operating expenses in 2020 rather than stability the group is aiming for a rone 1 in 2020 for global banking investor solutions ranging from 11 5 to 12 5 international retail banking financial services is expected to benefit from a still favourable environment and confirm its status as a profitable growth driver the target rone 1 for these activities in 2020 is increased to 17 0 18 0 4 french retail banking has demonstrated substantial resilience with activities in line with the execution of the transformation plan given the new interest rate assumptions and the effects on revenues of the measures recently adopted by the french banking sector around eur 70 million in 2019 the outlook for french retail banking revenues is expected to improve in 2019 the target rone 1 is revised to 11 5 12 5 for 2020 finally the group is accelerating the refocusing of the regional and business portfolio taking the disposal programme target to a positive effect of 80 90 basis points on the cet1 ratio by 2020 the group s initial target being 50 60 basis points the group has confirmed the cet1 ratio target of 12 in 2020 and consolidated the capital trajectory through the implementation of additional measures rigorous control of the allocation of risk weighted assets by prioritising the most profitable activities estimated impact on the cet1 ratio limited to around 50 basis points of organic growth when adjusted for changes in group structure and at constant exchange rates in risk weighted assets in 2019 2020 reduction in risk weighted assets allocated to global markets estimated impact on the cet1 ratio of 25 basis points dynamic optimisation of the stock of risk weighted assets estimated impact on the cet1 ratio of 10 20 basis points in 2020 stepping up of the disposal programme taking the overall impact on the cet1 ratio to 80 90 basis points in 2020 vs an initial target of 50 60 basis points to date the group believes that the first time application of ifrs 16 would have a negative impact on the cet1 ratio of 5 basis points in 2019 likewise the consequences of the ecb s model review including the targeted review of internal models would have an impact of between 30 and 50 basis points in 2019 2020 in conclusion the group s financial targets for 2020 are as follows group rote 1 of between 9 10 of between rone 1 for french retail banking revised to 11 5 12 5 for revised to rone 1 for international retail banking financial services increased to 17 0 18 0 for increased to rone 1 for global banking investor solutions ranging from 11 5 to 12 5 for ranging from cet1 ratio of 12 50 payout ratio with a dividend per share of

you dave and good morning everyone let me begin with an overview on slide three the year 2018 offer plenty of challenges for o i yet it also offered the opportunity to display our improved leadership accountability new capabilities improved culture and ability to execute as a single integrated global enterprise altogether we are more resilient than ever before and this year is a clear demonstration of the ongoing success of our transformation are coming both external and internal challenges for instance coming to a year fx was projected to be a significant tailwind by mid year it had become a headwind for the full year we faced lower than expected issues as well a transportation strike in brazil a batch disruption in mexico very high trade in the u s and a soft wine season in europe further in 2018 we took a pause in effect to emphasize a large incremental asset maintenance program that retrofitted assets to new market needs and added incremental capacity to support growth in emerging markets as we said in prior earnings calls the region hit its 15 margin target exiting the year in all this focused effort has helped reset the region for a sustainable improvement trend going forward again o i is a resilient company it is a change company that can absorb this shocks meet financial commitments while investing to set up the drivers of future shareholder value creation and of course europe continued to grow year after year with three consecutive years of triple digit margin expansion europe is the region most advanced in our transformation they are showing us what is possible as we properly segment our markets clearly define where to play and how to win and execute effectively to achieve this high results we are applying integrated business planning with running to year time horizon focusing on product system costs and simplifying the organization to become faster and more effective in 2018 our total system cost efforts contributed over 30 million and we continued to optimize our footprint with a closure of the atlanta plant in the third quarter as jan will talk more about later we continue to make progress on managing our capital structure and especially capital allocation in fact we have initiated a quarterly dividend while continuing to buy back shares at our investor day we provided an overview of our strategy and key financial targets all of which remain on track over the next several years including our 2019 earnings and cash flow guidance before moving into a review of trends by region let me provide detailed insight into sales volume which might be of concern for investors as you can see on slide four one of our key takeaways today is that our sales volume growth profile is changing for the better in 2019 quite simply the year 2018 is distorted by multiples ins and outs that mask the solid foundation for our volume evolution over the next several years we have characterized the ins and outs as simple optics temporary one off items that will favorably impact 2019 and beyond and structural factors we have already addressed or we are close to concluding in early 2018 these factors taken together adversely impact 2018 sales volume by about 250 basis points first we have been shifting a large amount of volume from waco and monterrey to our jv with cbi this instantly reduces our top line while this generates an unfavorable year on year comparison effect that is lapping in the second quarter of 2019 it is the right thing to do for long term sustainable value creation which shows in a strong and ongoing equity earnings second our sales in 2018 were adversely impacted by 50 basis points from several discrete events that one repeat in 2019 examples include the great harvest in europe and brazil transportation strike and third we couldn t serve some incremental volume last year due to capacity constraints in europe and latin america we are addressing this latter point by adding incremental capacity we already installed lines in late 2018 in europe that are now fully operational and we are adding a few more lines this year also in the first half of 2019 we are reopening a plant in brazil and adding lines in columbia in mexico we are successfully increasing the productivity of existing assets and excellent and inexpensive way to effectively increase capacity serve incremental sales and reduce cost be mindful that our commercial organization has already tangible incremental volume commitments from customers i think it s also important to work through the cadence of volume gains over the course of the year in the bar chart on this slide let s focusing on the evolution of o i legacy volumes which will drive our reported revenue dynamics in the first quarter are clearly transitory this is the last quarter that transferred of o i volume into the jv impacts o i revenue from there you can really see the year on year increase taking all beginning in the second quarter again this is driven by the combination of various specific events unwinding the temporary factors from last year the additional capacity i mentioned and top line growth from customer contracts and favorable market trends in all despite a slight volume decline in the first quarter of 2019 we continue to see full year volume growth of 150 basis points a combination of core organic growth and new business from a strategic customers turning to slide five let s step back from just 2019 for the moment to recognize the strongest start we have made on our three year plan for volume growth the pie chart from investor day outlines the resources of our expected 10 increasing volume over the next three years the 150 basis points of growth in 2019 i spoke about on the prior slide is a combination of core organic growth and a strategic customer agreements again leading to a break from 2018 volume pattern we have also locked in most of the all elements that will increase our volumes over two years the capacity i mentioned that we are adding in europe and in colombia for instance is specifically to grow with a strategic customers together this will support an incremental 150 basis points of volume for o i as they ramp up over the next 6 to 12 months joint ventures will continue to be a key part of our volume story even if we only formally recognize equity earnings from them the jv with cbi is adding another furnace at the end of 2019 mainly fueled by higher sales volumes of the modelo brands and we also invested in nearly 50 interest in comegua in central america and the caribbean together incremental volumes are more than 350 basis points and i hope to share more news to you soon about a few other important opportunities that we are making a lot of progress on in all we are well on our way to lock in the 10 increasing volumes over the next several years now on slide five let s take in the full year 2019 in short we ambition higher adjusted earnings and adjusted free cash flow in the year fundamentally we are building upon investments we have made so far and still investing for future shareholder value these investments are in additional capacity cost reduction and more flexible and reliable assets in talent and capabilities like lower procurement and breakthrough innovation and technology on the capacity side we anticipate adding four new furnaces seven new machines and several line conversions in 2019 to support volume growth about half of the capacities has been added in the americas and the other half in europe and we ambition investing capital within our product system cost framework in order to continue to reduce our structural costs in warehousing and logistics energy and labor for instance remember as we mentioned at investor day the capital projects for both growth and cost reductions are expected to generate returns between 12 and 25 this volume growth plus continued benefits in our total system cost approach and a constructive price environment will push up our segment operating profit in absolute terms and boost our margins as well while jan will provide more financial details on how we see 2019 unfolding let me focus on the regional perspective let us start with europe on slide seven overall the gas container market in europe is healthy and continuing to grow at about 1 per year glass continues to be a very good fit with customer in this market that value premium products package in a sustainable substrate our customers local regional and global are very interested in our support for them to grow and the share of glass in their portfolio interest from customers and consumers is clearly on the rise and we have been adapting our operations and footprint to meet emerging trends especially to meet the higher value premium segment which is growing at mid single digits super premium grows even faster in fact for a few years now we have been building our capabilities both commercial and end to end supply chain to take advantage of these trends which manifest across all of our geographies let me pass on o i sales volumes for a moment underlying growth is good it is positive yet why europe shipments were essentially on par with prior year due to three specific issues that temporarily offset the positive translation of the growing segments in 2018 the full grade harvest in 2017 impacted 2018 glass container shipments which will rebound in 2019 due to a strong harvest confirmed in 2018 lower margin foods sales driven by mix management increases europe s margin that will lap in early 2019 and the lack of capacity to serve incremental sales in growing segments due to high capacity utilization supported by long term customer contracts we added several lines to existing furnaces in late 2018 that will supply incremental capacity across elected segments plus we are adding a few more lines this year separately we plan to build a brownfield furnace to meet increased demand for long term strategic customers growth this furnace intended to come in line in early 2020 is expected to generate a return on capital of more than 12 taking together we anticipate o i europe will generate above market growth in 2019 based on the confluence of key factors favorable market conditions incremental volume through growth of a strategic relationships and o i selectively adding capacity to meet customer demand in key segments as we mentioned at investor day these opportunities are expected to generate solid returns on invested capital at the same time we remain squarely focused on reducing the structural costs these our sustainable efforts with best in class processes practices and tools now deeply embedded in o i s dna in fact in the chart on the right you can see how europe is doing more with less net volumes having moved too much over the past few years and as we explained this is about to change so the profit expansion has really been driven by commercial efforts on price and mix management and continued benefits of total system costs as we look through year end and into 2019 and beyond we expect further gains in europe in volumes cost reduction and profitability supporting our objective of continuous margin improvement turning to americas on the slide eight fx continues to be a considerable headwind while overall market trends support low single digit volume growth over time that said 2018 was a challenging year for volume in the region most of which i have already touched on however let me walk through dynamics in the fourth quarter in particular which saw an abnormally high year on year decline in volume volumes in the fourth quarter in the u s were down around 10 5 percentage points is due to a shift in production to a jv with cbi which will begin to lap in the second quarter of 2019 5 percentage points is due to ongoing megabeer dynamics one customer to one customer harvest impacted by two hurricanes and one customer that temporarily stop purchases and is resuming normal purchases in 2019 for 2019 we anticipated return to year over year growth in the u s in the second quarter we have been focusing on our commercial and operational efforts on premium products across all categories and on securing customer growth as a result we expect broad based growth in non beer categories will overtake the current megabeer downdraft in brazil we continue to see very strong market dynamics across all categories especially in premium products in the first nine months of the year our shipments in brazil were up double digits by the third quarter though we were already straining our capacity we have been running very hard and then the brazil transportation strike preventing us from building up our inventories which only strained further as such we actually saw a year on year decline in shipments in the fourth quarter not because of the market is very healthy but because of supply chain constraints of course this is why we are presently restarted a plant in the country and leaning on our plants in the americas leveraging our integrated supply chain capabilities to meet ongoing growth in brazil even though we are still likely to be somewhat capacity constraint safe volume growth in brazil is expected to be up low single digit for the full year 2019 despite this transitory issues there were many bright spots the jv with cbi continues to perform exceptionally well the fourth furnace came in line in the first quarter of 2018 and help reach equity earnings from the jv higher year on year the fifth furnace is projected to be on line by the end of 2019 volumes in mexico were strong in the back half of 2018 driven by solid demand trends and supply through increased increasing productivity volumes grew modestly in the andean countries and the strength utilization rates this justifies the new lines we are adding there in early 2019 again volume dynamics price kept pace with cost inflation including higher freight charges and the fx impact on raw materials and energy supplies across the americas the commercial and end to end supply chain organizations are collaborating well to meet customer needs and reduced cost overall we expect the americas will generate higher sales profit and margin in 2019 and beyond let s finish the regional review with asia pacific on slide nine the region improved significantly over the course of 2018 and undertook incremental activity in the asset advancement program starting in the fourth quarter of 2017 similar to what we did in previous years in europe and the americas with very positive impact over time as expected the region exceeded 2018 with a 15 margin an improvement of over 800 basis points year on year 2019 will bring a year with much improved assets that are a better fit to market with increased productivity and increased capacity to support growth with a focus on reducing a structural costs and capitalizing on growth opportunities apac s financial profile will continue to improve we see it evolving similar to europe over time where their transformative actions have driven a steady profit increases and margin expansion for the last several years that said in the first quarter asia pacific has engineering activity consistent with the companywide rebuild program and during the first half of the year the region will be working up relatively high cost import in inventory driven by the prior year s asset activity for apac this translating to a full year 2019 with low double digit margins which we then expect to expand by 100 basis points per year for several years and now i d like to turn the call over to jan to discuss our financial review and outlook jan bertsch senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks andres turning to slide 10 i want to first remind you of our key metrics which we presented at investor day last november we ve updated the slides for 2018 actuals in short we achieved our previous commitments certainly not without some challenges and we re excited to move forward to the next phase we see 2019 as a pivotal year for the company s transformation we have momentum and are on track to achieving growth margin expansion cash generation and return cash to shareholders over this three year plan before jumping forward though let me review the eps bridges for 2018 on slide 11 beginning with the full year on the chart on the left entering the year we thought fx would be a tailwind of about 0 10 however as we look back on the full year the strengthening u s dollar led to a 0 02 headwind for earnings a 0 12 delta to expectation and that s just on translation it s even higher when considering the fx impact on cost inflation which would add another nickel or so so on a constant currency basis adjusted eps for full year 2018 was up 0 09 with half of this coming from the business and the other half from our investments and share buybacks as we look at the reconciliation for the fourth quarter on the right most of the full year commentary holds for the quarter currency was 0 01 headwind while segment operating profit was higher net interest flip to a headwind as a result of higher variable rates while the tax rate for the full year was essentially flat there was a benefit in the fourth quarter due to the favorable impact of closed audits and statute expiration moving on to cash flow on slide 12 we delivered adjusted free cash flow of 362 million right in the middle of our guidance range cash flow from operations was up 10 compared with prior year driven not only by higher segment operating profit i just mentioned but also by lower cash restructuring payments working capital in total contributed cash of 15 million in 2018 which reflects a lower impact from inventory due to softer sales at the end of the year as i anticipated on the last earnings call we gave back some of the increase in cash flow from operations through a higher level of capex activity in 2018 up about 25 million compared with prior year you may recall that we had a high level of outstanding capex payables at the end of 2017 due to activity late in the year we paid that down early in 2018 in turn the change in capex payables was larger in 2018 as reflected on the statement of cash flows still the average level of capex activity for the past two years has been about 500 million in line with our expectation that said please see the last page of the appendix for more details on that on slide 13 let me refresh the 2019 adjusted eps guidance i presented at investor day last november the temporary items didn t change which taken together with rebase adjusted earnings to just under 2 60 a share we spoke in great detail at investor day about our strategic initiatives and the benefits we expect in the coming years specifically in 2019 we expect a 150 basis points of volume growth both organic and from strategic customers andres mentioned the solid price cost dynamics structural costs will also benefit from our total systems cost initiatives and much improved asia pacific cost base regarding strategic initiatives we will see a small contribution from our nearly 50 interest in the central america jv already in the first quarter variable interest rates are high year on year and we expect a higher effective tax rate we therefore anticipate a headwind coming from non operational items in 2019 and lastly we have become more active in repurchasing shares which we expect will add 0 10 to 0 15 to eps in 2019 depending on the pace of the buyback in all we have a good line of sight to 3 per share in adjusted earnings for 2019 and while there are many moving pieces to achieve it we see about half coming from business performance and half from share buyback on the next slide let me pause on how we see eps unfolding this year because it s different than last year due to several specific reasons which i believe street estimates have not fully incorporated the chart on the left shows how three key factors are expected to flip from a headwind in the first quarter to the tailwinds in the second half of the year fx moved quite a bit in the second quarter of 2018 so it should not be a surprise that its adverse impact is mainly isolated in the first half of this year based on current fx rates of course andres already discussed volumes both production and sales which are linked he outlined our capacity ads and how we will resume year over year growth in the second quarter that s what s reflected here now let s move to the chart on the right to drill down on just the first quarter partially offsetting the downdraft from fx and volumes we see some benefit coming from ongoing total system cost savings and apac gains overall non operational items are likely to be about flat so while we see eps down a nickel or so in the first quarter on a year over year basis we have tangible reasons for our confidence of higher earnings through the rest of the year shifting back to cash generation on slide 15 we are affirming our investor day target for 2019 adjusted free cash flow at 400 million similar to our adjusted earnings we provided additional assumptions in 2019 in the appendix so i ll just touch on a few the expected increase in earnings should flow naturally into cash generation the growth opportunities will allow us to work off the excess inventories from 2018 this coupled with more focus on increasing inventory efficiency should allow inventory to become a source of cash in 2019 we are presently forecasting lower cash restructuring payments in 2019 although this is contingent upon footprint optimization and other opex reduction efforts regarding capex we expect it will again be around 500 million as discussed in detail during investor day maintenance capital will be a bit lower and strategic capital for growth and cost reduction will be a bit higher there is always some variability in cash generation fx rates have a big impact and will be assured properly pays our capex expenditure throughout the year turning to slide 16 we have borrowed another investor day slide to highlight how we are managing our debt portfolio we continue to proactively issue non u s dollar denominated debt to hedge against foreign currency fluctuations at the end of 2018 only half of our debt was denominated in u s dollars whereas it was three quarters just three years ago we are also very deliberate about the overall level of floating rate debt and again in which currencies we hold it at the end of 2018 more than half of our floating rate exposure was to euribor which has not been on the increase like libor rate regarding our overall leverage we plan to repay debt and reduce our leverage ratio in 2018 leverage was relatively flat due to investing in our shares and investments and joint ventures we are confidently working toward a level of three times leverage by year end 2021 even if our net leverage ratio may fluctuate slightly year over year on slide 17 you can see the progress we have made in reducing our pension benefit obligation on a year over year basis discount rates were up which lowered plan liabilities compared with prior year for plan asset however the relatively weak market performance in 2018 more than offset the positive effect of the discount rates resulting in an overall increase in unfunded pension liabilities that said the risk mitigation activities we ve engaged in over the past several years have cut in half the effect that we would have experienced otherwise the company has focused on annuitizations and taking the liabilities completely off our books in order to reduce our financial risk and we will continue to focus on doing more looking into 2019 based on the rate of return assumptions we expect pension expense as well as cash contributions to be relatively flat to 2018 let s review the chart on the right as i d like to highlight this occasionally to show that using eps is the gauge of our business performance does not fully reflect the underlying strength of our business fundamentals because eps is partially masked by non cash pension accounting guidelines this is the reason we continue to remind the investment community about the approximate 0 35 non cash charge in pension expense related to the amortization of actuarial loss that is weighing on our earnings throughout the year and beyond we will continue to work on reducing our pension liability so that is a smaller source of volatility on company earnings now let s turn to slide 18 and discuss another win which we ve been managing the company s risk profile over time the fundamental metrics that we monitor related to our legacy asbestos liability continues to progress in the right direction the key drivers of the company s 1958 exit from this business and the resulting declining demographic trends while o i has been actively defending these demographic trends this is not the only reason we ve seen this decline the company has long practiced risk management in this area still the environment is volatile with discrete pockets of litigation perhaps even in adjacent spaces potentially creating substantial risk as i mentioned at investor day we have been actively pursuing some of these proactive risk management strategies to protect the effect of the demographic trends we believe the combination of several developing factors including changes in the law and procedure renewed attention to dockets of older non mesothelioma cases and deteriorating litigation dynamics in specific jurisdiction have the potential to put upward pressure on claim values and volumes given the situation the company added 125 million to the accrual and implemented and accelerated disposition strategy to act as a hedge against these potential pressures for perspective the 2018 charge is within 15 of the original lifetime estimate we booked in 2015 the execution of this strategy will likely result in cash payments averaging approximately 150 million in each of the next two years they are expected to drop to the 60 million to 80 million range in 2021 and then declines consistent with historic demographically driven trend should continue based on our current assessment of the landscape we anticipate the accrual in 2021 will not be more than 250 million de risking asbestos protecting the effect of the demographic trends and managing risk in the litigation environment our areas of key focus and we will continue to take actions to protect the company from downside risk as we hope you can see from the previous few slides with a backdrop of declining legacy liabilities we view 2019 as a continuation of our practice of returning cash to shareholders and de risking the balance sheet generally speaking we anticipate that about half of our free cash flow and half of net divestiture proceeds over time will be returned to shareholders first we will be paying our dividend in fact next week the quarterly dividend is a clear sign of the board s confidence in our three year plan and as of december 31 2018 we had 550 million remaining in the share repurchase program approved by the board we expect about 200 million of that will be purchased during 2019 and the remaining through 2021 as for remaining funds we plan to allocate them among deleveraging funding strategic investments that have returns in excess of our weighted average cost of capital and repurchasing shares and now i d like to turn the call back over to andres andres lopez chief executive officer thanks jan i trust you can see that we will continue to build and what we have accomplished over the past few years not just stabilizing the business but elevated it and invest in capabilities to grow it further as i described in investor day in the next three year planning horizon there are several value platforms that will unlock shareholder value the first is grow and expand o i s readiness to leverage newly developed capabilities and translate several market trends into grounded ascribable top line growth opportunities will help us grow and expand with the strategic customers next is the structural cost improvement we believe product system cost is a best in class approach to a structural cost reduction and will contribute to our bottom line for years to come our third area of focus is sustainability even the very real global traction of sustainability o i will exert even more focus on this ph mentioned going forward we ve also made substantial progress on innovation and developing breakthrough technology the magma pilot is running well in our streator facility we are on a schedule successfully and timely clearing important milestones the progress is very encouraging exciting and has generated tangible interest by key stakeholders we will continue to provide updates in every earnings call even if we like this one and jan just mentioned capital allocation and how the risk in o i s balance sheet coupled with increasing the return of cash to shareholders will drive value to our owners for years to come now that we have completed our remarks we are happy to take your questions questions and answers operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of mark wilde from bmo capital markets your line is now open mark wilde bmo capital markets analyst good morning andres good morning jan andres lopez chief executive officer good morning mark mark wilde bmo capital markets analyst i wondered if you could just give us a little more color on sort of the volume in particular regions around the americas in the fourth quarter and what you re expecting in 19 and then also given the declines you mentioned in the u s whether you have any plans for potential footprint moves over the next year or two andres lopez chief executive officer okay so the situation in the americas is as follows we see solid demand across the region with the exception of megabeer so we continue to see the same decline rate we talked about before we already factored the current decline rates now beyond that everything else we see it quite solid now if we talk about the u s and when we look at all product categories in the market all of them are offering opportunities for growth and as you know we have been focus on those categories for three years now and we ve been adapting the footprint in those three years too and now is the moment to start joining even more the benefits of that work that we did over the last three years when you look at particular areas that are growing quite fast for us products like comegua it is growing double digit and it s been sustained so it s quite solid we re seeing a double digit growth in carbonated rtd teas too and we re seeing situations like one very important food customer that moved their product some time ago to pet coming back to glass this year 2019 so that s quite a successful story there so bottom line u s megabeer declines run rates are already reflected in forecast as we noted today other categories growth and we ve been focus on this for three years and that s why we are confident we re going to see this performance in 2019 as we move forward when we look at brazil very strong demand across all categories premium beer demand is growing really fast it s 14 of the total business in brazil at this point customer s one glass to be par of that portfolio for premium beer so they re urging us to able to supply enough for them and as we reflected in the opening remarks we were able to grow really well from q1 through q3 in brazil at double digit rates now we reached a high utilization of capacity in brazil toward the end of the year inventories were very low so what happen is we ended up moving from growth of double digit growth in the first three quarters to decline in the fourth quarter and that s why you see these fourth quarters so low for the americas because a driver of growth which has very solid demand in the country couldn t grow in that particular quarter and then u s as i explained before i can t give more color on that now brazil is going to receiving capacity as we mentioned which is going to just make this country to rebound back to growth and that s all in the plant now you see and it s low q1 in particles of that because we are deploying capacity in brazil and in colombia and that obviously cost some money but also has some ramp up and that s impacting the quarter operation when we look at mexico a very solid demand too we re seeing growth opportunities in premium product specifically beer premium tequila and nabs and we re emphasizing productivity in that country we started last year we ve been successfully increasing output and we continue to do so so that s going to help us support incremental demand this year and we will also have the production that we lost last year from keratos ph issues in 2019 so that s going to support our growth in starting in the second quarter you re going to see that we re going to have positive rates in mexico now when we look at colombia is having a very strong demand in beer premium and we are adding lines in this country too and we expect that to be operational as we go into the second quarter and third quarters so that s why we re confident we re going to have this growth impacting the americas in 2019 altogether we see single digit growth for the americas in 2019 operator your next question comes from the line of george staphos from bank of america merrill lynch george staphos bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi everyone good morning thanks for all the details and congratulations on the progress andres i wanted to take jan a step back perhaps we appreciate all the color on volume and the outlook and your confidence there if you go back a few years ago one of the mantras with owens illinois was around stability and bringing stability back to your organization both from an operating standpoint and the volume standpoint one can you comment a little bit in terms of how you feel you progress there relatedly when we look at the americas there was about 48 million negative year on year variance in operations i m assuming a lot of that was the one off stuff that you talked about on a quarter call just now but how much of that was manufacturing maybe was under your control that you could have done a better job on and hopefully we will improve on the future and then around stability when we look at cash flows in asbestos jan can you give us a bit more color in terms of why it s prudent to proactively pull these claims forward as we think about the stability in cash flow thank you andres lopez chief executive officer okay so the george when we look back we said achieving the stability in operations and volume was very important for us and i think we made very good progress it s quite solid so we re counting on that stability to build our growth that we are seeing into a future i think the work that we ve done with customers where is creating a stability in the volume side i m going to talk about the americas in a minute for the fourth quarter and the operations are more and more stable over time and obviously that s a long term effort however our stability today is significantly higher than before now what that cost is we have another chance and we had that the chance over the last couple of years to focus on building this new demand and when we were in a day we propose that we will grow 10 in the following three years and that s because we have very single opportunities very specific opportunities in a specific segment already identified that we ve been working with our customers for quite a while that we are starting to close so when i look at the position we have when we where in i day based on that stability and the growth momentum at that point in time we were confident and we were optimistic and i would tell you today even more confident and more optimistic because we made substantial progress on the agreements we needed to put in place to be able to secure the demand for the following three years now when i look at the fourth quarter the demand in the fourth quarter wasn t good and it was a disappointing quarter but it has a quite a few things in there so it s driven by the americas within the americas half of it is with the united states half of that is the transfer of that volume to the jv which is going to lap now so we won t have that issue with that comparison anymore we already have megabeer which we already know it is already factoring our forecast at the run rate we know now the other portion is those specific issues with the customers that was exposed to hurricanes that lost their demand altogether and that other customers that is stop by but is resuming purchases so two very specific issues very unfortunate but they don t define the demand pattern for us going forward and the other situation is brazil we were going very strong for the year and it become a decrease year on year for the fourth quarter all the reason for that is capacity so we need to implement capacity in brazil we already have plans for that we re making very good progress we are about to start that plant that we mentioned before and we continue to evaluate alternatives to driving a capacity up in brazil jan bertsch senior vice president and chief financial officer and george let me clarify here i think if you re talking about the operating costs in the americas that you see on i think it was slide 27 of negative 48 million costs that is cost inflation but the trade cost is relatively flat so the driver of decline is volume which andres just mentioned let me go to the second part of your question when you were talking about asbestos but before i do that i just want to mention one other thing we talked andres talked about the stability we also tried to put a lot of emphasis over the last several years in the stability of our balance sheet and whether it was renegotiating our bank credit agreement or changing our debt profile to reduce the exposure the currencies spreading out the maturities or annuitizing more pensions that we have it was all with the goal of developing a stronger balance sheet and balancing our risk reducing our risks of the company another piece of that of course is asbestos and to get into the last part of your question it s probably best if i set some context for the broader topic of asbestos to really answer your question thoroughly all of the fundamental metrics that we monitor related to our legacy asbestos liability continued to progress in the right direction i mean the key drivers of the company s 1958 exit from this business and the resulting declining demographic trends and from 1948 through 1958 this company owned an installation business that produced and sold materials containing asbestos and then in 9th april of 58 the company sold the business unit and therefore the time frame appropriately reflects the mortality of current and expected claims but it s 30 years of asbestos liability on litigation rather it shown us its volatile in many external variables outside the company s or any other asbestos defendants controls can do and will affect the litigation environment this is why another key driver of o i s progress that its long standing strategy to proactively manage emerging risk so as to protect the favorable demographic trends and one example of such a strategy would be the use of administrative claims handling agreement at our investor day last november i mentioned that a couple of these risks that were materializing such as changes in the law increases in judicial resources unfavorable jurisdictional dynamics and even new bankruptcies as you know bankruptcies by other prominent asbestos payers create additional risk for companies like ours who remain in the litigation as we have for many years when we gain more information on these risks we believe it s prudent to implement strategies to mitigate them for some of these matters accelerating the disposition of some claims is a good way to hedge against the future risks and volatility like any other type of hedge the near term cost maybe a bit higher than average but operate to prevent inflationary factors in the future that s a situation with our strategy here we ll have some higher near term costs that need to adjust our accrual to account for them but to keep a proper perspective the accrual increase like i mentioned there s about a 15 adjustment to the estimated lifetime liability recorded back in 2015 so let s also keep proper perspective on the lifetime estimate even though we ve booked a projected lifetime asbestos accrual on our balance sheet for the past three years the litigation environment continues to be active and as we ve mentioned evolving factors could develop in a way that would cause us to adjust our asbestos reserve this is why we ve long disclosed that the point estimate of the lifetime accrual could be higher importantly we think that this charge and the resulting higher payments will make over the next last couple of years to dispose of these claims is appropriate to incur now to mitigate a greater risk that may develop in the future of course we ll continue to closely monitor changes in the asbestos environment and may implement additional de risking strategies in the future to mitigate new risk before they grow as i mentioned at investor day we still anticipate that our lifetime asbestos accrual will be less than 250 million at the end of the three year period ending in 2021 and our expected annual payments in 2021 will be in the 60 million to 80 million range we anticipate and then likely continue to decline thereafter consistent with the demographic effect so i hope that helps with your question operator your next question comes from the line of chip dillon from vertical research your line is now open chip dillon vertical research partners llc analyst yes good morning and thanks again for all the details just a quick question about the asbestos situation i do know that you had a slide from investor day that talked about the potential to do the de risking accelerated payments i don t recall though or maybe i just missed this that there would likely to be an increase to the cumulative reserve which was 125 million and so my question is was that increase something that you either missed and or you maybe we just didn t that you knew was going to happen or is it something that as a result of the recent developments since november and then as you go out how high is your confidence level that we won t have to see another increase in the reserve jan bertsch senior vice president and chief financial officer okay so chip at investor day we were in the midst of executing our strategy to mitigate future risk but we hadn t finished negotiation and with much of that behind us we have more clarity about the asbestos related payments over the next few years so that s why we think about 150 million on average for the next two years before falling back to a lower level of 60 million to 80 million for the last year of our three year range and then declining thereafter makes sense and it s consistent with the demographic trends as we see them today of course we ll continue to review our asbestos accrual and liabilities on an annual basis are more frequent if we need to just like we mentioned back in 2015 and have done ever since but i hope you see this as a more aggressive way to continue to tackle this very difficult situation and to help hedge against future increases and to be able to overall reduce the risk of this company which has been a strong focus especially in the last several years operator your next question comes from the line of debbie jones from deutsche bank your line is now open debbie jones deutsche bank securities inc analyst hi good morning andres lopez chief executive officer good morning debbie jones deutsche bank securities inc analyst i have a question on your guidance for europe you re referring to modest growth to europe in the region i was just wondering if you could talk about some of the buckets that i m sure you ve got fx as a negative and volume growth has been at the positive but how should we model in the cost side of things i mean those specifically in q1 can you elaborate on the comments that you made around some of the temporary items andres lopez chief executive officer so let me just make a comment on q1 and one of the major reasons why we re seeing a number that is below prior year and that is we are installing capacity and as you would expect that comes along with the spending and we got to hire people we got to train people we got to have expenses to put the capacity in place and then we got a ramp up so that s part of what we re seeing and based from an operational perspective impacting q1 which in fact is very positive as you look at the following quarters but we got to go through that quarter to be able to get to the higher performance quarters so from an operational perspective that s what s taking place jan bertsch senior vice president and chief financial officer yes and debbie maybe i can share a few numbers with you and when we look at europe for the first quarter we see a pretty balanced price cost spread maybe slightly positive we see from a volume standpoint things pretty on track versus prior year fx looks like it s in the first quarter going to be a headwind in europe i would say 5 million 6 million or so is what we re looking at based on the january 31st rates when we compare it to last year you know you see the big movement between the euro in that comparison area but that s where i see the biggest changes overall really a relatively flat for europe in the first quarter operator your next question comes from the line of gabe hajde from wells fargo your line is now open gabe hajde wells fargo securities llc analyst yeah good morning thanks for taking the question andres lopez chief executive officer good morning gabe hajde wells fargo securities llc analyst i was wondering if you could comment at all andres just i guess bigger picture on your expectation for volume given where we are sort of in the economics like war climate any slowdown potential from any consumers or travel related spend for some of the higher end i guess liquors and stuff like that you have a sense for maybe where customer inventories are and how that could impact sales if in fact something materializes on the slowdown side andres lopez chief executive officer well at this point in time what we re seeing is across the world when we look at our end users the only segment really that chose weakness and decline is megabeer in the united states which we have fully factor when we talk with customers they continue to see a good outlook for the businesses we haven t seen any change in that regards and we continually test that we see a premium product category to be the driver of our growth going forward this is a category of products that has proved to be quite resilient even when you have some downturns and we tested that in brazil we ve been able to grow in that premium beer over the last three years or four years even though the economy was in a very bad situation i highlighted the megabeer before it s important to have in mind that even though that subsegment declines it is only 5 of the total o i volume now at the same time premium beer grows very fast in the united states and we are very well positioned to serve that segment as you know because of the jv that we have in constellation brands so in all i think demand is quite healthy around the world we haven t seen any change on that the primary focus for us right now is to be able to finalize some of the initiatives and agreements that we ve got to have in place some of them are already finalized we continue to be focused on the orders and we are focused on the execution around installing capacity which we have started last year in europe with the addition of lines and we continue this year with addition of lines in brazil in europe with the addition of capacity in colombia with increasing productivity in mexico so that s where we ve got to go right now operator your next question comes from the line of tyler langton from jpmorgan your line is now open tyler langton jp morgan analyst hey good morning thank you jan i had a question on the divestiture i think you mentioned on investor day that you expected net proceeds i think 400 million to 500 million through 2021 so could you just talk about how that process is going and what you re seeing in general andres lopez chief executive officer yes so we continue with the same expectation we identify the potential businesses that we can deal with or part of businesses that we can deal with to do that and we are just moving forward with all the steps that you would expect we got to go through so we re actively executing on that jan bertsch senior vice president and chief financial officer yes so let me just add tyler since you asked about that i think that s an important part of the conversation related to the cash for the company because we anticipate based on where we are today and in our plan to reach adjusted free cash flow of 400 million for the company this year we ve talked about asbestos being 150 million 160 million payment this year so that reduces the free cash flow of about 240 million if we just add the cash component of these divestitures on just for sake of conversation we have about 440 million available to invest in the company deleverage or return value to our shareholders and based on our plan we would take about half of that over 200 million to return value to the shareholders through a combination of a dividend which will cost us about 30 million this year and then the couple of hundred million of share buybacks that we talked about so you can clearly see the merits of kind of tying our proceeds from the divestitures with our share buyback plan it s an important component of it and we re taking a very seriously and then on the other side we have another couple of hundred million plus to pay for minority dividends about 20 million for the year and then our investments in joint ventures is specifically like our joint venture with constellation brands as well as rmbc and then the remaining component of that 150 million 170 million we will primarily use for deleveraging or strategic capital for the company that yields very solid returns on capital so there is a balanced approach of investing in the business paying down debt reducing our leverage and returning value to the shareholders operator your next question comes from the line of edlain rodriguez from ubs your line is now open edlain rodriguez ubs equity research analyst thank you good morning guys andres lopez chief executive officer good morning edlain rodriguez ubs equity research analyst just one quick one on the eps guidance i mean should we make anything about the slight change in tone from 3 plus to approximately 3 that has anything changed at all since the investor day plus or minus jan bertsch senior vice president and chief financial officer i m glad you asked that question i thought it came up several times in the commentary last evening the answer is no please don t overanalyze that when i read it several times i was actually surprised our goal is to hit that 3 handle obviously we d like to be a bit higher than 3 we are working on everything we can to be that way but we re sticking right now with our 3 a share so please don t look any deeper into the minor wording change that was made between last november and last evening in the release operator your next question comes from the line of scott gaffner from barclays capital your line is now open scott gaffner barclays capital inc analyst thanks good morning andres lopez chief executive officer good morning scott scott gaffner barclays capital inc analyst andres jan just a quick question jan going back to the thoughts on share buyback a couple of things there can you talk about in the context of de risking the balance sheet as you mentioned right 240 million of free cash flow after you subtract out the pension sorry the asbestos payment so first would be should we think about the share buyback being more weighted toward the second half once you finally finished some of these divestitures the second part being should we think about in divestitures and share buybacks being more neutral to earnings on a go forward basis and then just lastly on the capital spend in europe you said 12 return on capital for brownfield are you getting later in the cycle and seeing lower return on capital from new investments on a go forward basis thanks jan bertsch senior vice president and chief financial officer let me first talk about the share buybacks i mean we already did in january about 40 million of share buyback so we ve started this year we also have about an equivalent amount last december so you think about it that way we probably have close to 160 million more to do the balance of this year we always said that we would time it and make sure that it made sense with other demands on cash in the company including capex and everything else in the proceeds of the from our divestiture so we will continue to try to match that up saying that andres mentioned that we are on target and very clearly looking at our open land that we have available for sales as well as some other divestitures that we re looking at and so i think we are on target this year to execute that entire 200 million and i think it s a little bit premature to give you by quarter how much that is but we ll share that as we go forward and you also asked about is that more neutral to earnings going forward and we do have a program as of the end of last year of 550 million on share repurchases so if we execute 200 million of those this year you can think that we ll have a remaining balance to do through the next couple of years of our plan as well i think we have good return in excess of 12 for our brownfield in europe and it clearly adds value over time we look at each one of these opportunities that we have standing on its own as well as in conjunction with what else we re doing in the region for the company and so will continue to be very prudent and very disciplined on making decisions that make sense for the company operator your next question comes from the line of ghansham panjabi from baird your line is now open ghansham panjabi robert w baird co analyst hi good morning andres and jan andres lopez chief executive officer good morning jan bertsch senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning ghansham panjabi robert w baird co analyst good morning i guess going back to europe 3q 2018 volumes were a bit sluggish i believe relative to your initial expectation i guess the 4q 18 sort of benefit from any sort of catch up i m just trying to understand the volume increase and then related to that just looking at europe on a full year basis volumes were basically flat how are we at this point where our capacity constraint in europe from your vantage point and then just separately jan comegua how is that going to be accounted for in the p l thanks so much jan bertsch senior vice president and chief financial officer okay andres lopez chief executive officer so we started some lines some additional lines in europe late last year so they help at the very end and they re helping across the full 2019 we got a little bit of improvement in wine demand at the very end when the 2018 harvest was confirmed to be very strong that you will expect that the dynamics in the market change from that point on so we saw some improvement due to that and we continue to focus on the premium segments they have opportunity for growth so as we make capacity available we are confident we re going to see improvement in demand in europe and that s why we put in place this or we re planning to put in place this brownfield that will start operation in q1 2020 jan bertsch senior vice president and chief financial officer okay and you also asked about comegua that s a non consolidated joint venture so we ll see the equity earnings of that will be reflected in the americas segment operating profit operator your last question comes from the line of arun viswanathan from rbc capital markets your line is now open arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst hey guys good morning thanks for taking the question andres lopez chief executive officer good morning arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst just wanted to go back to the americas obviously we ve been experiencing these declines on u s last year for a while just wondering i know i think you obviously reduce that exposure do you think you kind of found a steady state on other categories where last year ph continue to decline and if so what kind of percent of the portfolio would that become and what were the other categories become thanks andres lopez chief executive officer so the megabeer in our assumptions continues to decline and continues to decline at the current run rate we re not assuming that that s going to stop anytime soon it could but is difficult to predict so our assumption is it continues to go down and as you know we ve been working on the other categories of products for three years now both commercially and from a capacity standpoint so i think we re going to see more and more opportunities materializing as we go through 2019 now we got to take into consideration the volume that we are gaining through a jv because we are in fact with larger presence of o i containers in the u s market when you put together what we sell within the u s made with u s capacity plus the jv so we think the growth of the other categories and when you consider the joint venture too it s going to have the total u s market for us growing through 2019 david johnson treasurer and vice president investor relations thank you everyone that concludes our earnings conference call please note that our first quarter conference call is currently scheduled for may 2 2019 we appreciate your ongoing interest in o i and a gentle reminder to choose glass packaging made from natural ingredients it

ebitda and adjusted eps as defined within the non gaap financial measures described below any non gaap financial measures presented are reconciled to their respective gaap equivalents management believes these non gaap financial measures are useful in assessing the ongoing operational profitability of the company s business segments and therefore allow shareholders better visibility into the company s underlying operations see non gaap financial measures described below earnings summary q1 2019 gaap eps of 0 66 per share included 0 19 per share from a gain on the sale of doble s headquarters building in watertown massachusetts partially offset by charges incurred from cost reduction actions taken in technical packaging and at doble and costs incurred to move the aircraft aerospace business from vacco to pti as described in the company s november 15 2018 earnings release the 0 19 per share was excluded when determining q1 2019 adjusted eps gaap net earnings were 17 million in q1 2019 q1 2018 gaap eps of 1 33 per share included a net tax benefit of 25 million or 1 00 per share from the implementation of the december 2017 tax cuts and jobs act u s tax reform the 1 00 per share was excluded when determining q1 2018 adjusted eps gaap net earnings were 35 million in q1 2018 q1 2019 adjusted eps of 0 47 per share exceeded management s previous guidance of 0 40 to 0 45 per share and increased 42 percent over q1 2018 adjusted eps of 0 33 per share adjusted ebitda was 28 million in q1 2019 reflecting a 14 percent increase over q1 2018 adjusted ebitda of 24 million the increases in adjusted eps and adjusted ebitda were driven by higher sales and improved operating performance within filtration usg and test operating highlight s q1 2019 sales increased 5 percent to 183 million compared to 173 million in q1 2018 on a segment basis q1 2019 filtration sales exceeded expectations and increased 10 percent from q1 2018 as commercial aerospace and navy sales increased significantly test sales also exceeded expectations and increased 10 percent driven by strong project sales domestically and in china usg sales from doble morgan schaffer and vanguard increased 4 percent while nrg s sales to renewable energy customers decreased resulting in flat usg net sales technical packaging sales decreased five percent consistent with expectations due to project timing sg a expenses decreased 3 percent in q1 2019 compared to q1 2018 as a result of the cost reduction actions taken throughout 2018 entered orders were 198 million in q1 2019 book to bill of 1 08x which resulted in an ending backlog of 398 million at december 31 2018 an increase of 15 million or 4 percent from september 30 2018 q1 2019 gaap and adjusted income tax rates were 25 5 percent and 24 8 percent respectively which were slightly higher than management s previous expectations of 24 percent the gaap effective tax rate in q1 2018 was significantly impacted by the 25 million net tax benefit recorded as a result of u s tax reform and was 33 5 percent on an adjusted basis when excluding the net tax benefit q1 2019 net cash provided by operating activities was 8 million resulting in 179 million of net debt outstanding total borrowings less cash on hand at december 31 2018 with a 1 5x leverage ratio chairman s commentary q1 2019 vic richey chairman and chief executive officer commented i m pleased with the way we started the year as q1 s operating results came in above our original expectations at most of our operating units sales earnings cash flow and entered orders all came in better than plan which enabled us to beat the top end of our adjusted eps guidance range by 0 02 per share on an adjusted basis we increased our q1 2019 earnings 44 percent over prior year driven by the strength of our filtration test and usg businesses which all contributed meaningfully to our earnings growth our packaging business came in generally as expected and i m certain that the cost reduction actions that are underway will begin to have a favorable impact in the second half of the year touching on a few highlights of our q1 performance compared to q1 2018 filtration sales increased 10 percent driven by the continued strength of our commercial aerospace and navy business test sales also increased 10 percent on the strength of its backlog and new project wins doble vanguard and morgan schaffer had solid sales and earnings growth and exceeded expectations but we continued to experience some softness in the renewable energy space despite some softness at nrg usg delivered an adjusted ebit margin of 25 percent in q1 2019 up from 19 percent in q1 2018 our entered orders were another bright spot in q1 as we booked nearly 200 million of new business and increased our backlog over 15 million from the start of the year and that is despite beating our sales forecast i believe this bodes well for meeting our commitments for the balance of the year additionally we generated a meaningful amount of cash during q1 which enabled us to continue to pay down debt and positions us well for future m a spending on the m a front we continue to evaluate and diligence a robust pipeline of opportunities in both filtration and usg and continue to work these aggressively consistent with our history we will remain prudent and committed to our disciplined approach of balancing roic and protecting our balance sheet our cost reduction actions are proceeding as planned and are on budget and on schedule i m pleased to report that we are in lease negotiations for a new doble headquarters building in marlborough i m looking forward to having all of the doble staff co located in a single customer friendly facility as i believe it will further enhance our operational efficiency and effectiveness while lowering our operating costs the move is expected to be completed by december 2019 as we look forward in 2019 we plan to build on the successes we achieved in q1 and expect to continue benefitting from our lower cost structure our solid market positions and tangible growth opportunities across the company provide us with a favorable view of the future with our goal remaining unchanged to increase long term shareholder value dividend payment the next quarterly cash dividend of 0 08 per share will be paid on april 18 2019 to stockholders of record on april 3 2019 new revenue recognition standard on october 1 2018 the company formally adopted asc topic 606 revenue from contracts with customers new revenue recognition standard using the modified retrospective method operating results for reporting periods beginning after october 1 2018 will be presented under the new revenue recognition standard while the results from prior periods will not be adjusted and will continue to be presented using our historic accounting policies this new standard will have no impact on 2019 cash flows cost reduction restructuring actions to enhance doble s roic and further improve its operating efficiency in october 2018 the company sold doble s headquarters building in watertown massachusetts to a real estate developer for approximately 18 million in cash and later in 2019 will consolidate its operations into one location in marlborough massachusetts where doble has an existing administrative facility the sale resulted in a pretax gain recognized in q1 2019 the net proceeds were used to further pay down debt and the upcoming move will improve operational efficiency by having doble s entire boston area operations co located in a single lower cost more modern facility by the end of calendar 2019 the building gain and the restructuring move costs will be excluded when calculating 2019 adjusted eps to reduce technical packaging s cost structure and increase its ebit margins the company initiated a cost reduction action in europe to close plastique s headquarters in tunbridge wells uk and consolidate its new product design and administrative functions into the remaining facilities in nottingham uk and poznan poland this move is expected to generate meaningful operating improvements and will enable plastique to be more competitive in its various end markets the shut down and move costs approximately 2 million pretax will be excluded when calculating 2019 adjusted eps additionally the company is moving vacco s aircraft aerospace business approximately 8 million in annual revenue from south el monte california and consolidating it into pti s aerospace facility in oxnard california this will enable pti to maximize its aircraft aerospace customer relationships and market expertise and utilize manufacturing floor space made available by the elimination of its automotive industrial business during 2018 while allowing vacco to concentrate on its growing navy submarine and space business these move costs approximately 1 million will also be excluded when calculating 2019 adjusted eps all of these actions are intended to improve operating efficiency generate additional free cash flow and enhance the company s competitiveness across several end markets thereby accelerating annual sales and earnings growth in the future business outlook 201 9 summarized management s expectations for 2019 remain consistent with the details outlined in the business outlook 2019 section of the november 15 2018 earnings release management continues to see meaningful organic sales adjusted ebit and adjusted ebitda growth across each of the company s business segments and anticipates growth rates in 2019 and beyond that will generally exceed the broader industrial market the organic growth described in the previous earnings release is expected to be enhanced by additional m a contributions management s focus on profitable growth increased cash flow an enhanced cost structure driving efficiency and creating competitive advantages coupled with incremental roic will be the key drivers of sustainable share price appreciation to recap management expects 2019 adjusted eps to be in the range of 2 95 to 3 05 per share reflecting meaningful organic sales and adjusted ebitda growth partially offset by the additional depreciation and amortization charges and incremental tax expense as detailed previously on a quarterly basis management expects 2019 revenues and adjusted eps to be more back half weighted with the second half of the year being stronger than the first half management expects q2 2019 adjusted eps to be in the range of 0 58 to 0 63 per share the timing of quarterly sales and

12 98 excluding restructuring acquisition and other charges net earnings and eps were 1 0 billion and 13 61 commenting on mohawk industries fourth quarter performance jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and ceo stated the period was affected by significant inflation slowing markets and lvt impacting sales of other products even as we executed price increases in many products our businesses experienced greater pressures on pricing and mix in the quarter inflation continued to be a headwind across most of our categories as higher cost materials flowed through our results during the period we decreased our manufacturing production to adapt to market demand our start up costs for the quarter were higher than we projected with lvt production improving slower than anticipated our new countertop and sheet vinyl plants initiated manufacturing along with our polish ceramic tile expansion after five consecutive years of record earnings 2018 proved more difficult than we anticipated with inflation increasing dramatically luxury vinyl tile impacting other u s flooring products and most of our markets slowing in this environment we selectively invested approximately 1 5 billion to enhance our long term performance primarily in new product categories and geographies with green field projects and acquisitions cost saving initiatives and buying back shares we are managing through current conditions while enhancing the longer term value of our business to accomplish this in 2018 we acquired leading flooring companies in australia new zealand and brazil and in europe acquired two flooring distributors and a specialized mezzanine company we entered the european porcelain slabs and carpet tile markets expanded our higher end ceramic in eastern europe and initiated sheet vinyl production in russia and quartz countertop manufacturing in the u s much of the benefit from these capital investments will be realized in 2020 and beyond as we achieve higher volume mix and productivity in the period we purchased approximately 274 million of mohawk stock reducing our share count by 2 3 million or the equivalent of 3 of outstanding shares for the quarter our global ceramic segment sales increased 4 5 as reported and 7 on a constant currency basis the segment s operating margin was approximately 9 as reported or 10 excluding other charges declining year over year due to inflation price and mix pressures and lower production partially offset by increasing productivity in north america our ceramic business increased sequentially but remained challenged due to import pressures and transportation expenses to improve our margins we have increased prices on our products to recover inflation and higher freight costs our new quartz countertop plant is manufacturing basic products as we ramp up production and optimize our processes and formulations across north america we are taking many actions to lower our costs including consolidating regional service centers and reducing headcount in mexico our new production lines in salamanca are operating well and we are focused on improving our mix and margins we have announced price increases in mexico to cover inflation and shipping costs in november we finalized the purchase of eliane in brazil eliane is an industry leader with the best brand and a premium position in one of the world s largest ceramic markets we have ordered the first phase of new equipment to enhance eliane s operations and margins following the strategy we used to dramatically improve marazzi s profitability in europe conditions softened as we went through the period with the italian economy deteriorating the most due to the political uncertainty given these conditions we experienced greater pressure on margins as competition increased we reduced production rates in the fourth quarter and are continuing to do so in the first period with the expansion of our european ceramic footprint we are increasing the specialization of our plants in italy spain poland and bulgaria to improve our competitive advantages in russia our sales and profitability increased substantially although the weaker ruble significantly reduced our translated results to enable us to grow in russia we have installed two new production lines in 2018 and we will commence production of premium sanitary ware in 2019 during the quarter our flooring north america segment s sales decreased 3 the segment s operating margin was 8 as reported and 9 on an adjusted basis impacted by inflation lower than expected volume productivity and higher start up costs in november we announced paul de cock s appointment as president of the flooring north america segment to enhance our results he has changed the management structure to improve our marketing operations and innovation of each flooring product our sales slowed as we went through the period due to softer home sales and inventory reductions by customers in some channels during the period we initiated further price increases to recover higher material and freight costs carpet was impacted by hard surface alternatives and the high cost of materials in our premium smartstrand collections we introduced our new colormax technology and expanded our patented air o unified soft flooring offering we have reinvigorated the premium laminate category through the new investments we made to produce visuals that exceed real wood with previously unachievable durability and water resistance lvt sales grew substantially during the period as we implemented our sourcing and manufacturing strategy we are offering a premium pergo lvt collection which before introduction has greater consumer brand recognition than any other lvt product in the market although we anticipated even more improvement the output of our new lvt production has increased about 20 over the prior period long term we are confident that our investment in this technology will provide us with competitive advantages when it is operating at expected levels for the quarter our flooring rest of the world segment s sales increased 12 as reported and 16 on a constant currency basis the segment s operating margin was 12 as reported and 13 on an adjusted basis due to volume growth and productivity offset by the impact of price and mix start up costs and fx as we progressed through the

the us government acknowledges that it is knowingly consciously driving the venezuelan economy into the ground but us media make no such acknowledgment which sends the message that the problems in venezuela are entirely the fault of the government the us media chorus supporting a us overthrow of the venezuelan government has for years pointed to the country s economic crisis as a justification for regime change while whitewashing the ways in which the us has strangled the venezuelan economy fair org 3 22 18 a un rapporteur declares that sanctions kill independent 1 26 19 but few in western media are listening to his message sister eugenia russian president of fundalatin a venezuelan human rights ngo that was established in 1978 and has special consultative status at the un told the independent 1 26 19 in contact with the popular communities we consider that one of the fundamental causes of the economic crisis in the country is the effect the unilateral coercive sanctions that are applied in the economy especially by the government of the united states while internal errors also contributed to the nation s problems russian said it s likely that few countries in the world have ever suffered an economic siege like the one venezuelans are living under while the new york times and the washington post have lately professed profound and definitely 100 percent sincere concern for the welfare of venezuelans neither publication has ever referred to fundalatin alfred de zayas the first un special rapporteur to visit venezuela in 21 years told the independent 1 26 19 that us canadian and european union economic warfare has killed venezuelans noting that the sanctions fall most heavily on the poorest people and demonstrably cause death through food and medicine shortages lead to violations of human rights and are aimed at coercing economic change in a sister democracy de zayas un report noted that sanctions hind the imports necessary to produce generic medicines and seeds to increase agricultural production de zayas also cited venezuelan economist pasqualina curcio who reports that the most effective strategy to disrupt the venezuelan economy has been the manipulation of the exchange rate the rapporteur went on to suggest that the international criminal court investigate economic sanctions against venezuela as possible crimes against humanity given that de zayas is the first un special rapporteur to report on venezuela in more than two decades one might expect the media to regard his findings as an important part of the venezuela narrative but his name does not appear in a single article ever published in the post the times has mentioned him once but not in relation to venezuela economist francisco rodríguez wola 9 20 18 points out that oil production in both venezuela and colombia dropped when oil prices fell in 2016 but venezuelan production plummeted when the us imposed financial sanctions in 2017 the economist francisco rodríguez points out that the sanctions the trump administration issued in august 2017 prohibited us banks from providing new financing to the venezuelan government a key part of the toxification of financial dealings with venezuela rodríguez notes that in august 2017 the us financial crimes enforcement network warned financial institutions that all venezuelan government agencies and bodies appear vulnerable to public corruption and money laundering and recommended that some transactions originating from venezuela be flagged as potentially criminal many financial institutions then closed venezuelan accounts concerned about the risk of being accused of participating in money laundering rodríguez says that this handcuffed venezuela s oil industry the sector most crucial to its economy with lost access to credit preventing the country from obtaining financial resources that could have been devoted to investment or maintenance and whereas previously the venezuelan government would raise production by signing joint venture agreements with foreign partners who would finance investment trump s sanctions effectively put an end to these loans mark weisbrot the nation 9 7 17 the trump administration has made an open and firm commitment to regime change through the destruction of an already debilitated venezuelan economy mark weisbrot the nation 9 7 17 also an economist raised a related issue if we step back and look at venezuela from a bird s eye view how does a country with 500 billion barrels of oil and hundreds of billions of dollars worth of minerals in the ground go broke the only way that can happen is if the country is cut off from the international financial system otherwise venezuela could sell or even collateralize some of its resources in order to get the necessary dollars the 7 7 billion in gold held in central bank reserves could be quickly collateralized for a loan in past years the us treasury department used its clout to make sure that banks who wanted to finance a swap such as jpmorgan chase and bank of america did not do so sanctions have kept the venezuelan government from accessing financing and dealing with its debt while hamstringing its most important industry given that us media are writing for a principally us audience the damage done by washington and its partners sanctions should be front and center in their coverage exactly the opposite is the case virginia lopez glass of the new york times 1 25 19 uses 920 words to describe the challenges facing venezuelans but sanctions isn t one of them even as she writes about matters to which as i ve shown above sanctions are directly relevant food and medicine shortages are widespread hundreds have died from malnutrition and illnesses that are easily curable with the appropriate treatment weaponizing hunger in venezuela in this manner is dishonest and misleading christina m schiavoni a doctoral researcher at the international institute of social studies in the hague and ana felicien and liccia romero both of whom are venezuelan scholars wrote in monthly review 6 1 18 on overt us aggression toward venezuela in the form of the intensifying economic sanctions imposed by the obama and trump administrations as well as an all out economic blockade that has made it extremely difficult for the government to make payments on food imports and manage its debt torture advocate bret stephens new york times 1 25 19 mocks the idea that sanctions and not socialism are responsible for venezuela s economic crisis bret stephens column in the times 1 28 19 only mentions the word sanctions to complain that the media supposedly isn t blaming socialism for the crisis in venezuela alleging that what you re likelier to read is that the crisis is the product of corruption cronyism populism authoritarianism resource dependency us sanctions and trickery even the residues of capitalism itself after dismissing the idea that the sanctions are a key part of the problems in venezuela stephens went on to advocate using them to bring about regime change in the country writing that the trump administration should enhance s political standing by providing access to funds that can help him establish an alternative government and entice wavering figures in the maduro camp to switch sides it can put venezuela on the list of state sponsors of terrorism these funds presumably refer the money that the us has seized from venezuela and adding the country to list of state sponsors of terrorism automatically entails hitting it with further sanctions the editorial board of the washington post 1 24 19 alleged that venezuela s government has subject the country s 32 million people to a humanitarian catastrophe without referring to what scholars whose research and writing focuses on latin america such as laura carlsen sujatha fernandes greg grandin francisco dominguez noam chomsky aviva chomsky gabriel hetland and venezuelan born historian miguel tinker salas describe common dreams 1 24 19 as sanctions cut off the means by which the venezuelan government could escape from its economic recession while causing a dramatic falloff in oil production and worsening the economic crisis and causing many people to die because they can t get access to life saving medicines later the editorial said that a us boycott of venezuelan oil could endanger ordinary venezuelans already coping with critical shortages of food power and medicine an absurd remark given that the sanctions they are occluding have had precisely these effects a washington post op ed 1 24 19 urges trump to ratchet up pressure on venezuela while insisting that the country has been driven into the ground by the repressive socialist policies pursued by nicolás maduro henry olsen in the post 1 24 19 wrote as if sanctions are a benign tool that can be used to usher in a brighter future for venezuelans rather than a key reason that so many of them find themselves in such a grim condition trump has many levers to pull short of military intervention to topple maduro he could use us pressure on the global financial system to cut off regime access to international banks freezing access to any secret accounts that the regime and probably its highest ranking leaders established offshore he can as sen marco rubio r fla has suggested work with american oil companies that purchase venezuelan oil to provide the profits from those purchases to accounts controlled by guaidó s national assembly he can also pressure china which has a far more valuable relationship with the united states than it does with venezuela to withdraw its support any or all of these measures would ratchet up pressure directly on the regime decreasing its ability to finance itself and buy support from security and military figures odds are that increasing financial pressure on the regime will finally bring about its collapse even if one momentarily sets aside that the sanctions are illegal under international law and violate the charter of the organization of american states and that the us has no right whatsoever to decide who governs venezuela these measures don t just ratchet up pressure on the regime they also kill and immiserate ordinary venezuelans a the post s charles lane 1 28 19 wrote apologists for the regime blame us sanctions and destabilization for venezuela s problems the truth is that with the exception of the george w bush administration s brief halfhearted support for a coup attempt in 2002 washington learning the lessons of ill fated cold war interventions has shown restraint in dealing with the caracas regime he went on to write that until the trump administration announced limitations on imports of venezuelan oil that day the united states had traded with venezuela and focused economic pressure on regime leaders and key institutions which suggests that the sanctions exclusively harm the regime again even if that were true it would still be illegal and amounts to a lie given the evidence that the sanctions are crushing the venezuelan masses unlike lane and the rest of the media s regime change choir the us government has acknowledged what it s doing to venezuela schiavoni felicien and romero point to a telling remark that a senior state department official made last year the financial sanctions we have placed on the venezuelan government has forced it to begin becoming in default both on sovereign and pdvsa its oil company s debt and what we are seeing because of the bad choices of the maduro regime is a total economic collapse in venezuela so our policy is working our strategy is working and we re going to keep it on the venezuelans thus the us government acknowledges that it is knowingly consciously driving the venezuelan economy into the ground but us media make no such acknowledgment which sends the message that the problems in venezuela are entirely the fault of the government and that the us is a neutral arbiter that wants to help venezuelans call this elision what it is war propaganda gregory shupak teaches media studies at the university of guelph humber in toronto his book the wrong story palestine israel and the media is published by or books

i d now like to turn the call over to nick pinchuk nick nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer thanks sara good morning everybody today i ll start with the view of our fourth quarter giving update on the environment and the trends we see take you through some of the turbulence we ve encountered and speak about the progress we ve made as usual aldo will then provide a more detailed review of the financials results for the quarter for the full year this time include a number of special non recurring legal tax and debt events that affected our as reported levels so to provide greater clarity we re going to refer to amounts excluding those onetime effects as an as adjusted number to make everything comparable from an overview level and when you look through it all snap on did see external turbulence in a number of areas but we offset those challenges by and large and made but i think it s recognizable progress we saw disparity from group to group and within each group but overall we re encouraged by our position for going forward fourth quarter sales of 952 5 million as reported were down 2 3 including 17 1 million or 180 basis point impact from unfavorable foreign currency much different than the beginning of the year organic sales were about flat down 0 6 generally shortfalls in the oem dealership arena and in our international franchise businesses including the uk we re about to offset by gains in critical industries our asia pacific region and the beginning growth in the us van channel from an earnings perspective our opco operating income for the quarter including the onetime benefit from a legal settlement and an offsetting impact of unfavorable foreign currency effects was 182 1 million increasing 15 3 compared to last year which were also included legal impacts oi margin for the quarter as reported was 19 1 up 290 basis points on an as adjusted basis excluding the non recurring items the oi margin was 18 7 compared with 19 4 in 2017 for financial services operating income of 56 1 million was up compared to last year s 54 4 million as reported oi margin including both the financial services and opco was 23 up 290 basis points the as adjusted oi margin was 22 6 compared to the as adjusted 23 1 recorded last year so we re trying to give you a comparable to comparable on this quarterly as reported eps of 3 09 was 0 85 or 37 9 above last year s on an as adjusted basis the eps was 3 03 exceeding the 2 69 from last year by 0 34 an increase of 12 6 those are the numbers now let s speak about the markets well we believe the automotive repair environment continues to be generally favorable having said that though in the areas serving vehicle oems and dealerships we have seen some pause we think that s likely associated with a multiple forecast for lower new car sales and the uncertainty that also in companies that transition from a strong vehicle industry to a more moderate sales environment based on our past experience though it s not clear how long that uncertainty continues lower new car sales can also ignite greater interest in dealership repair activity on the other hand we ve been hearing from our franchisees and from technicians and from the shop owners themselves that there s considerable optimism in the independent repair that the optimism in the independent repair shops is strong and unaffected by those the latest rounds oem forecast as you might expect so we believe vehicle repair remains a favorable place to operate for critical industries we re seeing progress significant progress strong activity in aviation and general industry in that arena for us categorization of orders can create variation from quarter to quarter but overall activity trend continues to look quite promising we do like the trajectory in critical industries it s very positive and that positive extended across fc i group including asia pacific double digit growth and at sna europe showing mixed but positive results across the continent more than offsetting the clear impact of brexit we do believe we re well positioned to confront the challenges of this particular period and to make progress along our runways for growth we re also confident that we have continuing potential on our runways for improvement snap on value creation processes safety quality customer connection innovation and rapid continuous improvement there are constant fuel for our progress especially customer connection understanding the work of professional technicians and innovation matching that insight with technology we believe i m talking about a little bit we believe our product lineup is growing stronger everyday and we keep investing to make it so because we believe in our potential so across the corporation i would characterize our markets as mixed positive with significant potential a turbulent from period to period now for the full year sales were 3 74 billion an increase of 1 5 as reported and 0 5 organically the critical industries overcoming shortfall in the vehicle oem dealership arena and relative flatness over the year in the tools group as reported opco margins for the year was 19 4 up 140 basis points excluding the onetime events the opco margin percent as adjusted was 19 3 compared with an as adjusted 19 3 for last year maintaining our profitability against the turbulence as reported earnings per share for the year was 11 87 up 24 7 and excluding the non recurring events the eps was 11 81 up 1 69 or 16 7 compared to last year s as adjusted number when we include the income from financial services of 230 1 million which rose 12 6 million in the year the consolidated operating margin for the corporation was 23 5 or an as adjusted or as adjusted 23 4 up 20 basis points that s the overview now let s talk about the individual operating groups and their fourth quarter results let s start with c i reported sales for the group including 400 000 of acquisition related volume and 9 9 million of unfavorable currency grew 2 million or 6 organic sales increased 11 5 million or 3 5 robust performances in our asia pacific operation in our specialty torque division i haven t talked about it very much before but torque is getting bigger where particularly those two are particularly encouraging beyond that sna europe the sna europe operation and the industrial division both registered low single digit growth with mixed results across the industries and the geographies sna europe recorded single digit increases in most of the core european markets that were partially offset by a double digit decline in the uk overall growth despite the well publicized uncertainty that s brexit in this time period there the industrial division also showed variation across the business up for aerospace and general industry partially offset by some softness in natural resources in military but overall showing a positive outlook c i operating income was about flat with 2017 50 8 million down about 500 000 from last year operating margin was 14 8 down 20 basis points reflecting the effect of the expansion in asia pacific and asia pacific did expand more than it expanded more than offsetting the turbulence in china by gains in other key markets particularly india but also thailand and indonesia advances that were made possible only by customer connection and innovation two of our snap on value creation processes driving new products in markets like india effective products like those in our blue point hand tool offering this year we added almost 300 new tools to the blue point lineup and it help drive those expanded sales on the subcontinent another success in india was the asian drag in imaging aligner ideal for tight spaces it s a high end imaging aligner and a compact package perfect for the really small footprints of the indian repair shops and the customers in india they seem to agree also strong in c i as i mentioned before is our specialty torque business it s making encouraging strides strong growth driven in part by widening array of new offerings developed by developed in combination with the sna europe and our specialty torque operations products like our new powerful wireless torque control unit that has been co developed by sna europe and specialty torque demand there s a demand for efficiency and autonomy across the critical markets and with that torque position the torque position is rising in importance and snap on combining our long held experience in that field with the capability of our new torque acquisitions like sturtevant richmont enrichment in norbar were poised to take advantage and you can see it in this new unit the new torque control unit is a great example it puts together snap on sna europe s industry leading ergonomic design capabilities with sturtevant richmont s wireless capabilities it also incorporates sturtevant richmont s unique din style rectangular connector accommodating a wide variety of interchangeable wrench ship allowing to engage a broad array of customers like no other product in aviation and natural resources and heavy duty and in general industry it s another timely add to snap on sna europe s lineup and it clearly matches the industry trends it s going to be a big seller now let s talk about the industrial division focused on critical industries outside the vehicle garage gains now accomplished for nine straight quarters and that trend has been driven by customer connection extending our understanding of critical work that progress the progress understanding the work can be measured in a number of new tools solutions we will offer each year well just last year we added over 5 000 new products to our critical industry lineup that s quite a few so i think you can say with we say with confidence we re rolling the snap on brand out of the garage extending to critical industries with greater strength than ever before critical industries is a favorable market environment and we re amplifying that opportunity with innovative new products aimed at solving the task of consequence that inhabit that space and the result is encouraging now let s talk about the tools group organic sales about flat up 0 4 but continued growth in the us operations up low single digit a positive that was again offset by decline in international operations including uk operating income in the quarter was 57 million comparing to 67 3 million in 2017 the oi margin was 14 a 240 basis point decrease you can see that in the recent swing to unfavorable foreign currency transaction from a positive position in the prior quarter in product mix and an increased spending to strengthen franchisees support those were all the drivers of that margin in the quarter and throughout the year however the tools group did confirm the strength and the market leading position of our van network i wasn t evident so clearly in the recent financials but it was somewhat visible in the franchisee sales gains after vans in the quarter and it was clear in the franchisee health metrics those health metrics is monitored each quarter the franchisees and the networks are strong and the position and that positivity was once again acknowledged by multiple publications all listing snap on as a franchise of choice this quarter we were once again ranked among the top franchise organizations both in the us and abroad we were again recognized by franchise business view which is latest ranking for franchisee satisfaction listed snap on as a top 50 franchise making the 12th marking the 12th consecutive year we received that award we were also ranked number 1 among all franchisees in entrepreneur magazine s 2018 list of top franchises for veterans in abroad snap on was ranked number 4 in the elite franchise magazine s top uk franchises for 2018 finishing above a number of prominent international and uk only franchises and this type of recognition reflects the fundamental strength of our franchisees and of our van business in general and it wouldn t have been achieved without continuously investing in a continuous stream of innovative new products and in 2018 we once again the tools group increased the number of hit products those 1 million sellers developed from a direct observation gains in the field one is our flex head ratcheting wrench we just launched the full complement of these powerful problem solvers the ratcheting wrenches and we ve been expanding our new line continuously and the flex head is the latest addition the flexibility of the head makes it possible to access fasteners in very difficult locations alternator brackets motor mounts serpentine belt and suspension bolts and we put that the new flex head together with snap on s durable gearing extraordinary length in low profile it all combines for industry leading strength power and accessibility it s another hit product and it makes the line of snap on ratcheting wrenches even stronger even more versatile and believe me we ve been working hard to strengthen our tool storage line up migrating some of the premium options like power drawer and speed organizers ph with midrange equipping our heavy duty shop with some of the advanced options like ac outlets and usb ports and introducing our kmp1422 the mid tier with high capacity and small footprint and this past quarter we introduced our new flip color schemes creating boxes at shift colors under different conditions and viewing angles three different patterns with three distinct color ships burgundy to bronze blue to purple to orange and grey to blue to gold they re brand new but they re catching attention and selling well the tools group may be below the growth trend but we keep investing we keep building its strength with new product and network vitality and it s starting to bring the us channel back to its growth trajectory well that s the tools group now let s move to rs i volume in the fourth quarter was 339 9 million down organically 3 5 primarily because of high single digit decreases and our business is focused on vehicle oems and the dealerships a turbulent it s a turbulent period in that lumpy project driven sector rs i operating earnings of 87 4 million decreased 2 8 million including 1 3 million of unfavorable foreign currency oi margin was strong 25 7 up 40 basis points from last year with growth in innovative software and information products driving that progress along those lines our mitchell1 division providing software to independent shops continues to pursue customer connection and innovation bringing great new products to improve shop efficiency an example as an example we just added our adas quick link to the mitchell lineup the new advanced driver assistance system or adas helps technicians diagnose repair and calibrate a variety of driver assist functions making the required repair information component locations wiring diagrams repair procedures and recalibration processes all available with ease with incredible ease and it offers data on products for all oem brands so it creates that date at the fingertips of the technicians for all oem brand our adas quick link is unique in the industry and it clearly drives shop and technicians productivity it makes the repair of lane departure warnings of that s of cruise control and other driver assist and other driver assist much easier it s already received and it will be quite popular in days ahead another example of how snap on value creation is authoring that continues upward trend at mitchell1 we keep driving to expand rs i position with repair shop owners and managers offering more new products to sell developed by the value our value creation processes or added by a strategic and coherent acquisitions and we re confident into winning formula well that s our quarter opco organic sales decreased 0 6 about flat to last year significant positives in the critical space that is c i favorable trends in the industrial business gains in india thailand and indonesia overcoming to china turbulence and the ongoing return of the us van channel to growth the impacts of near uncertainty transition to lower auto sales and a turbulence of brexit about offset by those positive gains oi margin as adjusted 18 7 down 70 basis points still strong but impacted by the shortfall in the van channel the unfavorable flip in the currency and the spending strengthening our us van channel and overall as adjusted eps of 3 03 up 12 6 that s our quarter now i ll turn the call over to aldo aldo aldo j pagliari senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer thanks nick our consolidated operating results are summarized on slide 6 net sales of 952 5 million in the quarter were down 2 3 reflecting a 0 6 organic sales decline 0 4 million of acquisition related sales and 17 1 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation the organic sales decrease this quarter principally reflected low single digit declines in sales to repair shop owners and managers in the repair systems and information segment largely offset by a low single digit growth in the commercial and industrial segment sales in the snap on tools segment were essentially flat but reflected low single digit gains in the us franchise operations consolidated gross margin of 48 grew 20 basis points primarily due to savings from rci initiatives partially offset by higher material and other costs the operating expense margin of 28 9 reflected 40 basis points of benefit from the 4 3 million legal settlement nick referred to earlier this compares to an operating expense margin of 31 6 last year which included 320 basis points of negative effect associated with a 30 9 million legal charge incurred during q4 of 2017 operating earnings before financial services of 182 1 million or 19 1 of sales compares to 158 million or 16 2 of sales in q4 2017 excluding the effects of the legal items in both years as adjusted operating margin before financial services of 18 7 compared to 19 4 last year financial services revenue of 82 7 million and operating earnings of 56 1 million increased 2 8 million and 1 7 million respectively from 2017 consolidated operating earnings of 238 2 million or 23 of revenues including 4 5 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to 212 4 million or 20 1 of revenues a year ago excluding the effects of the legal items in both years as adjusted operating margin of 22 6 compared to 23 1 last year our fourth quarter effective income tax rate of 22 compared to 33 last year our q4 2017 rate was reduced by 120 basis points as a result of the legal charge recorded in that period but it was increased by 360 basis points as a result of the 7 million charge related to the implementation of the new tax legislation in the us excluding both the legal and tax charges the effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2017 as adjusted was 30 6 finally net earnings on a reported basis of 175 million or 3 09 per share including a 0 06 unfavorable impact associated with foreign currency compared to 129 5 million or 2 24 per share a year ago excluding 0 06 per share for the legal settlement adjusted earnings per share were 3 03 up 12 6 compared to q4 2017 adjusted earnings per share of 2 69 which excluded the legal and tax charges last year now let s turn to our segment results starting with c i group on slide 7 sales of 343 7 million in the quarter increased 0 6 reflecting a 3 5 organic sales gain and 0 4 million of acquisition related sales partially offset by 9 9 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation the organic increase included a double digit gain in sales in both our asia pacific operations and specialty tools business as well as a low single digit gains in our european based hand tools business and in sales to customers in critical industries asia benefited from a strong sales performance in india and across southeast asia more than overcoming lower sales in china within the critical industries continued strength in sales into the aerospace segment as well as in general industry more than offset software sales to the military and natural resources gross margin of 38 5 decreased 80 basis points primarily due to this higher sales volumes of lower gross margin products principally in asia pacific as well as higher material and other cost partially offset by savings from rci initiatives the operating expense margin of 23 7 improved 60 basis points primarily as a result of sales volume leverage operating earnings for the c i segment of 50 8 million decreased 1 and the operating margin of 14 8 decreased 20 basis points from 15 in 2017 turning now to slide 8 sales in the snap on tools group of 407 4 million decreased 0 4 reflecting a 0 4 organic sales increase more than offset by 3 4 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation the organic sales change includes a low single digit increase in the us partially offset by a low single digit decline internationally gross margin of 40 2 decreased 120 basis points year over year primarily due to increased sales of lower gross margin products as well as 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects and higher material and other costs the operating expense margin of 26 2 increased to 120 basis points year over year primarily due to higher cost including efforts to provide greater levels of field marketing and technical support for our franchisees operating earnings for the snap on tools group of 57 million decreased 15 3 and the operating margin of 14 compared to 16 4 in 2017 turning to the rs i group shown on slide 9 sales of 339 9 million decreased 4 7 reflecting a 3 5 organic sales decline and 4 7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation the lower organic sales reflects a high single digit decline in sales to oem dealerships and a low single digit decrease in sales of undercar equipment gross margin of 47 5 improved 210 basis points primarily as a result of the shift in sales that included reduced volumes within our oem facilitation programs which typically feature lower gross margin products gross margin also benefited from rci the operating expense margin of 21 8 increased to 170 basis points year over year primarily due to the effect of lower oem facilitation sales volumes and higher other costs operating earnings for the rs i group of 87 4 million decreased 3 1 from prior year levels however the operating margin of 25 7 improved 40 basis points from last year now turning to slide 10 operating earnings from financial services of 56 1 million on revenue of 82 7 million increased 3 1 and 3 5 respectively from a year ago fourth quarter financial services expenses of 26 6 million increased 1 1 million primarily due to a 500 000 year over year increase in provisions for losses on contract receivables and increases in other operating expenses total provision expense for finance receivables of 16 million in the fourth quarter was the same as in 2017 as a percentage of the average portfolio financial services expenses were 1 3 in both of the fourth quarters of 2018 and 2017 the average yield on finance receivables in the fourth quarter was 17 7 compared to 17 8 in 2017 driven principally by product mix and a reflective of the credit quality of customers originating loans over the past several months the respective average yield on contract receivables was 9 2 for both 2017 and 2018 total loan originations of 267 1 million increased 2 1 million or 0 8 year over year due to higher origination of contract receivables principally franchise finance while finance receivable originations were essentially flat we did see some sequential year over year improvement in the united states moving to slide 11 our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately 2 1 billion of gross financing receivables including 1 8 billion from our us operation our worldwide gross financial services portfolio grew 16 8 million in the fourth quarter as for the 60 day plus delinquency trends they are stable year over year and also reflect the seasonal increase we typically experience in q4 as it relates to extended credit or finance receivables the largest portion of the portfolio trailing 12 month net losses of 52 3 million represented 3 16 of outstandings at quarter end up 24 basis points year over year but essentially flat sequentially again this quarter further supporting continued stabilization in the portfolio s credit metric performance now turning to slide 12 cash provided by operating activities of 215 9 million in the quarter increased 22 4 million or 11 6 from comparable 2017 levels primarily reflecting higher net earnings partially offset by the settlement of the employment related litigation matter net cash used by investing activities of 60 8 million included net additions to finance receivables of 38 4 million and capital expenditures of 22 4 million net cash used by financing activities of 135 1 million included cash dividends of 53 1 million

year end we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional 215 7 million of common stock under existing authorizations turning to slide 13 trade and other accounts receivable increased 17 million from 2017 year end including 20 8 million of unfavorable currency translation days sales outstanding of 67 days compared to 66 days of 2017 year end inventories increased 35 million including 23 2 million of unfavorable foreign currency from 2017 year end as a reminder the increase in inventory from 2017 year end included 20 9 million related to the recognition of an inventory asset associated with the adoption of asu topic 606 on revenue recognition on a trailing 12 month basis inventory turns of 2 9 compared to 3 2 at year end 2017 inventories decreased approximately 17 million from the end of the third quarter our year end cash position of 140 9 million increased 48 9 million from 2017 year end levels our net debt to capital ratio decreased to 24 5 from 27 at year end 2017 in addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations we have more than 700 million in available credit facilities as of quarter end we had 177 1 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding that concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance i ll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2019 we anticipate that capital expenditures will be in the range of 90 million to 100 million we currently anticipate that our full year 2019 effective income tax rate will be comparable to our full year 2018 effective tax rate of 24 i ll now turn the call back to nick for his closing thoughts nick nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer thanks aldo snap on fourth quarter near term turbulence the auto sales transition and associated uncertainty and the effect of brexit all of that about to offset by c i s favorable trajectory continuing favorable trajectory of c i continually extend in critical industries asia pacific progressing overcoming china s turbulence and the tools us recovery we believe strongly in our opportunities for growth and improvement that s why we re keeping increasing our customer connection and working on innovation and launching new products looking forward we see attractive opportunity and we believe we have a strong position to take advantage our position in products in an optimistic and capable van network in a growing penetration of critical industry in a building array of unique repair databases and in expanding capability in the broad markets of asia pacific all serving as an effective base for moving forward for offsetting turbulence and for achieving a positive trajectory through 2019 and beyond before i turn the call over to the operator i ll speak directly to our franchisees and associates around the world i know you more than anyone see the turbulence of the day and i know that we ve been able to prevail because of your extraordinary capability energy and dedication for your role and our progress you have my admiration and for your unfailing commitment to our team you have my thanks now i ll turn the call over to the operator operator questions and answers operator thank you ladies and gentlemen at this time we will open the floor for questions operator instructions we ll take our first question from curtis nagle with bank of america curtis nagle bank of america merrill lynch analyst good morning and thanks very much for taking the question nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer hi curtis nagle bank of america merrill lynch analyst so i guess the first one good morning nick how are you nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer fine curtis nagle bank of america merrill lynch analyst could you guys good maybe speak just a little bit more specifically about why you guys are it sounds like pretty confident that us franchise business is on a trajectory of sustaining growth after a couple of years of fairly modest results on a revenue basis nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer yeah look i think this is the thing i mean there are a lot goes in and goes out in this quarter as you can listen but the thing is if we look at our franchise business second quarter this is second quarter of positivity positive growth we re returning to positive growth and we think if you look at the sales of the van they exceeded the numbers they were now over time sales of the van generally equal our numbers but sales our sales aren t sales of the van they re sales too our sales are the sales of the franchisees than they sell to end customers the end customer sales were pretty strong in this quarter and they started to approach where we want the tools business to be so we were encouraged by that it s one data point but we re encouraged and then we saw how we came out of 2018 toward the end of the year they were positive so i think we feel good about that more than that when you talk to the franchisees they re optimistic i spent a lot of time talking to and i look at our product line i think or product line is nonpareil and stronger again stronger everyday in the franchisee degree curtis nagle bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it and then just quickly shifting to rs i i don t know if you specifically commented on this but how did the diagnostics businesses fair in and how you are looking at next year and when does the modis launch nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer yeah well first of all couple of things modis is an existing product it s not a launch it s sold very well in the quarter the diagnostics business diagnostics sales primarily to the tools group the tools group sales of diagnostics were up year over year it was a less rich mix which is one of the product mix problems associated with tools group margins but modis and solus are sold very well through in diagnostic in terms of the tools group if you signal back to the rs i business itself there is the sales for the tools group were less than last year but that just had to do with the inventory adjustments between the tools group and rs i i would suggest that diagnostics had a pretty robust selling period in this quarter if you look at repair systems and information we usually how we described that is the repair systems and information sold independent shops at fairly positive and they re good margin drivers for rs i which is part of the reason why you see rs i 25 7 up 40 basis points curtis nagle bank of america merrill lynch analyst and then how you think about this year nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer i feel i kind of like our product line when i see it coming out i like the momentum in this year so quarter to quarter you can one of the things you ll find as you follow us over time it can t really hang yourself in any one quarter in terms of products as you break it down by product but we like our diagnostic offering they are better than anything in the market and it s only getting stronger in providing more options for customers for technicians and no one can match them and we have enhancements coming in the next year curtis nagle bank of america merrill lynch analyst all right thanks very much i appreciate it nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer okay operator we ll take our next question from christopher glynn with oppenheimer christopher d glynn oppenheimer co inc analyst thank you good morning can you hear me nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer yeah sure good morning christopher d glynn oppenheimer co inc analyst okay great hey so at c i the 3 5 organic was particularly striking on the comparison you re up 10 last year so that s i m just wondering if that equates as comparisons normalize to increase the organic confidence and ability and visibility for c i as you contemplate 2019 nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer actually 3 5 was nice i mean i think if you look at over five c i is one of those businesses which tends to be more variable in terms of the even though it s got positive trajectory our c i has grown take a look at our industrial business it s grown over the last five quarters like at 7 7 or 8 organically but quarter by quarter it s been all over the map mid teens and some low single digits because of the categorization of those orders that was a basis of my comment so we thought this quarter was nice we had great order activity we did well in aviation and other places but in general industry but we it wasn t as strong as some other quarters so this was kind of a little bit of a flat period for c i it s still was a good if you look at the overall trajectory it was very strong christopher d glynn oppenheimer co inc analyst okay yeah i thought multiple speaker nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer so i guess the other way to say that is we have expect positive expectations around c i christopher d glynn oppenheimer co inc analyst okay and then for sot between mix and investment margins were down quite a bit there i m just wondering how we think about the margin run rates currently that you experience for the full year 2018 nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer we don t think we sorry sorry go ahead sorry christopher d glynn oppenheimer co inc analyst yeah and just if there are any kind of sustained headwinds if we should expect a little continued pressure there nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer the currency is going to be the currency flipped on us they had 40 basis points of good news last quarter in currency that flipped to negative this quarter so part of the problem i usually don t mention currency but part of the problem is that flip you can t necessarily adjust in pricing and other things that quickly and so it was kind of an unusual flip for us we usually don t see it that quick we ll see continuing pressure but we ll learn we ll deal with that in terms of market pricing and so on in rci and so on you re going to see some pressure on material costs when that heats up some of our rci but we have rci against those the margin mix i think was more or less kind of a phenomena that is hard to forecast but this was a particularly low point of the quarter fundamentally last year you were selling you were pounding zeus into the marketplace diagnostics our highest priced diagnostic unit great margins this time we were pounding the we re pushing the non intelligent diagnostic portion of our lineup the modis and the solus so those are lower margins that was pretty must what drove that i wouldn t expect that to continue in that kind of level going forward so i suppose that s a long way of explaining why we thought this was kind of a lower point christopher d glynn oppenheimer co inc analyst got it thank you aldo j pagliari senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer sure operator thank you we ll take our next question from david macgregor david sutherland macgregor longbow research llc analyst nick i guess i m just looking at the relatively flat tool segment organic growth in both 3q and 4q and wondering why do you think the conversion of sfc orders were so disappointing and i guess overall now what kind of order order growth did you see from the 2019 regional kickoffs and any reason to believe you ll see it to be a better conversion rate on those orders than you did on the sfc orders nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer look i think we have said to look out from home that you can t really get sale from the sfc the sfc orders are up and they were up that s an encouraging event and part of it is i tell you the sales of the van have been pretty good so i kind of feel ok about that i think if you look at the us we feel even though the numbers aren t quite showing it yet we see the us making progress the thing that has bedeviled the tools group and these is the on look for effect of brexit on the uk and some softness internationally but it really has offset any kind of gain we see in the us and i think the us gain is somewhat muted compared to what the franchisees are seeing so i feel ok about that i don t think i think the sfc kind of did its job david sutherland macgregor longbow research llc analyst and the regional kickoffs your thoughts there nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer regional kickoffs if you look at the orders that are aren t coming out the original kickoffs into the first quarter they look pretty good so i feel ok about that of course there are always ups and downs when you go from region to region to region and from franchisee to franchisee but i think when we look at the effect and what we ve tried to do was bring the effect closer to those events as we did as you know we in the sfc and that seems to have worked some in the regional kickoffs as well as the sfc david sutherland macgregor longbow research llc analyst you ve got the lower inventory turns even adjusted for the 20 million year over year i guess do you feel like your over inventory right now in big ticket merchandise or just what s the makeup of that nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer no i wouldn t say we re over inventoried in big ticket merchandise i would say that we re adding a lot of tools we added 5 000 different line items for industrial last year so we ll keep adding the tools but now you could say ok we re not getting all sales we want but if you look at the trajectory of our businesses if you look at near term maybe you can getting twist but if you look at the trajectory of the tools group over a five six years you ll see that it s more than 5 if you look at the trajectory of c i it s a little bit below where we wanted to be if you look at rs i it is where we want it to be so you get those trajectories i don t think while we re working on the quarter to quarter we think we see the long term good and adding the number of products is part of that strategy and we see it working over time david sutherland macgregor longbow research llc analyst okay just a second question you d referenced the increase of 500 000 of provision for contract receivables can you what can you say right now about current trends in franchisee credit when you called out the franchisee health metrics i guess what would you say as being the most bullish of the franchisees aldo j pagliari senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer david it s aldo the contract receivable provision largely reflects the leased equipment into garages the franchisee health metrics have been steady and we experienced historically very very low losses on the franchise portion of that so because it come off of a little base it just you can get noise one quarter to a next when the k comes out you guys get to see in about a week but you ll see on a full year basis the provisions for contract receivable is actually lower on a full year basis so you just get some noise quarter to quarter but in this quarter mostly adjustment relates to leased equipment to garages david sutherland macgregor longbow research llc analyst are you comfortable with current trends in franchisee credit are you seeing any inflections there that multiple speakers aldo j pagliari senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer certainly i am comfortable i m certainly very comfortable nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer we are comfortable david sutherland macgregor longbow research llc analyst yeah you re not seeing any inflections nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer no we re not seeing any inflections aldo j pagliari senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer none nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer in fact if anything i think it s getting better so i mean i don t know multiple speakers yeah sure operator thank you we ll take our next question from david leiker with baird joseph d vruwink robert w baird co incorporated analyst good morning this is joe vruwink for david nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer yes joe joseph d vruwink robert w baird co incorporated analyst i wanted to drill in to tools group margin a bit more so i understand the dynamic with diagnostic product category can you talk about power tool s growth in the quarter and then was that subject additional tariffs pressures at all in the quarter nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer power tools had some tariff pressure in the quarter but its growth it was i wouldn t call it a factor in the quarter power tools except that power tools was one of the places that didn t grow in the quarter in the tools group so power tools didn t have a particularly robust quarter it had a pretty good quarter last quarter so we kind of didn t read anything into that but it didn t have particular growth so it wasn t if you re looking for the tariffs effect of that i wouldn t call that a factor here the factors are the ones i called out the flip if you look at the currency around the pound and the canadian dollar and so on where they went in the last quarter and particularly the end of the last quarter you can see that motion and so we just didn t maybe we should have been better at it but we didn t get our order quickly enough and so that 40 basis point to 20 basis point flip was the top one on them and then they do spin we want to spin them by the way we think that s paying off when you see the sales of the van and then if you look at the margins the product mix it was a particularly weak product mix compared to the zeus in the last quarter that s the way it played out and so yes you re rightly pointing out that that was a arithmetically that was a dominant number joseph d vruwink robert w baird co incorporated analyst and then on the franchisee support initiatives i understand those are going on all the time but they typically don t get called out in the quarterly deck so was it a larger than normal investment in the quarter and if that s the case why now nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer lt s somewhat larger but the thing is part of it is that we remember i said that i wouldn t say it s like what i would call a singularity in the quarter in this quarter but remember when you got when you have your intelligent diagnostics and we have more of these i would say more complex product offerings around the new hand tools around flex head ratchetings around the fdx the hand tools around flank drive extra and around the intelligent diagnostic you understand we made a conscious decision that we have to spend more time helping our franchisees communicate the value of those to the marketplace so that s been growing a little bit and we see the payoffs though i m telling you we think we see the payoffs i think the i like the sales of the van this quarter so i feel ok about that now if this is as you say arithmetically dominant you pointed out arithmetically dominating is that margin shortfall but part of it is that but also the margins the product mix is a big thing in that and the reversal on the currency and then of course yeah you have some tariffs and some materials eating up some of our rci joseph d vruwink robert w baird co incorporated analyst and i think snap on has a pretty good track record of making these corporate investments when you see a growth opportunity i m thinking about the rock n roll cabs and the techno vans and some of the early cycle studying the franchisees and increasing their productivity all of those investments ultimately drove inorganic growth improvement is what we re seeing this quarter calling out the investment and the technical skills sort of with your franchisees are better positioned to sell diagnostics would you expect that drives an acceleration in diagnostic growth during 2019 nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer i would expect it would drive a riching of our mix around software which it s doing and presumably a robust diagnostic sales but also robust hand tools sales and hand tools were nicely were nice in the quarter so i feel positive about that it s harder to it s not as easy as the rock n roll cabs because the rock n roll cabs was very palatable anyway we re pretty positive about the quarter if joe if the uk and the international businesses didn t find the problems associated with brexit this would look a lot to i think joseph d vruwink robert w baird co incorporated analyst and then my last question on rs i us auto sales have been plateauing around 70 million for four years this is probably going to be the fifth year around that level so it doesn t really seem like there is a major change in the end market outlook and yet you re getting feedback from your sales team that the oem dynamic has changed is there something else going on nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer no i don t know no i don t i think didn t ihs take down the market below 17 didn t inaudible take down the market below 17 so i think they forecasted down below 17 didn t gm announced that they re closing a bunch of plants and therefore drawing in their home i think everybody s been kind of demuring on this market a lot of very public announcements and i would suggest that that creates an aura i m not surprised at this at all i think that creates an aura of uncertainty i m not saying that this is a long term thing i think this is a shorter term thing i think we re feeling pretty good about next year in terms of projects i think eventually the shifts like gas prices when gas prices go up everybody stops driving for a couple of weeks so i think this is the same kind of thing that s how i view it now i could be wrong about this and we could be wrong but that s the way we see it the oem projects have been coming down and we see some opportunities next year so we think the effect was up but i think the it s the concern and conservatism over what s going to happen in the future joseph d vruwink robert w baird co incorporated analyst and then last question on the last question on this so even though there might be some questions around overall industry volume there are more new vehicles launching in 2019 versus 2018 and that typically is good for your facilitation business would you expect that to contribute more in 2019 versus 2018 was a down year versus 2017 does that come back for you nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer yes i think so i mean of course famous last words what i mean but yes joseph d vruwink robert w baird co incorporated analyst thank you nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer sure operator we ll take our next question from bret jordan with jefferies bret david jordan jefferies llc analyst good morning guys nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer good morning aldo j pagliari senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer hey bret bret david jordan jefferies llc analyst i guess on the tools group margin again i guess i was thinking about that franchise support spend and i guess also you talked about lower margin mix was there anything i guess either accelerate rate of promotions this quarter year over year or maybe you could talk specifically about tool storage and whether your volumes were up year over year and sequentially in that space nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer tool storage was ok tool storage volumes were up i don t think there was anything particularly special about the promotions around tool storage so i would suggest that there were special things around promotions around diagnostics and i don t think we see these things from time to time but remember what we did was we have been pushing the intelligent diagnostics the software packages the apollo and the zeus with the data packages for what three quarters and so we ve been pounding those and there are other customers who are little bit less software receptive and want to look at the non intelligent diagnostics the non enabled products that are modis and solus and so it came their time and so we pushed those and generally when you do that you do put promotions around that to get franchisee attention and give customers a reason to buy and that s what happened in this situation and the comparison to last year which was rolling out this new product zeus the best thing since sliced bread and it is it s a tough comparison bret david jordan jefferies llc analyst okay and then i guess one question on the oem side is there and this is sort of big picture but do you see the oem sort of pushing more toward an oe tool set in the sense that i guess via chrysler is now encrypting the obd port they haven t activated it yet but sort of trying to protect their software internally and are they are the oems pushing their own as opposed to outside buys now as the bigger structural trend nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer no i don t think that s a factor i don t think that s a factor for us it s always something we watch bret but i think for a dog s age they wanted to take more of the repair back but they haven t really been successful in doing that i mean this is what you re talking about in chrysler it s just the latest iteration of that effort i think we watch it carefully but i don t think it s an impact in what i m talking about what i m talking about i think is more or less that two of projects was done in the last couple of years in the last year and i think that has to do with the anticipation of uncertainty associated in the sense and the dealership themselves i mean autonation talked about restructuring i think the other day and they re talking about it that you say they talked about 40 less investment in dealerships and so you have all that stuff rolling through the industry i just think these guys are getting up every day and getting bad news for breakfast and they re pulling in their horns a little bit but that after a while they start saying wait a minute i don t have new car sales but i better get some parts and service sales bret david jordan jefferies llc analyst okay so you don t see it it s not it s just lower spending it s not a reallocation of where they are spending nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer i don t think so no we re not seeing that bret david jordan jefferies llc analyst all right thank you nicholas t pinchuk chairman of the board and chief executive officer sure great operator thank you ladies and gentlemen at this time there are no further questions in the queue i d now

ended december 31 2018 q1 2019 compared to the first quarter ended december 31 2017 q1 2018 the financial results presented include certain non gaap financial measures such as ebit ebitda adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps as defined within the non gaap financial measures described below any non gaap financial measures presented are reconciled to their respective gaap equivalents management believes these non gaap financial measures are useful in assessing the ongoing operational profitability of the company s business segments and therefore allow shareholders better visibility into the company s underlying operations see non gaap financial measures described below earnings summary q1 2019 gaap eps of 0 66 per share included 0 19 per share from a gain on the sale of doble s headquarters building in watertown massachusetts partially offset by charges incurred from cost reduction actions taken in technical packaging and at doble and costs incurred to move the aircraft aerospace business from vacco to pti as described in the company s november 15 2018 earnings release the 0 19 per share was excluded when determining q1 2019 adjusted eps gaap net earnings were 17 million in q1 2019 q1 2018 gaap eps of 1 33 per share included a net tax benefit of 25 million or 1 00 per share from the implementation of the december 2017 tax cuts and jobs act u s tax reform the 1 00 per share was excluded when determining q1 2018 adjusted eps gaap net earnings were 35 million in q1 2018 q1 2019 adjusted eps of 0 47 per share exceeded management s previous guidance of 0 40 to 0 45 per share and increased 42 percent over q1 2018 adjusted eps of 0 33 per share adjusted ebitda was 28 million in q1 2019 reflecting a 14 percent increase over q1 2018 adjusted ebitda of 24 million the increases in adjusted eps and adjusted ebitda were driven by higher sales and improved operating performance within filtration usg and test operating highlight s q1 2019 sales increased 5 percent to 183 million compared to 173 million in q1 2018 on a segment basis q1 2019 filtration sales exceeded expectations and increased 10 percent from q1 2018 as commercial aerospace and navy sales increased significantly test sales also exceeded expectations and increased 10 percent driven by strong project sales domestically and in china usg sales from doble morgan schaffer and vanguard increased 4 percent while nrg s sales to renewable energy customers decreased resulting in flat usg net sales technical packaging sales decreased five percent consistent with expectations due to project timing sg a expenses decreased 3 percent in q1 2019 compared to q1 2018 as a result of the cost reduction actions taken throughout 2018 entered orders were 198 million in q1 2019 book to bill of 1 08x which resulted in an ending backlog of 398 million at december 31 2018 an increase of 15 million or 4 percent from september 30 2018 q1 2019 gaap and adjusted income tax rates were 25 5 percent and 24 8 percent respectively which were slightly higher than management s previous expectations of 24 percent the gaap effective tax rate in q1 2018 was significantly impacted by the 25 million net tax benefit recorded as a result of u s tax reform and was 33 5 percent on an adjusted basis when excluding the net tax benefit q1 2019 net cash provided by operating activities was 8 million resulting in 179 million of net debt outstanding total borrowings less cash on hand at december 31 2018 with a 1 5x leverage ratio chairman s commentary q1 2019 vic richey chairman and chief executive officer commented i m pleased with the way we started the year as q1 s operating results came in above our original expectations at most of our operating units sales earnings cash flow and entered orders all came in better than plan which enabled us to beat the top end of our adjusted eps guidance range by 0 02 per share on an adjusted basis we increased our q1 2019 earnings 44 percent over prior year driven by the strength of our filtration test and usg businesses which all contributed meaningfully to our earnings growth our packaging business came in generally as expected and i m certain that the cost reduction actions that are underway will begin to have a favorable impact in the second half of the year touching on a few highlights of our q1 performance compared to q1 2018 filtration sales increased 10 percent driven by the continued strength of our commercial aerospace and navy business test sales also increased 10 percent on the strength of its backlog and new project wins doble vanguard and morgan schaffer had solid sales and earnings growth and exceeded expectations but we continued to experience some softness in the renewable energy space despite some softness at nrg usg delivered an adjusted ebit margin of 25 percent in q1 2019 up from 19 percent in q1 2018 our entered orders were another bright spot in q1 as we booked nearly 200 million of new business and increased our backlog over 15 million from the start of the year and that is despite beating our sales forecast i believe this bodes well for meeting our commitments for the balance of the year additionally we generated a meaningful amount of cash during q1 which enabled us to continue to pay down debt and positions us well for future m a spending on the m a front we continue to evaluate and diligence a robust pipeline of opportunities in both filtration and usg and continue to work these aggressively consistent with our history we will remain prudent and committed to our disciplined approach of balancing roic and protecting our balance sheet our cost reduction actions are proceeding as planned and are on budget and on schedule i m pleased to report that we are in lease negotiations for a new doble headquarters building in marlborough i m looking forward to having all of the doble staff co located in a single customer friendly facility as i believe it will further enhance our operational efficiency and effectiveness while lowering our operating costs the move is expected to be completed by december 2019 as we look forward in 2019 we plan to build on the successes we achieved in q1 and expect to continue benefitting from our lower cost structure our solid market positions and tangible growth opportunities across the company provide us with a favorable view of the future with our goal remaining unchanged to increase long term shareholder value dividend payment the next quarterly cash dividend of 0 08 per share will be paid on april 18 2019 to stockholders of record on april 3 2019 new revenue recognition standard on october 1 2018 the company formally adopted asc topic 606 revenue from contracts with customers new revenue recognition standard using the modified retrospective method operating results for reporting periods beginning after october 1 2018 will be presented under the new revenue recognition standard while the results from prior periods will not be adjusted and will continue to be presented using our historic accounting policies this new standard will have no impact on 2019 cash flows cost reduction restructuring actions to enhance doble s roic and further improve its operating efficiency in october 2018 the company sold doble s headquarters building in watertown massachusetts to a real estate developer for approximately 18 million in cash and later in 2019 will consolidate its operations into one location in marlborough massachusetts where doble has an existing administrative facility the sale resulted in a pretax gain recognized in q1 2019 the net proceeds were used to further pay down debt and the upcoming move will improve operational efficiency by having doble s entire boston area operations co located in a single lower cost more modern facility by the end of calendar 2019 the building gain and the restructuring move costs will be excluded when calculating 2019 adjusted eps to reduce technical packaging s cost structure and increase its ebit margins the company initiated a cost reduction action in europe to close plastique s headquarters in tunbridge wells uk and consolidate its new product design and administrative functions into the remaining facilities in nottingham uk and poznan poland this move is expected to generate meaningful operating improvements and will enable plastique to be more competitive in its various end markets the shut down and move costs approximately 2 million pretax will be excluded when calculating 2019 adjusted eps additionally the company is moving vacco s aircraft aerospace business approximately 8 million in annual revenue from south el monte california and consolidating it into pti s aerospace facility in oxnard california this will enable pti to maximize its aircraft aerospace customer relationships and market expertise and utilize manufacturing floor space made available by the elimination of its automotive industrial business during 2018 while allowing vacco to concentrate on its growing navy submarine and space business these move costs approximately 1 million will also be excluded when calculating 2019 adjusted eps all of these actions are intended to improve operating efficiency generate additional free cash flow and enhance the company s competitiveness across several end markets thereby accelerating annual sales and earnings growth in the future business outlook 201 9 summarized management s expectations for 2019 remain consistent with the details outlined in the business outlook 2019 section of the november 15 2018 earnings release management continues to see meaningful organic sales adjusted ebit and adjusted ebitda growth across each of the company s business segments and anticipates growth rates in 2019 and beyond that will generally exceed the broader industrial market the organic growth described in the previous earnings release is expected to be enhanced by additional m a contributions management s focus on profitable growth increased cash flow an enhanced cost structure driving efficiency and creating competitive advantages coupled with incremental roic will be the key drivers of sustainable share price appreciation to recap management expects 2019 adjusted eps to be in the range of 2 95 to 3 05 per share reflecting meaningful organic sales and adjusted ebitda growth partially offset by the additional depreciation and amortization charges and incremental tax expense as detailed previously on a quarterly basis management expects 2019 revenues and adjusted eps to be more back half weighted with the second half of the year being stronger than the first half management expects q2 2019 adjusted eps to be in the range of 0 58 to 0 63 per share the timing of quarterly sales and

everyone we serve had the energy needed to stay safe and warm we delivered thanks to the people who manage our system and our ability to operate in the most severe weather conditions service delivery is directly correlated with the significant investments we ve made in the last five years to modernize infrastructure and technology it s time like this when we are keenly aware of our vital role in taking care of our communities to all our spire employees i d like to say thank you for answering the challenge on our year end earnings call in november i took some time to outline spire s journey of transformation and how that set us up for another successful year in fiscal 2018 this transformation also positions us for further success in 2019 and beyond today i m happy to report that we re off to a strong start again in this year as we continue to put our energy in motion guided by our mission and our consistent set of strategic priorities for delivering long term growth we remain laser focused on organic growth for our gas utilities and our gas related businesses by our marketing spire stl pipeline and spire storage and we continue to make significant investments in organic growth infrastructure modernization and innovation and technology all of which combine to drive our overall performance coming off a strong year and fiscal 2018 when we wrap that regulatory resets in every area we serve we continued the momentum and delivered improved financial and operating performance in first quarter 2019 i m pleased to tell you that we posted first quarter net economic earnings of 1 30 per share up 9 from a year ago reflecting growth at our gas utilities and continued solid performance by spire marketing in fact our gas utilities posted a 7 increase in earnings per share in the first quarter thanks to regulatory outcomes and growth in our core business which i ll describe in a moment we remain focused on raising the bar on the operations side too and i m proud of how our dedicated employees are continuing to deliver improved performance across our five gas utilities at the same time we are progressing with the development of our gas related businesses construction is underway on our spire stl pipeline and at spire storage indeed we recently received approval from ferc to consolidate the operating certificate for our storage facility more on this in a moment we also continue to successfully implement technology solutions and innovation to achieve the targeted growth of our gas utility it starts with organic growth initiatives to increase customers and margin and lower operating costs these initiatives include enhancements to our new business processes and the technologies we use to track and successfully pursue opportunities we re also seeing further success for our increased focus on economic development in fact we are extensively engaged and reimagining the economic development landscape in missouri while we ve always had an active voice in early conversations on projects for the past year we ve been working with top business and government leaders to restructure and coordinate economic development efforts across the st louis region in fact last week the leading business organizations publicly announced the st louis regional economic development alliance the alliance creates a world class private sector initiative to attract and retain businesses jobs and top talent for the st louis region i have personally been involved in this effort for quite some time and i have the honor of serving as the first board chair for the alliance i m proud to say that with this new coordinated approach to economic development we now have an incredible opportunity to retain expand and attract large regional projects to the region now turning to the current business development our investment in new business continues to ramp up this quarter we invested 27 million up 19 over last year s record pace we achieved growth of 9 in new meters again an increase on top of last year s record level which also was supported by an increase of conversion activity in addition we are increasing our overall utility investment focused on infrastructure modernization in the first quarter utility capex was up 40 primarily driven by infrastructure upgrades and increased new business capital this was accomplished in spite of the challenging construction conditions this winter the regulatory mechanisms we have which include incentives to accelerate pipeline upgrades in both missouri and alabama and the real time rate making in alabama our key to timely recovery that helps drive our ability to holistically modernize our infrastructure system and return earnings to our shareholders in missouri we just filed for an additional 19 million in annual revenues under the infrastructure system replacement surcharge or isrs we expect new rates to go into effect in may in alabama you may recall that the commission established a rider to incent the accelerated replacement of remaining cast iron and bare steel distribution line the accelerated infrastructure modernization rider or aim provides an opportunity to earn an additional 10 basis points of equity return if target levels of replacement are met i m pleased to share that our infrastructure upgrade spend is on track for us to earn the increased roe next year and finally we support growth through the day and day out rigor of managing our costs to efficiently deliver safe and reliable natural gas while it s delivering exceptional service for our 1 7 million homes and businesses on the operations side of gas or gas utilities we continue to see improving performance driven by the investments we ve made in infrastructure technology and our people at spire everything begins with safety and we re seeing lower employee injury rate and better safety overall continuing the momentum from last year our strategic priority and invest in modernizing our pipeline system is leading to enhance system integrity with overall reductions in leaks and better leak response times this investment is driving lower maintenance cost across our system and finally our service levels and performance in the field continue to build on last year s success our customer satisfaction scores for our field technicians are higher and appointment attainment rates continue to go up building on the record levels we achieved last year in addition to the important work we do in the field to operate a safe and reliable system we re also investing in technology to help us better connect and serve our customers about 15 months ago we launched a technology enabled platform called my account that provides customers with more options for easily connecting and contacting us and manage their account on the go i m pleased to report that more than 680 000 spire homes and businesses have signed up for my account and as a result we re seeing increasing enrollment and programs such as paperless billing budget billing and auto pay plus our new automated start service and transfer service options are quickly becoming favorites among our customers by offering people more options and greater convenience we are seeing higher satisfaction overall let me now turn to spire stl pipeline following receipt of approval from ferc to proceed with our project we have secured land rights and have begun construction on the 65 mile route our contractor michel is highly regarded in terms of quality and safety and based on our current construction schedule we expect the pipeline to be in service by september 30 our estimated total spend on the project remains 210 million to 225 million we have also been working to further advance spire marketing and spire storage at spire marketing we have devoted significant effort over the last year to build an even stronger team positioning us for long term growth and success the team has expanded its longstanding business model of managing the complicated logistics and moving gas for customers including utilities power generators and producers by creating a larger geographic footprint growing its customer base and increasing its volumes as a reminder our marketing growth strategy is focused on contracting directly with producers and end users we re doing this while serving our growing customer base and leveraging our expertise to optimize our portfolio of supply transportation and storage assets based on market conditions including weather regional basis and price volatility spire marketing continues to be a valuable resource in our portfolio of business and once again posted strong performance reflecting its expansion and continuing favorable market conditions first quarter net economic earnings doubled over the last year to 0 16 per share turning to spire storage the ferc approved our application to strategically combine the operation of our two gas storage facilities into one certificate this positions us to offer new valuable services and enhanced reliability to a broader and more diverse mix of customers from utilities and power generators to producers as we continue to integrate these facilities we re now finalizing our development plan to reflect the combined operations and take advantage of the expanded market opportunities we re focused on unlocking long term value by investing in infrastructure and resources thereby increasing injection and withdrawal capabilities expanding working gas capacity and building on our service offerings as a result we expect spire storage to contribute to earnings in fiscal 2020 rest assured that we ve assembled a very talented team to support this strategy an important part of how we deliver to value to our investors is through our dividend very proud of our track record 74 years of uninterrupted dividend payments including increases for 16 years in a row this includes a 5 3 increase effective in january of this year to an annualized rate of 2 37 per share i m pleased to report that our board has declared a quarterly dividend of 0 5925 per share payable april 2nd with that let me turn the call over to steve rasche to cover the financial performance and outlook steve steven p rasche executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks suzanne and good morning everyone let s review our results starting here on slide 12 we delivered strong growth this quarter with consolidated net economic earnings of nearly 66 million up 14 from last year with growth in both our businesses gas utility posted earnings of 66 4 million up 6 9 million or nearly 12 from last year gas marketing earnings of 8 3 million were 4 7 million higher or over double last year s results these were offset in part by 3 6 million in higher corporate expenses and spire storage losses included in net economic earnings for the first time this year net economic earnings were 1 30 per fully diluted share or over 9 higher than last year reflecting the higher share count from our equity offering last spring now i normally don t comment on gaap earnings but we ve included it here in the slide since our comparables like those of many other companies are impacted by tax reform adjustments last year for us a non cash benefit of nearly 60 million or 1 24 per share which frankly makes the gaap earnings comparison and the significant drop in headline earnings misleading at best as a reminder we excluded these non cash benefits from our net economic earnings last year and we believe that the comparison of nee and the resulting year over year growth to be a fair review into our performance with that let s take a look at the key drivers starting on the next slide total operating revenues of 602 million were 7 higher than last year on the combination of higher weather related demand and higher commodity cost contribution margin was up as well consistent with colder weather this quarter our gas utility margins grew 2 million but that measure includes a 14 million customer rate reduction related to tax reform that is offset by lower income tax expense further down the income statement excluding that rate reduction margins were up 16 million or over 6 driven by first colder weather temperatures in our service territory were about 12 colder than last year and roughly 10 colder than normal this colder weather helped us to grow our off system sales and capacity release in missouri which benefits both our customers and utility secondly rate design changes in missouri including weather normalization which on balance push more of our margin into this quarter compared to a year ago and finally continued modest customer growth turning to gas marketing margins increased by 8 7 million as our geographic expansion and continued favorable market conditions allowed us to create value by optimizing our supply transportation and storage portfolio looking at operating expenses utility fuel cost and volume based taxes were higher as we would expect from higher revenues and commodity cost operation and maintenance expenses were up by 3 5 million but that increase was driven by higher benefit and energy efficiency cost that were defined by our missouri rate cases last year outside of those increases our run rate or controllable expenses were actually lower than last year not surprisingly depreciation and amortization was higher consistent with our higher capital investments gas marketing and other has two moving parts gas marketing and storage first gas marketing expenses increased due to higher commodity costs and volumes offset in part by a higher mix of trading business remember the transactions are recorded net as trading margins if we don t physically procure and deliver the same molecules which is not uncommon if we can trade at origin or destination to lower our delivered gas costs while meeting our customers needs secondly this expense line also includes spire storage expenses totaling 4 million this quarter and finishing up the slide interest expense was higher by 1 5 million largely due to higher short term interest rates and debt levels turning to slide 15 capital spend for the first quarter was 207 million reflecting our continued focus on infrastructure upgrades and new business investment in our utilities as well as higher spend in our other gas related businesses we are tracking against our 2019 full year capex target of 650 million with a note that we anticipate updating this target once we finalize our spire storage development plan as suzanne mentioned a few minutes ago our five year capital spending plan through 2022 remains 2 6 billion focused on utility infrastructure investments that are well diversified across our footprint and supported by long term upgrade programs of up to 20 years more importantly 85 of that spend is recovered with minimal regulatory lag or driving higher margins we also continue to grow our cash flow and maintain a strong financial position first quarter ebitda was up 3 from last year to 152 million short term liquidity was also very solid as we hit the peak of our seasonal working capital needs our long term equity capitalization also strengthened year over year and we now stand at just above 51 equity capitalization up nearly 190 basis points from last year and we continue to execute on planned financings at spire missouri we funded 100 million term loan in december and at spire alabama we completed a 90 million private placement of senior notes in january on the equity side of our capital structure today we announced the establishment of 150 million at the market or atm program that will help us meet our incremental equity needs over the next couple of years and atm is a great tool and fits our situation well the need for an incremental equity capital over time to ensure that we maintain a balanced capital structure and strong credit metrics as we continue to grow and invest i should note here that we do not expect to activate the atm program this quarter and we ll update you as our plans change our sales agents on the program will be rbc and bank of america merrill lynch turning to our earnings outlook we reaffirm our long term net economic earnings per share growth target range of 4 to 7 as well as our 2019 guidance range of 3 70 to 3 80 per share earnings growth is supported by greater regulatory certainty and our strong rate base growth and our organic growth across our utilities it also reflects the updates that we ve shared today strong first quarter performance in our gas utility and marketing businesses the progress we ve made with spire stl pipeline and our targeted in service date as well as the continued investment in our storage business so in summary we re off to a great start and we continue to invest for long term success across our businesses with that let me turn it back over to you suzanne for some closing comments suzanne sitherwood president and chief executive officer thank you steve in closing i d like to thank all of our spire employees for their hard work and personal commitment to serving our customers and community especially during the winter heating season when our customer count on us to safely and reliably keep their homes and businesses warm we re off to a fine start this fiscal year keeping pace with our plans to invest in and grow our businesses and drive increasing value for our shareholders we appreciate your interest and investment in spire and look forward to updating you on the progress and achievements as we continue to move forward in that spirit i hope you re able to join us for spire s first ever investor day on april 4 in new york that s where we will have the chance to meet with you face to face and engage in a deeper conversation conversations around organic growth infrastructure modernization spire s marketing business model and growth plans the progress on constructing spire stl pipeline and how we re developing an integrated platform for spire storage now we are ready to take your questions questions and answers operator we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions and our first question comes from michael weinstein with credit suisse please go ahead michael weinstein credit suisse analyst hi guys suzanne sitherwood president and chief executive officer hey good morning michael michael weinstein credit suisse analyst good morning could you talk a little bit about the atm and i guess more about the reasons why it was filed and what you re seeing over the next couple of years in terms of higher capex spend that might justify it or might require it and i guess mainly what i m asking for is a kind of a preview of what you might be talking about in april for and how you re going to change the plan steven p rasche executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah great question michael i think we ve been talking for a while that atm programs are great tools to have in your tool box in fact i know i ve spoken in the past about the fact that i ve had these in prior lives in other companies and it s a great way to keep fine tune the capital structure and make sure that we support our strong credit metrics and i don t think it should be a surprise to anybody on the call that we want to make sure to be prepared as we continue to invest somewhere in the next two years 1 1 million to 1 2 million in investments in our businesses that we can t reasonably finance only through debt capital and cash flow so from that standpoint i view an atm as a tool that makes sense for us it s a three year program 150 million fairly low in terms of size compared to our capitalization i think it s a reasonable program for us to put in place we as when we did our equity offering in may of last year we did that in anticipation of the spire stl pipeline and clearly it met our equity needs for the next year that s how we talked about it on the call which is why we are not activating the program right now but i think you can expect as we get later on into the year and into fiscal 20 that we ll activate the program at the right time and do it in a measured way so that we maintain those strong credit metrics over time because our expectation is we re going to continue would invest in our business and we have to keep an eye on the capital structure while we re keeping an eye on the accelerator to continue to grow michael weinstein credit suisse analyst got it and on the storage business i think you said that you expected a contribution from that next year and i think on the last call we talked about a small contribution in 2018 with kind of serve as the indication that maybe it would be earning money in 2019 so maybe you could just talk more about the timing of how that investments coming along suzanne sitherwood president and chief executive officer yeah michael so you are right that is how we spoke about it we at that time we had not secured the second facility and so now we are in the process of refining those development plans to integrate the two facilities and we ve gotten approval from the ferc as i mentioned to do just that which helps us in terms of our service offerings and the types of services we can offer so on a long term basis the combination of integrating these two facilities that they are obviously in the same territory geographically it provides us much more flexibility and again the ability to enhance our service offering so it s a little bit of go slow now to go fast because we re in a much better position with that storage facility spire storage combined and we ll speak in greater details too at the analyst day so hopefully you can join us to run we re working on those plans and we ll spend some time running through what exactly that looks like for you michael weinstein credit suisse analyst okay thank you thanks a lot and now i ll give it up to other people at this point suzanne sitherwood president and chief executive officer yeah thanks michael operator and our next question comes from shar pourreza with guggenheim partners please go ahead with your question shar pourreza guggenheim securities analyst hey good morning guys suzanne sitherwood president and chief executive officer hey shar steven p rasche executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning shar pourreza guggenheim securities analyst just two quick ones for you so on first on the stl approvals so given the fact that it s kind of behind us and construction has already commenced is there any sort of demand there to modestly upsize the pipe through other laterals of compression and the way we re thinking about it is there any incremental growth opportunities that you can get from this project suzanne sitherwood president and chief executive officer i ll give you a high flyby and mike s in here so he may want to expand on it a little bit more of it as you said the pipeline itself is under construction and the anchor customer obviously is our spire east utility and which we ve talked a lot about what flexibility that brings us in the region and it is the shipper on that pipeline but that being said there is some small amount of capacity remaining and we can add compression to it over time and we ve talked about that but as i mentioned earlier we are laser focused right now in getting that pipeline up and operating and we re very satisfied with where we are in terms of scheduling cost and mike you may want to add a little more color and that s another item we ll give you greater details on in the analyst day michael c geiselhart senior vice president strategic planning and corporate development yeah i mean we ll continue to focus on longer term opportunities to add add that shippers to that system part of it really depends on interconnected pipelines and where we end up with our chain of rocks interconnect with mrt for example as to whether that our pipeline could potentially be part of a longer path that other shippers might buy so we ll continue to work on that very much in the long term as of right now we expect to go in service with really just the one contract with the affiliate shar pourreza guggenheim securities analyst and then that s helpful and then if you take the upsizing the route the filing process i would have to assume is going to be much more rapid than what we ve seen in the past with the current pipe michael c geiselhart senior vice president strategic planning and corporate development yeah we certainly have the ability to add compression to the project there is no compression on it in its current form and that would require another filing to add compression in the future but we have a fairly long lead time in terms of what customers would be driving that expansion so we wouldn t anticipate any delay between getting that approval versus when the revenue would start to flow from any additional customers and larger capacity shar pourreza guggenheim securities analyst excellent and then just lastly it s good to see that there s obviously some pretty good growth in the marketing business is there sort of a mix you re targeting as you think about the consolidated business mix like the marketing business is becoming more and more material i guess in the end how large do you want the segment to be is there sort of a target that you re aiming for suzanne sitherwood president and chief executive officer i wouldn t say per se that we have a target but we also what we re mostly focused on is geography and the quality of our customer like i mentioned earlier with utilities which obviously we have five utility companies power generation and producers which is much like our utility operations we serve the same type of customer mix so from a earnings mix we obviously will only grow that so much based on those geography and the type of customers that we re serving and we re predominantly utility today over 90 of our earnings is utility today so we re very comfortable with where we are and we are very comfortable with the quality of team that we ve placed in our houston office and the technology and so forth that we have to support that business steven p rasche executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah and remember also shar that we ll when the pipeline comes online that adds to a regulated side of our mix and we continue to expect every business to grow and the utility continues to show strong growth so our goal is to grow every part of the pie but we are always cognizant of how the pieces play out shar pourreza guggenheim securities analyst that s perfect suzanne sitherwood president and chief executive officer and yeah i was just going to add and mike will give more color on this again at the analyst day it is a logistics business and it s logistics for to serve those customers which again is what we do everyday in the utility business shar pourreza guggenheim securities analyst got it got it so just to summarize the growth in the marketing business would commensurate with the regulated growth that you re seeing suzanne sitherwood president and chief executive officer that s right shar pourreza guggenheim securities analyst excellent thanks guys suzanne sitherwood president and chief executive officer thank you appreciate it steven p rasche executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks operator and our next question comes from dennis coleman with bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead with your question jason bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi it s jason standing in for dennis good morning suzanne sitherwood president and chief executive officer hey jason steven p rasche executive vice president and chief financial officer how are you doing jason jason bank of america merrill lynch analyst doing well thanks regarding the gas marketing again i guess maybe looking at it from the other view earnings are definitely up can you give maybe a little bit more granularity about what drove it you indicated geographic coverage and favorable market conditions can you maybe talk about how each contributed suzanne sitherwood president and chief executive officer yeah i think maybe what might be helpful is mike is in here mike provide a little color more color to this as i stated earlier michael c geiselhart senior vice president strategic planning and corporate development yeah over the last couple of years we ve been pretty methodical about putting in place a plan to kind of expand the current business model if you will into a broader geography and so a part of part of that vision and moving the business to houston was to add folks to the team that could bring existing relationships with high quality customers that would essentially fit into our existing business model and so really the way i would describe the growth it s been pretty gradual and and pretty steady and incremental and it s essentially adding new customers in new regions particularly in the gulf coast and the southeast that kind of have expanded our geographic footprint so we re just doing more of the same kind of business with the same kinds of customers and volumes are up in a lot of cases across the board as well with existing customers and so you combine that with a relatively supportive market conditions in location basis and that sort of explains the large part of the growth today jason bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay thanks for speaking to that a little bit my next question is sort of around stl and and flows coming off of rex you mentioned that stl is going to receive gas most likely from marcellus and utica we ve heard from some industry guys that and gals that they ve indicated there might be cheaper gas out of the west is there any discussion around east versus west flows michael c geiselhart senior vice president strategic planning and corporate development yeah that s an interesting point and it certainly has evolved somewhat over time i think when we originally created the project there was a clear expectation that we would use primarily rex zone 3 gas which is marcellus utica gas for the most part that we still believe that gas will be extremely cheap long term but you know part of the reason we really liked the project is upon completion our interconnect point which will be a new interconnect point on rex will be essentially the no point in terms of physical flows between west between westbound gas and eastbound gas and so we expect to have in the neighborhood of 4 bcf of total physical flows kind of meeting on the pipeline in that area and so at least for the foreseeable future we expect that to remain the no point on rex and so we would have optionality conceptually any way we d we would have optionality between both eastbound flows and westbound flows which is a pretty interesting place to be jason bank of america merrill lynch analyst definitely all right thanks for the thanks for those insights i ll i ll jump off suzanne sitherwood president and chief executive officer yeah thanks operator operator instructions and our next question comes from selman akyol with stifel please go ahead with your question selman akyol stifel nicolaus company analyst thank you good morning suzanne sitherwood president and chief executive officer hi good morning selman akyol stifel nicolaus company analyst can you talk a little bit about your 9 meter growth and i think i thought i heard you say that was supported by conversion activity as well so could you talk about that too steve lindsey executive vice president chief operating officer of distribution operations sure good morning this is steve lindsey i ll speak a little bit on behalf of utilities and so the 9 is a year over year comparison for first quarter and if you think back last year when we referenced a record year for us we had over 11 000 new meters across all of our jurisdictions and that was primarily in the residential and commercial markets as you can imagine we have had some increased activity on conversions and when we say conversions those could be propane customers on our existing system and in some areas in the in the south southwestern part of missouri we re actually looking to expand into some poultry applications where our infrastructure just isn t there now and so those would be poultry and chicken houses and those type of applications that will be converting from propane to natural gas i think it s really the build up of what we ve been putting in place over the last three years we ve become very focused we ve been really focusing our relationships with builders and developers and being there when they re making decisions as well as architects and engineers so i don t think it s any one big thing i think it s a lot of pieces that are starting to come together and as we also mentioned on our new business capital which is infrastructure that we re putting for really you know meters that are to come over the next three years we re up significantly over last year which was a big year for us as well so our focus on organic growth i think is really starting to pay off in the utilities as we continue to grow our base business selman akyol stifel nicolaus company analyst okay if i can just ask a little or dig a little deeper on that so if i asked you i guess i don t know five seven years ago about organic growth i think you probably would have said maybe 1 maybe 1 5 2 so do you think that organic growth number would be higher now i mean if we move to a plateau or a higher level say 3 what do you think about it suzanne sitherwood president and chief executive officer yeah so let me start and then i ll pass it to steve because i want i m harkening back i m thinking back reflecting back based on your question five to six years ago we started talking about organic growth on these calls and our investment in people and technology like salesforce com like the way we serve our customers like the way that we think about conversions and started implementing programs that we re seeing the fruits of that work today and we so we took the long view again on organic growth and the type of customers coupled with economic development which i talked about earlier and we re continuing to invest in organic growth for for our future and think about it and with a whole lot more commercial acumen and again that started five years ago we brought in an executive in outside the industry to run that area for us and he reports to steve and steve you may want to add a little bit more color than that steve lindsey executive vice president chief operating officer of distribution operations yeah i think when you re talking about overall net growth and so what we were referencing earlier on new meters and new business capital is on the new side obviously you ve got to keep all the customers that you have so from a retention standpoint that s an issue that you know really as recently as as two or three years ago in some of our jurisdictions we were seeing negative overall growth if you think about it on on an annual basis and so the fact that we re positive in all of our jurisdictions and continue to trend up i think is is a result of a lot of things some of the data and analytics that we re putting together we now know on a daily basis by zip code our customer either increases or decreases so that we can put together very focused programs to address that whether it s around rebates energy efficiency programs and so again i think we ve been building for the last three years a lot of data a lot of tools and now we re really starting to use those tools and data to make decisions and effectuate outcomes steven p rasche executive vice president and chief financial officer and selman i would add that we view organic growth including the commercial and industrial sector which especially when you get down to the southern parts of our service territory is a much bigger part of the overall pie so it s hard to look at net customer or residence or business growth and really equate that to an impact in our earnings because one business can be thousands of residential customers i d also add when we think about organic growth we think about it holistically and it is about managing cost and making sure that we re managing to get to the right margin and dropping the right earnings through the through the cost line and i think we ve shown that we consistently have been able to keep our cost in line and you saw that again this quarter and it s all part of that puzzle to make sure that we re doing the right thing growing but also doing the right thing for our customer and they re they re seeing the benefits in their bill in term of growth steve lindsey executive vice president chief operating officer of distribution operations yeah and and i think the last piece that suzanne mentioned in her remarks is we really have put a strong emphasis on economic development and this is in all of our jurisdictions and we ve even seen some strong things go on in the state of missouri as we focus on economic development across the state so i think more more good is to come on that as well selman akyol stifel nicolaus company analyst very good thanks i appreciate all that if you know just going over to storage you referenced sort of 39 bcf now and you re looking to expand can you say what size you re looking to take storage to michael c geiselhart senior vice president strategic planning and corporate development yeah this is mike you know we haven t what i can tell you is that you know that number is comprised of the two pieces right the 35 is the certificated capacity at ryckman and the 4 is the second facility at clear creek right now we re we re involved in very extensive kind of reservoir engineering work and geology work to really understand the potential size of the storage facility at clear creek we have only owned it since may and and i ve really kind of dug in to try and understand it it s part of the same formation as the ryckman facility so we think it has comparable size but until we finish that analysis we re really not in a position to say how much larger that clear creek facility can can be made beyond its current 4 bcf certificated capacity now when we look over on the ryckman side at this point we don t anticipate a large change in that capacity sitting here today but again that s still subject to the same kind of ongoing analysis so part of the development plan will be to refine that number and to come up with a number that is in fact going to be the certificated capacity of the two facilities on a combined basis and that will be filed with ferc at the appropriate point of time selman akyol stifel nicolaus company analyst okay and then you guys commented that storage ran loss at this quarter do you anticipate storage run losses every quarter this year or do you expect that to moderate as we approach 2020 steven p rasche executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah it s fair question selman we expect as we start ramping up the development plan that we should start moving closer and closer to earnings contribution we ll get into more detail we still have to finish the development plan and i think the important point to take away is we re looking we always try to make the right decision for the medium and long term and we see a great opportunity for even more value in the medium and long term and we think it s the right thing to do to make sure we re driving for the for the right balance of investment and return which is why to the question earlier we re willing to accept no earnings contribution and some subsidy this year because we think in the medium to long term that s the best place to be for our customers and also for our investors selman akyol stifel nicolaus company analyst all right thank you very much suzanne sitherwood president and chief executive officer thank you operator operator instructions and our next question comes from richard sunderland with jpmorgan please go ahead with your question richard sunderland jp morgan analyst hi good morning just wanted to follow up on some of the marketing commentary earlier it seems like the performance and the strength year over year might be putting you a little bit ahead of plan could you frame sort of the performance in q1 and maybe even revisit the expectations from last year the 0 17 non recurring outperformance there steven p rasche executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah rich this is steve clearly there are two components if you think about the marketing business at the 5 000 foot level there are two components to think about one is the building the base business additional relationships additional contracts more storage transport that we can optimize that s the fundamental way in which we grow the business over the long term and mike geiselhart spoke to that in a few minutes ago the second part is the icing on the cake and what s going on with the market and are the market opportunities creating unusual or opportunities that marketing businesses deal with everyday to optimize those investments is specifically in the assets and clearly through the first three months of this year we ve seen some strong market conditions let s face it price volatility we saw in the early part of our year right as we were getting into the fall in the early winter with a four handle plus on gas and volatility and the early cold did give us some opportunities in the marketing business and that s what marketing businesses do they take advantage of opportunities that may be intra day much less over a longer period of time but as we know markets change relatively quickly henry hub traded at 2 54 last night so the price volatility that we saw early in the season now that we re through the polar vortex and we really didn t see price spikes except for a single day we have to look at this business over the long term and i m we re not willing at this point to speak to what it looks like for the full year because as we look at the rest of the year especially going into the last part of the winter and into spring the market fundamentals are easing off a little bit for all the reasons that we talked about and it really starts with weather what we will do and we do this every year is we ll take a look at our performance after we get through the winter heating season and then make an assessment on how do we think about that in totality and how do we think about that going forward so that you all can understand the baseline for the business but i think mike s comments earlier stand we expect every business to grow and we re investing in a great team and relationships and everything else associated with that to grow that business in the right way doing what we do now which is physically procure and deliver gas and over time we expect that business to grow that s the fundamental part that you all should come to expect every year richard sunderland jp morgan analyst great thanks steve and just a few mechanical ones here the storage investment balance as of the quarter i m curious as to where that stands and then also if there are agency thresholds that you guys monitor for sort of the non regulated business versus total business mix steven p rasche executive vice president and chief financial officer the second the second piece gets back to the question that was asked earlier about mix of business and we obviously take a look at all of our businesses we expect them to grow it d be financed in a conservative fashion and ultimately we will and continue to be a largely regulated business but you have to look underneath the businesses because that s a surfacing comment right now as we stand today roughly 40 of the customers that we serve in marketing are utilities and power generation so under deals that can extend over a period of time which is a clearly different customer base than what you see with a pure marketer who might be selling into other places or to other marketers and the same as we developed the storage business our goal is to make that facility attractive to utilities power generators lng providers the kind of folks who need long term reliable storage services and in that vein the complexion of that business and how we think about that business changes so that s how we think about the mix of business we re clearly aware of where the guidelines are we know our peers really well and we understand how to think about that and actively exercise that internally to make sure that we are comfortable with where we are where we are driving but again we expect every one of our businesses to grow that s one of the tenets of our underlying business in terms of overall investment we re not quite at the 100 million mark this quarter if you look at the capital spend that we had this year or this quarter of 207 million about two thirds of that investment was in the utility and the other third was between the pipeline and the storage business and i think it was probably nearly 40 million in the storage business maybe it s 45 million in fact it is 45 million and the rest was in the pipeline as we now we ll see that ramp up fairly significantly going through the rest of the year so that s kind of where we stand right now and as suzanne mentioned on the in the prepared remarks we ll we ll update that not only the development plan for storage but how that impacts our go forward view on investment and capital and base gas and other things that you need in order to adequately operate a storage facility once we have finalized that plan richard sunderland jp morgan analyst great thank you for the update operator and our next question comes from andrew levi with exoduspoint please go ahead with your question andrew levi exoduspoint analyst hi good morning guys suzanne sitherwood president and chief executive officer hi andy good morning steven p rasche executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning andy andrew levi exoduspoint analyst great pictures in the hand out of you two suzanne sitherwood president and chief executive officer thanks we ll give corporate communication a little credit on that one andrew levi exoduspoint analyst yeah that s inaudible it s not scott okay but there you both look good just two very simple questions just on the atm just for modeling purposes how much should we kind of put into our earnings model a year like should it be 50 million 75 million any type of guidance you could give us on that steven p rasche executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah andy i can t give you any more guidance at this point it s a three year program i did mention that we expected to meet our needs for the next couple of years and we clearly haven t activated the program at this point and we ll update you all in the next call where where we stand on that i think you ll have to figure out a reasonable way to trip that over time as you because i know you will you will put yourself in our shoes and look at our capital structure and our credit metrics to make sure that we keep everything in balance andrew levi exoduspoint analyst and should we be more focused on the ffo to debt or your equity ratio steven p rasche executive vice president and chief financial officer actually we look at all of those and a few others our ffo to debt we re in the swim lane that would support our current credit ratings but it s something over time that we have a commitment to continue to improve andrew levi exoduspoint analyst and then the equity ratio at 51 at the end of the quarter is that kind of where you want to be as well steven p rasche executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah we ve worked really hard to get to the more equity than leverage on our long term capital structure we would like to keep that powder dry because we think that s the right place to be for us and that our investors actually appreciate that what you will see and continue to see andy is a continuing shift of the leverage and where it sits we continue to draw down the leverage at the holding company which is shareholder debt as we continue to borrow at the right times and we talked about a couple of those in the prepared remarks at the operating company the utilities where we get regulatory recovery i think you ll continue to see that and that s another component of that of the overall mix and that s at hold co debt as a percentage of total debt we ve been very successful and continue to driving that down and it s one of our commitments to ourselves to our board and to our investors andrew levi exoduspoint analyst got it and then just separately just on the weather just in missouri and alabama kind of interested as kind of overall growth ph companies within your area how could you can you categorize the weather in the fourth quarter and then maybe what i mean not the fourth quarter your first quarter and then kind of what you re seeing in the second quarter to just kind of hot cold hot cold so kind of where we stand weather wise whether it s in your southern service territory or your technical difficulty american service territory and then i have one more follow up to that steve lindsey executive vice president chief operating officer of distribution operations i ll take a shot this is steve i m not a weather expert but relative to just norms worried about this steve i think you mentioned this about 12 colder on average for the quarter than last year and about 10 from normal but as we all know there s variability so you might have as you described some very very cold periods followed by some warm so you have some cyclical periods and the one thing i will say too is as we talked about our capital we were able to have in essence of 40 increase in the utility capital spend first quarter year over year and that was in spite of some of the more challenging weather conditions so i think it clearly helps from a margin perspective as you ve seen and we went through those examples as well as we ve been able to manage it from a construction perspective in the south i think it s been again it s been up and down quite a bit we ve had some very warm periods followed by some very cold so i think when you get into averaging it might be pretty close to average there but we ve had some rain some snow and then some warm period so it was a little bit of a mix and for the quarter that we re in right now obviously this week we saw extreme conditions and the one thing i will say is that our systems across the board held up very well and i think a lot of that goes to a lot of the reinforcement and infrastructure upgrades that we put in place over the last five years so i think if you put all these things together we ve operated very well we continue to grow our system and from a margin perspective i think we re doing about as well as we could expect at this point in the year suzanne sitherwood president and chief executive officer and the flow through of that here as you think about it the way that we read meters and the way we cycle those meters through the month and then the way that data cycles through the rate design in those areas is how it flows to the bottom line it all arrives eventually but the timing from a quarter by quarter perspective is driven obviously by the way those meters some are read at first of the month on cycles some at the middle some at the end every day we re reading meters and then that s where technology on a longer term basis and again we ll speak more about that at the analyst day our deploying meter reading technology and how we think about designing those rates even in these last rate resets that was very much topical so again it s the math shows up the calendarization of the meter reads and also there s rate design have impact but again over time it all flows to the bottom line it s more of a timing perspective and i think you had one more question i didn t want to cut you off andrew levi exoduspoint analyst yeah that s fine and then just guidance wise just to understand kind of where you started kind of where you are today and just focusing on the gas storage and on the marketing so are you kind of where you expected to be when you gave guidance in both of those areas or a little better or little worse maybe you can tell us on that suzanne sitherwood president and chief executive officer yeah so i look at it this way so our gas companies we have five gas companies and how they collectively come in and then our gas related businesses marketing storage and pipeline and from a gas related businesses perspective we re actually where we expect it to come in in fact feeling a little better same thing with the gas company the utilities there s five of them and they re doing well on all performance metrics and i know we ve had a lot of conversations so far about gas related businesses as well as the utilities and when i think of them collectively and when we think of them collectively we are physically moving gas for customers be it residential customers or in a utility or small businesses large industrial or power generators and our gas related business as well as our utilities are every day physically moving gas for those customers the difference obviously with the utility side regulated by the state other regulation ferc or other criteria for gas related businesses that fundamentally which is what i ve been doing for 38 years we re physically moving gas for these customers to use it to keep their homes warm heat hot water improve their business processes or generate power and so we pull those together and we manage it collectively andrew levi exoduspoint analyst okay thank you steven p rasche executive vice president and chief financial

the dollar having been down by more than half a percent at one point carney s more upbeat tone on the country s prospects in the event of a deal was likely an important factor in this while he ll no doubt also be pleased with his ability to dodge those questions that threatened to put him on the front pages for the wrong reasons again while it s interesting to hear the central banks views on the outlook despite the huge uncertainty that still exists something he repeatedly referred to as fog it s clear that we ll have to wait until may to get a better idea on the path of interest rates not only will the brexit fog have cleared we ll also have a better idea of whether the global economic slowdown is progressing as is now widely expected carney was keen to stress that the economic

today arcelormittal forecasted a slowdown in chinese steel demand to 1 5 this year from 3 5 in 2018 notes fairly stable demand from autos and construction offset by falling machinery output oxford economics revises iron ore price forecast we have increased our iron ore price forecast to average 75 t in q1 from 67 t however we still expect prices to pull back this year averaging 68 t in 2019 although production has been impacted at the feijão mine we still expect strong supply this year due to australian miners increasing output to make up for shortfalls in brazilian production vale s s11d mine is also expected to ramp up output this year and there is still spare capacity at some of vale s existing mines we therefore expect a total reduction of 15 million tonnes from the global seaborne market but more significantly iron ore demand is expected to fall this year at a faster rate than supply due to slowing economic growth in china which will result in steel production growth slowing to 2 5 y y in 2019 however a court ruling in brazil has recently suspended operations at the brucutu mine with 30 million tonnes of capacity vale has argued the court ruling is unjust and is fighting to resume operations at this facility as soon as possible if vale is unsuccessful in its appeal other producers will be hard pressed to make up the shortfall at the moment it is hard to tell what the outcome will be but an extended closure of the brucutu mine will certainly drive prices higher and we expect iron ore will average 80 t in 2019 if vale is forced to close the brucutu mine for an extended period lme nickel added 0 5 per cent to close at us12 985 a tonne after touching us13 350 on wednesday its highest since august 31 partly on worries about top producer vale after last

america u s gaap our management uses certain non gaap measures to analyze our results of operations assess internal performance against budgeted and forecasted amounts and evaluate future impacts to our financial performance as a result of capital investments acquisitions divestitures and other strategic projects these measures are important factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include financial non gaap measures ebitda u s gaap based net earnings before interest income taxes and depreciation and amortization expense distributable cash flow u s gaap based

minus amounts recognized as ngl expense divided by our ngl sales volumes in barrels and average wholesale fuel sales margin per gallon wholesale fuel revenues minus wholesale s cost of fuel divided by

liquidity in conjunction with our u s gaap results including but not limited to our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded partnerships in the midstream energy industry without regard to historical cost basis or financing methods the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to our unitholders our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures and the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities management also uses these measures to assess internal performance and we believe they may provide meaningful supplemental information to the users of our financial statements non gaap measures have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect net earnings operating income and net cash from operating activities these measures should not be considered substitutes for their most directly comparable u s gaap financial measures see reconciliation of amounts reported under u s gaap segment reconciliation of amounts reported under u s gaap average margin on ngl sales per barrel

operations may not be comparable to the historical results of operations for the reasons described below acquisitions and mergers other than wnrl and certain assets acquired from the 2018 drop down our predecessors did not record revenues with andeavor and our predecessors recorded general and administrative expenses and financed operations differently than the partnership as previously mentioned on august 6 2018 we completed the 2018 drop down for total consideration of 1 55 billion as an entity under common control with andeavor who merged with and became a wholly owned subsidiary of marathon petroleum corporation mpc effective october 1 2018 we accounted for the transfers of businesses as if the transfer occurred at the beginning of the period and prior periods are retrospectively adjusted to furnish comparative information accordingly the accompanying results of operations have been retrospectively adjusted to include the historical results of the assets acquired prior to the effective date of the acquisition on november 8 2017 we acquired the anacortes logistics assets from a subsidiary of andeavor for total consideration of 445 million the anacortes logistics assets include crude oil feedstock and refined products storage at mpc s anacortes refinery the anacortes marine terminal with feedstock and refined product throughput a manifest rail facility and crude oil and refined products pipelines effective october 30 2017 andeavor logistics closed its merger with western refining logistics lp the wnrl merger wnrl s operations included terminalling and storage assets crude oil and refined product transportation services and a wholesale fuels business the wnrl merger was treated as a transaction of entities under common control thus andeavor logistics results reflect the operations financial position and cash flows associated with wnrl and their related subsidiaries as of june 1 2017 the closing of the wnrl merger was conditioned upon among other things the adoption and effectiveness of the second amended and restated agreement of limited partnership of andeavor logistics lp pursuant to which simultaneously with the closing of the wnrl merger i the incentive distribution rights in andeavor logistics the idrs held by tesoro logistics gp llc tlgp our general partner were canceled the idr exchange ii the general partner interests in andeavor logistics held by tlgp were converted into a non economic general partner interest in andeavor logistics and iii andeavor as well as mpc for periods after october 1 2018 and

marija majdoub is the vice president of the investment management and strategy team at md financial management she leads the team of portfolio managers and investment professionals responsible for managing the firm s mutual funds and investment pools and developing md s investment views canada s weather this winter has been erratic with snow rain sleet and frigid temperatures with the canadian dollar floating around 75 us cents right now you could say that it s been a few years of rough weather for the loonie since it hit us 1 05 in 2011 however toward the end of last year my team and i became more positive on the prospects for the canadian dollar let me explain why with raised levels of global economic uncertainty 2018 ended with more questions than answers in particular the growth paths of china and the euro zone two of the three pillars of the global economy remain uncertain the third pillar the u s economy is still robust but as i pointed out in my last article is expected to slow in 2019 in comparison the canadian economic outlook remains quite good and the growth path is more certain growth in 2019 is in line with the economy s long term potential and what s more revealing is that there is less dispersion among forecasts than any other group of 10 currency we did see the bank of canada revise 2019 growth downward in its january monetary policy report not surprising given recent market volatility and the aforementioned uncertainty but the 2020 forecast was revised upward with the u s economy likely to slow through 2020 this relative pickup in growth could give the loonie a boost later this year great news for savers and another positive sign for the first time since the global financial crisis we will likely see short term interest rates rise above inflation in 2019 at least in north america this is an important reminder that we are still recovering from the worst financial calamity since the great depression separately oil prices have stabilized somewhat after global supply concerns and the potential ramifications of iran sanctions proved excessive we view oil prices as range bound going forward staying between the marginal cost of u s shale production and the cap set by a semi compliant opec 2 0 arrangement that being said near term geopolitical risks remain elevated so we believe commodities will be modestly supportive of the canadian dollar over all despite continuing transport challenges even from a secular perspective which admittedly has less influence on currencies in the near term the canadian dollar is undervalued relative to the u s dollar in our modelling what could make this seemingly rosy outlook for the canadian dollar go sideways there are a few scenarios that could see the u s dollar remain at its current level relative to the loonie for this we need to revisit the pillars of the global economy first the carry forward of strength we saw in the december u s jobs report combined with a calming of financial market conditions could give the u s federal reserve the impetus to return to a more hawkish stance next an extended slowdown in china and the euro zone could see an increased flow to the u s dollar the world s reserve currency in search of liquidity and safety all things considered there appears to be a few tailwinds supporting the loonie here in the early part of 2019 our economic growth is still above potential the growth path appears more certain and oil prices have bounced back from late 2018 woes perhaps conditions are just right for a thawing of the canadian dollar

connor chief executive officer thanks bill good morning everyone and thanks for joining our fiscal 2019 first quarter earnings call our strong earnings and momentum from 2018 continued into our first quarter of fiscal 2019 despite most banks reporting a decline in trading revenues in the december quarter we reported a 25 increase in operating revenues from a year ago and up 9 sequentially from q4 all of our businesses recorded strong increases in transactional volumes with the only exception being fx prime brokerage all of our segments except commercial hedging showed double digit growth in both operating revenue and segment income commercial hedging had stronger transactional volume growth but reduced revenues segment income was a record in our global payments and clearing execution services segment as well as in our equity capital markets business because of increased volatility and market share we achieved an increase in pre tax income of 31 versus a year ago and up 19 sequentially from q4 net earnings were 18 2 million versus a loss of 6 9 million a year ago due to the impact of the new tax legislation in the prior year period this also represented a 16 growth in net income over the immediately preceding fourth quarter our eps was 0 94 a share and our roe was just over 14 on a trailing 12 month basis our eps is now 4 18 per share some highlights before i hand off to bill we had some noise in our numbers this quarter which i would like to highlight in our commercial hedging segment our structured product and otc business was negatively affected by approximately 11 million in unrealized mark to market losses at the end of the first quarter this was due to year end lack of liquidity which was more severe than normal this year which caused some longer dated positions to trade away from fair value these positions were directly directionally hedged as we always do and as of today the bulk of those unrealized losses reversed and we expect this will continue until these positions roll off later in the year in addition operating revenues in our precious metals business were affected by a 1 6 million unrealized mark to market loss on hedges placed against inventory carried at lower cost of market we had a similar situation in the prior quarter when we reported an unrealized mark to market loss of 1 3 million which reversed in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 on the positive side we recorded a 2 4 million bad debt recovery realized upon the final settlement of outstanding liabilities relating to the physical coal matter and also received a 2 million settlement in our favor net of legal fees which was related to the barclays last look foreign exchange class action matter the net impact of all of these items was to reduce our pre tax income for the quarter by approximately 8 2 million our core operating results excluding these items was well in excess of our target roe making this one of our better quarters to date our equity capital markets business also had a record quarter adding 20 million in operating revenues versus the prior year as we benefited from increased market share increased volatility and better revenue capture as we internalize more trading spreads dollar volume was up an impressive 75 from a year ago and revenue capture improved about 15 global payments achieved record quarterly operating revenues and record segment income which was up 27 from a year ago and up 18 consecutively this was due to an increase in both transactional volume and revenue capture this was the first time our global payments was the largest in terms of segment income over the past four quarters this business has generated an impressive 64 million in segment income with a 61 margin on operating revenues our clearing execution services segment also had a record segment income for the quarter with strong performances in futures securities clearing and voice brokerage in january we closed the acquisition we mentioned last quarter of gmp securities which brings over 2 400 institutional relationships and product capabilities focused in high yield convertibles emerging market debt and certain equities we have started integrating the two broker dealers and believe that there is a good cross sell opportunity between our rates business and gmp s business lastly on the optionsellers matter the aggregate receivable due from these clients declined modestly to 29 4 million we are continuing to aggressively pursue collection of amounts due to us we have done a detailed assessment of the collectability of visa counts and have concluded we do not have a sufficient basis to determine an allowance against these balances at this time as we move through the collection process and additional information becomes available we ll continue to evaluate the likelihood of collection and consider the need for an allowance against these amounts outstanding with that i will hand you over to bill dunaway for a more detailed discussion of our financial results bill william j dunaway chief financial officer thank you sean i ll be referring to slides and the information we have made available as part of the webcast specifically starting with slide number 3 which shows our performance over the last five fiscal quarters the chart depicts our net income earnings per share and roe over the last five quarters as shown net income in the first quarter of 2019 was 18 2 million which represents a 2 5 million improvement over the immediately preceding quarter in the prior year comparative quarter we reported a net loss of 6 9 million however in that period we recorded a charge to income tax expense related to the enactment of tax reform in the amount of 20 9 million moving onto slide number four which represents a bridge between operating revenues for the first quarter of last year to the current period operating revenues were a record 264 7 million in the current period up 52 1 million or 25 over the prior year as shown all operating segments showed revenue growth over the prior year with the exception of commercial hedging this growth was led by our securities segment which added 26 million or 60 in operating revenue versus the prior year within this segment equity capital markets had a record quarter adding 20 million in operating revenues versus the prior year as the dollar volume increased 75 in addition debt capital markets added 6 3 million in operating revenues primarily driven by an increase in interest income in our domestic business driven by higher short term interest rates which was partially offset by weaker revenues from our argentina and municipal securities businesses our clearing execution services segment added 23 million or 32 in operating revenue as compared to the prior year driven by a 14 5 million increase in exchange traded revenues as volumes increased by 57 versus the prior year also contributing to the growth in exchange traded revenues was a 4 3 million increase in interest income related to 7 growth in average client balances and higher short term interest rates also in this segment operating revenues and fx prime brokerage revenues increased 2 8 million primarily related to the class action settlement received as mentioned by sean higher interest rates drove a 2 3 million increase in correspondent clearing while independent wealth management and derivative voice brokerage each added 1 7 million in operating revenues versus the prior year operating revenues in our global payments segment added 5 1 million or 21 versus the prior year to a record 29 7 million as the number of payments increased 7 and the average revenue per payment increased 13 versus the prior year this growth was driven by increased activity from our international banking clients as well as increased activity from nongovernmental organizations physical commodities added to 3 7 million or 35 in operating revenues versus the prior year driven by a 2 4 million increase in precious metals off strong volume growth which was tempered by the 1 6 million unrealized mark to market loss sean mentioned earlier in addition physical ag energy operating revenues added 1 3 million versus the prior year finally operating revenues declined in our commercial hedging segment by 1 7 million versus the prior year to 59 8 million exchange traded volumes increased 8 and otc volumes grew by 25 versus the prior year however overall revenues declined due to the unrealized mark to market loss sean mentioned earlier exchange volumes increased as a result of increased client activity in the domestic grain markets latin american soft commodity and in our lme business otc volumes increased driven by increased client activity in energy grain and soft commodity markets in addition interest income in this business increased 83 to 7 7 million driven by short term rates and a 14 increase in average client equity to 1 billion the net decline in unallocated overhead operating revenues includes the 2 2 million loss on economic hedges in place against the effect of the devaluation of the argentine peso which was partially offset by revaluation gains in our debt capital markets and asset management businesses in that country the next slide number five represents a bridge from 2018 first quarter pre tax income of 18 6 million to pre tax income of 24 4 million in the current period commercial hedging segment income declined 7 8 million as a result of the decline in operating revenues i just mentioned combined with a 4 1 million increase in variable expenses and a 1 9 million increase in non variable direct expenses global payments added 4 million in segment income to a record 18 6 million while the ces segment added 7 2 million versus the prior year in addition off the back of strong gains in equity capital markets revenue somewhat tempered by higher interest expense in the debt capital markets business our securities segment added 5 million versus the prior year segment income the physical commodities segment added 4 8 million in segment income versus the prior year as a result of the increase in operating revenues combined with the 2 4 million bad debt recovery in the current period while the prior year period included a 1 million expense on bad debt on physical coal slide number 6 shows the interest in fee income on our investment of client funds and our exchange traded futures and options businesses as well as client balances held in our correspondent clearing and independent wealth management businesses as noted on this slide earnings on these balances have increased 7 1 million versus the prior year to 17 9 million as our yield on these balances has increased 76 basis points to 2 21 in the current period the bottom of this slide shows the potential annualized interest rate sensitivity which the balances held at the end of the current period have based upon an increase in short term rates at various levels as shown a 100 basis point increase in short term rate has the potential to increase our net income by 15 9 million or 0 83 per share on an annualized basis moving onto slide number 7 our quarterly financial dashboard i would just highlight a couple items of note variable expenses represented 62 9 of our total expenses for the quarter well above our average of keeping more than 50 of our total expenses variable in nature non variable expenses which are made up of both fixed expenses and bad debt expense increased 2 1 million excluding a 3 3 million positive swing in bad debt expense versus the prior year non variable expenses increased 5 4 million primarily driven by higher trade systems and market data costs non trading technology costs and non variable compensation and benefits we reported net income of 18 2 million in the first quarter for a 14 1 return on equity slightly below our stated target of 15 finally in closing out the review of the quarterly results our average revenue per employee increased 16 to 616 000 on an annualized basis and our book value per share increased 4 08 to close out the quarter at 27 64 per share we did not repurchase any of our common stock during the first quarter with that i would like to turn it back to sean to wrap up sean m o connor chief executive officer unlike many of our competitors and banks we recorded one of our best quarters in terms of core operating performance our model allows us to offer a wide range of products and capabilities to our clients making us more relevant to each client and in turn making each client more valuable to us with more diversified and predictable revenues furthermore unlike more narrowly focused firms we can leverage our central infrastructure and capital across many different business lines creating operational leverage and producing better returns on capital this business model offering our clients vertically integrated execution and clearing in all major asset classes is being validated both through our increased market share as well as through our financial performance which we believe is best in class we believe that this is a winning formula for both our clients and our investors with that i d like to turn it back to the operator and open up for a question and answer session operator questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions first question comes from paul dwyer from punch associates your line is now open paul dwyer punch associates analyst hey good morning guys sean m o connor chief executive officer hey paul paul dwyer punch associates analyst to start maybe can we talk about your ability to drive operating leverage on the unallocated cost relative to segment income and just kind of how you think about how fast unallocated costs will grow in the future sean m o connor chief executive officer good question we are very focused on trying to keep our central overhead cost increases well below the rate at which our segment income grows i mean that s what causes our operational leverage and to do that what we are working on is really two things to more tightly integrate our offerings systems wise and support wise to try and eliminate costs and create synergies so for example we ve acquired a lot of businesses over time we don t want to have a separate accounting team separate credit team separate compliance teams we re trying to sort of centralize those things and then the second thing we re doing which is probably costing us money in the short term is we need to build a much more scalable infrastructure so that and this is our objective is that every incremental transaction really cost us close to zero and at the moment we are trying to drive that through technology so if you look probably over the last three years or four years we ve had pretty substantial uplifts in our technology spend as we re trying to achieve that and we re not trying to do it sort of in a big bang approach i think that could be highly detrimental people who try to sort of introduce enterprisewide systems normally fail but we re spending a lot of money on trying to get to a more scalable infrastructure i think we are making progress on that side and i think that cost will start to flatten and hopefully that will allow us to achieve that objective of keeping our central overhead cost growth lower than the growth in our segment income so those are two things we re trying to do is create the internal synergies where we can and organize ourselves smarter and i think we ve done a reasonably good job of that and build better technology and we re sort of three years four years in to a pretty big incremental build and i think that will be ongoing for a while but i think we re starting to see some good progress on that side did that answer your question paul paul dwyer punch associates analyst yes it does i think and then so are there costs running through this that will fall off eventually or is it more that the things will moderate sean m o connor chief executive officer yes we always think when you sort of agree to these big it uplifts in costs that maybe they ll go away i don t think actually that s realistic what i m hoping is that will flatten and those costs will allow us to create more scalable infrastructure and they will flatten in absolute terms so i wouldn t think that you should anticipate our costs reducing but if we do our jobs right our cost should flatten at some point paul dwyer punch associates analyst okay two more questions if that s all right sean m o connor chief executive officer yes sure go ahead paul dwyer punch associates analyst what do you think is a reasonable timing to have some sort of estimate for this optionsellers potential bad debt sean m o connor chief executive officer okay i obviously can t go into too much detail because we re sort of involved in litigation all around here but honestly this is going to be multiple quarters before i think we have a clearer picture we are going through a legal process that s most likely going to involve an arbitration of some sort we are filing all that paperwork now so i think toward the end of this fiscal year we should have much greater clarity i mean that s the part of this that i can tell you right now it s certainly not going to be resolved in the next three months or something i mean that s for sure paul dwyer punch associates analyst okay that s fine and then can you talk so i understand short term interest rate movement of the business and how that impacts it can you talk a little bit about how the slope of the yield curve impacts earnings sean m o connor chief executive officer well two thoughts on that so firstly we have a float and our float is pretty much sitting at the 3 month t bill rate we invest that both with banks and in t bills so that s probably a good proxy so that s sort of the bulk of our net interest carry right we have historically and if i go back three four years ago when the t bill rate was basically zero we did see an opportunity to create a ladder after two years because we were basically getting 60 70 basis points at the two year mark so we created a ladder of treasuries which just sort of rolled off and we just replaced them which allowed us to actually capture on average about 50 basis points and this is from memory i may be a little bit off but about 50 basis points when the short term rate was zero we will use the yield curve if it presents an opportunity to us i don t think we ll ever want a ladder our exposure out beyond more than say two years as you know that s kind of very flat right now so it doesn t present us an opportunity to enhance our yield over what we re getting now on the short term basis so that s kind of one part of it the second part of it is in our rates business we carry fairly large inventories in mortgage backed and other things which are hedged and are funded and they are largely funded at about the three year three month rate and obviously they earn a rate that s slightly higher honestly the hedges end up probably negating a lot of that yield curve benefit we might get but oftentimes there s just a little dip we kind of squeeze out there but i don t think it s material so if we didn t hedge those positions obviously we d be getting kind of a carry on the yield curve if there was one but honestly we don t see much of that just because we hedge everything does that answer your question paul okay paul dwyer punch associates analyst yes they do and then just last for me is kind of what the m a landscape looks like for you going forward and kind of where do you what s interesting you and where do you want to go next for acquisitions sean m o connor chief executive officer yes this is always kind of a funny conversation we have with people because as you know we ve done maybe 20 m a deals over the last sort of 10 years but we certainly don t have a list on the wall somewhere of companies we d like to buy i mean i think that s very dangerous you end up sort of falling in love with things and overpaying but what we do do is we have got ourselves known as a potential buyer that can move quickly that executes and can close transactions and as a result of that we see what s going on so we re definitely in the flow of acquisitions and just to give you some sense of it during 2018 we probably were presented with roughly 50 opportunities that we looked at we probably got pretty seriously engaged on maybe 10 and we sort of did two i think so yes we re pretty disciplined and picky we will continue that process and what we re really looking for is businesses that either bring clients or capabilities we don t have first of all and businesses we can add value to there s no point in us buying something that we can t do a lot with so we want businesses that can do better on our platform we can add value to that can cross sell to our clients whatever it is so that s sort of our basic screen and we ll keep looking so we re pretty opportunistic i would say as we fill out our offering i think there s less things that fit and you start to look at things that are maybe more duplicative and then you re sort of just thinking about cost synergies up until now we really haven t done a lot of transactions that are just driven by cost synergies but we re probably going to start to see that a little more and i think as we ve grown and become known in the market we re also seeing talent just wanting to move across to us so we ve actually recruited a lot of pretty senior people that are bringing with them their relationships so that s obviously another way you grow your business i mean it s almost like buying small decks of business right so that s sort of our approach we don t have any big deals in the works we don t want to sort of chase anyone we want to be nimble we want to be disciplined and we want to be patient in how we build out our business and frankly our business is doing great so we don t feel compelled or under pressure to have to do something to change our trajectory i mean we are making better returns than any of our competitors we are seeing customers onboarding with us and we re seeing talent wanting to work here so it seems like what we re doing is good and therefore we are afforded the luxury of being disciplined and i think we want to stay that way is that helpful paul paul dwyer punch associates analyst okay yes yes that s very helpful i d agree really nice quarter guys that s all i have so thanks sean we will talk again soon sean m o connor chief executive officer thanks for the questions appreciate it paul dwyer punch associates analyst yeah bye bye operator operator instructions

year driven by a 2 4 million increase in precious metals off strong volume growth which was tempered by the 1 6 million unrealized mark to market loss sean mentioned earlier in addition physical ag energy operating revenues added 1 3 million versus the prior year finally operating revenues declined in our commercial hedging segment by 1 7 million versus the prior year to 59 8 million exchange traded volumes increased 8 and otc volumes grew by 25 versus the prior year however overall revenues declined due to the unrealized mark to market loss sean mentioned earlier exchange volumes increased as a result of increased client activity in the domestic grain markets latin american soft commodity and in our lme business otc volumes increased driven by increased client activity in energy grain and soft commodity markets in addition interest income in this business increased 83 to 7 7 million driven by short term rates and a 14 increase in average client equity to 1 billion the net decline in unallocated overhead operating revenues includes the 2 2 million loss on economic hedges in place against the effect of the devaluation of the argentine peso which was partially offset by revaluation gains in our debt capital markets and asset management businesses in that country the next slide number five represents a bridge from 2018 first quarter pre tax income of 18 6 million to pre tax income of 24 4 million in the current period commercial hedging segment income declined 7 8 million as a result of the decline in operating revenues i just mentioned combined with a 4 1 million increase in variable expenses and a 1 9 million increase in non variable direct expenses global payments added 4 million in segment income to a record 18 6 million while the ces segment added 7 2 million versus the prior year in addition off the back of strong gains in equity capital markets revenue somewhat tempered by higher interest expense in the debt capital markets business our securities segment added 5 million versus the prior year segment income the physical commodities segment added 4 8 million in segment income versus the prior year as a result of the increase in operating revenues combined with the 2 4 million bad debt recovery in the current period while the prior year period included a 1 million expense on bad debt on physical coal slide number 6 shows the interest in fee income on our investment of client funds and our exchange traded futures and options businesses as well as client balances held in our correspondent clearing and independent wealth management businesses as noted on this slide earnings on these balances have increased 7 1 million versus the prior year to 17 9 million as our yield on these balances has increased 76 basis points to 2 21 in the current period the bottom of this slide shows the potential annualized interest rate sensitivity which the balances held at the end of the current period have based upon an increase in short term rates at various levels as shown a 100 basis point increase in short term rate has the potential to increase our net income by 15 9 million or 0 83 per share on an annualized basis moving onto slide number 7 our quarterly financial dashboard i would just highlight a couple items of note variable expenses represented 62 9 of our total expenses for the quarter well above our average of keeping more than 50 of our total expenses variable in nature non variable expenses which are made up of both fixed expenses and bad debt expense increased 2 1 million excluding a 3 3 million positive swing in bad debt expense versus the prior year non variable expenses increased 5 4 million primarily driven by higher trade systems and market data costs non trading technology costs and non variable compensation and benefits we reported net income of 18 2 million in the first quarter for a 14 1 return on equity slightly below our stated target of 15 finally in closing out the review of the quarterly results our average revenue per employee increased 16 to 616 000 on an annualized basis and our book value per share increased 4 08 to close out the quarter at 27 64 per share we did not repurchase any of our common stock during the first quarter with that i would like to turn it back to sean to wrap up sean m o connor chief executive officer unlike many of our competitors and banks we recorded one of our best quarters in terms of core operating performance our model allows us to offer a wide range of products and capabilities to our clients making us more relevant to each client and in turn making each client more valuable to us with more diversified and predictable revenues furthermore unlike more narrowly focused firms we can leverage our central infrastructure and capital across many different business lines creating operational leverage and producing better returns on capital this business model offering our clients vertically integrated execution and clearing in all major asset classes is being validated both through our increased market share as well as through our financial performance which we believe is best in class we believe that this is a winning formula for both our clients and our investors with that i d like to turn it back to the operator and open up for a question and answer session operator questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions first question comes from paul dwyer from punch associates your line is now open paul dwyer punch associates analyst hey good morning guys sean m o connor chief executive officer hey paul paul dwyer punch associates analyst to start maybe can we talk about your ability to drive operating leverage on the unallocated cost relative to segment income and just kind of how you think about how fast unallocated costs will grow in the future sean m o connor chief executive officer good question we are very focused on trying to keep our central overhead cost increases well below the rate at which our segment income grows i mean that s what causes our operational leverage and to do that what we are working on is really two things to more tightly integrate our offerings systems wise and support wise to try and eliminate costs and create synergies so for example we ve acquired a lot of businesses over time we don t want to have a separate accounting team separate credit team separate compliance teams we re trying to sort of centralize those things and then the second thing we re doing which is probably costing us money in the short term is we need to build a much more scalable infrastructure so that and this is our objective is that every incremental transaction really cost us close to zero and at the moment we are trying to drive that through technology so if you look probably over the last three years or four years we ve had pretty substantial uplifts in our technology spend as we re trying to achieve that and we re not trying to do it sort of in a big bang approach i think that could be highly detrimental people who try to sort of introduce enterprisewide systems normally fail but we re spending a lot of money on trying to get to a more scalable infrastructure i think we are making progress on that side and i think that cost will start to flatten and hopefully that will allow us to achieve that objective of keeping our central overhead cost growth lower than the growth in our segment income so those are two things we re trying to do is create the internal synergies where we can and organize ourselves smarter and i think we ve done a reasonably good job of that and build better technology and we re sort of three years four years in to a pretty big incremental build and i think that will be ongoing for a while but i think we re starting to see some good progress on that side did that answer your question paul paul dwyer punch associates analyst yes it does i think and then so are there costs running through this that will fall off eventually or is it more that the things will moderate sean m o connor chief executive officer yes we always think when you sort of agree to these big it uplifts in costs that maybe they ll go away i don t think actually that s realistic what i m hoping is that will flatten and those costs will allow us to create more scalable infrastructure and they will flatten in absolute terms so i wouldn t think that you should anticipate our costs reducing but if we do our jobs right our cost should flatten at some point paul dwyer punch associates analyst okay two more questions if that s all right sean m o connor chief executive officer yes sure go ahead paul dwyer punch associates analyst what do you think is a reasonable timing to have some sort of estimate for this optionsellers potential bad debt sean m o connor chief executive officer okay i obviously can t go into too much detail because we re sort of involved in litigation all around here but honestly this is going to be multiple quarters before i think we have a clearer picture we are going through a legal process that s most likely going to involve an arbitration of some sort we are filing all that paperwork now so i think toward the end of this fiscal year we should have much greater clarity i mean that s the part of this that i can tell you right now it s certainly not going to be resolved in the next three months or something i mean that s for sure paul dwyer punch associates analyst okay that s fine and then can you talk so i understand short term interest rate movement of the business and how that impacts it can you talk a little bit about how the slope of the yield curve impacts earnings sean m o connor chief executive officer well two thoughts on that so firstly we have a float and our float is pretty much sitting at the 3 month t bill rate we invest that both with banks and in t bills so that s probably a good proxy so that s sort of the bulk of our net interest carry right we have historically and if i go back three four years ago when the t bill rate was basically zero we did see an opportunity to create a ladder after two years because we were basically getting 60 70 basis points at the two year mark so we created a ladder of treasuries which just sort of rolled off and we just replaced them which allowed us to actually capture on average about 50 basis points and this is from memory i may be a little bit off but about 50 basis points when the short term rate was zero we will use the yield curve if it presents an opportunity to us i don t think we ll ever want a ladder our exposure out beyond more than say two years as you know that s kind of very flat right now so it doesn t present us an opportunity to enhance our yield over what we re getting now on the short term basis so that s kind of one part of it the second part of it is in our rates business we carry fairly large inventories in mortgage backed and other things which are hedged and are funded and they are largely funded at about the three year three month rate and obviously they earn a rate that s slightly higher honestly the hedges end up probably negating a lot of that yield curve benefit we might get but oftentimes there s just a little dip we kind of squeeze out there but i don t think it s material so if we didn t hedge those positions obviously we d be getting kind of a carry on the yield curve if there was one but honestly we don t see much of that just because we hedge everything does that answer your question paul okay paul dwyer punch associates analyst yes they do and then just last for me is kind of what the m a landscape looks like for you going forward and kind of where do you what s interesting you and where do you want to go next for acquisitions sean m o connor chief executive officer yes this is always kind of a funny conversation we have with people because as you know we ve done maybe 20 m a deals over the last sort of 10 years but we certainly don t have a list on the wall somewhere of companies we d like to buy i mean i think that s very dangerous you end up sort of falling in love with things and overpaying but what we do do is we have got ourselves known as a potential buyer that can move quickly that executes and can close transactions and as a result of that we see what s going on so we re definitely in the flow of acquisitions and just to give you some sense of it during 2018 we probably were presented with roughly 50 opportunities that we looked at we probably got pretty seriously engaged on maybe 10 and we sort of did two i think so yes we re pretty disciplined and picky we will continue that process and what we re really looking for is businesses that either bring clients or capabilities we don t have first of all and businesses we can add value to there s no point in us buying something that we can t do a lot with so we want businesses that can do better on our platform we can add value to that can cross sell to our clients whatever it is so that s sort of our basic screen and we ll keep looking so we re pretty opportunistic i would say as we fill out our offering i think there s less things that fit and you start to look at things that are maybe more duplicative and then you re sort of just thinking about cost synergies up until now we really haven t done a lot of transactions that are just driven by cost synergies but we re probably going to start to see that a little more and i think as we ve grown and become known in the market we re also seeing talent just wanting to move across to us so we ve actually recruited a lot of pretty senior people that are bringing with them their relationships so that s obviously another way you grow your business i mean it s almost like buying small decks of business right so that s sort of our approach we don t have any big deals in the works we don t want to sort of chase anyone we want to be nimble we want to be disciplined and we want to be patient in how we build out our business and frankly our business is doing great so we don t feel compelled or under pressure to have to do something to change our trajectory i mean we are making better returns than any of our competitors we are seeing customers onboarding with us and we re seeing talent wanting to work here so it seems like what we re doing is good and therefore we are afforded the luxury of being disciplined and i think we want to stay that way is that helpful paul paul dwyer punch associates analyst okay yes yes that s very helpful i d agree really nice quarter guys that s all i have so thanks sean we will talk again soon sean m o connor chief executive officer thanks for the questions appreciate it paul dwyer punch associates analyst yeah bye bye operator operator instructions

the statement above is of course totally accurate for a country running budget and trade deficits for over half a century with a total debt including unfunded liabilities in the hundreds of trillions of dollars it could have been said today but it actually dates back to august 1971 when the people s daily in china declared the beginning of the end for the monetary system of the capitalist world this prescient statement certainly has cassandra characteristics cassandra was the princess of troy who was given the gift to make prophecies that were true but no one believed the chinese government saw already 48 years ago that nixon s decision to end the gold backing of the dollar would be the end of the dollar and the western monetary system no one believed their prophecy at the time but they are being proven right the chinese predicted the dollar fall starting my working life in a swiss bank in geneva two years before nixon s fatal decision i have experience of that fall of the dollar that the chinese predicted in 1970 there were 4 30 swiss francs to the dollar today you get just under one franc for one us that is a catastrophic collapse of 77 of the world s reserve currency in almost 50 years if we look at the graph of the dollar against the swiss franc below we can see that this currency pair has been in a long consolidation at the bottom since 1987 the next leg down in the dollar is not far away and the target over the next few years could be anywhere between 0 40 and 0 00 swiss francs this means a further fall of 60 to 100 could take place making the dollar worthless this confirms voltaire s statement that all currencies eventually reach their intrinsic value of zero we know that this move to zero is virtually guaranteed measured against gold but more surprising is that it could also happen against the swiss currency the swiss banking system and the swiss national bank also have serious problems so eventually the franc is likely to reach almost zero against gold too but the dollar will win that race china predicted in 1971 the decline of the capitalist system the people s daily is the most influential and authoritative newspaper in china it has been the official voice of the central government of the people s republic of china for the last 71 years currency wars the mak james rickards best price 1 76 buy new 6 46 as of 09 55 utc details the paper declared in 1971 when nixon closed the gold window these unpopular measures reflect the seriousness of the us economic crisis and the decay and decline of the entire capitalist system the paper further stated that the measures mark the collapse of capitalist monetary system with the us dollar as its prop and that nixon s new economic policy cannot extricate the us from financial and economic crisis the article predicted instead that the measures would intensify the crisis nixon declared in 1971 the time has now come for a new economic policy in the united states its targets are unemployment inflation and international speculation and this is how we are going to attack those targets the time has come for decisive action action that will break the vicious circle of spiralling prices and costs nixon s fatal decision the chinese understood already in 1971 that nixon s decision would have disastrous consequences contrary to what nixon declared so here we are today with galloping inflation including asset prices collapsing currencies and exploding debts all the things that nixon said he would prevent nixon stated further in his speech we must protect the position of the american dollar as a pillar of monetary stability around the world i am determined that the american dollar must never again be a hostage in the hands of international speculators little did he understand that his decision would have the opposite effect without gold backing the dollar was not in the hands of speculators but instead in the hands of the us government and the federal reserve and that is why the dollar has since 1971 lost 97 against real money which is gold 57 against the dmark euro and 77 against the swiss franc read the whole article the best of egon von greyerz
advertisement singapore reported a credible economic performance in 2018 amid an increasingly uncertain global environment exemplified by the us china trade war economic growth for the year came in at 3 3 per cent and overall inflation at 0 4 per cent these compare well with international monetary fund imf forecasts of 2 4 per cent and 2 per cent respectively for advanced economies official surveys report an increase in median income with lower income deciles experiencing greater gains although the employment rate of singaporeans and permanent residents the resident labour force declined marginally from 80 7 per cent to 80 3 per cent over the year singapore maintained a regular international presence throughout the year the country hosted the first ever meeting between the leaders of the united states and north korea in june and convened and officiated the 33rd asean and related summits as the 2018 asean chair in november this bodes well for the location based business strategy that continues to be an integral part of singapore s economic planning and management domestically signs suggest the start of a gradual transition and renewal of singapore s economic structure in line with the committee on the future economy cfe report released in 2017 adherence to the report s recommendations can be seen in the emphasis on education and training infrastructure and healthcare sectors that policymakers believe will further singapore s long term growth potential in the annual government budget as well as government support for the use of technology in financial services fintech singapore s ageing population income inequality greater expenditure on health also suggests that policymakers acknowledge the need for the public sector to play a larger and deeper role in managing the needs of singapore s ageing population the expected increase in public spending will be financed by an increase in the goods and services tax gst from 7 per cent to 9 per cent between 2021 and 2025 despite stated urgency on the need to manage inequality and old age income security public policy focus remains on job creation and skills upgrading this is notwithstanding that income inequality is likely higher than may be inferred as singapore s gini coefficient is calculated using only labour income of the employed policymakers remain averse to calls for a minimum wage or higher income supplements to reduce inequality because of hypothesised negative effects to employment and economic growth there continues to be a strong preference for selective use of wage and income supplements to low income households to be more effective instruments of redistribution but a recent study revealed that accumulation from employment income alone may be insufficient to ensure old age income security due to rising longevity and underemployment both observed in singapore inequality and old age income security concerns are amplified by the continued lack of social risk pooling arrangements this is seen from an enduring emphasis on individual savings from labour income in retirement financing arrangements on the use of actuarial valuations in the basic catastrophic national health insurance and disability insurance premiums and on pay outs from the compulsory annuity scheme disproportionate level of individual risk the individual bears a disproportionate amount of risk when some of it could be better managed by society the case for social risk pooling is more compelling for women in particular as they typically experience lower incomes shorter working lifespans and greater longevity all of which raise inequality and insecurity consequently a universal non contributory pension scheme is necessary to limit the extent for old age poverty singapore stands alone among developed economies in not having such a budget financed social pension despite its record of recurring budget surpluses the importance of implementing such a scheme in singapore is greater now with the reported complexities in monetising public housing values for retirement financing however informed discussions on this and other issues remain constrained by data limitations well illustrated by the role of existing budgetary reporting practices in facilitating fiscal policy debates alongside early signs indicating the start of economic restructuring in november 2018 the ruling party announced a leadership renewal with changes to its core management team this includes a number of younger members who will or are anticipated to take on key leadership and decision making roles in the coming years more focus on inequality needed singapore s policymakers will need to manage more vocal domestic concerns about inequality old age income security and social stratification the latter will be accentuated by cost of living concerns from higher public utility charges and the increase in public transport fares the difficulty in doing so is increased by the population s changing perspectives and demands of governance and public sector accountability understanding and adapting to this takes on greater significance as the conventional drivers of growth and social mobility such as education begin to seem ineffective and conducive to social stratification as ageing and the pace of technological change across the economy accelerates the economic gains from job creation and retraining especially for older workers will become increasingly difficult to realise in the course of change and renewal more comprehensive measures and safeguards will be needed to mitigate the adverse effects that will inevitably emerge over the adjustment process increasingly this will require singapore s policymakers to diverge from long held convictions and positions of what is appropriate to devise more nuanced policy responses that successfully navigate the challenges of the coming year this article was written by chang yee kwan an assistant professor in economics at

opportunity such as job discrimination inadequate access to health care and insufficient affordable housing reflecting our history of racism and ongoing discrimination using the budget to invest in high quality early education support community based mental health and addiction treatment services and to improve housing options for returning citizens are just a few ways the dc budget can transform the district into a more equitable community where all residents share in our city s prosperity second the dc budget differs from your personal budget because we can increase our resources by making our tax code fairer and better able to meet our needs eliminating ineffective tax subsidies that allow big corporations to avoid paying their fair share of taxes for example would give us more money for things that benefit dc residents like affordable housing better funded schools and ending chronic homelessness many people consider the budget intimidating don t worry this guide will give you all you need to understand dc s budget and become a powerful advocate we ll explain where dc gets its money and where it is spent we ll explain what happens when there s no more money left or when there s a surplus we ll outline the process for putting the budget together every year and we ll give you the tools you need to get involved in the process together we have the power to address the challenges our city faces and put our shared values into action we hope you ll use this guide to help shape this year s dc budget how the budget works the mayor and dc council decide how to allocate the city s resources through the budget with input from residents about what is important to them every service the city provides such as trash collection appears in the budget every year new initiatives such as new programs in public school classrooms for example need to be funded through the budget too with so many competing priorities tough decisions must be made every year how much will we spend what will we spend it on how much will we save should we reduce taxes for residents who struggle to make ends meet should we raise taxes to meet urgent needs like metro if so how much should we raise and what s the right way to make sure the increases affect residents and businesses most able to contribute all these questions get addressed in the mayor s budget proposal which is presented to the dc council each year for review and approval the dc council can vote to change the mayor s proposal but it cannot spend more in any particular area than the mayor proposes unless it finds an equal amount of offsetting cuts or revenue increases by law the budget must be balanced with revenue equaling expenditures although the city can get some of those revenues by dipping into its savings dc s budget is divided into two parts the operating budget allocates resources to run the city government day to day paying for things such as the salaries of police officers and librarians electricity and phone bills for government agencies and health expenses for residents in one of the district s health programs the capital budget supports the costs associated with building and maintaining infrastructure such as roads and schools most of the time when officials speak about the budget they are talking about the operating budget this guide also focuses primarily on the operating budget the dc budget year is different from the calendar year it operates in what s known as the fiscal year fy which begins october 1 and ends september 30 for dc the district follows this schedule because it must align its budgetary year with that of the federal government most states including maryland and virginia begin their fiscal year july 1 the basic timeline each year for preparing the city s budget is as follows the mayor s office spends roughly six months from september to february developing a spending plan for the upcoming year the proposed budget then gets sent in march or early april to the dc council the council reviews the budget and holds public hearings to get input from the mayor s administration and the public on those plans the dc council usually approves the final budget in may however based on revenue projections from the city s chief financial officer the budget may be adjusted during the year to stay in balance with the amount of money the city collects we ll get into more detail about this process a little later where the district gets its money the district collected 11 6 billion in revenue in fy 2017 figure 1 above the money came from three general categories local funds this is mostly tax revenue generated from property income and sales taxes as well as several other taxes and non tax revenue local funds totaled 7 5 billion in fy 2017 this is mostly tax revenue generated from property income and sales taxes as well as several other taxes and non tax revenue local funds totaled 7 5 billion in fy 2017 special purpose revenues and dedicated taxes these are taxes and fees designated for a specific use for example the district has a nuisance abatement fund which collects fees and fines from property owners who violate building codes in another example 15 percent of the city s deed recordation and transfer taxes are dedicated to a special fund to finance affordable housing called the housing production trust fund the district collected 881 million in special purpose revenues and dedicated taxes in fy 2017 and these are taxes and fees designated for a specific use for example the district has a nuisance abatement fund which collects fees and fines from property owners who violate building codes in another example 15 percent of the city s deed recordation and transfer taxes are dedicated to a special fund to finance affordable housing called the housing production trust fund the district collected 881 million in special purpose revenues and dedicated taxes in fy 2017 federal funds like all other states and municipalities the district receives federal funds to meet specific purposes such as services for residents with hiv or grants for schools with significant low income populations these sometimes come in the form of matching funds where the district and federal government share expenses for a particular program or as grants fully funded by the federal government in fy 2017 the district used 3 2 billion in federal funds the largest share goes to support our medicaid program unlike the federal government which is allowed to carry a deficit dc must balance its budget each year dc is like similar to nearly all cities and states in this regard in other words the money the city brings in revenue must be equal or greater than the money the city spends expenditures although the city can use money in its savings account to help meet its revenue needs a budget gap occurs when revenue is less than expenditures a surplus occurs when revenue exceeds expenditures how does a gap happen the budget adopted by the district each year must be balanced but a budget shortfall can arise either because revenue collections turn out to be lower than initially expected or because expenditures are higher than expected or both how the district spends its money for fy 2017 the gross dc budget was about 12 8 billion this includes money raised locally as well as federal dollars that dc receives the dc budget is divided into seven clusters known as appropriation titles figure 2 above human support services is the biggest chunk of the dc budget as it is in many other states budgets this sector of the government includes many programs that keep residents safe and healthy the majority of these expenditures are for health care programs that serve more than one third of dc residents other services target youth veterans and the elderly this sector also includes the department of parks and recreation human support services accounted for 4 7 billion of the city s budget in

restructuring acquisition and other charges net earnings and eps were 1 0 billion and 13 61 commenting on mohawk industries fourth quarter performance jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and ceo stated the period was affected by significant inflation slowing markets and lvt impacting sales of other products even as we executed price increases in many products our businesses experienced greater pressures on pricing and mix in the quarter inflation continued to be a headwind across most of our categories as higher cost materials flowed through our results during the period we decreased our manufacturing production to adapt to market demand our start up costs for the quarter were higher than we projected with lvt production improving slower than anticipated our new countertop and sheet vinyl plants initiated manufacturing along with our polish ceramic tile expansion after five consecutive years of record earnings 2018 proved more difficult than we anticipated with inflation increasing dramatically luxury vinyl tile impacting other u s flooring products and most of our markets slowing in this environment we selectively invested approximately 1 5 billion to enhance our long term performance primarily in new product categories and geographies with green field projects and acquisitions cost saving initiatives and buying back shares we are managing through current conditions while enhancing the longer term value of our business to accomplish this in 2018 we acquired leading flooring companies in australia new zealand and brazil and in europe acquired two flooring distributors and a specialized mezzanine company we entered the european porcelain slabs and carpet tile markets expanded our higher end ceramic in eastern europe and initiated sheet vinyl production in russia and quartz countertop manufacturing in the u s much of the benefit from these capital investments will be realized in 2020 and beyond as we achieve higher volume mix and productivity in the period we purchased approximately 274 million of mohawk stock reducing our share count by 2 3 million or the equivalent of 3 of outstanding shares for the quarter our global ceramic segment sales increased 4 5 as reported and 7 on a constant currency basis the segment s operating margin was approximately 9 as reported or 10 excluding other charges declining year over year due to inflation price and mix pressures and lower production partially offset by increasing productivity in north america our ceramic business increased sequentially but remained challenged due to import pressures and transportation expenses to improve our margins we have increased prices on our products to recover inflation and higher freight costs our new quartz countertop plant is manufacturing basic products as we ramp up production and optimize our processes and formulations across north america we are taking many actions to lower our costs including consolidating regional service centers and reducing headcount in mexico our new production lines in salamanca are operating well and we are focused on improving our mix and margins we have announced price increases in mexico to cover inflation and shipping costs in november we finalized the purchase of eliane in brazil eliane is an industry leader with the best brand and a premium position in one of the world s largest ceramic markets we have ordered the first phase of new equipment to enhance eliane s operations and margins following the strategy we used to dramatically improve marazzi s profitability in europe conditions softened as we went through the period with the italian economy deteriorating the most due to the political uncertainty given these conditions we experienced greater pressure on margins as competition increased we reduced production rates in the fourth quarter and are continuing to do so in the first period with the expansion of our european ceramic footprint we are increasing the specialization of our plants in italy spain poland and bulgaria to improve our competitive advantages in russia our sales and profitability increased substantially although the weaker ruble significantly reduced our translated results to enable us to grow in russia we have installed two new production lines in 2018 and we will commence production of premium sanitary ware in 2019 during the quarter our flooring north america segment s sales decreased 3 the segment s operating margin was 8 as reported and 9 on an adjusted basis impacted by inflation lower than expected volume productivity and higher start up costs in november we announced paul de cock s appointment as president of the flooring north america segment to enhance our results he has changed the management structure to improve our marketing operations and innovation of each flooring product our sales slowed as we went through the period due to softer home sales and inventory reductions by customers in some channels during the period we initiated further price increases to recover higher material and freight costs carpet was impacted by hard surface alternatives and the high cost of materials in our premium smartstrand collections we introduced our new colormax technology and expanded our patented air o unified soft flooring offering we have reinvigorated the premium laminate category through the new investments we made to produce visuals that exceed real wood with previously unachievable durability and water resistance lvt sales grew substantially during the period as we implemented our sourcing and manufacturing strategy we are offering a premium pergo lvt collection which before introduction has greater consumer brand recognition than any other lvt product in the market although we anticipated even more improvement the output of our new lvt production has increased about 20 over the prior period long term we are confident that our investment in this technology will provide us with competitive advantages when it is operating at expected levels for the quarter our flooring rest of the world segment s sales increased 12 as reported and 16 on a constant currency basis the segment s operating margin was 12 as reported and 13 on an adjusted basis due to volume growth and productivity offset by the impact of price and mix start up costs and fx as we progressed through the period we experienced softening market conditions in both europe and australia lvt sales continued their strong growth and we significantly outperformed the laminate market with our premium collections we have initiated laminate price increases to recover rising costs and currency changes our investments to expand laminate production in europe and russia have increased our market share by delivering differentiated visuals and water proof features our lvt sales continue to grow dramatically as our production rates increase some of our lvt introductions were postponed until later this period as we overcame technical problems that increased our costs during the fourth quarter we have seen about 15 production improvements in lvt over the last quarter as our processes have been refined and we anticipate continued improvement in the year ahead in europe we are gaining share in sheet vinyl and our new sheet vinyl plant in russia has commenced production our russian sheet vinyl facility is operating as planned and is producing goods to satisfy commitments to major customers our european carpet tile plant continues to progress as we broaden our product offering and customer base we have integrated godfrey hirst into the mohawk structure presently the australian housing market is slowing and we are adapting to the changing conditions we are investing in new assets to expand godfrey hirst s commercial carpet and leveraging mohawk s resources to enhance product and material strategies the volume and profitability of our insulation business is improving significantly our polyurethane insulation is taking share from other products as it did prior to prices rising from material constraints our board sales and margins for the year were the highest in a decade the investments we have made in our board business have improved our offering and productivity we are expanding the mezzanine flooring business we acquired last year as we leverage our existing manufacturing and sales organization as we enter 2019 many macroeconomic conditions around the world could impact our results economies have been slowing in most of our markets oil volatility is making our costs unpredictable and housing markets in many regions are under pressure though our outlook is cautious because of these issues we expect our results to improve through the year in the first quarter we are reducing production rates due to the softer environment we see in most of our markets higher priced materials will flow through before we realize the benefits from recent changes the u s dollar strengthened relative to last year and will have a significant negative impact on the period we continue to introduce innovative new collections implement price increases and improve manufacturing processes taking all of this into account our eps guidance for the first quarter of 2019 is 2 02 to 2 12 excluding any one time charges our major product and geographic expansions are at varying stages of ramping up as we progress through this year these investments will increase our sales and margins price increases will benefit our results start up costs will decline and production levels will increase we will begin to realize the potential of these projects in 2020 as volume and efficiencies increase today the business is stronger with substantial resources a broader product portfolio and a more diverse geographic footprint we have a strong balance sheet extensive liquidity and historically low debt leverage in the short term we are taking the appropriate steps to manage through market uncertainties and we are confident our investments and acquisitions will significantly enhance our long term business about mohawk industries mohawk industries is the leading global

poor people give away a lot of information if you ve never lived under the poverty line you might not be aware how much of our personal privacy we trade away for basic benefits such as food stamps health insurance and utility discounts itâ s not just social security numbers and home addresses which are required as part of these applications it includes health histories household incomes living expenses and employment histories most people shrug off this exchange what good is personal data when you have no money and terrible credit anyway â especially when you don t really have a choice but after decades of collecting this data the government is putting it to use this information is feeding algorithms that decide everything from whether or not you get health insurance to how much time you spend in jail increasingly it is helping determine whether or not parents get to keep their kids get talkpoverty in your inbox when someone phones in a report of suspected child abuse â usually to a state or county child abuse hotline â a call screener has to determine whether the accusation merits an actual investigation sometimes they have background information such as prior child welfare reports to assist in their decision making process but often they have to make snap determinations with very little guidance besides the details of the immediate report there are more than 7 million maltreatment reports each year and caseworkers get overwhelmed and burn out quickly â especially when a serious case gets overlooked new algorithms popping up around the country review data points available for each case and suggest whether or not an investigation should be opened in an attempt to offset some of the individual responsibility placed on case workers the trouble is algorithms arenâ t designed to find new information that humans miss â theyâ re designed to use the data that humans have previously input as efficiently as possible â if you give it biased data it will be biased â explained cathy oâ neil mathematician and author of the book weapons of math destruction while speaking with me for a story i wrote for undark last year â the very short version is that when you re using the past as a kind of reference for how it works well you re implicitly assuming the past is doing a good job of rewarding good things and punishing bad things you re training the system to say if it worked in the past it should work in the future â historically low income families have had their children removed from their homes at higher rates than wealthier families as a result these new algorithms work to codify poverty as a criteria for child maltreatment some of the variables that these tools consider are public records that only exist for low income parents such as parents poverty status whether they receive welfare benefits like snap and tanf employment status and whether they receive medicaid other factors like previous criminal justice involvement and whether or not there have been allegations of substance misuse in the past are also dramatically more likely for families living in poverty if you give it biased data it will be biased this bias exists even in systems that have been highly praised like the allegheny family screening tool currently being implemented in pittsburgh where prior arrests and parentsâ mental health histories are considered factors in whether a child should be removed itâ s similar in other less transparent systems like one in florida where tech giant sas contracted with the florida department of children and families to research which factors were most likely to contribute to the death of a child by maltreatment according to press releases by sas some of which have been unpublished since they began garnering media attention the company used public records such as medicaid status criminal justice history and substance use treatment history the results led jurisdictions in florida to zoom in on factors that apply to huge swaths of families including mine in april of last year an allegation of drug use and child abandonment led broward county florida child welfare investigators to investigate my family when my drug tests were negative the investigation pivoted to my recent financial setbacks which had been caused by my husband s acute health crisis my children were ultimately removed from my care and we have been separated for nine months for reasons that are primarily financial my case is far from unique three quarters of child protective cases in the united states are related to neglect not abuse and that neglect usually means lack of food clothing shelter heating or supervision problems which are almost always the result of poverty ira schwartz a private analytics consultant thinks he may have found a way to help re balance this system he conducted a research study in broward county â the same county in which my case is based â that discovered the current approach to child welfare substantiation is highly flawed according to his research 90 percent of system referrals were essentially useless and 40 percent of court involved cases which typically involve child removal were overzealous and harmful rather than beneficial to the families he created his own system that like the allegheny tool predicted the likelihood that a family would become re involved with the system but he admits quite openly that predictive algorithms like his target the poor itâ s a discrimination factor â we found in our study that lower socioeconomic status was one of the significant variables that was a predictor â said schwartz â the issue with higher income families is they just donâ t really come into the system because they have other options with higher income families when there s child abuse or neglect or even spouse abuse and itâ s reported they can afford to go to private agencies get private mental health services they can see a psychiatrist or social worker or psychologist itâ s a discrimination factor â schwartz believes that these types of admittedly discriminatory computer programs can still be put to good use when combined with prescriptive analytics which would determine the services that high risk families need in order to remain out of the system in the future schwartz says this would include services like rental assistance food assistance day care funding and housekeeping services this would help welfare agencies understand which families need what services and streamline the process of providing them all jurisdictions are legally required to make â reasonable effortsâ to help families resolve the issues that brought them under investigation but how agencies go about meeting that standard varies widely by location the issue with these algorithms is certainly not malice on the part of their creators even the more secretive proprietary algorithms being created by companies like sas claim to want to create a safer system that results in less child maltreatment but itâ s unclear if that is possible with the data thatâ s available without comparable data from wealthier populations which are better protected by privacy laws the new systems cannot produce accurate results â and even if more data were added it would mean more families are being separated and surveilled
braching for the coming china shock feb 7 2019 16 40 by korea herald in september 2018 we argued that china s economic and foreign policies were defying the laws of economics and geopolitics and warned that the situation could not last since then our assessment has been borne out and our concerns have deepened until recently china had been able to pursue a unique development path owing to the government s far reaching control over the economy and society more generally but those days are over the country s internal debts are mounting to unsustainable heights and domestic investment levels have passed the point of diminishing returns and are veering toward negative territory moreover china s strategy of fostering exports promoting industrial national champions and expropriating foreign technology has crossed the threshold of what the west especially the united states is willing to tolerate chinese president xi jinping s belt and road initiative is showing all the signs of imperial overreach not only does the bri s lending far exceed participating governments borrowing capacity but its loan terms have become increasingly onerous indeed usurious as harvard university s ricardo hausmann recently observed in september we saw some discontinuity in china s economic performance as inevitable even if the country was not heading for a full blown crisis we believed it would almost certainly experience some combination of rapidly decelerating growth and a sharply depreciating exchange rate that prognosis has since become even more likely with global economic growth and exports declining china s economy is on track to slow further relative to the 6 4 percent growth recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018 the double digit average achieved from the 1980s until recently has never seemed more distant in response to the current global slowdown the chinese government has decided to loosen restrictions on private and public borrowing but this will merely aggravate the country s debt and overinvestment problems or as a famous chinese saying goes it is akin to drinking poison to quench one s thirst even without these macro developments china s defiance of well established findings in development economics was never going to last forever economists douglass north daron acemoglu and james a robinson have shown that long run economic development tends to rely on strong state institutions and open political systems because these are necessary to foster competition investor confidence dynamism and innovation as the notable exception to an otherwise robust relationship between political and economic development china has long posed a problem for the theory with its closed political system it should not be anywhere near as rich as it is in the 1990s and 2000s the west made a gamble that china would cease to be an exception and would veer toward normalcy by adopting more open and democratic political institutions as a practical matter that bet translated into western policies to facilitate china s rise and decisions by us firms to transfer manufacturing capacity there but under xi s leadership china has instead become less open and as nicholas lardy of the peterson institute for international economics shows in a new book its economy has also shifted back from a private sector driven growth model to state capitalism in other words systemic political and economic changes are making china even more of an exception thereby increasing the odds that its return to normalcy will come in the form of a sharp deterioration in economic performance there is no telling precisely when that correction will happen but the more china defies the rules of economic development the more likely it becomes unfortunately any discontinuity in china s economic performance would have a seismic effect on the rest of the world because it would lead to a significant weakening of the renminbi in fact china itself might engineer a depreciation of its currency in order to promote its exports and cushion the inevitable fall in domestic demand particularly its investment component such a scenario would have a tsunami like impact on global currencies other major asian countries would respond by pursuing their own devaluations to maintain their competitiveness and europe and the united states would experience sharp deflation as their currencies strengthened in kind for a historical comparison consider that in the 1930s the us dollar and british sterling depreciated by about 40 percent over four years while the french and german currencies remained broadly stable measured against gold like the us and britain in 1929 just before the great depression today the major asian economies that would be affected by a chinese currency shock account for around 30 percent of world trade making matters worse trade is much more important to the global economy today than it was 90 years ago in 2017 merchandise exports accounted for 20 25 percent of global gdp compared to just 8 percent in 1929 that means a depreciation in asian currencies would have a significantly greater global impact than the dollar and sterling devaluation of the 1930s a china shock could potentially dwarf the competitive currency depreciations of the early 1930s one of the darkest economic periods in recorded history one way or another china s continued defiance of the laws of macroeconomics geopolitics and economic development will hasten its inevitable return to normalcy when that happens the world had better brace itself by arvind subramanian and

for two years in the early 1990s richard palmer served as the cia station chief in the united states moscow embassy the events unfolding around him the dissolution of the soviet union and the rise of russia were so chaotic so traumatic and exhilarating that they mostly eluded clearheaded analysis but from all the intelligence that washed over his desk palmer acquired a crystalline understanding of the deeper narrative of those times much of the rest of the world wanted to shout for joy about the trajectory of history and how it pointed in the direction of free markets and liberal democracy palmer s account of events in russia however was pure bummer in the fall of 1999 he testified before a congressional committee to disabuse members of congress of their optimism and to warn them of what was to come american officialdom palmer believed had badly misjudged russia washington had placed its faith in the new regime s elites it took them at their word when they professed their commitment to democratic capitalism but palmer had seen up close how the world s growing interconnectedness and global finance in particular could be deployed for ill during the cold war the kgb had developed an expert understanding of the banking byways of the west and spymasters had become adept at dispensing cash to agents abroad that proficiency facilitated the amassing of new fortunes in the dying days of the u s s r palmer had watched as his old adversaries in soviet intelligence shoveled billions from the state treasury into private accounts across europe and the u s it was one of history s greatest heists washington told itself a comforting story that minimized the importance of this outbreak of kleptomania these were criminal outliers and rogue profiteers rushing to exploit the weakness of the new state this narrative infuriated palmer he wanted to shake congress into recognizing that the thieves were the very elites who presided over every corner of the system for the u s to be like russia is today he explained to the house committee it would be necessary to have massive corruption by the majority of the members at congress as well as by the departments of justice and treasury and agents of the fbi cia dia irs marshal service border patrol state and local police officers the federal reserve bank supreme court justices in his testimony palmer even mentioned russia s newly installed and little known prime minister whom he mistakenly referred to as boris putin accusing him of helping to loot russia the united states palmer made clear had allowed itself to become an accomplice in this plunder his assessment was unsparing the west could have turned away this stolen cash it could have stanched the outflow to shell companies and tax havens instead western banks waved russian loot into their vaults palmer s anger was intended to provoke a bout of introspection and to fuel anxiety about the risk that rising kleptocracy posed to the west itself after all the russians would have a strong interest in protecting their relocated assets they would want to shield this wealth from moralizing american politicians who might clamor to seize it eighteen years before special counsel robert mueller began his investigation into foreign interference in a u s election palmer warned congress about russian political donations to u s politicians and political parties to obtain influence what was at stake could well be systemic contagion russian values might infect and then weaken the moral defense systems of american politics and business this unillusioned spook was a prophet and he spoke out at a hinge moment in the history of global corruption america could not afford to delude itself into assuming that it would serve as the virtuous model much less emerge as an untainted bystander yet when yegor gaidar a reformist russian prime minister in the earliest postcommunist days asked the united states for help hunting down the billions that the kgb had carted away the white house refused capital flight is capital flight was how one former cia official summed up the american rationale for idly standing by but this was capital flight on an unprecedented scale and mere prologue to an era of rampant theft when the berkeley economist gabriel zucman studied the problem in 2015 he found that 52 percent of russia s wealth resided outside the country the collapse of communism in the other post soviet states along with china s turn toward capitalism only added to the kleptocratic fortunes that were hustled abroad for secret safekeeping officials around the world have always looted their countries coffers and accumulated bribes but the globalization of banking made the export of their ill gotten money far more convenient than it had been which of course inspired more theft by one estimate more than 1 trillion now exits the world s developing countries each year in the forms of laundered money and evaded taxes as in the russian case much of this plundered wealth finds its way to the united states new york los angeles and miami have joined london as the world s most desired destinations for laundered money this boom has enriched the american elites who have enabled it and it has degraded the nation s political and social mores in the process while everyone else was heralding an emergent globalist world that would take on the best values of america palmer had glimpsed the dire risk of the opposite that the values of the kleptocrats would become america s own this grim vision is now nearing fruition the contagion has spread remarkably quickly which is not to say steadily in a country haunted since its founding by the perils of corruption the united states has had seizures of conscience en route to the top of the new global order surveyed by the british journalist oliver bullough in his excellent book moneyland why thieves and crooks now rule the world and how to take it back in the months following palmer s testimony the zeitgeist swerved in the direction he urged at least momentarily newspaper articles in the fall of 1999 showed how billions in russian money some of it seemingly tied to an alleged crime boss had landed in the bank of new york these sums startled bill clinton s administration which readied tough new anti money laundering bills designed to stiffen banking regulations but the administration was in its last year and passing any new law would have required a legislative slog and bull rushing obstreperous lobbyists so plans stalled the clinton era proposals would have remained an unvisited curio in the national archives had osama bin laden not attacked but in the days after the twin towers collapsed george w bush s administration furiously scoured washington for ideas to jam into the 342 page piece of legislation that would become the patriot act a sense of national panic created a brief moment for bureaucrats to realize previously shelved plans title iii of the patriot act the international money laundering abatement and anti terrorist financing act was signed into law little more than a month after september 11 this section of the bill was a monumental legislative achievement undeterred by the smoke clouds of crisis representatives of the big banks had stalked the senate trying to quash the measure citibank officials reportedly got into shouting matches with congressional staffers in the hall this anger reflected the force of the patriot act if a bank came across suspicious money transferred from abroad it was now required to report the transfer to the government a bank could face criminal charges for failing to establish sufficient safeguards against the flow of corrupt cash little wonder that banks fought fiercely against the imposition of so many new rules which required them to bulk up their compliance divisions and more to the point subjected them to expensive penalties for laxity much of what palmer had urged was suddenly the law of the land but nestled in the patriot act lay the handiwork of another industry s lobbyists every house district in the country has real estate and lobbyists for that business had pleaded for relief from the patriot act s monitoring of dubious foreign transactions they all but conjured up images of suburban moms staking for sale signs on lawns ill equipped to vet every buyer and they persuaded congress to grant the industry a temporary exemption from having to enforce the new law the exemption was a gaping loophole and an extraordinary growth opportunity for high end real estate for all the new fastidiousness of the financial system foreigners could still buy penthouse apartments or mansions anonymously and with ease by hiding behind shell companies set up in states such as delaware and nevada those states along with a few others had turned the registration of shell companies into a hugely lucrative racket and it was stunningly simple to arrange such a potemkin front on behalf of a dictator a drug dealer or an oligarch according to global witness a london based anti corruption ngo founded in 1993 procuring a library card requires more identification in many states than does creating an anonymous shell company the united states palmer made clear had allowed itself to become an accomplice to this plunder much of the money that might have snuck into banks before the patriot act became law was now used to purchase property the new york times described the phenomenon in a series of exposés published in 2015 called towers of secrecy reporters discovered that condos in the ultra luxe time warner center at columbus circle in manhattan were owned by a constellation of kleptocrats one condo belonged to the family of a former russian senator whose suspected ties to organized crime precluded him from legally entering canada for a few years a condo down the hall belonged to a greek businessman who had recently been arrested in an anti government corruption sweep the family of a former colombian governor imprisoned for self enrichment while in office owned a unit he could no longer visit these denizens all of whom denied wrongdoing made their high priced purchases in what has become a common way nationwide nearly half of homes worth at least 5 million the times found were bought using shell companies the proportion was even greater in los angeles and manhattan where more than 80 percent of time warner center sales fit that description as the treasury department put it in 2017 nearly one in three high end real estate purchases that it monitors involves an individual whom the government has been tracking as suspicious yet somehow the presence of so many shady buyers has never especially troubled the real estate industry or for that matter politicians in 2013 new york city s then mayor michael bloomberg asked wouldn t it be great if we could get all the russian billionaires to move here the warm welcome has created a strange dissonance in american policy take the case of the aluminum magnate oleg deripaska a character who has made recurring cameos in the investigation of russian interference in the 2016 presidential election the state department concerned about deripaska s connections to russian organized crime which he has denied has restricted his travel to the united states for years such fears have not stood in the way of his acquiring a 42 5 million mansion on manhattan s upper east side and another estate near washington s embassy row over time the gap between the noble intentions of the patriot act and the dirty reality of the property market became too wide to ignore in 2016 barack obama s administration tested a program to bring the real estate industry in line with the banks compelling brokers to report foreign buyers too the ongoing program piloted in miami and manhattan could have become the scaffolding for a truly robust enforcement regime but then the american presidency turned over and a landlord came to power obama s successor liked selling condos to anonymous foreign buyers and may have grown dependent on their cash in 2017 reuters examined the sale of trump organization properties in florida it found that 77 of 2 044 units in the developments were owned by russians but that was likely an incomplete portrait more than one third of the units had been sold to corporate vehicles which can readily hide the identity of the true owner as oliver bullough remarks they might have belonged to vladimir putin for all anyone else could know around the time that trump took up occupancy in the white house the patriot act s temporary exemption for real estate entered its 15th year without anyone ever declaring it so the ephemeral has been enshrined the war on kleptocracy had meanwhile been lurching forward on another front if foreign plutocrats remained mostly unscathed as they made themselves at home in the u s american plutocrats eager to hide their fortunes abroad faced fresh trouble in 2007 the united states experienced one of its bouts of moral clarity jolted by the confessions of a banker named bradley birkenfeld who came clean to the department of justice he would later tell his story in a book called lucifer s banker what he freely divulged to prosecutors were his client recruiting efforts on behalf of ubs the swiss banking behemoth birkenfeld described how he had ensconced himself in the gilded heart of the american plutocracy attending yacht regattas and patronizing art galleries he would mingle with the wealthy and strike up conversation what i can do for you is zero he would say and then pause before the punch line actually it s three zeroes zero income tax zero capital gains tax and zero inheritance tax birkenfeld s unsubtle approach succeeded wildly as did his bank as part of an agreement with the justice department ubs admitted to hiding assets totaling some 20 billion in american money the scale of the hidden cash spun congress into a fury in 2010 it passed the foreign account tax compliance act fatca legislation with moral clout that belies its stodgy name never again would a foreign bank be able to hold american cash without notifying the irs or without risking a walloping fine here was anti corruption leadership at work and u s waffling on display according to one powerful strain of american exceptionalism the nation boasts superior financial hygiene and a bedrock culture of good government indeed the u s government has devoted more attention to money laundering than perhaps any other nation on the planet but the bar isn t very high and the vigilance has its limits in 2011 the obama administration sought to collect more information about foreigners bank accounts and to share it with the relevant home countries but banks along with their lobbyists and intellectual mouthpieces worked furiously to prevent the expansion a fellow at the heritage foundation denounced the proposed standards as fiscal imperialism the president of the florida bankers association said at a time when we are trying to create jobs and reduce the burden on businesses this is the wrong issue bankers associations in texas california and new york followed suit the effort went nowhere in congress members of america s professional elite competed to sell their services to kleptocrats breezing past ethical prohibitions the pattern repeated itself when the organization for economic cooperation and development following the original fatca example took the congressional template and extended it each year banks would report foreign accounts to the tax authorities in the account holders home country if every nation had signed on to the oecd standards the effect would have been a hammerblow to tax havens shattering the vital infrastructure that allows kleptocratic money to flow unnoticed in the end the united states was alone in refusing to join the oecd agreement finalized in 2014 this obstinacy stood to subvert everything the country had done to lead the fight against dirty money while the u s can ask almost any other nation s banks for financial information about american citizens it has no obligation to provide other countries with the same the united states had bullied the rest of the world into scrapping financial secrecy bullough writes but hadn t applied the same standards to itself a zurich based lawyer vividly spelled out the consequences to bloomberg how ironic no how perverse that the usa which has been so sanctimonious in its condemnation of swiss banks has become the banking secrecy jurisdiction du jour that giant sucking sound you hear it is the sound of money rushing to the usa not long before the u s declined to sign on to the oecd standards a branch office of the baronial rothschild bank opened on the 12th floor of a building in reno nevada far away in miles and spirit from the home office in paris the bank s name wasn t announced on the exterior of the building or even listed in the lobby directory soon after the reno outpost opened one of the bank s managing directors introduced the new branch s services to potential clients in san francisco what made the presentation so memorable were the ideas included in a draft procured by bloomberg the script laid bare the reasons for wealthy foreigners to funnel money through nevada the state is the ideal place to hide money from governments and avoid paying u s taxes the draft acknowledged a truth that bankers don t usually admit in public which is that the united states has little appetite for helping foreign governments retrieve money laundered within its borders in fact it has grown into the biggest tax haven in the world the firm said these statements were removed before the presentation was delivered because they did not reflect the firm s real views what changed wasn t just regulatory structure the behavior of the american elite changed too members of the professional classes competed to sell their services to kleptocrats in the course of that competition they breezed past old ethical prohibitions and the pressure rose to test the limits of the law a collection of videos on the internet filmed in 2014 illustrates this moral collapse the clips never show the face of a man introduced as ralph kayser a german who reveals only the most elemental details about himself recited in lightly accented english he has lined up a succession of meetings with 13 law firms in manhattan in which he engages in pleasantries and then announces his purpose he works as an adviser to a government official in one of these mineral rich countries in west africa he explains over a long career the official has grown quite wealthy companies are eager to get hold of rare earth or other minerals and so they pay some special money for it i wouldn t name it bribe i would say facilitation money kayser s client he continues is getting older and because the client s wife has always wanted a new york brownstone and the client is in the market for a gulfstream and a yacht he has a sudden need to transport money into the united states the client prefers that his purchases remain a tightly held secret so as not to provoke attention back in his home country it would look at least very very embarrassing kayser makes hardly any effort to disguise his desire to move suspect funds that is entirely by design kayser is actually a character devised by global witness the london based ngo the actor is outfitted with a well concealed camera to capture the american lawyers displaying their ethical proclivities although none of the lawyers kayser visits takes him on as a client and several say they need more information about the source of the official s wealth only one flatly refuses to discuss ways to move the money kayser has not it should be said selected the law offices of saul goodman his targets include attorneys at white shoe firms of course they understand the risks of moving suspect cash into new york one lawyer tells kayser i ve gotta be very careful myself i don t wanna do something looks like i m laundering money and that would cost me my license and and i just don t do that just what sort of scrutiny he generally applies though isn t clear when i get money from my other clients he admits it always comes in with some strange name on it i don t even ask another lawyer blithely announces they don t send lawyers to jail because we run the country we re still members of a privileged class in this country the perils of corruption were an obsession of the founders madison mentioned corruption 54 times in a 1787 notebook global witness conducted its experiment to point out big law s complicity in the spread of kleptocracy but the footage also provides primary anthropology of an american elite a profession like law has highly developed ethical codes yet those codes appear to have receded in recent years even the most prestigious firms find themselves fretful about the survival of their high priced business model which was profoundly rattled by the 2008 financial crisis and the corporate cost cutting that followed greedy impulses have surely always existed within the white shoe world but the sense of darwinian struggle and the norms of a global elite have eroded boundaries the same partners who shed underachieving colleagues more ruthlessly than they used to also seem primed to adopt a more permissive attitude toward clients whom they might once have rejected this decay has been on full display in robert mueller s investigation we have seen how the firm skadden arps slate meagher flom a sturdy pillar of the legal profession placed itself in the service of kleptocracy one partner at the firm from 2010 to 2018 gregory craig had served as barack obama s white house counsel the man responsible for safeguarding the integrity of the presidency at skadden he oversaw the creation of a report that was used to justify ukrainian president viktor yanukovych s arrest of his primary political opponent on what were widely viewed as highly dubious grounds the firm according to testimony in mueller s investigation said privately that evidence to support the arrest was virtually nonexistent another lawyer who worked for skadden has pleaded guilty to lying to prosecutors during the mueller team s probe of the firm s ukrainian work the ukrainians hired skadden through a middleman the now jailed political consultant paul manafort once upon a time it might have been possible to think of manafort as a grubby outlier in washington the lobbyist with the lowest standards willing to take on the most egregious clients but mueller has exposed just how tightly tethered manafort s work on behalf of ukrainian kleptocrats was to washington s permanent elite manafort subcontracted some of his lobbying to the firm of tony podesta arguably the most powerful democratic influence peddler of his generation and manafort employed mercury public affairs where he dealt with vin weber a former republican congressman and a former chairman of the national endowment for democracy america s fear of kleptocracy goes back to its founding in 1785 benjamin franklin returned from paris where he had served as a representative of american interests he brought home a bejeweled gift which incited controversy the grandest item in his possession it was a portrait of louis xvi outlined by 408 diamonds and stored in a golden case this present was often referred to as a snuffbox a name that seemed intended to obscure its grandeur it symbolized everything that franklin s generation despised about europe and its debasements there gift giving was a standard diplomatic custom but a gift might cloud the judgment of a public official and risked undermining the allegiances of the recipient it represented the possible elevation of personal gain over commitment to the public good the perils of corruption were an obsession of the founders in the summer of 1787 james madison mentioned corruption in his notebook 54 times to read the transcripts of the various constitutional conventions is to see just how much that generation worried about the moral quality of public behavior and how much it wanted to create a system that defined corruption more expansively than the french or british systems had and that fostered a political culture with higher ethical ambitions in her important history corruption in america zephyr teachout a legal scholar and liberal activist argues that during the country s first 200 years courts maintained the founders vigilance against corruption for a good chunk of american history a number of states criminalized lobbying in many forms out of a sense that a loosening of standards would trigger a race to the bottom that near phobia now looks quaint and also prescient the political culture the legal culture the banking culture so much of the culture of the self congratulatory meritocratic elite have long since abandoned such prudish ways the defining document of our era is the supreme court s citizens united decision in 2010 the ruling didn t just legalize anonymous expenditures on political campaigns it redefined our very idea of what constitutes corruption limiting it to its most blatant forms the bribe and the explicit quid pro quo justice anthony kennedy s majority opinion crystallized an ever more prevalent ethos of indifference the collective shrug in response to tax avoidance by the rich and by large corporations the yawn that now greets the millions in dark money spent by invisible billionaires to influence elections in other words the united states has legitimized a political economy of shadows and it has done so right in step with a global boom in people hoping to escape into the shadows american collusion with kleptocracy comes at a terrible cost for the rest of the world all of the stolen money all of those evaded tax dollars sunk into central park penthouses and nevada shell companies might otherwise fund health care and infrastructure a report from the anti poverty group one has argued that 3 6 million deaths each year can be attributed to this sort of resource siphoning thievery tramples the possibilities of workable markets and credible democracy it fuels suspicions that the whole idea of liberal capitalism is a hypocritical sham while the world is plundered self righteous americans get rich off their complicity with the crooks the founders were concerned that venality would become standard procedure and it has long before suspicion mounted about the loyalties of donald trump large swaths of the american elite lawyers lobbyists real estate brokers politicians in state capitals who enabled the creation of shell companies had already proved themselves to be reliable servants of a rapacious global plutocracy richard palmer was right the looting elites of the former soviet union were far from rogue profiteers they augured a kleptocratic habit that would soon become widespread one bitter truth about the russia scandal is that by the time vladimir putin attempted to influence the shape of our country it was already bending in the direction of his
last sunday el salvador lived one of its most quiet and dull presidential elections since the end of the 12 year civil war in 1992 all candidates advanced an anti corruption rhetoric to cover up their support for the same right wing policies of social austerity and militarization at the behest of the local oligarchy and us imperialism the overwhelming victory of nayib bukele the 37 year old former mayor of the capital san salvador was chiefly an expression of the popular loathing toward the traditional ruling parties and political forces associated with the bloody civil war whose economic and social devastation is still deeply felt today the far right nationalist republican alliance arena and the ruling guerrilla movement turned bourgeois party the farabundo martí national liberation front fmln bukele who ran on the ticket of the grand alliance for national unity gana party received 53 percent of the votes enough to avoid a second round the multi millionaire businessman carlos calleja leading the coalition topped by arena received 31 8 percent of the vote while the former fmln foreign minister hugo martinez won 14 4 percent the abstention rate of nearly 50 percent more than 10 percentage points more than the last presidential elections in 2014 and the highest since the 1990s reflected the growing political gap between workers peasants and youth and the entire ruling elite in the last five years the fmln lost more than 1 million votes and arena three quarters of a million votes the salvadoran and international media have promoted bukele for years as a new and cool leader and worked to distance him from the leadership of the fmln and from arena which was founded by death squad leader maj robert d aubuisson and ruled the country for two decades back in 2016 foreign policy part of the washington post group owned by jeff bezos listed bukele as one of 15 top decision makers in the world for placing street lights gentrifying downtown el salvador and removing a skating ban on sunday the german deutsche welle featured bukele s comment that the two groups that created the war still want to keep governing and what s more they re corrupt far from an anti corruption outsider however bukele was expelled from the fmln as recently as 2017 for slandering the leadership and allegedly violently attacking a local female official after failing to register a new party last year he joined gana a recent split off from arena founded by former president antonio saca whose successful presidential bid in 2004 was financed with millions stolen from taiwanese donations for the reconstruction of the country after the devastating 2001 earthquakes last september saca pleaded guilty to embezzling and laundering more than 300 million of public funds during his administration beyond providing a new façade for the same rotten establishment bukele s rise reflects the ongoing shift of the latin american bourgeoisie away from the pink tide governments in the last two decades of which the fmln formed a part this process has been marked by a sharp move to the right and a geopolitical shift behind the drive by us imperialism to reassert its hegemony in the region particularly against growing russian and chinese influence during the last two decades partly due to these pressures bukele centered his campaign on the promise of a commission against impunity in el salvador cicies modeled on the anti impunity commission in guatemala backed by the un using half truths such as there will be enough money when nobody steals bukele has sought to cover up his refusal to impinge upon the property and billions of profits plundered from salvadoran workers by foreign and domestic capital at the same time washington has demanded the creation of a cicies since guatemala agreed to its own commission cicig in 2006 and honduras maccih in 2016 the us has heavily sponsored such efforts as window dressing for these corrupt semi colonial governments and as political tools to pressure local elites to strictly adhere to us financial and geopolitical interests after the guatemalan president jimmy morales pledged his opposition to establishing diplomatic ties with china for instance the trump administration silently tolerated the expulsion of the cicig last august that same month facing constant financial defaults and a slowing economy the fmln government felt compelled to break diplomatic ties with taiwan and recognize beijing which committed to a three year assistance program of 150 million and a donation of 3 000 tons of rice at the same time discussions are ongoing about selling the inactive la union container port to chinese companies including permission to build a major free trade zone the trump administration responded by temporarily pulling out its ambassador jean manes who had previously declared the expansionist strategy that china has in the region is alarming not just economically but also militarily bukele himself has criticized the decision by the fmln administration to break ties with taiwan and recognize beijing as the sole legitimate government of china promising to review that deal but we will not necessarily break relations with china the administration of the outgoing president salvador sánchez cerén has continued to recognize nicolás maduro as the president of venezuela against the military coup being orchestrated by washington to hand over power to cia asset juan guaidó who has already congratulated bukele on his victory for his part bukele has called maduro and nicaragua s president daniel ortega dictators and indicated that his new party unlike the fmln is not bound to these governments however as the crisis of global capitalism deepens a process accelerated by the us trade and economic war against china and spurs the crisis of bourgeois rule in el salvador and across the region fears are growing in the ruling class that new parties based on anti corruption platforms constitute a very limited palliative for instance the forbes magazine for mexico where the recently elected president the anti corruption demagogue andrés manuel lópez obrador is already facing mass social unrest wrote on monday in the end the picture of el salvador and the young bukele is the same as in the other countries of latin america with minor nuances the risk that these faces that come to oxygenate politics don t fulfill the expectations of change and on the contrary end as stained as the traditional parties and politicians as soon as bukele takes office on june 1 he will face an anemic economic growth largely dependent on remittances from migrants living in the us a growing exodus of migrants seeking to escape widespread poverty and gang violence and the plans by the trump administration to rescind the temporary protected status tps and deport hundreds of thousands of salvadorans the foundation for economic and social development fusades reported recently that out of the 91 000 salvadoran youth entering the job market each year only 12 400 or 13 6 percent find a formal job the most recent census shows that the average monthly salary in el salvador is 300 but 64 percent of salvadoran workers make less than this amount oxfam reports that multi dimensional poverty affects 53 percent of the population the uk based charity reported back in 2014 that 160 salvadorans owned more than 30 million in assets and collectively controlled the equivalent of 87 percent of the gdp this inequality particularly as a result of the boom in the stock markets since is undoubtedly much higher today at the same the bukele administration will face higher borrowing rates a public debt equivalent to 70 percent of gdp and growing pressure by the imf to implement new regressive tax policies and social austerity the percentage of gdp spent on health and education has already fallen below 2009 levels when the fmln came to power while the 2019 budget already allocates 1 8 billion for debt servicing and 1 6 billion in total for health and education the most common proposal for el salvador made in recent months by us based think tanks is the creation of new tax free economic zones perpetuating the place of el salvador in the global capitalist economy as a cheap labor platform ruled by a handful of increasingly rich oligarchs most salvadoran exports are currently produced in 17 free trade zones concentrated in textile maquiladora sweatshops owned by us korean and taiwanese capital amid a growing resurgence of the class struggle and radicalization of workers and youth internationally the salvadoran working class can only fight against this super exploitation and the staggering levels of inequality by extracting the essential lesson of the bloody defeats of the revolutionary struggles following 1979 it can only oppose imperialism by building an authentic socialist and internationalist party a section of the international committee of the fourth international and waging an intransigent struggle for its political independence against all pro capitalist and nationalist parties like the fmln the trade unions and their pseudo left apologists

this article is more than 5 years old getty actions speak louder than words that s why surveys asking people what they think about the economy aren t always useful their actions might not match their words of course attitudes are important because they guide our decisions even though we don t act on them consistently not everyone s decisions have equal impact though business owners and ceos have more influence because they make bigger decisions whether to create new jobs raise wages buy new equipment and so on the economy has done okay the last few years largely because business leaders were confident in the future we ll know the end is coming when they lose that confidence and they re starting to disturbing trend the national federation of independent business a small business advocacy group compiles a monthly optimism index this is valuable data because small businesses drive job creation and they are usually well informed about local conditions in november 2016 the nfib index climbed more than it fell during the entire 2008 2009 financial crisis see the chart here strange not really consider who is in this survey it s not a random sample of small business owners nfib surveys its own members who are indeed business owners but they also voluntarily joined an organization that advocates lower taxes deregulation and smaller government so of course donald trump s election win made them happy he had promised many things they wanted more significant is that they stayed happy and optimistic and grew even more so the nfib index hit an all time high in august 2018 then it fell in each of the next four months those declines are small and still leave the index higher than it was before the 2016 election but it s starting to look like a downtrend given the lack of other positive news it s hard to imagine what would make the nfib index turn higher from here data reveals more disturbing signs capital spending plans are back where they were in november 2016 only 16 of respondents expect to see better business conditions six months from now just 24 said now is a good time to expand their businesses as noted sentiment data is imprecise none of this means an imminent breakdown but it is concerning especially when larger studies show similar attitudes weak spots the federal reserve s beige book is a collection of anecdotes assembled eight times a year by regional fed staff who talk to their business contacts it s not infallible but it s good for general impressions here is how the latest beige book summarized its findings outlooks generally remained positive but many districts reported that contacts had become less optimistic in response to increased financial market volatility rising short term interest rates falling energy prices and elevated trade and political uncertainty so here again we see optimism starting to fade let s break down the factors they mention increased financial market volatility the stock market was falling as fed staff collected these impressions in some cases a lot that has an impact on sentiment rising short term interest rates borrowing is getting more expensive as the fed tightens policy that makes business financing more expensive falling energy prices this one is a bit surprising lower fuel prices help some businesses those who ship products for instance but hurt those involved in energy production the fed appears to be saying that damage to the energy industry outweighs the benefit of falling fuel prices to others elevated trade and political uncertainty this isn t new so i don t get why they call it elevated in any case the developing trade conflict does make planning difficult for many businesses why make long term investments when you have no idea what tariffs will pop up in the next year the regional summaries showed generally good news but also a few weak spots some examples new york holiday season sales were a bit on the sluggish side but still up from a year ago philadelphia further slowing occurred among service sectors and some real estate activity declined richmond manufacturers reported a decline in shipments and orders and faced higher input costs due to tariffs kansas city district agricultural conditions remained weak dallas a broad based deceleration was seen across manufacturing services retail and energy ominously the dallas fed added this to its summary outlooks were markedly less optimistic than the previous report they saw something new a notable change just in the last few weeks maybe weak oil prices are hurting texas more than we think but it s not just business confidence cracking consumers are noticing it too this month the university of michigan s consumer sentiment index slid to its lowest point since october 2016 and for similar reasons the survey s chief economist described it this way the loss was due to a host of issues including the partial government shutdown the impact of tariffs instabilities in financial markets the global slowdown and the lack of clarity about monetary policies notably consumers showed lower confidence for both present conditions and future expectations people know something is wrong their behavior and economic decisions will increasingly reflect it worry lines none of this is reason to panic it does however support what other data has been telling us us economic growth is slowing that s due to both cyclical factors and the fed s rate hikes and quantitative tightening the problem is that businesses are now far more leveraged than they were the last time we entered recession it won t take much to push default rates higher which will lead to layoffs and lower consumer spending loan defaults are a problem for lenders as well as borrowers you can t get blood from a turnip banks and bondholders who assumed they would get bailed out again may learn that conditions have changed some economists think recessions are a kind of necessary evil because they purge excesses i disagree with that perspective evil is never necessary but it does exist we may see some of the economic kind soon
review overripe economy by alan nasser london pluto press 2018 it is all too rare that an economist makes the case socialism or barbarism or in alan nasser s more piquant alternatives socialism or fascism economics is a hedging profession of carefully detailed countervailing forces and measured equivocation even the seemingly most radical among professional economists generally restrict their advocacy to a social democratic vision of managed capitalism and he makes the case for socialism with an attention to historic detail and eminent readability that in themselves mark it as a work apart though clearly working in the marxist tradition nasser introduces a truly eye opening appreciation of keynes as an institutional socialist for having independently of marx foreseen capitalism s inability to realize its own self transcending potential though nasser does not make the genealogy of his work explicit we can without much resistance place it within the broad domain of breakdown theories theories that is which zero in on the limits of capitalism s plasticity to modify its form and expand without immiserating its working class despoiling the biosphere and eviscerating its limited democracy of course no social system collapses on its own but a capitalism unable to generate any broad reforms for fifty years and which rolls back past gains which piles up levels of class inequality virtually unknown in history hollows out the middle classes and which can offer no uplifting vision of unity and cohesion beyond an ugly and tawdry nationalism envelopes its economic stagnation with an alarming level of universal social decay the desertion of the working classes from socialism in the wake of its post war expansion has now left it with no clear faith in a system that is increasingly failing them its loyalties are once again up for grabs the social convulsions produced by economic crises generate the concrete context for social transformation neither revolution nor reaction raises itself as a possibility in the absence of this objective necessity the book is organized as an unfolding history of american capitalism from the tooth and claw competitiveness of the 19th century to the maturity of the industrial hay days prior to the great depression through the exceptional era of its post war golden age and its ensuing descent into austerity and financialization american capitalism is treated in effect as paradigmatic in its maturity offering a peak into the general arc of capitalist development from its most advanced vantage nasser s narrative confines and excepts itself on this basis from the ancillary issues of peripheral development the rise of sub imperialisms or imperialist rivalry implicit i believe is the unstated assumption that expansion into the exterior cannot ultimately compensate for capitalism s contraction at the interior the marxist view of the inevitability of crises resides in the contradictory nature of capitalist production the production of capital is at the same time the accumulation of capital in which unpaid labor in the form of profits is converted into additional capital profits must be produced in sufficient mass to compensate capital for the relative expulsion of labor from the production process an expulsion that coincides with an increase in labor productivity when the relative increase in exploitation is no longer sufficient to compensate for the diminished base of labor exploited the expansion falters all the difficulties of capitalism reside in the absence of a sufficient expansion of profit yet only by an increase in profits can capitalism overcome its difficulties it is the class nature of capitalist production that imposes system specific limits on economic growth from the proximate vantage of the market place the reality of this fall in the rate of profit is seen as an insufficiency of aggregate demand for it is this very lack of sufficient demand that is seen as the immediate impediment against an increase in prices sufficient to offset declining profitability that at least is the raw material from which marx built his framework for capitalism s periodic contractions as nasser explains the six business cycles that defined the post golden age of the late 1960s and early 70s coincided with a long decline of the profit rate in the us the withering of the framework stimulants fueling the great boom transformative or epoch making innovations bf the beginning of the age of austerity and long term stagnation and the intensification of the economy s financialization keynesian stimulants have proven unappealing to the ruling classes that such programs can increase output aggregate demand employment and wage growth is generally not disputed but unless these programs also increase profitability the ensuing expansion is from the vantage of capitalism a false prosperity and an unwanted detour rather than allow for a diversion of resources and capacity to the public sphere as keynesianism might suggest the preferred means of addressing the prolonged stagnation is through its inverted image privatization the opening of new and in many cases subsidized spheres for profit making from sectors previously walled off to capital but nasser avers capitalist production confronts a more immanent barrier that restricts the viability of such new avenues of accumulation for the same reason as it limits the expansion of existing channels productivity under a fully mature industrial capitalism is not just labor displacing it is in a fundamental sense capital displacing as well ever more productive means of production ai digitilization and robotization can be financed out of amortization funds with an ever diminished need for plowing profits back into production manufacturing s share of worldwide activity is declining globally this combined with an increasingly saturated demand for produced commodities dissolves into a toxic formula capitalism finds itself with a surfeit of investment seeking capital unable to find sufficiently lucrative branches of production within which to expand there is both a lack of profits relative to existing capital and an excess of investment capital yet to be invested profits relative to existing profit making opportunities capitalist accumulation begins to rot from the core degenerating into a zombie like version of marx s rough hewn model instead of the expansion of tangible capital for production investment begins to flow into the accumulation and production of financial assets commodified income streams diced and re bundled as securities arising from mortgage and credit card debt corporate loans pension funds government debt and equities etc and securitized hedges derived from these commodities fictitious capital begins to displace production goods plant machinery means of transportation etc on corporate balance sheets and these financial assets yield a secondary stream of income seemingly independent of the production process that account for an ever mounting pile of profits this income is only in part a redistribution of surplus value among capitalists but it also and more importantly signifies a supplementary stream of working class debt exploitation that converts paid time into unpaid time on the installment plan debt driven demand artificially expands revenues in support of profit margins so that profits appear to have been liberated from the detour of investment but this just papers over the inevitable snapback to come as economic bubbles burst for the same causes that make capital superfluous also make labor precarious mechanized jobs do not come back this hollows out and degrades the wages of average middle skilled workers even the professions have reduced their need for skilled employees wage stagnation cannot long support the accumulation of consumer debt needed to avert collapse because of this our outlived capitalism is doomed to stagger from crisis to crisis as the replay of credit expansion and debt pay down spirals faced with the persistence of low rates of capital expansion and the slow motion immiseration of a working class that had seen itself as a permanent middle class a new disillusionment has set in and for good reason by 2014 the evidence indicated that half of americans were in or near poverty the abstract theoretical model upon which marx built his case for the inevitable decline and breakdown of capitalism did not preclude modifications that could extend its life but these modifications have seemingly run their course no industrially mature society argues nasser can achieve and sustain recovery except by re cycling its mounting surpluses capitalists won t invest nor can they possibly consume their lavish incomes without living multiple life times at once neither can the mounting overhead costs of holding the system intact by means of policing prisons and militarization stabilize the system these accumulating overhead costs neither add to system wide profits nor profitability though a proto fascist such as trump seems hell bent on testing the limits of that proposition this leaves one avenue alone that is why wage growth through a carefully modulated guaranteed basic income has been bandied about albeit without much traction beyond silicon valley but a thoroughgoing downward redistribution of these surpluses required to sustain any industrially mature economy is a remedy that capitalism fears worse than its disease it s a reminder of the limitations of capitalism for it awakens the call for production for need instead of profit i ll leave the last words to alan nasser economic growth in the future must be led by public investment and most importantly by workers wages alas these conditions cannot be met under capitalism this is the strongest case for the democratization of both the political and the economic spheres i e for democratic socialism this is the sole desirable and feasible alternative to a future of working class austerity enforced by a militarized repressive state
president donald trump exaggerated perils at the border flubbed food stamp numbers and the length of wars and told partial truths on drug prices in his state of the union speech he also celebrated a couple of workforce measures that have little to do with him and almost everything to do with a growing population however in a response to the speech democratic politician stacey abrams reflected a recent and misleading talking point by her party when she slammed the trump administration for choosing to cage children at the border ignoring a practice also employed by the obama administration to hold migrant children in facilities with chain link fencing here s a look at some of the statements from state of the union night labour force trump all americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before more people are working now than at any time in the history of our country 157 million people at work the facts yes but that s because the population has grown it s more than doubled since 1950 and in recent months it s been increasing by 150 000 to nearly 200 000 per month births are the primary driver of population growth with immigration also contributing in 2030 that s expected to change with immigration overtaking the natural increase from births exceeding deaths as for women the big question is whether greater percentages of them are working or searching for a job than at any point in history and on this count women have enjoyed better times women s labor force participation rate right now is 57 5 percent according to the us labor department the rate has ticked up recently but it was higher in 2012 and peaked in 2000 at roughly 60 percent overall 63 2 percent of americans are working or looking for work that s a few ticks higher than when mr trump was inaugurated when it was 62 9 percent but far below the 2000 peak of 67 3 percent the rate has declined partly because of aging as a wave of baby boomers retire but even among younger workers it s below where it was nearly two decades ago photo ap photo andrew harnik border el paso trump the border city of el paso texas used to have extremely high rates of violent crime one of the highest in the entire country and considered one of our nation s most dangerous cities now immediately upon its building with a powerful barrier in place el paso is one of the safest cities in our country simply put walls work and walls save lives the facts that s a distorted picture of el paso where trump is going to showcase his push for a border wall el paso has never been considered one of the nation s most dangerous cities in fact its murder rate was less than half the national average in 2005 the year before the start of its border fence the city has experienced ebbs and flows in violent crime but they have largely mirrored national trends and been under national averages for decades border security trump the lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety and security and financial well being of all america the facts whether the border is sufficiently secure or not cuts to the core of a heated national debate but it s far from lawless the number of people arrested for crossing illegally has plunged in the last decade and is near its lowest level since the mid 1990s illustrating a substantial downward trend in the number of migrants trying to sneak in border patrol personnel detection technology and physical barriers have increased in that time do walls work trump these border agents will tell you where walls go up illegal crossings go way way down san diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in our country in response a strong security wall was put in place this powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings simply put walls work and walls save lives the facts it s a lot more complicated than that yes border patrol arrests in the san diego sector plummeted 96 percent from nearly 630 000 in 1986 to barely 26 000 in 2017 a period during which walls were built but the crackdown pushed illegal crossings to less patrolled and more remote arizona deserts where thousands died in the heat arrests in tucson in 2000 nearly matched san diego s peak critics say the water balloon effect build a wall in one spot and migrants will find an opening elsewhere undermines trump s argument though proponents say it only demonstrates that walls should be extended the government accountability office reported in 2017 that the u s has not developed metrics that demonstrate how barriers have contributed to border security legal immigration trump i want people to come into our country in the largest numbers ever but they have to come in legally the facts his policy recommendations to date do not reflect this wish the plan he proposed upon taking office would have sharply limited the ability of citizens and permanent residents to bring in family which he derisively called chain migration the cato institute which favors more open immigration policies estimated his plan would cut the number of legal immigrants by up to 44 percent the largest cut to legal immigration since the 1920s according to data from the homeland security department about 750 000 of more than 1 1 million people who obtained green cards in 2017 or two thirds did so through family relations mr trump s plan called for limiting family based green cards to spouses and minor children of us citizens and green card holders a dramatic cut he s also slashed the number of refugees the us will accept for two straight years and he wants to eliminate diversity visas he s talked about switching to merit based instead of family based immigration and said at times that he wants to make it easier for temporary workers to work and graduates from top colleges to stay in the country but researchers have said the net effect of his proposals would be fewer legal immigrants middle east wars trump our brave troops have now been fighting in the middle east for almost 19 years the facts trump exaggerated the length of the wars in iraq and afghanistan the war in afghanistan began in october 2001 in the aftermath of the 11 september attacks the invasion of iraq was in march 2003 the us has been at war for a bit more than 17 years also he refers to fighting in the middle east iraq is in the middle east but afghanistan is in central asia photo ap photo andrew harnik food stamps trump describing progress over the last two years nearly 5 million americans have been lifted off food stamps the facts the number of people receiving food stamps actually hasn t declined that much government data show there were 44 2 million people participating in the supplemental nutrition and assistance program in 2016 before mr trump took office in 2018 there were 40 3 million people participating in snap that s a decline of 3 9 million not the 5 million mr trump talked about the number of people participating in the snap program peaked in 2013 and has been going down since that time mr trump s last budget proposed cutting snap by 213 billion over 10 years the administration also has been pushing to give states more flexibility in implementing the program including tightening work requirements for recipients abrams economy abrams the republican tax bill rigged the system against working people rather than bringing back jobs plants are closing layoffs are looming and wages struggle to keep pace with the actual cost of living the facts the economy is doing better after the introduction of the trump administration s tax cuts than abrams suggests the number of people seeking unemployment benefits a proxy for layoffs briefly fell to a five decade low last month average hourly pay is running ahead of inflation tariffs trump we recently imposed tariffs on 250 billion of chinese goods and now our treasury is receiving billions of dollars the facts this is misleading yes money from tariffs is going into the federal treasury but it s largely coming from us businesses and consumers it s not foreign countries that are paying these import taxes by cutting a cheque to the government mr trump s reference to money coming into the treasury now belies the fact that tariffs go back to the founding of the country this revenue did not start with his increased tariffs on some goods from china tariffs did produce 41 3 billion in tax revenues in the last budget year according to the treasury department but that is a small fraction of a federal budget that exceeds 4 1 trillion the tariffs paid by us companies also tend to result in higher prices for consumers which is what happened for washing machines after the trump administration imposed import taxes trade nafta trump our new us mexico canada agreement or usmca will replace nafta and deliver for american workers bringing back our manufacturing jobs expanding american agriculture protecting intellectual property and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with the four beautiful words made in the usa the facts it s unlikely to do all those things since the new agreement largely preserves the structure and substance of nafta in addition the deal has not been ratified and its chances in congress are uncertain in one new feature the deal requires that 40 percent of cars contents eventually be made in countries that pay autoworkers at least 16 an hour that is in the united states or canada but not in mexico it also requires mexico to pursue an overhaul of labor law to encourage independent unions that will bargain for higher wages and better working conditions for mexicans still just before the agreement was signed general motors announced that it would lay off 14 000 workers and close five plants in the us and canada philip levy senior fellow at the chicago council on global affairs and a trade official in republican president george w bush s white house says president trump has seriously overhyped this agreement drug pricing trump already as a result of my administration s efforts in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years the facts trump is selectively citing statistics to exaggerate what seems to be a slowdown in prices a broader look at the data shows that drug prices are still rising but more moderately some independent experts say criticism from trump and congressional democrats may be causing pharmaceutical companies to show restraint the consumer price index for prescription drugs shows a 0 6 percent reduction in prices in december 2018 compared to december 2017 the biggest drop in nearly 50 years the government index tracks a set of medications including brand drugs and generics however that same index showed a 1 6 percent increase when comparing the full 12 months of 2018 with the entire previous year the annualized number gives you a better picture said economist paul hughes cromwick of altarum a nonprofit research organization it could be that something quirky happened in december separately an analysis of brand name drug prices by the associated press shows there were 2712 price increases in the first half of this january as compared with 3327 increases during the same period last year the size of this year s increases was not as pronounced both this year and last the number of price cuts was minuscule the information for the analysis was provided by health data firm elsevier photo ap photo rich pedroncelli wages trump wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades and growing for blue collar workers who i promised to fight for they re growing faster than anyone else thought possible the facts this is an unsupported statement because the data on hourly wages for private workers only go back to 2006 not decades but data on wages for production workers date back to 1939 and trump s claim appears to be unfounded average hourly earnings for production and nonsupervisory workers are up 3 4 percent over the past year according to the labor department those wage gains were higher as recently as early 2009 and they were averaging roughly 4 percent before the start of the global financial crisis in late 2007 there are other ways to track wage gains and those don t work in trump s favor either adjusted for inflation median weekly wages rose just 0 6 percent in 2018 the gains in weekly wages were 2 1 percent in 2015 abrams migrant children abrams in the democratic response we know bipartisanship could craft a 21st century immigration plan but this administration chooses to cage children and tear families apart the facts the cages that abrams mentions are actually chain link fences and the obama administration used them too children are held behind them inside holding border patrol facilities under the trump administration as well obama s administration detained large numbers of unaccompanied children inside chain link fences in 2014 images that circulated online of children in cages during the height of trump s family separations controversy were actually from 2014 when president barack obama was in office children are placed in such areas by age and sex for safety reasons and are held for up to 72 hours by the border patrol the department of homeland security inspector general visited five detention facilities for unaccompanied children on the texas border with mexico in late june during the height of the furor over family separations and found they appeared to comply with detention standards the government watchdog reported that cleanliness was inconsistent but that the children had access to toilets food drinks clean bedding and hygiene items at the height of the family separations about 2 400 children were separated since then 118 children were separated immigration officials are allowed to take a child from a parent in certain cases serious criminal charges against a parent concerns over the health and welfare of a child or medical concerns that policy has long been in place and is separate from the now suspended zero tolerance trump administration policy that saw children separated from parents only because they had crossed illegally minority unemployment trump african american hispanic american and asian american unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded the facts what he s not saying is that the unemployment rates for all three groups have gone up since reaching record low levels black unemployment reached a record low 5 9 percent in may but rose to 6 8 percent in january latino unemployment fell to 4 4 percent its lowest ever last october and asian unemployment fell to a record low of 2 2 percent in may but latino and asian unemployment also have increased in part because of the government shutdown which elevated unemployment last month the african american rate is still nearly double the jobless rate for whites at 3 5 percent the most dramatic drop in black unemployment came under obama when it fell from a recession high of 16 8 percent in march 2010 to 7 8 percent in january 2017 human trafficking trump human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the united states and to sell them into prostitution and modern day slavery the facts his administration has not supplied evidence that women and girls are smuggled by the thousands across remote areas of the border for these purposes what has been established is nearly 80 percent of international trafficking victims cross through legal ports of entry a flow that would not be stopped by a border wall trump distorts how often trafficking victims come from the southern border according the counter trafficking data collaborative a global hub for trafficking statistics with data contributed by organizations from around the world the national human trafficking hotline a venture supported by federal money and operated by the anti trafficking group polaris began tracking individual victim records in 2015 from january through june 31 2018 it tracked 35 000 potential victims of those there was a near equal distribution between foreigners on one hand and u s citizens and legal permanent residents on the other most of the labor trafficking victims were foreign and most of the sex trafficking victims were u s citizens of foreign nationals mexico had the most frequently trafficked economy trump in just over two years since the election we have launched an unprecedented economic boom a boom that has rarely been seen before there s been nothing like it an economic miracle is taking place in the united states the facts the president is vastly exaggerating what has been a mild improvement in growth and hiring the economy is healthy but not nearly one of the best in us history the economy expanded at an annual rate of 3 8 percent last spring and summer a solid pace but it was just the fastest in four years in the late 1990s growth topped 4 percent for four straight years a level it has not yet reached under trump and growth even reached 7 2 percent in 1984 almost all independent economists expect slower growth this year as the effect of the trump administration s tax cuts fade trade tensions and slower global growth hold back exports and higher interest rates make it more expensive to borrow to buy cars and homes energy trump we have unleashed a revolution in american energy the united states is now the no 1 producer of oil and natural gas in the world the facts true if we means trump and his recent predecessors it s not all to trump s credit the government says the u s became the world s top natural gas producer in 2013 under the obama administration the u s now leads the world in oil production too under trump that s largely because of a boom in production from shale oil which also began under obama ap watch the full state of the union address
