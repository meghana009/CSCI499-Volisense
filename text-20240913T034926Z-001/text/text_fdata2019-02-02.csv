less than two decades into the twenty first century it is evident that capitalism has failed as a social system the world is mired in economic stagnation financialization and the most extreme inequality in human history accompanied by mass unemployment and underemployment precariousness poverty hunger wasted output and lives and what at this point can only be called a planetary ecological death spiral 1 the digital revolution the greatest technological advance of our time has rapidly mutated from a promise of free communication and liberated production into new means of surveillance control and displacement of the working population the institutions of liberal democracy are at the point of collapse while fascism the rear guard of the capitalist system is again on the march along with patriarchy racism imperialism and war to say that capitalism is a failed system is not of course to suggest that its breakdown and disintegration is imminent 2 it does however mean that it has passed from being a historically necessary and creative system at its inception to being a historically unnecessary and destructive one in the present century today more than ever the world is faced with the epochal choice between the revolutionary reconstitution of society at large and the common ruin of the contending classes 3 indications of this failure of capitalism are everywhere stagnation of investment punctuated by bubbles of financial expansion which then inevitably burst now characterizes the so called free market 4 soaring inequality in income and wealth has its counterpart in the declining material circumstances of a majority of the population real wages for most workers in the united states have barely budged in forty years despite steadily rising productivity 5 work intensity has increased while work and safety protections on the job have been systematically jettisoned unemployment data has become more and more meaningless due to a new institutionalized underemployment in the form of contract labor in the gig economy 6 unions have been reduced to mere shadows of their former glory as capitalism has asserted totalitarian control over workplaces with the demise of soviet type societies social democracy in europe has perished in the new atmosphere of liberated capitalism 7 the capture of the surplus value produced by overexploited populations in the poorest regions of the world via the global labor arbitrage instituted by multinational corporations is leading to an unprecedented amassing of financial wealth at the center of the world economy and relative poverty in the periphery 8 around 21 trillion of offshore funds are currently lodged in tax havens on islands mostly in the caribbean constituting the fortified refuge of big finance 9 technologically driven monopolies resulting from the global communications revolution together with the rise to dominance of wall street based financial capital geared to speculative asset creation have further contributed to the riches of today s 1 percent forty two billionaires now enjoy as much wealth as half the world s population while the three richest men in the united states jeff bezos bill gates and warren buffett have more wealth than half the u s population 10 in every region of the world inequality has increased sharply in recent decades 11 the gap in per capita income and wealth between the richest and poorest nations which has been the dominant trend for centuries is rapidly widening once again 12 more than 60 percent of the world s employed population some two billion people now work in the impoverished informal sector forming a massive global proletariat the global reserve army of labor is some 70 percent larger than the active labor army of formally employed workers 13 adequate health care housing education and clean water and air are increasingly out of reach for large sections of the population even in wealthy countries in north america and europe while transportation is becoming more difficult in the united states and many other countries due to irrationally high levels of dependency on the automobile and disinvestment in public transportation urban structures are more and more characterized by gentrification and segregation with cities becoming the playthings of the well to do while marginalized populations are shunted aside about half a million people most of them children are homeless on any given night in the united states 14 new york city is experiencing a major rat infestation attributed to warming temperatures mirroring trends around the world 15 in the united states and other high income countries life expectancy is in decline with a remarkable resurgence of victorian illnesses related to poverty and exploitation in britain gout scarlet fever whooping cough and even scurvy are now resurgent along with tuberculosis with inadequate enforcement of work health and safety regulations black lung disease has returned with a vengeance in u s coal country 16 overuse of antibiotics particularly by capitalist agribusiness is leading to an antibiotic resistance crisis with the dangerous growth of superbugs generating increasing numbers of deaths which by mid century could surpass annual cancer deaths prompting the world health organization to declare a global health emergency 17 these dire conditions arising from the workings of the system are consistent with what frederick engels in the condition of the working class in england called social murder 18 at the instigation of giant corporations philanthrocapitalist foundations and neoliberal governments public education has been restructured around corporate designed testing based on the implementation of robotic common core standards this is generating massive databases on the student population much of which are now being surreptitiously marketed and sold 19 the corporatization and privatization of education is feeding the progressive subordination of children s needs to the cash nexus of the commodity market we are thus seeing a dramatic return of thomas gradgrind s and mr m choakumchild s crass utilitarian philosophy dramatized in charles dickens s hard times facts are alone wanted in life and you are never to fancy 20 having been reduced to intellectual dungeons many of the poorest most racially segregated schools in the united states are mere pipelines for prisons or the military 21 more than two million people in the united states are behind bars a higher rate of incarceration than any other country in the world constituting a new jim crow the total population in prison is nearly equal to the number of people in houston texas the fourth largest u s city african americans and latinos make up 56 percent of those incarcerated while constituting only about 32 percent of the u s population nearly 50 percent of american adults and a much higher percentage among african americans and native americans have an immediate family member who has spent or is currently spending time behind bars both black men and native american men in the united states are nearly three times hispanic men nearly two times more likely to die of police shootings than white men 22 racial divides are now widening across the entire planet violence against women and the expropriation of their unpaid labor as well as the higher level of exploitation of their paid labor are integral to the way in which power is organized in capitalist society and how it seeks to divide rather than unify the population more than a third of women worldwide have experienced physical sexual violence women s bodies in particular are objectified reified and commodified as part of the normal workings of monopoly capitalist marketing 23 the mass media propaganda system part of the larger corporate matrix is now merging into a social media based propaganda system that is more porous and seemingly anarchic but more universal and more than ever favoring money and power utilizing modern marketing and surveillance techniques which now dominate all digital interactions vested interests are able to tailor their messages largely unchecked to individuals and their social networks creating concerns about fake news on all sides 24 numerous business entities promising technological manipulation of voters in countries across the world have now surfaced auctioning off their services to the highest bidders 25 the elimination of net neutrality in the united states means further concentration centralization and control over the entire internet by monopolistic service providers elections are increasingly prey to unregulated dark money emanating from the coffers of corporations and the billionaire class although presenting itself as the world s leading democracy the united states as paul baran and paul sweezy stated in monopoly capital in 1966 is democratic in form and plutocratic in content 26 in the trump administration following a long established tradition 72 percent of those appointed to the cabinet have come from the higher corporate echelons while others have been drawn from the military 27 war engineered by the united states and other major powers at the apex of the system has become perpetual in strategic oil regions such as the middle east and threatens to escalate into a global thermonuclear exchange during the obama administration the united states was engaged in wars bombings in seven different countries afghanistan iraq syria libya yemen somalia and pakistan 28 torture and assassinations have been reinstituted by washington as acceptable instruments of war against those now innumerable individuals group networks and whole societies that are branded as terrorist a new cold war and nuclear arms race is in the making between the united states and russia while washington is seeking to place road blocks to the continued rise of china the trump administration has created a new space force as a separate branch of the military in an attempt to ensure u s dominance in the militarization of space sounding the alarm on the increasing dangers of a nuclear war and of climate destabilization the distinguished bulletin of atomic scientists moved its doomsday clock in 2018 to two minutes to midnight the closest since 1953 when it marked the advent of thermonuclear weapons 29 increasingly severe economic sanctions are being imposed by the united states on countries like venezuela and nicaragua despite their democratic elections or because of them trade and currency wars are being actively promoted by core states while racist barriers against immigration continue to be erected in europe and the united states as some 60 million refugees and internally displaced peoples flee devastated environments migrant populations worldwide have risen to 250 million with those residing in high income countries constituting more than 14 percent of the populations of those countries up from less than 10 percent in 2000 meanwhile ruling circles and wealthy countries seek to wall off islands of power and privilege from the mass of humanity who are to be left to their fate 30 more than three quarters of a billion people over 10 percent of the world population are chronically malnourished 31 food stress in the united states keeps climbing leading to the rapid growth of cheap dollar stores selling poor quality and toxic food around forty million americans representing one out of eight households including nearly thirteen million children are food insecure 32 subsistence farmers are being pushed off their lands by agribusiness private capital and sovereign wealth funds in a global depeasantization process that constitutes the greatest movement of people in history 33 urban overcrowding and poverty across much of the globe is so severe that one can now reasonably refer to a planet of slums 34 meanwhile the world housing market is estimated to be worth up to 163 trillion as compared to the value of gold mined over all recorded history estimated at 7 5 trillion 35 the anthropocene epoch first ushered in by the great acceleration of the world economy immediately after the second world war has generated enormous rifts in planetary boundaries extending from climate change to ocean acidification to the sixth extinction to disruption of the global nitrogen and phosphorus cycles to the loss of freshwater to the disappearance of forests to widespread toxic chemical and radioactive pollution 36 it is now estimated that 60 percent of the world s wildlife vertebrate population including mammals reptiles amphibians birds and fish have been wiped out since 1970 while the worldwide abundance of invertebrates has declined by 45 percent in recent decades 37 what climatologist james hansen calls the species exterminations resulting from accelerating climate change and rapidly shifting climate zones are only compounding this general process of biodiversity loss biologists expect that half of all species will be facing extinction by the end of the century 38 if present climate change trends continue the global carbon budget associated with a 2 c increase in average global temperature will be broken in sixteen years while a 1 5 c increase in global average temperature staying beneath which is the key to long term stabilization of the climate will be reached in a decade earth system scientists warn that the world is now perilously close to a hothouse earth in which catastrophic climate change will be locked in and irreversible 39 the ecological social and economic costs to humanity of continuing to increase carbon emissions by 2 0 percent a year as in recent decades rising in 2018 by 2 7 percent 3 4 percent in the united states and failing to meet the minimal 3 0 percent annual reductions in emissions currently needed to avoid a catastrophic destabilization of the earth s energy balance are simply incalculable 40 nevertheless major energy corporations continue to lie about climate change promoting and bankrolling climate denialism while admitting the truth in their internal documents these corporations are working to accelerate the extraction and production of fossil fuels including the dirtiest most greenhouse gas generating varieties reaping enormous profits in the process the melting of the arctic ice from global warming is seen by capital as a new el dorado opening up massive additional oil and gas reserves to be exploited without regard to the consequences for the earth s climate in response to scientific reports on climate change exxon mobil declared that it intends to extract and sell all of the fossil fuel reserves at its disposal 41 energy corporations continue to intervene in climate negotiations to ensure that any agreements to limit carbon emissions are defanged capitalist countries across the board are putting the accumulation of wealth for a few above combatting climate destabilization threatening the very future of humanity capitalism is best understood as a competitive class based mode of production and exchange geared to the accumulation of capital through the exploitation of workers labor power and the private appropriation of surplus value value generated beyond the costs of the workers own reproduction the mode of economic accounting intrinsic to capitalism designates as a value generating good or service anything that passes through the market and therefore produces income it follows that the greater part of the social and environmental costs of production outside the market are excluded in this form of valuation and are treated as mere negative externalities unrelated to the capitalist economy itself whether in terms of the shortening and degradation of human life or the destruction of the natural environment as environmental economist k william kapp stated capitalism must be regarded as an economy of unpaid costs 42 we have now reached a point in the twenty first century in which the externalities of this irrational system such as the costs of war the depletion of natural resources the waste of human lives and the disruption of the planetary environment now far exceed any future economic benefits that capitalism offers to society as a whole the accumulation of capital and the amassing of wealth are increasingly occurring at the expense of an irrevocable rift in the social and environmental conditions governing human life on earth 43 some would argue that china stands as an exception to much of the above characterized as it is by a seemingly unstoppable rate of economic advance though carrying with it deep social and ecological contradictions yet chinese development has its roots in the 1949 chinese revolution carried out by the chinese communist party headed by mao zedong whereby it liberated itself from the imperialist system this allowed it to develop for decades under a planned economy largely free of constraints from outside forces establishing a strong agricultural and industrial economic base this was followed by a shift in the post maoist reform period to a hybrid system of more limited state planning along with a much greater reliance on market relations and a vast expansion of debt and speculation under conditions the globalization of the world market that were particularly fortuitous to its catching up through trade wars and other pressures aimed at destabilizing china s position in the world market the united states is already seeking to challenge the bases of china s growth in world trade china therefore stands not so much for the successes of late capitalism but rather for its inherent limitations the current chinese model moreover carries within it many of the destructive tendencies of the system of capital accumulation ultimately china s future too depends on a return to the process of revolutionary transition spurred by its own population 44 how did these disastrous conditions characterizing capitalism worldwide develop an understanding of the failure of capitalism beginning in the twentieth century requires a historical examination of the rise of neoliberalism and how this has only served to increase the destructiveness of the system only then can we address the future of humanity in the twenty first century neoliberalism and capitalist failure many of the symptoms of the failure of capitalism described above are well known nevertheless they are often attributed not to capitalism as a system but simply to neoliberalism viewed as a particular paradigm of capitalist development that can be replaced by another better one for many people on the left the answer to neoliberalism or disaster capitalism is a return to welfare state liberalism market regulation or some form of limited social democracy and thus to a more rational capitalism it is not the failure of capitalism itself that is perceived as the problem but rather the failure of neoliberal capitalism in contrast the marxian tradition understands neoliberalism as an inherent outgrowth of late capitalism associated with the domination of monopoly finance capital a critical historical analysis of neoliberalism is therefore crucial both to grounding our understanding of capitalism today and uncovering the reason why all alternatives to neoliberalism and its capitalist absolutism are closed within the system itself the term neoliberalism had its origin in the early 1920s in the marxian critique of ludwig von mises s nation state and economy 1919 and socialism an economic and sociological analysis 1922 both of which were written as virulent anti socialist tracts constituting the foundational works of neoliberal capitalist ideology 45 in these works mises then employed by the vienna chamber of commerce insisted that the old liberalism had to be relaid in such a way as to defeat socialism in the process he equated socialism with destructionism insisted that monopoly was consistent with capitalist free competition defended unlimited inequality and argued that consumers exercised democracy through their purchases which were equivalent to ballots he strongly condemned labor legislation compulsory social insurance trade unions unemployment insurance socialization or nationalization taxation and inflation as the enemies of his refurbished liberalism 46 so extreme were mises s neoliberal views that he explicitly took the side of the crass utilitarian pedagogue m choakumchild against the defiant young heroine sissy jupe as portrayed by dickens in hard times dickens mises claimed had taught millions to hate liberalism and capitalism 47 in 1921 austro marxist max adler coined the term neoliberalism to designate mises s attempt to refurbish a fading liberal order through a new ideology of market fetishism this was followed by a sharp criticism of mises s neoliberal ideology in 1923 by the gifted austro marxist helene bauer in 1924 the german marxist alfred meusel wrote a lengthy critique of mises entitled neoliberalism der neu liberalismus for the leading german socialist theoretical journal die gesellschaft edited by rudolf hilferding 48 building on a wealth of marxian analysis adler bauer and meusel attacked mises s claim that an unregulated capitalism was the only rational economic system and that socialism was equivalent to destructionism they strongly challenged his ahistorical depiction of a harmonious capitalism that promoted free exchange and free trade through the market mechanism a serious logical flaw in mises s analysis they contended was the systematic bifurcation built into his neoliberal ideology whereby trade unions were considered constraints on trade while employers associations and monopolistic corporations were justified as consistent with free competition likewise it was noted that mises advocated a strong state to repress working class struggles in the name of a self regulating market system even when state action on behalf of workers was condemned as anti free market and a form of class terror for meusel mises was a faithful servant of the mobile capitalist or international finance capital later in 1926 the protofascist economist othmar spann criticized the atavistic attempt to revert to a more extreme version of classical liberalism referring to this in his types of economic theory as the neo liberal trend 49 in 1927 in his work liberalism mises himself distinguished between the older liberalism and neoliberalism on the basis of the commitment of the former to equality in contrast to the rejection of equality other than so called equality of opportunity by the latter 50 neoliberalism as it first emerged from mises s pen was thus viewed by marxian critics in the 1920s and even by some figures on the right as an attempt to rationalize a monopoly or finance capital far removed from the precepts of classical liberalism it was designed to provide the intellectual basis for capitalist class warfare against not only socialism but all attempts at social regulation and social democracy a no quarter given attack on the working class mises s assault on socialism together with that of his protégé friedrich hayek was motivated in part by a profound disenchantment with red vienna under the sway of austro marxism which was inspired by figures like adler otto bauer and karl renner 51 conversely it was this same political environment of red vienna which dominated austrian politics from 1919 32 that inspired karl polanyi who was strongly influenced by adler and otto bauer to develop a crushing critique of the neoliberal belief in the self regulating market later to form the basis of the great transformation 1946 52 in the 1930s to 1960s following the great depression and the second world war neoliberal ideology waned in the context of the deepening crisis of capitalism in the early 1930s as the storm clouds gathered over europe mises served as an economic advisor to austrofascist chancellor dictator engelbert dollfuss prior to the nazi takeover of austria 53 he later emigrated to switzerland and then to the united states enjoying the support of the rockefeller foundation and teaching at new york university meanwhile hayek was recruited by the london school of economics at the instigation of the early neoliberal british economist lionel robbins the post second world war years in the west were known as the age of keynes spurred on by increased state spending particularly on the military in the context of the cold war the rebuilding of the war torn european and japanese economies the expansion of the sales effort waves of automobilization in both the united states and europe and two major regional wars in asia capitalist economies grew rapidly for a quarter century 54 meanwhile faced with the threat of the alternative model represented by the soviet union and the advent of strong unions as a result of the developments of the 1930s and 40s the west moved in the direction of keynesianism social democracy and the welfare state nevertheless the tendency toward economic stagnation already exhibited in the 1930s remained as a structural flaw of the system temporarily masked by the so called golden age of rapid growth and increasing income for workers that immediately followed the second world war the giant corporations of monopoly capitalism succeeded in appropriating ever greater surplus in both absolute and relative terms which was concentrated in the hands of ever fewer wealth holders leading to a tendency toward overaccumulation of capital and manufacturing overcapacity countered in part by a massive expansion of the sales effort militarism and imperialism but with ever lessening effect in stimulating the economy u s imperialism and the proliferation of dollars abroad led to a breakdown in the bretton woods system that had stabilized world trade in the early post second world war period causing richard nixon to end the dollar gold standard in 1971 this was associated with a slowdown in the u s economy from the late 1960s on as the vietnam war was winding down resulting in a structural crisis of the capitalist system in the mid 1970s which was to mark the beginning of decades of economic stagnation and a long decline in the trend rate of growth in the advanced capitalist economies the major stimuli that sparked the post second world war boom had all waned leaving the advanced capitalist economies in the doldrums 55 the first response to the structural crisis of the capitalist system that emerged in the 1970s was to utilize keynesian demand promotion to expand state spending u s civilian government spending on goods and services as a percentage of gross domestic product thus reached a peak during the nixon administration 56 this plus the struggles of unions to maintain their real wages in the crisis while monopolistic corporations aggressively raised prices to increase their profit margins led to a period of stagflation economic stagnation plus inflation inflation which depreciates accumulated wealth held in the form of monetary assets is a much greater immediate threat to the position of the capitalist class than is economic stagnation while for the working class the situation is reversed the result was the emergence of an anti keynesian movement within the capitalist class which designated anything to the left of hardcore neoliberalism as socialist or totalitarian in the manner of hayek s road to serfdom and sought to reverse decades of modest working class gains 57 there was a sharp turn toward austerity and economic restructuring initially under the guise of monetarism and supply side economics and later taking a more amorphous free market character a concerted effort to destroy unions by combined political economic and juridical means was carried out eliminating what john kenneth galbraith in his american capitalism had once called the countervailing power of labor 58 key to the reemergence of neoliberalism in the post second world period was the mont pèlerin society named after the swiss spa where mises hayek robbins milton friedman george stigler raymond aron and others met in 1947 to promote neoliberal economic and political ideas the members of the mont pèlerin society generally referred to themselves as classical liberals in the european sense no doubt remembering the devastating marxist critiques of neoliberal ideology in the 1920s they eschewed the label neoliberal which mises himself had adopted in 1927 and which had been put forward in the 1938 walter lippmann colloquium in paris that mises and hayek attended 59 instead neoliberalism was presented by its chief adherents in the mont pèlerin society not as a separate political ideology from but as an extension of classical liberalism and attributable to inherent features of human nature in this way as michel foucault argued it was converted into a kind of biopolitics 60 nevertheless while abandoning the neoliberal label the mont pèlerin society together with the department of economics at the university of chicago was to be a bastion of neoliberal ideology in precisely the sense that it had first emerged between the world wars in the keynesian era of the 1950s and 60s figures like mises hayek friedman and james buchanan remained on the margins though heavily bankrolled by private foundations 61 but with the return of economic stagnation in the 1970s neoliberal intellectuals were actively recruited at the apex of monopoly capital in order to provide the ideological basis for an ongoing corporate campaign to restructure the capitalist economy deliberately targeting labor the state and the underdeveloped economies of the global south central to neoliberal philosophy from the beginning was the defense of concentrated corporate capital and class dynasties which were portrayed as representing free market competition and entrepreneurship 62 the very virulence of neoliberal anti socialism meant that it represented the drive to a complete market privatization of social life in margaret thatcher s london and ronald reagan s washington figures like hayek and friedman became the symbols of the neoliberal era sometimes called the age of hayek the new so called nobel prize in economics or the sveriges riksbank bank of sweden prize in economic sciences in memory of alfred nobel established by the bank of sweden in 1969 was controlled from its inception by ultraconservative neoliberal economists seven members of the mont pèlerin society including hayek friedman stigler and buchanan received the prize between 1974 and 1992 while even mildly social democratic economists were all but excluded 63 neoliberalism as an economic ideology was largely ineffectual in normal economic policy terms judged by its lack of success in promoting growth since like neoclassical economics itself it sought to deny or rationalize the reality of an economy dominated by big business and concentrated power 64 nevertheless it served as an effective political economic strategy for big business and the emerging billionaire class in an age where monopoly finance capital sought to seize control of all monetary flows in society 65 although capitalist economies continued to stagnate with growth rates diminishing decade by decade the surplus capital in the hands of the corporate rich not only increased but by virtue of financialization globalization and the revolution in digital technology new forms of amassing wealth were created 66 financialization the relative shift of the economy from production to finance opened up vast new avenues to speculation and wealth formation relatively removed from capital investment in new productive capacity that is real capital accumulation globalization meant not only new markets but more importantly through the global labor arbitrage the appropriation of huge economic surpluses from the overexploitation of low wage labor in the periphery that ended up in the financial coffers of multinational corporations and wealthy individuals in the rich countries 67 the benefits of imperialism to workers in the center of the capitalist economy no longer included incremental gains in employment and income associated with the global dominance of production but at best could be said to contribute to cheaper prices from the outsourcing of production by multinational corporations symbolized by the growth of walmart meanwhile digital technology created the basis of a new globalized surveillance capitalism buying and selling information on the population primarily motivated by the sales effort leading to the creation of enormous information technology monopolies 68 vast increases in inequality and wealth were justified as returns for innovation always attributed to a very few rather than as the collective product of society in the new era of expropriation all was up for grabs education health systems transportation housing land cities prisons insurance pensions food entertainment all exchanges in society were to be fully commodified corporatized and financialized with the funds flowing into financial centers and feeding speculation on capital gains leveraged by debt human communication was itself to be turned into a commodity all in the name of a free market society for the powers that be this strategy was enormously successful capitalism despite adam smith had never been about the wealth of nations so much as the wealth of the capitalist class the financialization process managed to counter economic stagnation tendencies to some extent but at the cost of periodic financial crises layered over the normal business cycle nevertheless the amassing of wealth at the top continued to accelerate with financial crises themselves leading to even greater financial concentration and centralization in this situation neoliberalism increasingly took on the logic of financialized expropriation and accumulation the state too became subject to the financialization policy shifting its overall role to protecting the value of money 69 in the great financial crisis of 2007 09 the big banks and corporations were almost all bailed out the population was not rather than representing a severe crisis for neoliberalism itself the great financial crisis only gave it further impetus reflecting the fact that neoliberal politics had become the ideological expression of an all encompassing system of financial expropriation 70 a characteristic of this new era of financialized accumulation is that it is progressively removed from the realities of production and use value heightening the conflict between exchange value the value form and use value the natural form within the overall production and accumulation process 71 the result is a social and ecological planetary emergency 72 this is most evident in the rapid destruction of the natural environment fossil fuels are entered as financial assets on the books of corporations even when they exist only in the form of reserves buried in the ground in this way they are integral to the entire financialized accumulation process of monopoly capitalism trillions of dollars of wall street assets are thus tied up in fossil capital 73 this has made it doubly difficult to shift away from the extraction and use of fossil fuels to more sustainable alternatives such as solar and wind power no one owns the sun s rays or the wind hence there is less of a vested interest in these forms of energy in today s capitalism more than ever before current and potential future profits dictate all at the expense of people and the planet the human population stands by seemingly helpless watching the destruction of the climate and the loss of innumerable species all imposed by the ostensibly overwhelming force of market society neoliberalism has always been directly opposed to strict laissez faire since it has invariably emphasized a strong interventionist and constructionist relation to the state in the direct service of private capital and market authoritarianism or what james k galbraith has critically referred to as the predator state 74 in the neoliberal view capitalist absolutism is not a spontaneous product it must be created the role of the state is not simply to protect property as maintained by smith but as foucault brilliantly explained in his birth of biopolitics extends to the active construction of the domination of the market over all aspects of life 75 this means refashioning the state and society on the model of the corporation or the market as foucault put it the problem of neo liberalism is how the overall exercise of political power can be modeled on the principles of a market economy the state must not correct the destructive effects of the market where these fall on society outside the market but rather take advantage of these destructive effects to impose further measures that extend the reach and penetration of the market 76 the goal is not to transcend the state altogether but to shackle it to the monopolistic competitive ends of capital a view forcefully propagated by buchanan 77 the shackles imposed on the neoliberal state dominated by monopoly finance capital are specially designed to limit any changes that would negatively affect the value of money hence both fiscal and monetary policy are increasingly put out of reach of the government itself in those cases where changes going against the vested interests are contemplated central banks have been transformed into largely autonomous branches of the state in fact controlled by the banks treasury departments are shackled by debt ceilings regulatory agencies are captured by monopoly finance capital and act for the most part in the direct interest of corporations outside governmental control 78 the result of such an attempt to construct a so called self regulating market society in fact requiring constant state interventions on behalf of capital and the creation of a predator state is as polanyi powerfully demonstrated to undermine the very foundations of society and life itself 79 but in terms of capitalism today there is no going back stagnation financialization privatization globalization the marketization of the state and the reduction of people to human capital and nature to natural capital have made neoliberal politics an irrevocable characteristic of monopoly finance capital which only an anti capitalist politics can supplant neoliberalism has thus become integrated into the system in the context of the structural crisis of capitalism in its globalized monopoly finance phase it extends this structural crisis to all of society and makes it universal and insurmountable within the system the answer to every failing of capitalism is thus to turn the screw further which accounts for much of the allure of the market principle since it is perpetually seen as the solution to the problems it causes with each failure opening up new areas of profitability for a few the result of this irrational logic is not merely economic and ecological disaster but the gradual demise of the liberal democratic state itself neoliberalism thus points inevitably to market authoritarianism and even neofascism in this respect donald trump is no mere aberration 80 as mises openly declared in 1927 in liberalism it cannot be denied that fascism and similar movements aiming at the establishment of dictatorships are full of the best intentions and that their intervention has for the moment saved european civilization the merit that fascism has thereby won for itself will live on eternally in history 81 hayek along with other neoliberals such as friedman and buchanan actively supported general augusto pinochet s coup in chile in 1973 overthrowing the democratically elected socialist government of salvador allende and imposing an economic shock doctrine on the population in this context hayek in a trip he took to chile in 1978 personally warned pinochet against a resurrection of unlimited democracy during a second visit in 1981 he stated that a dictatorship may be more liberal in its policies than a democratic assembly 82 as he wrote in 1949 in individualism and economic order we must face the fact that the preservation of individual freedom is incompatible with a full satisfaction of our views of distributive justice 83 neoliberalism in short is not a mere paradigm that can be dispensed with but represents the absolutist tendencies of the system in the age of monopoly finance as foucault pointed out the survival of capitalism could only be ensured for a time by the singular application of its economic logic to all of sociological existence 84 reduced however to a pure midas principle capitalism could only end up by destroying everything in existence with which it came into contact but if capitalism has now failed the question becomes what next what next in his magisterial the age of extremes a history of the world 1914 1991 marxist historian eric hobsbawm viewing the approach of the twenty first century indicated that there were reasons to be concerned that the new century might be even more threatening to humanity than the age of extremes that had preceded it a century that had been punctuated by world wars imperial conflicts and economic depressions and in which humanity was confronted for the first time with the possibility of its own self annihilation yet looking forward he concluded the new century and millennium offered even greater dangers we live in a world hobsbawm observed in 1994 uprooted and transformed by the titanic economic and the techno scientific process of the development of capitalism which has dominated the past two or three centuries we know or at least it is reasonable to suppose that it cannot go on ad infinitum the future cannot be a continuation of the past and there are signs both externally and as it were internally that we have reached a point of historic crisis the forces generated by the techno scientific economy are now great enough to destroy the environment that is to say the material foundations of human life the structures of human societies themselves including even some of the social foundations of the capitalist economy are on the point of being destroyed by the erosion of what we have inherited from the human past our world risks both explosion and implosion it must change we do not know where we are going we only know that history has brought us to this point and if readers share the argument of this book why however one thing is plain if humanity is to have a recognizable future it cannot be by prolonging the past or the present if we try to build the third millennium on that basis we shall fail and the price of failure that is to say the alternative to a changed society is darkness 85 hobsbawm left little doubt as to what the principal danger was at present namely the theological faith in an economy in which resources were allocated entirely by the totally unrestricted market under conditions of unlimited competition carried out by evermore concentrated corporations chief among the dangers of such a system was the likelihood of irreversible and catastrophic consequences for the natural environment of this planet including the human race which is part of it 86 hobsbawm s position was roundly criticized at the time even by many on the left as overly pessimistic with regard to the course of capitalist development 87 today however a quarter century later it is clear that he hit the mark as the concerns that he voiced then are even more evident today nevertheless such realism in approaching the failure of capitalism in our time is still rare on the part of left intellectuals in the wealthy countries even in the face of decades of neoliberal assault combined with economic stagnation financialization growing inequality and environmental decline one common response is to refer to polanyi s notion of a double movement in which the recurring myth of a self regulating market society inevitably gives rise to defensive movements to protect society and the environment 88 this has fed the hope that the pendulum will swing back again leading to a more affirmative style liberalism or social democracy this sustains the belief that the failures of unregulated capitalism can be countered by a return to regulated capitalism a new keynesian age as if history had stood still pinning hopes on a double movement of this kind however denies four material realities first social democracy came about and persisted only as long as the threat of actually existing socialist societies was present and union strength endured and faded immediately with the demise of both second neoliberalism today is ingrained in capitalism itself in the phase of monopoly financial capital the earlier age of industrial capital dominance on which keynesian economics was based is now gone third social democracy was in practice reliant on an imperialist system that was opposed to the interests of the vast majority of humankind fourth the liberal democratic state and the dominance of a purportedly enlightened industrial capitalist class willing to engage in a social accord with labor is largely a relic of the past with its structural bases having all but disappeared even when social democratic parties come to power in these circumstances promising to work within the system and create a kinder and gentler capitalism they invariably fall prey to the laws of motion of capitalism in this phase as michael yates writes in the context of a failed capitalism today it is impossible to believe that there will be a recovery of even the modest political and economic project that labor unions and political parties once embraced and helped bring to fruition 89 on the so called liberal left some have adopted a broad technological modernization approach largely disregarding social relations here in an implicit technological determinism digital technology social engineering and wise liberal management are expected to reign supreme it is true such thinkers argue that the capitalist absolutism of neoliberalism points to unending disaster but capitalism can be altered presumably from above to fit any exigency even the sidelining of profits and accumulation conforming to current technological imperatives what will remain of the system in this conception will be the bare frames of corporations and markets now devoid of any class or acquisitive drive mere engines of efficiency as jørgen randers one of the original limits to growth authors declares in 2052 his forecast in 2012 of the world society forty years into the future that the modified capitalism that will emerge mid point in this century will be a system wherein collective well being is set above the return of the individual modified capitalism will be subject to the guidance of wise government directed by technocrats while being characterized by less democracy and less market freedom rather than directly facing up to the failures of capitalism though he projects forty years of economic stagnation for the major economic powers and continued poverty in the rest of the world randers sees such questions as largely irrelevant to his vision of the world in 2052 the dominant reality he predicts will be a more efficient and sustainable if more physically constrained version of the present day capitalist world 90 yet in the barely seven years since his book was written it is already clear that randers s predictions were wrong in every respect the situation confronting the world is qualitatively more serious than it was in 2012 at a time when gradualist technocratic solutions to climate change still seemed feasible to many even among those on the left and when the liberal democratic state appeared perfectly stable today in the context of accelerated climate change continuing economic stagnation political upheaval and growing geopolitical instability it is clear that the challenges that the world is facing will be both more cataclysmic and epoch making than progressive ecological modernizers like randers envisioned the choices confronting us are now much harder indeed history has been unkind to all such attempts to provide detailed forecasts of the future particularly if they simply extend current trends and leave the bulk of humanity and their struggles out of the picture it is for this reason that a dialectical view is so important the actual course of history can never be predicted the only thing certain about historical change is the existence of the struggles that drive it forward and that guarantee its discontinuous character both implosions and explosions inevitably materialize rendering the world for new generations different than that of the old history points to numerous social systems that have reached the limits of their ability to adapt their social relations to allow for the rational and sustainable use of developing productive forces hence the human past is dotted by periods of regression followed by revolutionary accelerations that sweep all before them as the conservative historian jacob burckhardt declared in the nineteenth century a historical crisis occurs when a crisis in the whole state of things is produced involving whole epochs and all or many peoples of the same civilization the historical process is suddenly accelerated in terrifying fashion developments which otherwise take centuries seem to flit by like phantoms in months or weeks and are fulfilled he called this the acceleration of historical processes 91 burckhardt principally had in mind social revolutions like the french revolution of 1789 this was an acceleration of history that as the modern french historian georges lefebvre explained commenced as a series of widening revolutions mutating with terrifying speed from an aristocratic revolution to a bourgeois revolution to a popular revolution and then a peasant revolution finally taking on the character of a historic bloc a single thing seemingly unconquerable which reshaped much of world history 92 could such a revolutionary acceleration of history though on an incomparably greater scale happen in the twenty first century most establishment commentators in the hegemonic countries of the world imperialist system would say no based on their own narrow experience and limited view of history nevertheless revolutions continue to break out in the periphery of the world system and are even now only put down by imperialist economic political and military interventions moreover the failure of capitalism on a planetary scale today threatens all of civilization and life on the planet as we know it if drastic changes are not made global temperature this century will increase by 4 or even 6 c from preindustrial times leading to conditions that will imperil humankind as a whole meanwhile the extreme capitalism of today seeks to expropriate and enclose all the bases of material existence siphoning off almost the entire net social surplus and robbing the natural environment for the direct benefit of a miniscule few as a direct result of capitalist social relations the material challenges now facing humanity are greater than anything ever seen before pointing to an accumulation of catastrophe along with the accumulation of capital 93 hundreds of millions of people under these circumstances are already being drawn into struggles with the system creating the basis of a new worldwide movement toward socialism in his book can the working class change the world yates answers yes it can but it can only do so through a unifying struggle by workers and peoples aimed at genuine socialism 94 it may be objected that socialism has been tried and has failed and hence no longer exists as an alternative however like the earliest attempts at capitalism in the italian city states of the late middle ages which were not strong enough to survive amongst the feudal societies that surrounded them the failure of the first experiments at socialism presage nothing but its eventual rebirth in a new more revolutionary more universal form which examines and learns from the failures 95 even in failure socialism has this advantage over capitalism it is motivated by the demand for freedom in general rooted in substantive equality and sustainable human development reflecting precisely those collective social relations borne of historical necessity and the unending struggle for human freedom crucial to human survival in our time 96 the great conservative economist joseph schumpeter who as austrian finance minister in red vienna had allied himself for a time with the socialist government and found himself attacked on all sides once wrote that capitalism would perish not because of the weight of economic failure but rather because its very success in pursuing its narrow economic ends had undermined the sociological foundations of its existence capitalism schumpeter exclaimed inevitably creates conditions in which it will not be able to live and which strongly point to socialism as its heir apparent 97 he was it turns out in many ways correct though not entirely in the way he expected the global development of monopoly capitalism and financialization spearheaded by the very same counterrevolutionary neoliberalism that first arose in response to red vienna in the interwar years at a time when schumpeter himself was a major actor has now undermined the material bases not so much of capitalism itself but of global society and planetary ecology the result has been the emergence of an atmosphere of almost universal hostility to the prevailing social order though playing out in the confused context of the present less as opposition to capitalism itself than to neoliberalism 98 it is capitalism s undermining of the very basis of human existence that will eventually compel the world s workers and peoples to seek new roads forward an inclusive class based movement toward socialism in this century will open up the possibility of qualitative new developments that the anarchy of the capitalist market society with its monopolistic competition extreme inequality and institutionalized greed cannot possibly offer 99 this includes the development of a socialist technology in which both the forms of technology utilized and the purposes to which they are put are channeled in social directions as opposed to individual and class gain 100 it introduces the prospect of long term democratic planning at all levels of society allowing decisions to be made and distributions to occur outside the logic of the cash nexus 101 socialism in its most radical form is about substantive equality community solidarity and ecological sustainability it is aimed at the unification not simply division of labor once sustainable human development rooted not in exchange values but in use values and genuine human needs comes to define historical advance the future which now seems closed will open up in a myriad ways allowing for entirely new more qualitative and collective forms of development 102 this can be seen in the kinds of needed practical measures that could be taken up but which are completely excluded under the present mode of production it is not physical impossibility or lack of economic surplus most of which is currently squandered that stands in the way of the democratic control of investment or the satisfaction of basic needs clean air and water food clothing housing education health care transportation and useful work for all it is not the shortage of technological know how or of material means that prevents the necessary ecological conversion to more sustainable forms of energy 103 it is not some inherent division of humanity that obstructs the construction of a new international of workers and peoples directed against capitalism imperialism and war 104 all of this is within our reach but requires pursuing a logic that runs counter to that of capitalism humanity karl marx wrote inevitably sets itself only such tasks as it is able to solve since closer examination will always show that the problem itself arises only when the material conditions for its solution are already present or at least in the course of formation 105 the very waste and excess of today s monopoly finance capitalism together with the development of new means of communication that allow for greater human coordination planning and democratic action than ever before suggest that there are countless paths forward to a world of substantive equality and ecological sustainability once the world is freed from the fetters of capital 106 the answers to the crises before us are both social and ecological they require the rational regulation of the metabolism between human beings and nature under the control of associated humanity regenerating and maintaining the flows cycles and other vital processes of healthy local regional and global ecosystems and species habitats in accord with the needs of the entire chain of human generations the mainsprings of human action throughout history lie in the drive for human freedom and the struggle to master our relation to the world the first of these ultimately demands equality and community the second human development and sustainability it is on these struggles for collective advancement that we must ultimately rely if humanity is to have a future at all notes
techniques for determining the treatment costs of cervical cancer a systematic review background uterine cervical cancer ucc represents a public health problem in many part of the world the use of new technologies is leading to increased treatment costs resulting in a substantial economic impact worldwide standardization of economic evaluation methods is needed to improve comparisons between jurisdictions objective to identify the methods used to measure the cost of treating invasive ucc and to search for correlations between cancer treatment expenditures and local economies methods we searched articles in medline lilacs and scielo with no language restrictions and included publications from january 01 2007 to december 31 2016 studies were included if they described the annual direct cost of invasive cervical cancer and detailed the costing method complete economic evaluations were excluded results were described in 2016 international dollars results of 1581 studies initially reviewed 13 articles were included in the analysis six articles used a bottom up six used a top down approach and one used both annual cost per patient varied from i 2146 22 poland to 34 351 54 sweden middle income countries mic spent median 72 52 of its gdp per capita on the treatment of invasive cervical cancer while high income countries hic spent median 30 12 p 0 032 no significant difference was found when separated by costing method conclusions we found that for the treatment costs of invasive ucc the percentages of gdp per capita were statistically higher in mic than in hic however no significant difference was found between costing methods and the top down approach could be used 1 introduction uterine cervical cancer ucc is the fourth most common malignant neoplasia in women worldwide it has a heterogeneous distribution with 84 of cases occurring in less developed regions cancer treatment costs are increasing as a result of new medications innovative surgical procedures radiotherapy and technologies related to diagnosis and treatment thereby resulting in a substantial economic impact for those who pay for healthcare in most countries the estimated 14 million new cases of cancer annually worldwide lead to significant economic costs and the total annual economic cost of cancer in 2010 was estimated at approximately us 1 16 trillion although impressively high this figure is underestimated and not equally distributed across all nations even though low and middle income countries represent 84 5 of the world population and 61 3 of new cancer cases globally these areas account for only 6 2 of financial expenditures on cancer middle income countries mics are defined as having a per capita gross national income gni of us 1026 to 12 475 2011 since resources are limited economic evaluation has emerged as an important tool in evaluating healthcare complete or full economic evaluation refers to the costs and consequences associated with some medical conditions studies that do not consider the consequences and contain only cost descriptions represent partial economic evaluations these studies are defined as cost analysis cost descriptions cost of illness or burden of illness and can be conducted using different costing methods costs refer to all expenditures related to an intervention including the treatment itself adverse effects and acute or late complications these costs may be direct or indirect direct costs are related to spending on medical physician time tests and drugs and non medical treatment food transport accommodation and home aides indirect costs refer to lost productivity resulting from absence from work or loss of life due to disease or treatment the cost of an intervention can be estimated by means of a top down td or a bottom up bu method in a td approach an adequate population is identified and their aggregated economic or resource costs of a particular health intervention are extracted from the health services billing data it is then adjusted by cost to charge ratios in a bu method estimates are obtained in a two step process first the utilization frequency of individual resources is obtained after which the frequencies are multiplied by each unit s cost and summed to yield a total cost a full assessment of the costs is described by some as micro costing where details of additional costs are provided such as the contribution of the care provided by health workers supplies or ancillary services however this nomenclature is unclear and some authors use bu as a synonym of micro costing and td as a synonym of macro costing or gross costing in addition there are controversies about the ideal costing method when different costing methods are used different cost estimates are frequently reached conducting cost description studies may be a difficult task mainly for low and middle income countries another major point of discussion is transferability of health economic data between jurisdictions the results of cost evaluations may vary from place to place because of differences in the severity of the disease the availability of health care resources clinical practice patterns and prices all over the world especially in developing countries strong economic health policies are necessary and economic evaluation studies are essential in order to identify the best action for each situation thus the aim of this review is to identify the methods used to measure the cost of treating invasive ucc and to search for correlations between cancer treatment expenditures and local economies in articles published in the last ten years 2 methods this systematic review incorporated studies where costing methods of invasive ucc treatment costs were described studies were identified by searching medline lilacs and scielo from january 01 2007 to december 31 2016 the search strategy included the descriptors uterine cervical neoplasms or cervical cancer were combined with costs and cost analysis drug costs cost of illness cost benefit analysis economics direct service costs and hospital costs a free search was also conducted in the references of studies considered relevant no language restriction was applied studies were included if they met the following criteria 1 was primary research 2 described the annual direct cost of invasive ucc and 3 described a detailed costing method an initial selection of titles and abstracts was conducted by two independent researchers discordant cases were evaluated at a consensus meeting thereafter articles were read in full to ensure that they met the inclusion criteria complete economic evaluations which comprised cost effectiveness cost benefit and cost utility analysis were excluded data were collected using a spreadsheet that contained information about the author location year of publication costing method total annual cost and annual cost per patient for comparison we searched economic and demographic data referent to each country discussed in this analysis based on their gni countries were divided into mic between us 1026 and us 12 475 and high income countries hic more than us 12 476 all costs were inflated for 2016 and then converted to 2016 international dollar i using purchasing power parities ppp from the world bank consumer prices table 1 in order to test the differences in costs between mic and hic statistical analysis was done using a non parametric kruskal wallis test in stata version 12 1 se a p value 0 05 was considered statistically significant this project was approved by the ethics committee at imip document table 1 annual inflation rate between 2006 and 2016 source the world bank 2017 number 4026 14 as secondary published data were analyzed no informed consent was needed the selection algorithm is described in figure 1 3 results the initial search retrieved 1581 references among these 1546 articles were excluded by title and another 22 were excluded because of eligibility criteria the remaining 13 articles were included in the analysis the economic characteristics of the countries referred to in this review are outlined in table 2 ten studies used the payer perspective and included only direct costs four studies used the societal perspective where direct and indirect costs were calculated for these articles indirect costs represented between 14 11 only morbidity

cm of each article was classified into td and bu these methodologies were used in seven articles each with one article using both see table 3 only four studies specified that the cost referred to the

according to costing method td top down bu bottom up tc total icc treatment costs per patient per year gdp gross domestic product per patient although the societal perspective has the stronger claim to be the basis for comparison across studies only one article incorporated the ratio of the mortality cost to the total cost besides the morbidity cost the mortality cost was calculated by summing the income that could have been earned in future if death had not occurred the indirect cost in this article represented 80 5 of the total costs because of this discrepancy and to make values comparable we have excluded indirect costs from the statistical analysis we found no significant difference in the results derived by different costing methods actually most articles did not name the costing method however they did describe how costs were calculated and could therefore be separated into studies using td and bu methods although bu is the theoretically correct way to estimate service cost this approach may not be practical in all cases the resources required for the bu costing could outweigh the benefit of more accurate costing experience shows that the td approach could be useful and reasonably accurate in cases where marketed health technologies expensive drugs and medical devices are responsible for most of the resource costs in these cases the bu approach may yield a very similar result but could be more expensive and time consuming for international comparative studies the use of the td approach is recommended in this review mic had a relatively higher expenditure as percentage of per capita gdp than hic on the treatment of invasive ucc this is in some respects different from what was demonstrated in earlier studies where latin america spent 7 7 of its gdp on health while the usa and canada spent approximately 18 and 12 respectively this difference can be explained by the lower incidence of invasive ucc in hic when compared to mic even though hic had a superior percentage of gdp expenditure on health as a whole it probably was not relevant to invasive ucc this study has limitations first only four studies specified that the treatment costs were related to the first year after diagnosis it has been demonstrated that costs may change depending on the time since diagnosis and costs are the lowest in the period between the initial and end of life phase following a u shaped curve in fact costs can be higher when only the cost of the first year of treatment is included compared to the inclusion of the costs for all phases in this review we found two articles referring to morocco in which the cost in one study based on data from the first year of treatment was more than twice the cost calculated by the other second two articles did not refer to the entire country s population and data were extrapolated finally the lack of clarity in cost concepts and differences in the inclusion and exclusion of cost items made these comparisons problematic consequently the findings should be interpreted carefully however because all costs were adjusted to one common currency and correlated to each country s gdp we were able to determine the cost of invasive ucc treatment relative to the health budget of each evaluated country economic evaluations are important tools to guide decision makers with respect to appropriate resource allocation the methodology of these studies is heterogeneous but forms of equivalency should always be sought although we recognize many caveats this is to our knowledge the only study that has tried to determine a parallel between invasive ucc treatment costs across different regions the intent is that this would contribute to the continued efforts of policy makers to standardize and develop reproducible economic studies especially in low and middle income counties 5 conclusion we found that for the treatment costs of invasive ucc the percentages of gdp per capita were statistically higher in mic than in hic however no significant difference was found between costing methods and the top down approach could be used
union minister arun jaitley on friday said the government s decision to exempt income of up to rs 5 lakh from tax will benefit the great indian middle class the significant announcement made by finance minister piyush goyal in his interim budget 2019 20 speech will strengthen the purchasing power of the middle class which holds the key for india s future jaitley wrote in a facebook post advertisement goyal who was recently given the charge of the finance ministry temporarily presented the budget for 2019 20 in the absence of jaitley who is away in new york for medical treatment piyush goyal has today made a significant announcement wherein income earners earning upto rs 5 lakhs have been exempted from payment of income tax this effectively strengthens the great indian middle class whose expansion of purchasing power holds the key for india s future jaitley said he further said the budget marks a high point in the policy directions that the government headed by prime minister narendra modi has given to the nation jaitley noted that interim budgets are presented in an election year to seek a vote on account for a limited period till the post election government can decide the further direction of the economy however he added that past precedents have conclusively shown that urgent steps are required in the larger interests of the economy and they can be taken we have the immediate precedents of the year 2009 and 2014 where significant taxation changes were brought about in the interim budgets jaitley pointed out in an apparent reference to the raging controversy over jobs jaitley wondered how the indian economy can grow at an average of 7 5 per cent in the last five years without any job creation the last five years have seen an average of about 7 5 per cent real gdp growth is it possible to conceive that such high nominal growth despite controlled inflation will not lead to any job creation he noted stating that several data points including the epfo numbers have given a detailed indication of the job creation jaitley pointed out that if there is no employment generation as alleged there should have logically been a great social unrest in the country past five years have passed off without a single major protest movement he asserted stating that the vision is to make india a usd 5 trillion economy he said by the middle of the next decade we will achieve this and thereafter target doubling that size of the economy jaitley also said there were no globally established models on the immediate impact of demonetisation on gdp growth the former prime minister s statement that it will lead to a 2 drop in the gdp captured the imagination of the government s critics neither the original data for 2016 17 and 2017 18 nor the first revision proved that he wrote former prime minister manmohan singh had earlier said demonetisation will lead to a 2 per cent drop in gdp growth jaitley also stressed that 2014 19 has been perhaps the best performing period in terms of india s macro economic stability the gdp growth during this five year period will be about 7 5 per cent the inflation will be in the range of 4 per cent it is therefore obvious that india is being hailed as a bright spot in the global economy he said here is the full text of finance minister arun jaitley s article on interim budget 2019 the interim budget 2019 and a five year direction the interim budget presented by shri piyush goyal today marks a high point in the policy directions that the government headed by prime minister shri narendra modi has given to this nation interim budgets which are presented in the election year seek a vote on account for a limited period till the post election government can decide the further direction of the economy however past precedents have conclusively shown that urgent steps are required in the larger interests of the economy and they can be taken we have the immediate precedents of the year 2009 and 2014 where significant taxation changes were brought about in the interim budgets interim budgets are also an opportunity for the government of the day to introspect their performance of the last five years and place its facts before the people the government also outlines its vision for the future of the indian economy this is precisely what shri piyush goyal s budget speech has done let me try to expand and illustrate the performance of the past five years and the further direction which the interim budget has given the political thrust the political thrust of the past five years both through budgetary outlays tax policy and legislative and administrative steps have been to create a government which is decisive compassionate and clean the economic reforms undertaken have unshackled indian economy unleashed its potential and made us a global leader in growth india is the fastest growing major economy in the world and is becoming a nation where it is easier to do business the prime minister s leadership has provided india with a decisive government which is capable of even taking difficult decisions reforms reforms have been undertaken with the idea of enhancing growth and the benefits of high growth have gone predominantly to the poor the rural and the farm sector and infrastructure creation major reliefs have been provided to the taxpaying segments of the population the anti corruption and pro transparency thrust of the government involved elimination of routine permissions and approvals ending of discretions in determination of contracts licenses and natural resources they would be allowed only through a market mechanism an enhanced payment of state support through the direct benefit transfer eliminated all leakages the major reforms undertaken by the government involved significant steps like the gst elimination of human interface in both the direct and indirect taxes the lowering of both direct and indirect taxes and the expansion of the tax base the government has undertaken a major investment through capitalization to revive the banking system which was stressed on account of past legacy issues the insolvency and bankruptcy code being enacted major credit schemes like the mudra loans low cost insurances and pensions and a major thrust towards funding the msmes have all been key banking sector reforms the demonetisation was a major assault on a high cash economy which generated black money tax evasion and even corruption demonetisation proved to be a major step towards formalization of the economy significantly enhancing india s tax collection and a movement towards the digitalisation of the economy the long pending reform was enacted in terms of the monetary policy committee of the rbi the unique identity number provided by aadhaar is a significant reform which is peculiar only to india this covers 99 of india s population social sector reforms such as financial inclusion connecting every family to banking every home to electricity every kitchen to cooking gas every home to a toilet have been witnessed in the past five years advertisement india has become the largest recipient of fdi thanks to a liberalized policy our infrastructure sector in highways ports airports and civil aviation power smart cities metro systems improved urban facilities has made a significant contribution the government personnel both government employees and as those of the armed forces and para military forces have benefited by the enhanced benefits being given to them through the implementation of the 7th central pay commission orop and by the improvements made in the new pension scheme advertisement macro economic data india s macro economic stability has unquestionably witnessed 2014 19 as perhaps the best performing period in indian history the gdp growth during this five year period will be about 7 5 the inflation will be in the range of 4 the average fiscal deficit in the past five years has fallen from upa 2 s figure of 5 3 to 3 7 we will close a five year period by a figure of 3 4 we would ordinarily have maintained a target of 3 3 but have a major announcement involving extra expenditure being made in the current budget the current account deficit from the upa 2 s five year figure of 3 3 with a high of 5 6 has fallen during this period to an average of 1 5 similarly external debt to gdp has fallen from 23 9 to 20 5 till march 2018 foreign exchange reserves are comfortable at us 396 billion and touched an all time high of us 425 billion it is therefore obvious that india is being hailed as a bright spot in the global economy the indian middle class shri piyush goyal has today made a significant announcement wherein income earners earning upto rs 5 lakhs have been exempted from payment of income tax this effectively strengthens the great indian middle class whose expansion of purchasing power holds the key for india s future the immediate implementation of the 7th central pay commission the resolution of the long pending orop improvement of the new pension scheme grant of crores of loans under the mudra scheme to aspirational entrepreneurs provision for housing subsidies for middle income group downward reduction of both direct and indirect taxes containing the double digit inflation left by the upa to what is now a little over 2 itself brings relief to the middle class however in each of the budget s of prime minister narendra modi s government there has been significant relief to india s middle class the tax exemption limit was first raised from rs 2 lakhs to rs 2 5 lakhs thereafter without altering the slabs people earning upto rs 3 lakhs were exempted from payment of taxes in a further calibrated move those in the income bracket of rs 3 to 5 lakhs witnessed their tax liability being halved from 10 to 5 and today this category has been completely exempted to this if the other tax reliefs under the income tax act are added the number of beneficiaries will further rise for payment of interest on housing loans the deduction limit was expanded from rs 1 5 to rs 2 lakhs the section 80c deduction limit was expanded from rs 1 lakh to rs 1 5 lakh the government believes that salary paid employees whether in the government or in the private sector are an honest set of tax assesses their entire tax is deducted at source last year the government restored the benefit of standard deduction to them at rs 40 000 this year this benefit is being extended to rs 50 000 for senior citizens the limit for benefits accruing on account of health care tax payment and insurance is higher thus if all these benefits given to india s neo middle class and middle class are added a person earning about rs 8 lakhs a year can get away by paying almost no tax as the tax base increases which it has the government s abilities in future years to move in this direction will further increase the gst was enforced 19 months ago it has already brought down most taxes on goods from 31 tax to the 18 12 and the 5 bracket never in the history of india during the five year tenure of a government we have witnessed tax reduction and a middle class relief of this magnitude lower taxes higher base and larger collections are the high point of the past five years this has been made possible because an anti corruption regime made non compliance more difficult inflation being contained from a double digit inflation during the upa government to be within the mandated range of 4 itself has led to the reduction of interest rates which also has provided relief to those seeking credit for building houses and other economic activities a recent global study has shown that india s middle class from 18 in 2005 expanded to 29 in 2015 and will reach 44 in 2025 we want this direction to not only continue but to be further expedited putting more money in the pockets of the middle class will ensure this infrastructure infrastructure does not recognise caste creed or religion it is a facility that the state provides to all we are today the fastest highway developer in the world our port sector both in the government and the private sector is expanding its capacity and making large profits on the civil aviation front we are amongst the fastest growing civil aviation economies of the world with already 100 functional airports our national inland waterways have been put to effective use the indian railways are not only expanding each day but improving upon quality of their services and performance our power sector has expanded its capacity to ensure that every household has an electricity connection our current emphasis on non conventional energy is producing results each of the last five year s budgets has expanded the expenditure on infrastructure the interim budget maintains the same direction the poor the government has been guided by gandhi ji s talisman recall the face of the poorest and the weakest man whom you may have seen and ask yourself if the step you contemplate is going to be of any use to him will he gain anything by it the government valued the above dictum and worked in that direction from day one india s financial inclusion program the pradhan mantri jan dhan yojana has been globally recognized the unique identification ensured that pilferages leakages and misuse of government support programmes does not take place the money spent from this was also directed at the poor the pradhan mantri suraksha bima yojana pradhan mantri jeewan bima yojana pradhan mantri mudra yojana were all an extension of this inclusion programme the urban and rural aawas yojanas have ensured that by 2022 there should not be a single roofless family in india the right to food has been ensured by making the largest ever allocation for cheap ration to a large section of india s population almost doubling the actual expenditure on mnrega has ensured that the rural unemployed can get a livelihood source to make the right of life respectable in a short span the government ensured that the overwhelming number of rural houses get sanitation the bpl families are switching over to the cooking gas every willing household has been connected with electricity the last five years have seen liberalization of the criterion and eligibility of bonus gratuity and several other benefits by india s working class in the same direction is the major scheme ensuring a pension of rs 3 000 to each unorganized sector worker the employee and the government would make an equal contribution effectively it is one more step in the direction of making india a greater pensioned society to ensure social security the political act of the government to provide a 10 reservation for the economically weaker sections of the non reserved category in educational institutions and jobs the government healthcare programme aayushman bharat has been globally recognized 40 of india s population encompassing the weakest is now entitled to hospital treatment free upto rs 5 lakhs a year at state cost the government s concern for naming 115 under developed districts as the aspirational districts has been guided by the antyodaya philosophy conventionally the poor of this country were bluffed by attractive slogans which had short term impact and no lasting value as observed by nobel laureate gary becker that poverty perpetuates not because poor are no less capable than the rich but because the poor can be habituated for making myopic choices because of the daily constraints that force them to always focus on survival india s poor only got the benefit of slogans in the past today they have seen resources being actually transferred to them they are today all candidates who are aspiring to enter the neo middle class agriculture last year in the budget the government had announced that the recommendations of the swaminathan commission would be implemented and every farmer would be entitled to get 50 more than his input cost prof swaminathan himself has appreciated the government decision the others had only promised it the government delivered it however in view of the inadequacy of the procurement system in certain states many farmers did not get the full benefit and had to sell their produce at softer prices the government has made massive efforts to improve the quality of rural life it has enhanced agricultural credit ensured a crop insurance scheme enhanced investments in irrigation and still the requirements of the economy are that the indian farmer who gives us the surplus produce deserves a lot more the farmer s welfare cannot wait in another step in this direction the budget has announced today a significant income support scheme for every small and marginal land owning family involved in agriculture they will each be entitled to a sum of rs 6 000 anually this will be a major step to put more money in the pockets of our food producers this necessarily expand the government expenditure in the fy 2018 19 as also in the future years this has had marginal impact on our projections of the fiscal deficit but we are confident of being on the glide path as per the recommendations of the frbm committee improving the lot of the indian farmer and adding to his purchasing power in the long run will help the economy much more than the expenditure being undertaken the future vision the future vision is to make india a five trillion dollar economy by the middle of the next decade we will achieve this and thereafter target doubling that size of the economy with the present growth rates we are on track to achieve this this involves a commitment to make sure that we work for every indian and not just for the unduly privileged dynasties we envisage an india where poverty is eliminated the eastern regions of india grow at par with other parts of the country rural india having urban like facilities and that female employment in india in the formal sector expeditiously increases challenges of the future are going to be met by special emphasis on food processing green energy health care world class educational institutions multiplying tourism potential global quality infrastructure making india a hub of electronic manufacturing textile and apparel with a special focus on organic farming and non conventional energy more modern cities and urban renewal will be the focus we are growing at a rate faster than other comparable economies we are proud of our performance yet we are impatient we wish to grow faster than even our present status of the world s fastest growing economy so that we can cover up for the missed historical opportunities finally a response two comments have recently been made by various individuals the first relating to job creation in the economy and the second on the impact of demonetization on the gdp the last five years have seen an average of about 7 5 real gdp growth if the inflation figure is added to this the nominal growth on an average will be between 11 5 to 12 is it possible to conceive that such high nominal growth despite controlled inflation will not lead to any job creation several datas including the epfo data have given a detailed indication of the job creation if there is no job creation as alleged there should have logically been a great social unrest in the country past five years have passed off without a single major protest movement there were no globally established models on the immediate impact of demonetization on the gdp growth the former prime minister s statement that it will lead to a 2 drop in the gdp captured the imagination of the government s critics neither the original data for 2016 17 and 2017 18 nor the first revision proved that when india had a large parallel economy we were all told that our growth figures do not correctly capture the gdp growth because a lot of activity takes place outside the formal economy when demonetization led to depositing the entire cash into the banking system and led many future transactions to be more recordable logically the gdp had to grow post demonetisation the impact of demonetization could only be transient as the government always maintained the present data conclusively establishes this this is further fortified by the high tax collections both in the direct and indirect taxes during 2016 17 and 2017 18 tax payments do not rise when the economy is not adequately expanding growth figures are based on estimates tax collections are real
american economic sanctions have been the worst crime against humanity since world war two america s economic sanctions have killed more innocent people than all of the nuclear biological and chemical weapons ever used in the history of mankind the fact that for america the issue in venezuela is oil not democracy will surprise only those who watch the news and ignore history venezuela has the world s largest oil reserves on the planet america seeks control of venezuela because it sits atop the strategic intersection of the caribbean south and central american worlds control of the nation has always been a remarkably effective way to project power into these three regions and beyond from the first moment hugo chavez took office the united states has been trying to overthrow venezuela s socialist movement by using sanctions coup attempts and funding the opposition parties after all there is nothing more undemocratic than a coup d état united nations human rights council special rapporteur alfred de zayas recommended just a few days ago that the international criminal court investigate economic sanctions against venezuela as a possible crime against humanity perpetrated by america over the past five years american sanctions have cut venezuela off from most financial markets which have caused local oil production to plummet consequently venezuela has experienced the largest decline in living standards of any country in recorded latin american history prior to american sanctions socialism in venezuela had reduced inequality and poverty whilst pensions expanded during the same time period in america it has been the absolute reverse president chavez funnelled venezuela s oil revenues into social spending such as free 6 healthcare education subsidized food networks and housing construction in order to fully understand why america is waging economic war on the people of venezuela one must analyse the historical relationship between the petrodollar system and sanctions of mass destruction prior to the 20th century the value of money was tied to gold when banks lent money they were constrained by the size of their gold reserves but in 1971 u s president richard nixon took the country off the gold standard nixon and saudi arabia came to an oil for dollars agreement that would change the course of history and become the root cause of countless wars for oil under this petrodollar agreement the only currency that saudi arabia could sell its oil in was the us dollar the saudi kingdom would in turn ensure that its oil profits flow back into u s government treasuries and american banks in exchange america pledged to provide the saudi royal family s regime with military protection and military hardware it was the start of something truly great for america access to oil defined 20th century empires and the petrodollar agreement was the key to the ascendancy of the united states as the world s sole superpower america s war machine runs on is funded by and exists in protection of oil threats by any nation to undermine the petrodollar system are viewed by washington as tantamount to a declaration of war against the united states of america within the last two decades iraq iran libya and venezuela have all threatened to sell their oil in other currencies consequently they have all been subject to crippling u s sanctions over time the petrodollar system spread beyond oil and the u s dollar slowly but surely became the reserve currency for global trades in most commodities and goods this system allows america to maintain its position of dominance as the world s only superpower despite being a staggering 23 trillion in debt with billions of dollars worth of minerals in the ground and with the world s largest oil reserves venezuela should not only be wealthy but her people the envy of the developing world but the nation is essentially broke because american sanctions have cut them off from the international financial system and cost the economy 6 billion over the last five years without sanctions venezuela could recover easily by collateralizing some of its abundant resources or its 8 billion of gold reserves in order to get the loans necessary to kick start their economy in order to fully understand the insidious nature of the venezuelan crisis it is necessary to understand the genesis of economic sanctions at the height of world war two president truman issued an order for american bombers to drop fat man and little boy on the cities of hiroshima and nagasaki killing 140 000 people instantly the gruesome images that emerged from the rubble were broadcast through television sets across the world and caused unprecedented outrage the political backlash forced u s policy makers to devise a more subtle weapon of mass destruction economic sanctions the term weapons of mass destruction wmd was first defined by the united nations in 1948 as atomic explosive weapons radioactive material weapons lethal chemical and biological weapons and any weapons developed in the future which have characteristics comparable in destructive effect to those of the atomic bomb or other weapons mentioned above sanctions are clearly the 21st century s deadliest weapon of mass destruction in 2001 the u s administration told us that iraq had weapons of mass destruction iraq was a terrorist state iraq was tied to al qaeda it all amounted to nothing in fact america already knew that the only weapons of mass destruction that saddam had were not nuclear in nature but rather chemical and biological the only reason they knew this in advance was because america sold the weapons to saddam to use on iran in 1991 what the u s administration did not tell us was that saddam hussein used to be a strong ally of the united states the main reason for toppling saddam and putting sanctions on the people of iraq was the fact that iraq had ditched the dollar for oil sales the united nations estimates that 1 7 million iraqis died due to bill clinton s sanctions 500 000 of whom were children in 1996 a journalist asked former u s secretary of state madeleine albright about these un reports specifically about the children america s top foreign policy official albright replied i think this is a very hard choice but the price we think the price is worth it clearly u s sanctions policies are nothing short of state sanctioned genocide over the last five years sanctions have caused venezuelan per capita incomes to drop by 40 percent which is a decline similar to that of war torn iraq and syria at the height of their armed conflicts millions of venezuelans have had to flee the country if america is so concerned about refugees trump should stop furthering disastrous foreign policies that actually create them under chavez venezuela had a policy of welcoming refugees president chavez turned venezuela into the wealthiest society in latin america with the best income equality another much vilified leader who used oil wealth to enrich his people only to be put under severe sanctions is muammar gaddafi in 1967 colonel gaddafi inherited one of the poorest nations in africa however by the time he was assassinated gaddafi had turned libya into africa s wealthiest nation perhaps gaddafi s greatest crime in the eyes of nato was his quest to quit selling libyan oil in u s dollars and denominate crude sales in a new gold backed common african currency in fact in august 2011 president obama confiscated 30 billion from libya s central bank which gaddafi had earmarked for the establishment of an african central bank and the african gold backed dinar currency africa has the fastest growing oil industry in the world and oil sales in a common african currency would have been especially devastating for the american dollar the u s economy and particularly the elite in charge of the petrodollar system it is for this reason that president clinton signed the now infamous iran libya sanctions act which the united nations children s fund said caused widespread suffering among civilians by severely limiting supplies of fuel access to cash and the means of replenishing stocks of food and essential medications clearly u s sanctions are weapons of mass destruction not so long ago iraq and libya were the two most modern and secular states in the middle east and north africa with the highest regional standards of living nowadays u s military intervention and economic sanctions have turned libya and iraq into two of the world s most failed nations they want to seize libya s oil and they care nothing about the lives of the libyan people remarked chavez during the western intervention in libya in 2011 in september 2017 president maduro made good on chavez s promise to list oil sales in yuan rather than the us dollar weeks later trump signed a round of crippling sanctions on the people of venezuela on monday u s national security adviser john bolton announced new sanctions that essentially steal 7 billion from venezuela s state owned oil company at that press conference bolton brazenly flashed a note pad that ominously said 5 000 troops to colombia when confronted about it by the media bolton simply said president trump stated that all options are on the table america s media is unquestionably the most corrupt institution in america the nation s media may quibble about trump s domestic policies but when it comes to starting wars for oil abroad they sing in remarkable unison fox news cnn and the new york times all cheered the nation into war in iraq over fictitious weapons of mass destruction whilst america was actually using sanctions of mass destruction on the iraqi people they did it in libya and now they are doing it again in venezuela democracy and freedom have always been the smoke screen in front of capitalist expansion for oil and the western media owns the smoke machine economic warfare has long since been under way against venezuela but military warfare is now imminent trump just hired elliot abrams as u s special envoy for venezuela who has a long and torrid history in latin america abrams pleaded guilty to lying to congress about the iran contra affair which involved america funding deadly communist rebels and was the worst scandal in the reagan era abrams was later pardoned by george bush senior america s new point man on venezuela also lied about the largest mass killing in recent latin american history by u s trained forces in el salvador there is nothing more undemocratic than a coup d état a un human rights council rapporteur alfred de zayas pointed out that america s aim in venezuela is to crush this government and bring in a neoliberal government that is going to privatise everything and is going to sell out a lot of transitional corporations stand to gain enormous profits and the united states is driven by the transnational corporations ever since 1980 the united states has steadily devolved from the status of the world s top creditor country to the world s most indebted country but thanks to the petrodollar system s huge global artificial demand for u s dollars america can continue exponential military expansion record breaking deficits and unrestrained spending america s largest export used to be manufactured goods made proudly in america today america s largest export is the u s dollar any nation like venezuela that threatens that export is met with america s second largest export weapons chief amongst which are sanctions of mass destruction note to readers please click the share

by michael hudson the end of america s unchallenged global economic dominance has arrived sooner than expected thanks to the very same neocons who gave the world the iraq syria and the dirty wars in latin america just as the vietnam war drove the united states off gold by 1971 its violent regime change warfare against venezuela and syria and threatening other countries with sanctions if they do not join this crusade is driving european and other nations to create their alternative financial institutions this break has been building for quite some time and was bound to occur but who would have thought that donald trump would become the catalytic agent no left wing party no socialist anarchist or foreign nationalist leader anywhere in the world could have achieved what he is doing to break up the american empire the deep state is reacting with shock at how this right wing real estate grifter has been able to drive other countries to defend themselves by dismantling the u s centered world order to rub it in he is using bush and reagan era neocon arsonists john bolton and now elliott abrams to fan the flames in venezuela it is almost like a black political comedy the world of international diplomacy is being turned inside out a world where there is no longer even a pretense that we might adhere to international norms let alone laws or treaties the neocons who trump has appointed are accomplishing what seemed unthinkable not long ago driving china and russia together the great nightmare of henry kissinger and zbigniew brzezinski they also are driving germany and other european countries into the eurasian orbit the heartland nightmare of halford mackinder a century ago the root cause is clear after the crescendo of pretenses and deceptions over iraq libya and syria along with our absolution of the lawless regime of saudi arabia foreign political leaders are coming to recognize what world wide public opinion polls reported even before the iraq iran contra boys turned their attention to the world s largest oil reserves in venezuela the united states is now the greatest threat to peace on the planet calling the u s coup being sponsored in venezuela a defense of democracy reveals the doublethink underlying u s foreign policy it defines democracy to mean supporting u s foreign policy pursuing neoliberal privatization of public infrastructure dismantling government regulation and following the direction of u s dominated global institutions from the imf and world bank to nato for decades the resulting foreign wars domestic austerity programs and military interventions have brought more violence not democracy in the devil s dictionary that u s diplomats are taught to use as their elements of style guidelines for doublethink a democratic country is one that follows u s leadership and opens its economy to u s investment and imf and world bank sponsored privatization the ukraine is deemed democratic along with saudi arabia israel and other countries that act as u s financial and military protectorates and are willing to treat america s enemies are theirs too a point had to come where this policy collided with the self interest of other nations finally breaking through the public relations rhetoric of empire other countries are proceeding to de dollarize and replace what u s diplomacy calls internationalism meaning u s nationalism imposed on the rest of the world with their own national self interest this trajectory could be seen 50 years ago i described it in super imperialism and global fracture it had to happen but nobody thought that the end would come in quite the way that is happening history has turned into comedy or at least irony as its dialectical path unfolds for the past half century u s strategists the state department and national endowment for democracy ned worried that opposition to u s financial imperialism would come from left wing parties it therefore spent enormous resources manipulating parties that called themselves socialist tony blair s british labour party france s socialist party germany s social democrats etc to adopt neoliberal policies that were the diametric opposite to what social democracy meant a century ago but u s political planners and great wurlitzer organists neglected the right wing imagining that it would instinctively support u s thuggishness the reality is that right wing parties want to get elected and a populist nationalism is today s road to election victory in europe and other countries just as it was for donald trump in 2016 trump s agenda may really be to break up the american empire using the old uncle sucker isolationist rhetoric of half a century ago he certainly is going for the empire s most vital organs but it he a witting anti american agent he might as well be but it would be a false mental leap to use quo bono to assume that he is a witting agent after all if no u s contractor supplier labor union or bank will deal with him would vladimir putin china or iran be any more naïve perhaps the problem had to erupt as a result of the inner dynamics of u s sponsored globalism becoming impossible to impose when the result is financial austerity waves of population flight from u s sponsored wars and most of all u s refusal to adhere to the rules and international laws that it itself sponsored seventy years ago in the wake of world war ii dismantling international law and its courts any international system of control requires the rule of law it may be a morally lawless exercise of ruthless power imposing predatory exploitation but it is still the law and it needs courts to apply it backed by police power to enforce it and punish violators here s the first legal contradiction in u s global diplomacy the united states always has resisted letting any other country have any voice in u s domestic policies law making or diplomacy that is what makes america the exceptional nation but for seventy years its diplomats have pretended that its superior judgment promoted a peaceful world as the roman empire claimed to be which let other countries share in prosperity and rising living standards at the united nations u s diplomats insisted on veto power at the world bank and imf they also made sure that their equity share was large enough to give them veto power over any loan or other policy without such power the united states would not join any international organization yet at the same time it depicted its nationalism as protecting globalization and internationalism it was all a euphemism for what really was unilateral u s decision making inevitably u s nationalism had to break up the mirage of one world internationalism and with it any thought of an international court without veto power over the judges the u s never accepted the authority of any court in particular the united nations international court in the hague recently that court undertook an investigation into u s war crimes in afghanistan from its torture policies to bombing of civilian targets such as hospitals weddings and infrastructure that investigation ultimately found a reasonable basis to believe that war crimes and crimes against humanity 1 donald trump s national security adviser john bolton erupted in fury warning in september that the united states will use any means necessary to protect our citizens and those of our allies from unjust prosecution by this illegitimate court adding that the un international court must not be so bold as to investigate israel or other u s allies that prompted a senior judge christoph flügge from germany to resign in protest indeed bolton told the court to keep out of any affairs involving the united states promising to ban the court s judges and prosecutors from entering the united states as bolton spelled out the u s threat we will sanction their funds in the u s financial system and we will prosecute them in the u s criminal system we will not cooperate with the icc we will provide no assistance to the icc we will not join the icc we will let the icc die on its own after all for all intents and purposes the icc is already dead to us what this meant the german judge spelled out was that if these judges ever interfere in the domestic concerns of the u s or investigate an american citizen said the american government would do all it could to ensure that these judges would no longer be allowed to travel to the united states and that they would perhaps even be criminally prosecuted the original inspiration of the court to use the nuremburg laws that were applied against german nazis to bring similar prosecution against any country or officials found guilty of committing war crimes had already fallen into disuse with the failure to indict the authors of the chilean coup iran contra or the u s invasion of iraq for war crimes dismantling dollar hegemony from the imf to swift of all areas of global power politics today international finance and foreign investment have become the key flashpoint international monetary reserves were supposed to be the most sacrosanct and international debt enforcement closely associated central banks have long held their gold and other monetary reserves in the united states and london back in 1945 this seemed reasonable because the new york federal reserve bank in whose basement foreign central bank gold was kept was militarily safe and because the london gold pool was the vehicle by which the u s treasury kept the dollar as good as gold at 35 an ounce foreign reserves over and above gold were kept in the form of u s treasury securities to be bought and sold on the new york and london foreign exchange markets to stabilize exchange rates most foreign loans to governments were denominated in u s dollars so wall street banks were normally name as paying agents that was the case with iran under the shah whom the united states had installed after sponsoring the 1953 coup against mohammed mosaddegh when he sought to nationalize anglo iranian oil now british petroleum or at least tax it after the shah was overthrown the khomeini regime asked its paying agent the chase manhattan bank to use its deposits to pay its bondholders at the direction of the u s government chase refused to do so u s courts then declared iran to be in default and froze all its assets in the united states and anywhere else they were able this showed that international finance was an arm of the u s state department and pentagon but that was a generation ago and only recently did foreign countries begin to feel queasy about leaving their gold holdings in the united states where they might be grabbed at will to punish any country that might act in ways that u s diplomacy found offensive so last year germany finally got up the courage to ask that some of its gold be flown back to germany u s officials pretended to feel shocked at the insult that it might do to a civilized christian country what it had done to iran and germany agreed to slow down the transfer but then came venezuela desperate to spend its gold reserves to provide imports for its economy devastated by u s sanctions a crisis that u s diplomats blame on socialism not on u s political attempts to make the economy scream as nixon officials said of chile under salvador allende venezuela directed the bank of england to transfer some of its 11 billion in gold held in its vaults and those of other central banks in december 2018 this was just like a bank depositor would expect a bank to pay a check that the depositor had written england refused to honor the official request following the direction of bolton and u s secretary of state michael pompeo as bloomberg reported the u s officials are trying to steer venezuela s overseas assets to guaido to help bolster his chances of effectively taking control of the government the 1 2 billion of gold is a big chunk of the 8 billion in foreign reserves held by the venezuelan central bank 2 turkey seemed to be a likely destination prompting bolton and pompeo to warn it to desist from helping venezuela threatening sanctions against it or any other country helping venezuela cope with its economic crisis as for the bank of england and other european countries the bloomberg report concluded central bank officials in caracas have been ordered to no longer try contacting the bank of england these central bankers have been told that bank of england staffers will not respond to them this led to rumors that venezuela was selling 20 tons of gold via a russian boeing 777 some 840 million the money probably would have ended up paying russian and chinese bondholders as well as buying food to relieve the local famine 3 russia denied this report but reuters has confirmed is that venezuela has sold 3 tons of a planned 29 tones of gold to the united arab emirates with another 15 tones are to be shipped on friday february 1 4 the u s senate s batista cuban hardliner rubio accused this of being theft as if feeding the people to alleviate the u s sponsored crisis was a crime against u s diplomatic leverage if there is any country that u s diplomats hate more than a recalcitrant latin american country it is iran president trump s breaking of the 2015 nuclear agreements negotiated by european and obama administration diplomats has escalated to the point of threatening germany and other european countries with punitive sanctions if they do not also break the agreements they have signed coming on top of u s opposition to german and other european importing of russian gas the u s threat finally prompted europe to find a way to defend itself imperial threats are no longer military no country including russia or china can mount a military invasion of another major country since the vietnam era the only kind of war a democratically elected country can wage is atomic or at least heavy bombing such as the united states has inflicted on iraq libya and syria but now cyber warfare has become a way of pulling out the connections of any economy and the major cyber connections are financial money transfer ones headed by swift the acronym for the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication which is centered in belgium russia and china have already moved to create a shadow bank transfer system in case the united states unplugs them from swift but now european countries have come to realize that threats by bolton and pompeo may lead to heavy fines and asset grabs if they seek to continue trading with iran as called for in the treaties they have negotiated on january 31 the dam broke with the announcement that europe had created its own bypass payments system for use with iran and other countries targeted by u s diplomats germany france and even the u s poodle britain joined to create instex instrument in support of trade exchanges the promise is that this will be used only for humanitarian aid to save iran from a u s sponsored venezuela type devastation but in view of increasingly passionate u s opposition to the nord stream pipeline to carry russian gas this alternative bank clearing system will be ready and able to become operative if the united states tries to direct a sanctions attack on europe i have just returned from germany and seen a remarkable split between that nation s industrialists and their political leadership for years major companies have seen russia as a natural market a complementary economy needing to modernize its manufacturing and able to supply europe with natural gas and other raw materials america s new cold war stance is trying to block this commercial complementarity warning europe against dependence on low price russian gas it has offered to sell high priced lng from the united states via port facilities that do not yet exist in anywhere near the volume required president trump also is insisting that nato members spend a full 2 percent of their gdp on arms preferably bought from the united states not from german or french merchants of death u s overplaying its position is leading to the mackinder kissinger brzezinski eurasian nightmare that i mentioned above in addition to driving russia and china together u s diplomacy is adding europe to the heartland independent of u s ability to bully into the state of dependency toward which american diplomacy has aimed to achieve since 1945 the world bank for instance traditionally has been headed by a u s secretary of defense its steady policy since its inception is to provide loans for countries to devote their land to export crops instead of giving priority to feeding themselves that is why its loans are only in foreign currency not in the domestic currency needed to provide price supports and agricultural extension services such as have made u s agriculture so productive by following u s advice countries have left themselves open to food blackmail sanctions against providing them with grain and other food in case they step out of line with u s diplomatic demands it is worthwhile to note that our global imposition of the mythical efficiencies of forcing latin american countries to become plantations for export crops like coffee and bananas rather than growing their own wheat and corn has failed catastrophically to deliver better lives especially for those living in central america the spread between the export crops and cheaper food imports from the u s that was supposed to materialize for countries following our playbook failed miserably witness the caravans and refugees across mexico of course our backing of the most brutal military dictators and crime lords has not helped either likewise the imf has been forced to admit that its basic guidelines were fictitious from the beginning a central core has been to enforce payment of official inter government debt by withholding imf credit from countries under default this rule was instituted at a time when most official inter government debt was owed to the united states but a few years ago ukraine defaulted on 3 billion owed to russia the imf said in effect that ukraine and other countries did not have to pay russia or any other country deemed to be acting too independently of the united states the imf has been extending credit to the bottomless it of ukrainian corruption to encourage its anti russian policy rather than standing up for the principle that inter government debts must be paid it is as if the imf now operates out of a small room in the basement of the pentagon in washington europe has taken notice that its own international monetary trade and financial linkages are in danger of attracting u s anger this became clear last autumn at the funeral for george h w bush when the eu s diplomat found himself downgraded to the end of the list to be called to his seat he was told that the u s no longer considers the eu an entity in good standing in december mike pompeo gave a speech on europe in brussels his first and eagerly awaited in which he extolled the virtues of nationalism criticised multilateralism and the eu and said that international bodies which constrain national sovereignty must be reformed or eliminated 5 most of the above events have made the news in just one day january 31 2019 the conjunction of u s moves on so many fronts against venezuela iran and europe not to mention china and the trade threats and moves against huawei also erupting today looks like this will be a year of global fracture it is not all president trump s doing of course we see the democratic party showing the same colors instead of applauding democracy when foreign countries do not elect a leader approved by u s diplomats whether it is allende or maduro they ve let the mask fall and shown themselves to be the leading new cold war imperialists it s now out in the open they would make venezuela the new pinochet era chile trump is not alone in supporting saudi arabia and its wahabi terrorists acting as lyndon johnson put it bastards but they re our bastards where is the left in all this that is the question with which i opened this article how remarkable it is that it is only right wing parties alternative for deutschland afd or marine le pen s french nationalists and those of other countries that are opposing nato militarization and seeking to revive trade and economic links with the rest of eurasia the end of our monetary imperialism about which i first wrote in 1972 in super imperialism stuns even an informed observer like me it took a colossal level of arrogance short sightedness and lawlessness to hasten its decline something that only crazed neocons like john bolton elliott abrams and mike pompeo could deliver for donald trump notes alexander rubenstein it can t be fixed senior icc judge quits in protest of us turkish meddling january 31 2019 patricia laya

u s highlights financial markets extended their gains this week the re opening of the u s government the dovish fomc statement progress in the u s china trade talks and a strong january payroll report all helped to boost sentiment global growth concerns persisted this week but the u s economy continued to move along nicely the labor market added 304k new jobs in january and the ism manufacturing index improved after a sharp decline in december even as domestic economic performance remains solid global growth slowdown did not go unnoticed by the fomc the committee left the fed funds rate unchanged and went to great lengths to emphasize patience canadian highlights canada s economy contracted 0 1 in november as the energy sector weighed on growth real gdp is tracking a modest 1 annualized for the fourth quarter as a whole a patient federal reserve will mean an even more patient bank of canada canada s outlook is even cloudier than that stateside providing numerous reasons for caution from the central bank in a speech this week deputy governor wilkins noted that the oil shock is coming through not only on the unemployment rate but also the pace of wage growth until there is some clarity on the path of global growth expect the bank of canada to remain on the sidelines u s the fed s rate hikes a pause or a stop concerns about slowing global growth continued to linger this week even so financial markets had a lot to be cheerful about the u s government re opened the fomc was dovish the u s china talks made progress and january payroll report showed blockbuster job growth after a brutal december this week s trading capped the best monthly performance for the s p 500 since october 2015 top of the list the longest shutdown in u s history has ended for now a short term spending bill keeps the government funded until february 15th still the damage has been done various estimates suggest that the shutdown has shaved between 0 2 0 4 percentage points off first quarter gdp growth which is tracking 1 6 annualized while most of the lost economic activity will be recouped in the following quarter some of the loss will be permanent the impact of the government shutdown was also apparent in today s payroll report the unemployment rate move up a tick to 4 0 lifted by government workers who were furloughed and the broader measure of unemployment which includes people working part time for economic reasons the u6 has jumped up from 7 6 to 8 1 aside from those temporary distortions it was a stellar report the labor market added an impressive 304k new jobs in january marking a record setting 100th straight month of payroll gains wages continued to advance at above 3 pace and the core age participation rate kept moving higher rising 0 5 percentage points over the past year meanwhile across most other major economies performance is shifting into lower gear china s economy is weakening last year s auto sales declined for the first time in decades and manufacturing activity is contracting that impact is being felt acutely by china s major trading partners and american companies with significant exposure to the region the export oriented euro area economy also ended 2018 on a weaker footing growing at the slowest pace in four years clearly the toll on global growth from the u s china trade dispute is rising and the time to reach a deal before possible further escalation after the march 1st deadline is running out president trump was upbeat about the progress during this week s negotiations but important issues remain unresolved and any deal is unlikely until the two presidents meet in person later this month global growth slowdown considerations did not go unnoticed by the fomc as widely expected the committee left the target range for the fed funds rate unchanged at 2 25 2 5 but the statement itself was very dovish in particular the committee acknowledged that while domestic economic activity has been rising at a solid rate risks to the outlook have increased which would necessitate patience and flexibility on the fed s behalf any mention of gradual rate increases has been removed suggesting the fed is prepared to be patient for some time until the fog clears and its gets a better reading on global and domestic economic conditions canada oil sector puts a chill on canada s growth the impact of lower oil prices and widening spreads on western canadian select was on full display in the november real gdp report released this week canada s economy shrunk by 0 1 in the month the economy likely grew for the fourth quarter as a whole but with the poor outturn in november the pace is likely a modest 1 annualized the pain unfortunately is not over the oil shock is evident in small business confidence into january which according to the cfib pulled back dramatically in alberta and remained at a low level nationally edging up only slightly after a steep decline in december mandatory production cuts will continue to weigh on economic growth through the first quarter of this year likely leading to a repeat performance in terms of sluggish real gdp growth in the neighbourhood of 1 the good news is that due to the improvement in pricing alberta has announced a production boost in february slightly earlier than expected with a bit of luck the drag will be contained to the first quarter and a healthy bounceback will take place in the second still ongoing economic weakness alongside rising global uncertainty is reason enough for a pause on interest rate increases from the bank of canada recall that the last oil shock resulted in two rate cuts from the bank of canada in 2015 the current situation is different from the past for one the energy price shock is smaller roughly 25 versus 70 according to bank of canada estimates what is more the unemployment rate is a percentage point lower and core inflation is closer to the bank of canada s 2 target nonetheless below trend growth gives little reason to expect further improvement in the country s labour market and will mute upward pressure on inflation at the same time the outlook for rate hikes from the bank of canada will be influenced by events outside of the country s borders with the federal reserve changing tack on future interest rate increases there is less scope or rationale for the bank of canada to push higher if the federal reserve has reason for patience the bank of canada has a multitude to name a few canada is even more tied into the softening global outlook especially through the commodity channel than the u s the interest rate sensitivity of households is a more pressing issue north of the border where debt levels are higher and housing valuations more stretched and finally competitiveness and investment challenges are a much more pressing issue necessitating a lower exchange rate to maintain full employment as senior deputy governor wilkins noted the oil shock is coming through not only on the unemployment rate but also the pace of wage growth which is particularly muted in oil producing regions other structural factors weighing on wage growth such as increased market power of firms and lower labour market turnover also bear watching the improvement in canada s benchmark oil prices of late is encouraging but until global event risks subside and there is some clarity on the path of global growth expect the bank of canada to remain on the sidelines u s upcoming key economic releases u s gdp q4 advanced release date tbd previous 3 4 td forecast 2 8 consensus 2 6 we expect the advanced release of q4 gdp to show economic growth slowed back to a still strong 2 8 q q pace down from q3 s solid burst to 3 4 the more measured expansion rate should reflect the economy s expected normalization as the fiscal stimulus wanes and as a result of the gradual impact of a tighter monetary stance we anticipate consumers to remain a firm driver of economic activity during the quarter as suggested by a strong holiday shopping season and on the back of high levels of consumer confidence and solid employment numbers that said we expect the stimulus driven

2016 together these two industries shed over 40k workers which suggests some mean reversion into 2019 meanwhile goods producing employment will face a headwind from layoffs across the energy sector a likely result of government mandated caps on oil production and a giveback in manufacturing employment after 24k jobs were added last month a post crisis record elsewhere we also look for a recovery in private sector job growth following last month s rotation into self employment job growth of 15k should leave the unemployment rate unchanged at the current cycle low of 5 6 while wage growth

challenging united states hegemony is never an easy course a county need not be socialist it is enough to either voice aspirations toward socialism or merely demonstrate a pattern of not doing as washington dictates so here we go again this time with venezuela ironically for a country that the corporate media insistently claims has been ruled by two dictators remember that hugo chávez was routinely denounced in the same ways that nicolás maduro is today it would be difficult to find a country with more opportunities for grassroots democracy and for everyday people to participate in the decisions that affect their lives and neighborhoods there has been backtracking on some of this and there are legitimate complaints about the top down manner in which the ruling united socialist party of venezuela psuv is run the u s government is in no position to point fingers however given its history in latin america and the widespread voter suppression that is a regular feature of u s elections it is also preposterous to assert that socialism has failed in venezuela when 70 percent of the country s economy is in private hands the country is completely integrated into the world capitalist system and it is overly dependent on a commodity with a price that wildly fluctuates on capitalist markets venezuela is a capitalist country that does far more than most to ameliorate the conditions of capitalism and in which socialism remains an aspiration if something has failed it is capitalism leaving much of the economy in the hands of capitalists leaves them with the ability to sabotage an economy a lesson learned in painful fashion during the 1980s in sandinista nicaragua before delving into the significant problems of venezuela largely due to the economic war being waged against it by the u s government and the economic sabotage within by venezuela s industrialists and other business interests it is worthwhile to briefly examine some of the democratic institutions that have been created since the bolivarian revolution took root in 1998 communal councils organize at neighborhood level the base of the venezuelan political system are the communal councils various political structures designed to organize people at the grassroots level have evolved into a system of communal councils organized on a neighborhood level which in turn build up to communes and communal cities these are direct democracy bodies that identify and solve the problems and deficiencies of their local areas with the direct support and funding of the national government after decades of neglect by previous governments there were no shortage of problems to tackle like many institutions of the bolivarian revolution these have roots in grassroots organizing that pre date hugo chávez s first election the barrio assembly of caracas emerged in 1991 as something of a general assembly representing local groups coming into being after demonstrations marking the first and second anniversaries of the caracazo uprising were dispersed by soldiers firing on them from rooftops the caracazo uprising was a massive revolt sparked by popular resistance to an austerity package dictated by the international monetary fund later versions of these assemblies organized on the eve of the 2002 coup attempting to overthrow president chávez among these assemblies accomplishments were distributing 100 000 fliers calling for a march on the presidential palace to defend the government the communal councils are the base of an alternative government structure one intended to bypass municipal and other local governments and to eventually replace them this was an attempt to provide a concrete form to the concept of constituent power the idea that people should be direct participants in the decisions to affect their lives and communities legislation passed in 2006 formally recognized the communal councils and the form quickly gained popularity there were an estimated 30 000 in existence by 2009 these councils are formed in compact urban areas containing 200 to 400 households in cities and 20 or so in rural areas all residents of the territory are eligible to participate in turn communal councils organize into larger communes and communes into communal cities to coordinate projects too large for a neighborhood or to organize projects necessarily on a larger scale such as improving municipal services communal councils are required to propose three projects that will contribute to development in the community funding for approved projects will usually come from national government bodies an interesting development is that many in the case of councils studied by researchers a majority who have taken active roles in the communal councils were not politically active before the 2002 failed coup generally women outnumber men among the active participants and it is often older women taking the lead the culture of participation that the councils encourage and that the bolivarian government is paying vastly more attention to solving social problems and the needs of the poor than prior governments has facilitated the organizing of women and the new activity of women in turn is breaking down traditional macho attitudes that pensions are now much stronger proving material security also enables participation health committees tackling problems of illness access to contraception and motherhood are often where participation begins once involved women sign up for training programs with more women then men taking advantage of these communes often organize enterprises to provide employment for local residents and to help supply needed basic goods one example is the el panal 2012 commune in caracas el panal operates several enterprises and a communal bank one of the enterprises is a sugar packaging plant and there are also bakeries el panal activists are also creating links with neighboring communes in caracas and in other parts of the country links are also being created with the countryside a pueblo a pueblo initiative brings together urban communities and farmers to distribute food directly eliminating intermediaries and speculators el panal also regularly organizes food fairs at which meats vegetables and other basic foods can be bought at discounts well below market prices tackling social problems through missions there are also the social programs known as missions that are based on the direct participation of the beneficiaries begun in 2003 there are more than two dozen missions that seek to solve a wide array of social problems given the corruption and inertia of the state bureaucracy and the unwillingness of many professionals to provide services to poor neighborhoods the missions were established to provide services directly while enabling participants to shape the programs much government money was poured into these programs thanks to the then high price of oil which in turn enabled the chávez government to fund them among the approximately two dozen missions are alimentación which incorporates the mercal network that provides food at subsidized prices and a distribution system cultura which seeks the decentralization and democratization of culture to ensure that all have access to it and stimulate community participation guaicaipuro intended to guarantee the rights of indigenous peoples as specified in the constitution madres del barrio designed to provide support to housewives in dire poverty and help their families overcome their poverty negra hipólita which assists children adolescents and adults who are homeless piar which seeks to help mining communities through dignifying living conditions and establishing environmental practices and zamora intended to reorganize land especially idle land that could be used for agriculture in accordance with the constitution venezuelan political scientist and historian margarita lópez maya summarized the breadth of the missions in a socialist register article missions programs bypassing uncooperative or ineffective state agencies such as barrio adentro free 24 hours a day primary health care and disease prevention for low income groups mercal state distribution of food at subsidized prices robinson 1 and 2 literacy and primary education for adults ribas and sucre secondary and university education for those who had missed or not finished these vuelvan caras training for employment and the bolivarian schools where a full day schedule has been restored with two free meals and two snacks a day plus free uniforms and textbooks all these undoubtedly had a positive political impact the government has also invested in the social economy as in the ruedas de negocios in which the creation of cooperatives is encouraged in order to supply goods and services to the state sector the government has also created a system of micro financing with the women s bank the sovereign people s bank and so on which make small loans to lower income borrowers struggles for economic democracy in the workplaces there are experiments with co management cooperatives socialist production units and workers councils these forms have been contested an ongoing multiple sided struggle over what constitutes workers control of industry and what forms such control should take continues cooperative enterprises are enshrined in the constitution and a 2001 law mandates that all members be included in decision making and that an assembly of all members has final decision making power over all topics temporary workers can be hired for a maximum of six months after which they must be accepted as members a state ministry was created to provide assistance to cooperatives and small businesses including the facilitation of securing contracts from state companies there are difficulties here one significant problem were instances of cooperatives being formed only in order to acquire the start up capital provided by the government or were small companies that converted to being cooperatives only on paper to take advantage of preferential priority for state contracts or to obtain subsidies in response to these irregularities the government began to require coops obtain a certificate of fulfillment of responsibilities which includes financial audits and demonstration of work within their local community nonetheless there are many examples of successful cooperative enterprises there are also socialist production units these are nonprofit state owned enterprises that are managed democratically by a combination of their workers local communal councils and the national government these enterprises are intended to provide local services such as transportation and distribution of cooking gas and the creation of production although workers are directly involved in decision making at these enterprises the state also has a role which can sometimes lead to tensions the goods produced are most often distributed through the mercal state owned chain of supermarkets that provides food at subsidized prices and pdval a state run food distribution network these are often operated at a loss as they are intended to provide needed goods and services to communities at steep discounts a continuing area of contestation are state owned enterprises some argue for state ownership with employee participation others argue for full autonomy of enterprises and the workers in them and there are gradations in between there are managements that don t wish to cede decision making authority to their workforce and there are government officials despite being part of the bolivarian movement who oppose workers control sometimes because they believe in top down control by the state there are examples of state owned companies in which management structures have changed multiple times as different factions temporarily gain control the push and pull of competing interests and tendencies is exemplified in the case of the state owned aluminum smelter alcasa which had a well functioning system of workers control under co management that reversed its debt problems then had a new director appointed who ignored the co management structure with an accompanying fall in productivity and return of corruption and then a return to co management when president chávez named a new company president selected by the workers workers control was reinstated with new structures and because of the precarious financial situation caused by the corruption of the middle period workers began designing parts to be produced internally instead of buying them from suppliers as previously done more difficulties arose when a dissident union aligned with the local state governor attempted to stop production and although unsuccessful caused a significant disruption yet another change in management by chávez led to a renewed deterioration in co management and struggles at alcasa continued economic warfare at home and abroad shifting from a traditional capitalist economy toward a participatory economic democracy can t be expected to be smooth sailing especially when this attempt is being done in a country with subaltern status in the world capitalist system president chávez had to withstand three successive attempts to remove him the 2002 coup 2002 03 bosses lockout and the 2004 recall referendum five times he was elected president never with less than 55 percent of the vote and overall he won 16 of 17 elections and referendums in which his movement participated the election system put in place by the chávez government was declared by former u s president jimmy carter s carter center to be the best in the world none of this prevented the late president from being furiously denounced as a dictator once he died however the attacks were stepped up by the revolution s opponents apparently believing that the loss of the leader would make the revolution vulnerable in reality the bolivarian revolution has always been a movement propelled by millions who will not readily give up the many gains they have achieved and which pushed the late president to go further venezuela has a long tradition of strong organized movements which predate the bolivarian revolution despite the difficulties of recent years and increasing popular disapproval of president maduro those movements do not want their gains to be reversed during the chávez years unemployment and poverty were drastically reduced and people were able to participate in the political process for the first time so how much of venezuela s serious economic problems are the fault of the current president some of the blame can be laid at his doorstep but mostly for his inability to act in timely fashion and allowing problems caused by outside forces to deepen a serious mistake that has ran through the past 20 years is that no progress was made on reducing venezuela s heavy reliance on oil exports when oil prices were high the government was content to let the money flow and use it to fund social programs and finance a wide variety of projects but the later crash in oil prices left the government vulnerable by not diversifying the economy much less is earned when the inevitable falls in price arrive and it becomes difficult to maintain consumption because so many consumer products must be imported the over reliance on a single export commodity would be difficult to overcome by itself but greatly compounding venezuela s problems are u s sanctions a currency that became drastically overvalued and an inflationary spiral resulting from that overvaluation that incentivized black markets and smuggling poor management on the part of the government of president maduro has intensified the damage done by those factors although the venezuelan government set an official exchange rate for its currency the bolívar the effective exchange rate was determined by international currency speculators and thus the value of the bolívar is not in the control of caracas speculators caused the value of the bolívar to be reduced by 97 percent in 2017 and further drastic reductions in the currency s value continued well into 2018 the value or output of the venezuelan economy hardly declined by anything remotely comparable so there are other factors at work for such a drastic reduction in exchange value but because the maduro government did not adjust the official exchange rate when the bolívar came under attack the spread between the official rate and the de facto rate widened to the point that vast opportunities for smuggling and black market operations were created that in turn caused shortages and hyperinflation these developments were a consequence of venezuela s integration into the world capitalist system and the country s heavy reliance on imports food and consumer goods intended to be sold at discounts in state stores were diverted to the black market where profiteers sold them at prices several times higher or smuggled them into colombia for huge profits government officials have repeatedly discovered vast quantities of consumer goods hidden in warehouses by local capitalists who are artificially causing shortages hardening financial sanctions united states government sanctions on venezuela prohibit any u s persons or banks from providing financing or purchasing any debt issued by the venezuelan government or the state oil company pdvsa the purpose of which is to make it more difficult for the government to raise funds internationally or to restructure debt these sanctions are effectively extra territorial a non u s bank that seeks to handle a transaction in u s dollars the currency most often used in international transactions has to do so by clearing the transaction through a u s bank a u s bank that cleared such a transaction would be in violation of the sanctions the obama administration intensified the u s financial war on venezuela by absurdly declaring the latter a national security threat and the trump administration has issued a succession of decrees tightening the screws the latest issued on january 28 freezes all property and interests of pdvsa subject to u s jurisdiction in other words blocking venezuela from any access to the profits generated by pdvsa s u s subsidiary citgo or any pdvsa activities in the united states the trump administration expects venezuela to lose us 11 billion this year the new york times reports that move is in addition to repeated calls by the trump administration for an overthrow of the venezuelan government threats by president trump to invade and the trump administration recognizing the opposition leader juan guaidó as president although guaidó has never run for the position and is largely unknown to the venezuelan public an added insult is the appointment of death squad cheerleader elliot abrams to oversee a return to democracy an idea that would draw laughs if abrams history in latin america during the reagan administration weren t so deadly successive u s administrations have subsidized opposition groups an estimated us 100 million has been poured into venezuela in an effort to subvert the elected government alan macleod a specialist in media studies summarized the extra territorial effect of u s sanctions he sanctions strongly discourage other countries from lending money to the country for fear of reprisal and also discourage any businesses from doing business there too a study from the 2018 opposition presidential candidate s economics czar suggested the sanctions were responsible for a 50 drop in oil production furthermore trump s sanctions prevent profits from venezuela owned citgo from being sent back to venezuela trump has also threatened banks with 30 years in jail if they co operate with caracas and has intimidated others into going along with them president maduro is repeatedly called a dictator an epithet endless repeated across the corporate media but when a portion of the opposition boycotts can it be a surprise that the incumbent wins the opposition actually asked the united nations to not send observers a sure sign that they expected to lose a fair election despite their claims that the election would be rigged nonetheless a coalition of canadian unions church leaders and other officials declared the election to be a transparent secure democratic and orderly electoral and voting process unfortunately there is every reason to be concerned given the hostility of u s governments and capitalists to any intent to become independent of the u s or to direct economic activity to benefit local people rather than maximizing the profits of u s multinational corporations the united states has militarily invaded latin american and caribbean countries 96 times including 48 times in the 20th century that total constitutes only direct interventions and doesn t include coups fomented by the u s such as guatemala in 1954 and chile in 1973 guatemala was attempting nothing more radical than a land reform that would have forced united fruit to sell idle land at united fruit s own under valuation of the land a self assessment made by united fruit to avoid paying a fair share of taxes the u s overthrew the government and instituted what would become a 40 year nightmare of state organized mass murder that ultimately cost 200 000 lives the chilean effort to build a humane economy was ended with the overthrow of salvador allende and the installation of augusto pinochet and his murderous regime that immiserated chileans dissimilar results can hardly be expected if the u s were to succeed in overthrowing the venezuelan government and installing a right wing government that would reverse the many gains of the past 20 years hands off venezuela systemic disorder is written by pete dolack an activist writer poet and photographer he is the author of the book it s not over learning from the socialist experiment a study of some of the attempts organized to create societies on a basis other than capitalism with an eye toward an understanding of today s world and finding a path to a better

all individuals have access to similar economic opportunities he said abacus s coletto is seeing signs that the trend exists here in canada too one of the key indicators of underemployment is wages which would be reflected in the rise of minimum wage workers but the other big indicator is the benefits offered by employers self employed people largely don t have access to benefits people making

coletto we ve been raised around these expectations go do what you want to do the world is your oyster dream big those expectations were set quite high when you enter a world where it s not possible to achieve the things that your parents and your teachers and society has been saying is going to be there it creates further tension baby boomers won t go can t go the tension is being compounded by the baby boomer generation s refusal to leave the workforce if the millennials are stuck in a bottleneck fighting for career advancement right now the baby boomers are acting like a cork preventing

paying for the care of their aging parents many also find themselves sandwiched in between paying for their parents while also supporting their millennial children who have returned to the family home the millennials can t afford to leave their parents homes because they don t have the opportunity or means to do so but their parents can t afford to retire which would open spaces in the workforce for millennials because they are still supporting those kids at home it is a problem that the boomers aren t leaving that s absolutely true said duxbury so what comes next advertisement 15 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the awakening of the millennial tectonic plates are beginning to shift that s the opinion at least of karen foster assistant professor at dalhousie university and canada research chair in sustainable rural futures for atlantic canada one of foster s areas of expertise is in researching generational divisions at work she said there is no doubt millennials are upset and that their complaints have been falling on deaf ears however one of the larger issues that millennials are facing is a growing wealth gap between themselves and older generations due to the fact that major life milestones have been delayed investments in real estate or other financial transactions aren t yielding the same return for the younger generation foster said sure property values have skyrocketed for older generations who bought when prices were affordable and have been hanging onto the property but the millennial who just purchased is seeing bigger mortgages than ever before and interest rates that are steadily rising critics of millennial concerns have often pointed out that are next in line to inherit massive amounts of wealth that has been accumulated by their aging parents in fact between 2016 and 2026 the largest wealth transfer in history is expected to take place as older generations pass on as much as 1 trillion to younger generations in canada according to toronto based research firm strategic insight advertisement 16 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content but foster pointed out one critical problem with the upcoming windfall the expected transfer of wealth will only benefit those people who come from families that are already wealthy it will also affect people from major canadian cities where property prices have been steadily rising in a much different way than those people from less populated towns if your family is from somewhere such as moncton n b moose jaw sask or sudbury ont you won t see the same windfall when it comes time to collect an inheritance people who are set to inherit money from their parents or in a sense have been inheriting it their whole lives through various kinds of support that s where the real inequality happens she said adding that millennials are looking to completely upend the status quo that really comes down to a restructuring of the tax system we need to be taxing wealth and high incomes and corporate profits more in order to redistribute wealth across the demographics foster predicts that millennials are likely to push for things such as increased estate taxes in order to ensure that some of the wealth that is transferred from older generations is redistributed throughout all of society the idea is being spearheaded in the united states by recently elected democrat congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez ocasio cortez who at 29 is also a millennial is lobbying for the introduction of a tax on the wealthiest americans in the country she believes that every dollar of income over 10 million should be taxed at 70 per cent

audience at the world economic forum in davos switzerland as recently as last week with attendees including michael dell founder of dell technologies and microsoft corp founder bill gates expressing objections the call for higher estate taxes in canada was recently reinforced in a study released by the canadian centre for policy alternatives ccpa you d expect canada s tax regime would try to counteract this concentration of wealth at the very top where it s needed the least but in fact federal policies encourage it said the centre s senior economist david macdonald in a release canada is the only country in the g7 without an inheritance estate or gift tax on tremendous family wealth the ccpa s report said canada s wealthiest families saw their net worth grow on average by 37 per cent between 2012 and 2016 middle class families saw their net worth grow by only 16 per cent during the same time frame the study calls for high estate taxes eliminating tax preferences for capital gains and dividend income in a bid to better distribute wealth across demographics advertisement 18 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content that may sound like a scary scenario to older generations who have amassed wealth throughout their lifetimes and typically been more conservative when it comes to political fiscal policies but for the millennial generation it s only the tip of the iceberg bring the big government according to abacus data millennials are looking to government to take big steps to fix their problems this generation is more comfortable with big interventionist government than allowing market forces to play their part surveys suggest many millennials truly believe that the economic system that has been in place for hundreds of years fails to work for them the company s research suggests that millennials clearly prioritize increased government spending over balanced budgets in order to tackle issues such as alleviating income inequality they believe corporations don t pay their fair share of taxes and that government has a big role to play in redistributing that money having lived through the 2008 financial crisis and a rise in housing costs many are outright skeptical of the free market when asked to indicate if they lean more towards one perspective or the other only 46 per cent suggested that capitalism is the best economic model we have while 54 per cent believe canada would be better off with a more socialist system reads an abacus data survey released last year

for a lot of the programs you are looking at applying to to get an actual career the amount of hours of experience you need for example the physician assistant program that i applied to it s only offered by three universities in canada and i couldn t apply to the third which is the university of toronto because they require almost 1 000 hours of health care experience so where am i supposed to

report released thursday he highlighted significant structural changes in ontario s economy and labour market including a rise in part time and temporary work these trends in ontario incomes raise important questions about the role of government in ensuring that all individuals have access to similar economic opportunities he said abacus s coletto is seeing signs that the trend exists here in canada too one of the key indicators of underemployment is wages which would be reflected in the rise of minimum wage workers but the other big indicator is the benefits offered by employers self employed people largely don t have access to benefits people making minimum wage get a minimum amount of benefits from their employers only 55 per cent of millennials have access to a prescription

expectations were set quite high when you enter a world where it s not possible to achieve the things that your parents and your teachers and society has been saying is going to be there it creates further tension baby boomers won t go can t go the tension is being compounded by the baby boomer generation s refusal to leave the workforce if the millennials are stuck in a bottleneck fighting for career advancement right now the baby boomers are acting like a cork preventing any movement whereas the age 65 was once marked by a person s announcing their retirement today s senior citizens are

extended life spans better health and in some cases continued financial responsibilities are seeing many people in the baby boomer demographic work well into their 70s before opting for retirement boomers have significant expenses that perhaps they didn t anticipate plus they love their jobs and they re healthy they think what am i going to do for the next 25 years said duxbury duxbury also said that baby boomers are now finding themselves in a situation where they are caring for or paying for the care of their aging parents many also find themselves sandwiched in between paying for their parents while also supporting their millennial children who have returned to the family home the millennials can t afford to leave their parents homes because they don t have the opportunity or means to do so but their parents can t afford to retire which would open spaces in the workforce for millennials because they are still supporting those kids at home it is a problem that the boomers aren t leaving that s absolutely true said duxbury so what comes next advertisement 15 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the awakening of the millennial tectonic plates are beginning to shift that s the opinion at least of karen foster assistant professor at dalhousie university and canada research chair in sustainable rural futures for atlantic canada one of foster s areas of expertise is in researching generational divisions at work she said there is no doubt millennials are upset and that their complaints have been falling on deaf ears however one of the larger issues that millennials are facing is a growing wealth gap between themselves and older generations due to the fact that major life milestones have been delayed investments in real estate or other financial transactions aren t yielding the same return for the younger generation foster said sure property values have skyrocketed for older generations who bought when prices were affordable and have been hanging onto the property but the millennial who just purchased is seeing bigger mortgages than ever before and interest rates that are steadily rising critics of millennial concerns have often pointed out that are next in line to inherit massive amounts of wealth that has been accumulated by their aging parents in fact between 2016 and 2026 the largest wealth transfer in history is expected to take place as older generations pass on as much as 1 trillion to younger generations in canada according to toronto based research firm strategic insight advertisement 16 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content but foster pointed out one critical problem with the upcoming windfall the expected transfer of wealth will only benefit those people who come from families that are already wealthy it will also affect people from major canadian cities where property prices have been steadily rising in a much different way than those people from less populated towns if your family is from somewhere such as moncton n b moose jaw sask or sudbury ont you won t see the same windfall when it comes time to collect an inheritance people who are set to inherit money from their parents or in a sense have been inheriting it their whole lives through various kinds of support that s where the real inequality happens she said adding that millennials are looking to completely upend the status quo that really comes down to a restructuring of the tax system we need to be taxing wealth and high incomes and corporate profits more in order to redistribute wealth across the demographics foster predicts that millennials are likely to push for things such as increased estate taxes in order to ensure that some of the wealth that is transferred from older generations is redistributed throughout all of society the idea is being spearheaded in the united states by recently elected democrat congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez ocasio cortez who at 29 is also a millennial is lobbying for the introduction of a tax on the wealthiest americans in the country she believes that every dollar of income over 10 million should be taxed at 70 per cent advertisement 17 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content there will of course be pushback to that idea it s been panned by the audience at the world economic forum in davos switzerland as recently as last week with attendees including michael dell founder of dell technologies and microsoft corp founder bill gates expressing objections the call for higher estate taxes in canada was recently reinforced in a study released by the canadian centre for policy alternatives ccpa you d expect canada s tax regime would try to counteract this concentration of wealth at the very top where it s needed the least but in fact federal policies encourage it said the centre s senior economist david macdonald in a release canada is the only country in the g7 without an inheritance estate or gift tax on tremendous family wealth the ccpa s report said canada s wealthiest families saw their net worth grow on average by 37 per cent between 2012 and 2016 middle class families saw their net worth grow by only 16 per cent during the same time frame the study calls for high estate taxes eliminating tax preferences for capital gains and dividend income in a bid to better distribute wealth across demographics advertisement 18 story

their lifetimes and typically been more conservative when it comes to political fiscal policies but for the millennial generation it s only the tip of the iceberg bring the big government according to abacus data millennials are looking to government to take big steps to fix their problems this generation is more comfortable with big interventionist government than allowing market forces to play their part surveys suggest many millennials truly believe that the economic system that has been in place for hundreds of years fails to work for them the company s research suggests that millennials clearly prioritize increased government spending over balanced budgets in order to tackle issues such as alleviating income inequality they believe corporations don t pay their fair share of taxes and that government has a big role to play in redistributing that money having lived through the 2008 financial crisis and a rise in housing costs many are outright skeptical of the free market when asked to indicate if they lean more towards one perspective or the other only 46 per cent suggested that capitalism is the best economic model we have while 54 per cent believe canada would be better off

giving them a reason to get engaged said abacus s coletto millennials are unique from previous generations particularly the boomers and those who came before the boomers in that voting is not considered a duty we don t do it because we have to we do it because we have a reason to reasons seem to be emerging according to elections canada 38 8 per cent of eligible voters between the ages of

with more politicians tuning into the fact that the millennial generation will vote for political platforms that speak to their agenda the 18 through 35 demographic looks as though it will soon find

the pot is starting to get warm said coletto there are more millennials than there are boomers more millennials are eligible to vote than any other generation more politicians are mindful of the shift that millennials could bring meanwhile barrett is taking things in stride i ve seen a fair amount of challenges our generation may seem to think that we go through more but i think that every

turning now to our overall financial results and highlights for the quarter on slide 3 i m proud to report we had another quarter of solid financial performance as we generated record results for any december quarterly period for many of our primary operating metrics for the quarter sales were december quarterly record at nearly 2 billion increasing 11 over the prior year with growth in all three segments we recorded organic sales dollar growth of 3 led by our consumer packaging division at 9 and our health hygiene specialties division at 2 this was our fifth consecutive quarter of positive organic sales growth for the company operating ebitda was also a december quarterly record at 331 million up 7 from the prior year our adjusted earnings per share quarterly record of 0 77 was an increase of 15 compared with the prior year quarter now looking at some of our highlights specifically by segment as i mentioned our consumer packaging business reported strong organic sales growth in the quarter of 9 largely led by our food service products driven by stronger demand in quick serve restaurants and convenience stores we continue to be encouraged by the momentum of the division delivering five consecutive quarters of positive organic sales growth our health hygiene and specialties division recorded strong quarterly sales growth of 22 as well as a 21 improvement in operating ebitda including the impact of the clopay acquisition that closed in fiscal 2018 we will continue to be pleased we continue to be pleased with our acquisition integration of clopay which has provided us an opportunity to leverage technology in order to create more value with our customers the hhs division has now recorded sales growth for eight consecutive quarters and grew 2 organically in the first fiscal quarter inside our engineered materials division we delivered strong sales and operating ebitda growth during the quarter of 3 and 7 respectively the division made good progress in the period completing much of the qualification of alternate and new raw materials intended to maximize and reinforce our low cost position in this space as you recall in august of last year we announced the company s first share repurchase authorization of 500 million and kicked off the program purchasing 35 million before our fiscal year ended in september in the december quarter we repurchased an additional 54 million bringing our aggregate total to 89 million ph of shares repurchased since the plan was implemented we remain committed to a dynamic capital allocation strategy to maximize shareholder value which will thoughtfully include investment to grow our business organically execute strategic acquisitions debt reduction and return cash to our shareholders our financial performance and balance sheet has strengthened considerably over the past several years driven by our consistent dependable and growing free cash flow and we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet at berry we continue to believe the possibilities of plastics are endless whether it s used in applications such as healthcare medicine food storage and spoilage protection products from cellphones to cars plastics was one of the most versatile materials on the planet we re encouraged by our progress and improved collaboration across the value chain as you ll see on slide 4 on january 16th we announced our participation as a founding member of a new global alliance to health and plastics waste i m very proud and excited to be part of this new organization which is currently comprised of nearly 30 global companies and is making a 1 5 billion commitment over the next five years to invest in solutions to eliminate plastics wastes in the environment this alliance is different from many other organizations in that it spans the value chain brand owners plastics resin producers chemical companies converters like ourselves as well as waste management companies and recyclers are all aligned toward a common goal of how we ultimately end plastics wastes as a whole the alliance will work with governments multilateral institutions companies non government organizations and community to support investments and drive progress over the next five years the primary focus is categorizing the four main areas infrastructure development innovation education engagement and clean up in addition to our efforts with the alliance berry is also partnering with key organizations to encourage recycling as well as internal efforts to improve product recyclability and increased offerings with recycled content we similarly have pledged for that resin pellet flake and powder loss along with our partnership with operation clean sweep berry has a long history of taking steps to reduce our environmental impact through our technology know how material science and product design capabilities that coupled with the use of post consumer recycled material is something we re very encouraged by by joining the alliance we are now able to make greater impact on the end of life for plastics products one in which we hope will lead to an increase use of recovered plastics material which can be reused again in the manufacturing process before i turn the call to mark who ll review berry s financial results in detail i d like to highlight that the company is well positioned to achieve our historical track record of growing our free cash flow and delivering on its commitment just as we ve done every single year as a publicly traded company so today we are reaffirming our free cash flow guidance of 670 million for fiscal 2019 mark will provide more detail in his remarks and then i ll come back to summarize our strategy and open the call for questions mark mark w miles chief financial officer thank you tom and good morning everyone i would like to refer everyone to slide 5 now as tom referenced first quarter sales were 1 972 million which was up 196 million or 11 over the prior year quarter primarily due to recent acquisitions and organic sales dollar growth of 3 from an earnings perspective we achieved the december quarter operating ebitda record of 331 million up 7 compared to the prior year quarter contributions from recent acquisitions along with cost reduction efforts and price increases were partially offset by higher raw material manufacturing and transportation costs accounting for the annualized impact of acquired businesses including cost synergies our adjusted ebitda was 1 439 million for the four quarters ended december 2018 looking at the results of each operating segments starting on slide 6 sales for our engineered materials division for the quarter was 669 million an increase of 3 compared to the prior year quarter primarily attributed to the laddawn acquisition partially offset by a modest volume decline as a result of strong volumes in the december 2017 quarter operating ebitda in our engineered materials division was 127 million an increase of 7 compared to the prior year we are pleased with our progress in the quarter completing much of the qualification of alternate and new raw materials intended to maximize earnings and reinforce our low cost position in this space as discussed on our last earnings call in november this negatively impacted volumes the last couple of quarters due to the inefficiencies created along with some destocking we believe occurred in the supply chain in the december quarter in anticipation of lower resin pricing next on slide 7 our health hygiene specialties division delivered sales of 702 million in the quarter compared to 577 million in the prior year quarter the increase of 125 million or 22 was primarily attributable to the clopay acquisition and organic sales growth of 2 the organic sales growth was primarily driven by higher selling prices partially offset by reduced volume in our baby care and specialty businesses and an unfavorable currency impact we remain focused on leveraging our scale and low cost position to secure demand as the hygiene market works through a softer period we have worked hard to foster great relationships with the leading end users in the hygiene category and our capabilities know how and low cost global platform position us well for the future as these brands will lead the way in terms of innovation and differentiation we will provide operating ebitda increased 21 in the quarter to 116 million this 20 million increase in operating ebitda was primarily a result of the clopay acquisition cost reduction initiatives and recovery inflation partially offset by an unfavorable currency impact turning to slide 8 sales in our consumer packaging division was 601 million in the quarter which was 50 million higher than the december 2017 quarter the 9 organic sales growth was primarily driven by continued growth from our food service products that tom referenced earlier operating ebitda for consumer packaging in the quarter was 88 million compared to 95 million in the prior year quarter the timing lag of recovery in higher raw material transportation and manufacturing costs were partially offset by the continued volume growth delivered in the division our results in the quarter also included increased costs in the start up of new capital expenditures to support this continued growth slide 9 provides a summary of our income statement for our fiscal first quarter overall operating income improved 8 to 176 million due to the items previously discussed that drove the 21 million ph operating ebitda improvement partially offset by incremental depreciation and amortization from the recent acquisitions our net income for the quarter was 88 million compared to 163 million in the prior year quarter the december 2017 quarter included a 95 million favorable adjustment to income taxes related to tax reform earnings per diluted share came in at 0 66 and adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 15 to 0 77 in the current quarter compared to 0 67 in the prior year quarter next on slide 10 the company generated 161 million of cash flow from operations in the quarter representing an increase of 5 from the december 2017 quarter net capital expenditures in the quarter was 75 million as we incurred spending on cost reduction initiatives as well as growth related projects our adjusted free cash flow for the fourth quarter ended totaled 679 million which represents an adjusted free cash flow yield of nearly 11 using our quarter end market capitalization our consistently increasing dependable and substantial free cash flow provides us the opportunity to improve our balance sheet which included early principle payments of 100 million ph on our term loan in the december quarter in addition to reducing our variable rate debt through cash flow applied toward debt reduction we further reduced our earnings volatility from interest rate changes through an additional conversion of 400 million ph of variable rate debt to a fixed rate in january our financial guidance and assumptions for fiscal 2019 are shown on slide 11 we are reaffirming our fiscal 2019 adjusted free cash flow at 670 million which includes 1 036 million of cash flow from operations partially offset by capital expenditures of 350 million or we plan to allocate a larger percentage of our capital expenditures to drive earnings growth through a focus on cost reduction initiatives our guidance continues to assume constant currency rates and a normal inflationary environment on our costs additionally cash interest is estimated to be 270 million cash taxes of 165 million and working capital and other cash costs of 45 million as a reminder we anticipate fiscal year 2019 to follow our normal historical trend of strongest to weakest earnings quarters being 1st june 2nd september followed by march with this december quarter that we just completed being the weakest now let me take a moment to discuss the current landscape regarding pricing cost publish market prices for plastic resin our primary raw material dropped in the fourth calendar quarter the polyethylene reporting 0 06 ph lower and polypropylene 0 18 ph lower due to the timing of these decreases passing through our inventory we expect the majority of the benefits of these lower costs will positively impact the march 2019 quarter as we are only one quarter in our fiscal year and predicting resin market cycles can be very difficult we have opted to keep our guidance unchanged this concludes my financial review and now i ll turn it back to tom thomas e salmon chief executive officer chairman thank you mark as we look forward strategically and as that reflect on two years as berry s ceo i m committed to continue to do what berry does well manufacture products within stable end markets grow our business organically leverage our scale advantage locate and integrate accretive acquisitions and generate consistent dependable free cash flow while maintaining a strong balance sheet as a leading global supplier of broad range of innovative non woven flexible and rigid products our acquisition pipeline continues to be very robust with global opportunities in each of our three segments we feel there is and will be ample opportunity to

will continue to drive positive results and achieve our goals and mission of always advancing to protect what s important thank you for your continued interest in berry at this time mark and i will be glad to answer any of your questions operator questions and answers operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of ghansham panjabi from baird please go ahead ghansham panjabi robert w baird analyst hi everyone good morning thomas e salmon chief executive officer chairman morning mark w miles chief financial officer hi ghansham ghansham panjabi robert w baird analyst i guess first off i mean resin prices did collapse pretty significantly in the fourth quarter did you see any sort of ordering pattern shifts that customers were delaying orders into the following quarter and if so can you kind of quantify that and give us a sense as to how volumes are tracking across your three segments so far in the current quarter thomas e salmon chief executive officer chairman thanks ghansham i think most pronounced was probably our engineered materials business which is predominantly a distribution driven business where in the december month we saw some softness in demand with the anticipation of pe prices falling and so we do believe there was some destocking during the quarter and again it s typically if that impacts us in a quarter it will be in one month time only relative to demand across all three spaces as predicted and as budgeted we spend a lot of time in engineered materials focused on qualifying alternate raw materials and new raw materials ultimately to maintain our low cost position that s ostensibly behind us now as we migrate into q2 and we re making good improvement on a year over year basis and going into quarter two relative to hhs we saw 2 organic sales volume growth in the quarter two areas however i would say were consistent trends for us which was baby continued to be a bit soft and certainly inside of our specialty business we made the volume price trade up but i am actually very encouraged inside of hhs relative to the kind of partnerships we have and the key end users inside that space it s going to position us very well via innovation and via their promotional activities i think as they recover and improve inside that space as a leader in that particular category we ll be well benefited and in consumer packaging it continues to be a strong growth story we re very pleased with the progress the investments we made in that space clearly our food service our healthcare space are both making really strong progress inside that division and we continue to make really good improvement relative to lag recovery in terms of raw materials in offsetting that some of that price pressure and margin pressure we saw in the quarter so just a quick summary of those three ghansham panjabi robert w baird analyst okay and just as my follow up understanding you re very limited on what you could say about rpc but can you just sort of give us a sense on the timeline of diligence it just seems like there s a fair amount of controversy around rpc s true ebitda just curious on whether diligence will be something that will be done in a few weeks or will it stretch longer keeping in mind that the other parties have spent probably months evaluating rpc thanks so much thomas e salmon chief executive officer chairman yes thanks ghansham as we said in our opening comments unfortunately we really can t comment any further or respond to that announcement on the call but in general and consistent with our statements in our prepared comments this is not new to berry we will utilize our proven disciplined approach to complete this due diligent process and as such as that we would have other opportunities relative to shareholder value creation that won t change ghansham panjabi robert w baird analyst thanks good luck with it operator your next question comes from the line of george staphos from bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead molly bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey guys this is actually molly ph sitting in for george i just had two quick ones on volume so the first i m looking at the engineered materials segment so it was down 3 in the quarter but the waterfall showed a slight increase to ebitda of about 2 million can you provide a little bit of additional color on kind of what causes this is it mix acquisition effects or something else there thanks mark w miles chief financial officer good morning molly certainly as we mentioned in the prepared remarks we continue to work diligently to improve the blends of our raw materials and reducing our costs by qualifying various lower cost raw materials and encouraged by the progress we re seeing there the impacts we re having on our profitability molly bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay got it and then the second question is on hhs volumes can you kind of go into a little bit more detail on the 5 volume decline how that varies by region obviously you mentioned baby diapers were a bit weak so by product you kind of went over that but if you could just go over region that would be helpful thank you thomas e salmon chief executive officer chairman i ll start back with on baby listen the specialty business is what we ve described and that s everything from the underlayment that goes underneath furniture and things like that but our specialty category is very transactional if you will and during the quarter we made some conscious decisions relative to price volume trade off that impacted demand in the quarter but again we feel well positioned in the baby care and hygiene space relative to our position with the key end users in the space that as they show improvement in the category we ll similarly be benefited in that regard molly bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it thank you i ll turn it over operator your next question comes from the line of scott gaffner from barclays your line is open scott gaffner barclays capital analyst thanks good morning tom good morning mark dustin just a quick follow up tom on you mentioned the acquisition pipeline is robust kind of just want to focus on north america and some of the emerging markets i mean what are you seeing there i mean multiples were relatively high in north america for a while i mean is it are multiples still high or is nothing available there and then anything you have on the emerging markets as well thomas e salmon chief executive officer chairman just in general i think we d say we re seeing a moderation in some of the expectations in terms of around valuation in multiples certainly from 12 months ago and i think your our speculation as you ll continue to see that moderate overtime that will address and fix itself we re going to continue to take full advantage of what is the attractiveness of this incredibly fragmented space that continues to warrant investment by our suppliers which we re excited about and we think we re very well positioned right now especially with the percent of our business in north america today and the investments made around polyolefins that positioned berry very very well and i think it s a great statement and testimony to the growth prospects for our industry scott gaffner barclays capital analyst okay and then just focusing more on some of the recycled material that you re using i mean what percentage of your mix today do you think you could get to recycled material just based on the current technologies and which product categories are best suited for using recycled versus virgin resins thanks thomas e salmon chief executive officer chairman it s interesting scott across our entire product line at berry we have an opportunity to offer post consumer alternative for our customers and so that really expands the cross section of our business and so we re excited about that and frankly the efforts really are focused on making recommendations to our key end users and making them aware of the variety of post consumer alternatives that they can consider and i think that for me is what so exciting about the alliance and plastics waste is how does the initiative across that value chain exposes more of our market space to the possibility of plastics and the possibility of recycled plastic so very pleased and excited to look forward to that there s good progress being made and i think the alliance is just one step in that regard and clearly i think the categories that we re primarily focused on which is around prevention around enhancements of waste infrastructure innovation by helping create new sustainable technologies and business models to support innovative materials education and engagement and ultimately clean up i think will demonstrate on a global basis our ability to make a real impact on plastic waste and really change that narrative so looking forward to that scott gaffner barclays capital analyst perfect thanks tom operator your next question comes from the line of edlain rodriguez from ubs your line is open edlain rodriguez ubs securities analyst thank you good morning guys just a follow up on health and hygiene in specialties you ve talked about that price volume trade off that you ve made this quarter is there much of that to be done going forward and also i think last quarter you ve talked about repositioning some assets from baby care to adult products like what s the progress there thomas e salmon chief executive officer chairman it s a great question we continue to move on that the nice piece in terms of the asset mix inside of hhs is pretty fluid so as we work to create more demand on the adult and cotton side and we ultimately migrate more of that capacity to support that incremental growth inside specialty it s just as like most specialty businesses there s a variety of different products some are incredibly high tech value add and very strategic others are more transactional and more commoditized if you will and the choices that we made relative to volume price trade offs were around more of the commoditized items edlain rodriguez ubs securities analyst okay and one quick one on consumer packaging like how sustainable is that recent volume growth that we ve seen is it being driven by new customer wins or just improvement in the end markets thomas e salmon chief executive officer chairman it s predominantly driven by new customer wins and opportunities for berry to bring innovation and differentiation and find ways to meet unmet need we ve been very focused and methodical in terms of how we invest targeted markets with advantaged products and any opportunity where we have strength in a particular category to utilize that strength to give us exposure to other opportunities we ll do it so in food service where we have strength in cups we migrate that strength to support innovation and technology around strawless lids where we have capability and know how around tamper evident lid child resistant lid we migrate that know how to support the development of cannabis packaging we that s more of the theme ph so we re very bullish about the growth prospects inside that business and frankly in all of our businesses where we believe each of our businesses can be a low single digit growth business for berry edlain rodriguez ubs securities analyst okay thank you guys operator your next question comes from the line of arun viswanathan from rbc capital markets your line is open arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst thanks so i just had a couple of questions on that volume following up on that so in hh s what are you hearing from your customers on the category is there any possibility that you could see some slow improvement as we move through fiscal 19 in the diaper category and then in em you referenced maybe tougher comps resulting in a little bit of a volume shortfall so given that you still have some easier comps ahead of you due to the volume calling should we expect em volumes to turn positive later in the year thanks thomas e salmon chief executive officer chairman related to em the team is making good progress i think you ll see improvement in the em volume profile versus prior quarter and what our customers are asking for is they re looking for providers like berry who can bring them innovation differentiation scale capital investment to support innovation and customers and companies like ourselves for them that ultimately can deliver kind of quality and service and have the supply chain consistency that they re looking for and we think berry is very well suited for that in that regard they are obviously trying new techniques in terms of marketing promotion shelf pricing as well as different innovative launches that berry is supporting in kind and as we see traction and improvement inside the hygiene space berry will similarly benefit arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst okay thanks operator your next question comes from the line of neel kumar from morgan stanley please go ahead neel kumar morgan stanley analyst hi good morning thomas e salmon chief executive officer chairman good morning neel kumar morgan stanley analyst in consumer packaging i was wondering if you could just give us some color on the margin decline year over year it seems that price cost is negative but anything else is driving that decline and also just generally how do your margins in food service products compared to the overall segment margins mark w miles chief financial officer yes good morning yes relative to the inaudible that margin discussion by product is not something that we re prepared to disclose relative to the year over year earnings in consumer packaging raw materials didn t drop until the back half of the quarter and that will certainly benefit us as we go into march but there is a timing lag in the pass through of that through our inventories which again is the reason you didn t see much of an impact in the december quarter however we did see sequential improvement the year over year price cost improved significantly in that business compared to the september quarter so we re encouraged by the progress we make as the inflation moderates and we re recovering price into the market but it s just a timing lag relative to recovering cost inflation that s occurred and it s a little more pronounced in consumer the agreements most of our customer relationships they are covered by agreements which have timing lag to pass through of resin and typically don t have pass throughs on other costs so you have to wait for those agreements to mature which again tend to be longer term in that business neel kumar morgan stanley analyst that s helpful and then for my follow up i was just wondering if you can give an update on where you were in terms of your initiatives the lag in your resin pass through mark w miles chief financial officer yes i would say that s an ongoing exercise again as agreements come up working with customers to reduce that lag to the extent we re doing that through the negotiation whether or not it s the frequency of the moves or the timing with which the month it looks at the embassy we re working on both those things on an ongoing basis plus an ongoing effort of the company to although our lag is somewhat modest we want to continue to improve to reduce that timing lag on our earnings thomas e salmon chief executive officer chairman and that s a consistent effort across all three of our divisions neel kumar morgan stanley analyst great thanks that s helpful operator your next question comes from the line of tyler langton from jpmorgan your line is open tyler langton jp morgan analyst good morning thank you just had a question on price cost i know it was a positive sort of 3 million spread this quarter do you still expect to get back roughly half of the 100 million sort of under recovery that you based on last year and should that sort of i guess accelerate throughout the year thomas e salmon chief executive officer chairman we continue to believe we ll recover at least 50 million during fiscal 2019 and i would say also we re very pleased with our progress on price recovery during the quarter in general just coming in positive on price versus cost tyler langton jp morgan analyst got it thanks and then could you just remind us of leverage target i know you ve mentioned you kind of want to stay around 4 times but i guess is that something you d go above for a short period of time if you had sort of visibility to deleverage just sort of any color there would be helpful thomas e salmon chief executive officer chairman as we previously said that we believe we can execute our strategy below 4 times leverage we re fortunate to participate in what remains a very fragmented plastics packaging market we evaluate every capital allocation opportunity to maximize shareholder value were there a circumstance that would arise that would temporarily take our leverage higher berry s strength and dependable cash generation affords us the opportunity to delever quickly and we are very committed to maintain a strong balance sheet tyler langton jp morgan analyst great thanks much operator your next question comes from the line of salvator tiano from vertical research your line is open salvator tiano vertical research analyst hi guys i d like also to talk some of the cost of goods sold specifically can you provide us some of the big market soft ph inflation you saw this quarter i assume if resins weren t as pronounced so this i think almost 80 million in higher cogs year on year what were the main components mark w miles chief financial officer yes resin is about half of our costs and on a year over year basis it s up significantly again on a year over year basis again that will moderate next quarter as we have the benefit of the lower resin prices that occurred in the back half of the calendar quarter impact the march quarter but largely driven by resin certainly other raw materials as well as normal inflation and costs like healthcare labor et cetera were higher on a year over year basis but significantly overshadowed by the resin year over year increased costs salvator tiano vertical research analyst okay perfect then just i know you won t as you mentioned you won t discuss rpc i was just wondering how do you see generally investing in the european market given all the proposed regulations restricting use of single use plastics and some feedback we re being getting from some other companies that even with that regulations many companies focusing on sustainability are just shifting to other formats what do you think the trade off by expanding to more to europe there thomas e salmon chief executive officer chairman well obviously we re not going to speak relative to that announcement but i would say in general we believe that the energy around recyclability around plastics and its sustainability and how we ultimately create a circular economy is a huge opportunity for a company like berry global we talked about the level of investment that we ve made over a long period of time with our engineering our design capability our ability to lightweight our ability to work collaboratively through alliance alliance is like the alliance and plastics waste to promote to ultimately prevent to innovate to educate and to clean up and we remain very bullish about the substrate and about the opportunity i mean if you think of that and take a look i strongly suggest you do this take a look on the alliance and plastics waste look at some of the projects that we ll be focused on inside this arena and this area of conversation we re working with circulate capital as an incubator network to support investment around waste management infrastructure we re working with the united nations environment to raise awareness and engage public sector for local deployment of solutions around waste management infrastructure we re working with renew oceans to capture plastics waste from rivers we re working on the ganges river project which will be begun in 2019 in partnership with national geographic we re developing open source data to support investment maximize the impact of sharing that data across the value chain to make greater strides faster and the chemical companies and the resin companies are in a better position to talk about it but there s a tremendous amount of effort right now focused around chemical recycling where you take waste migrate it to monomer to create polymer and it s migrating from the lab and ultimately become commercial and they can walk through the timeline there but we remain very bullish on the space bullish on the opportunity bullish on one of the most flexible versatile raw material on the planet that has changed people s lives every day and there continues to be i think a tremendous amount of opportunity going forward with it salvator tiano vertical research analyst great thanks operator your next question comes from the line of adam josephson from keybanc capital markets your line is open adam josephson keybanc capital markets analyst tom mark and dustin good morning thomas e salmon chief executive officer chairman good morning adam josephson keybanc capital markets analyst just one more on the leverage question i think tyler asked a little bit ago tom you said a couple of quarters ago that you think your leverage should stay below four and i thought that meant just remain below four sustainably and it sounds like what you re saying as well we re more than comfortable exceeding it for a year or two and then going below and then going back up again what do you think of just staying below four sustainably rather than going up and down and up and down thomas e salmon chief executive officer chairman well listen we evaluate every capital allocation in our company on ways that we can maximize shareholder value and like i just noted that we continue to believe based on what we know today that we can execute that strategy and stay below 4 times now were there an opportunity and as i said or a circumstance that would arise that would temporarily take it higher we believe our strength and our dependable cash generation affords us the opportunity to do that and delever quickly while at the same time creating shareholder value and not losing that commitment on maintaining a strong balance sheet adam josephson keybanc capital markets analyst okay thank you for that and just on the recycled resin someone asked about it earlier but how feasible do you think it would be to meaningfully increase your usage of recycled resin just given the industry infrastructure or lack thereof that exists today and the cost differences between recycled and virgin resin because obviously i imagine your customers do not want to pay more for their packaging than they re paying today thomas e salmon chief executive officer chairman there is it starts with making them aware of what s available and how they ultimately take a look at that consideration in terms of costs market impact how it affects their brand but clearly the objective of the alliance is to promote encourage make people aware of the products that are available to justify investments so that the demand will ultimately support a greater roic and that s what hasn t happened over the years and the fact that the alliance and plastics waste is across value chain initiative with key end users being part of that they have complete line of sight and visibility to that to help pull that along historically i think the efforts have been less successful because you haven t had the entire value chain represented which you do now and i wholly expect that other converters other end users other waste management companies other recyclers will get engaged and want to be part of this alliance to ultimately formally at one day end plastics wastes in its entirety adam josephson keybanc capital markets analyst thanks tom operator your next question comes from the line of anojja shah from bmo capital markets your line is open anojja shah bmo capital markets analyst hi good morning i just wanted to ask another question about food service clearly it s doing very well there s been volume growth for many quarters now but what steps are you taking to insulate it from increasing concerns around single serve plastics thomas e salmon chief executive officer chairman well listen we that space has been a great growth industry similarly we re partnering with the top qsrs in the world we always focus on multi generation product plans ultimately so that one innovation is replaced by another innovation overtime and we continue to see strength inside that space very pleased with the opportunities that s in front of us both in terms of the polypropylene drink cup and it being a platform technology and how we extend that to other end users as well as extensions like strawless lids as one example where our historic capability supported by consumer insights that we actually have product that the markets are looking for right now consumers frankly prefer a strawless lid over alternative straw solutions and we have a well known capability inside that space and we re excited about some of the prospects that that can provide longer term anojja shah bmo capital markets analyst all right thank you for that and then just for my follow up are you seeing more attractive acquisition opportunities in china given the slowdown that s happening there thomas e salmon chief executive officer chairman the market and the industry is fragmented around the globe china is not insulated from that fragmentation as well and yes we have line of sight there there is there continues to be opportunities and one of the fastest growth regions from a volume perspective still in the world and we ll continue to take and keep an eye on that clearly it s an opportunity where we have a base of business both in terms of our non woven space as well as inside consumer packaging and we continue to look for opportunities to grow that business organically as well as through other investments should they generate the kind of shareholder value we expect in return anojja shah bmo capital markets analyst great thank you very much operator your last question comes from the line of daniel rizzo from jefferies your line is open daniel rizzo jefferies analyst good morning guys thank you for taking my question you mentioned alternative raw materials in engineered materials i was just wondering what exactly you re referring to thomas e salmon chief executive officer chairman just in general we have the engineered materials business is probably the business inside our portfolio most impacted by our material science know how so as we ultimately come up with different combinations and formulations to create feature benefits that are unique to the customer or create feature benefits at a lower cost that s what we re speaking of and that s a core competency inside that business and it s something that we re very excited about because we remain committed to preserving our low cost provider position inside that space daniel rizzo jefferies analyst okay and then you also mentioned that hygiene was swapped i would think that that s fairly stable i was wondering and are you referring just to the diapers what are you actually referring to thomas e salmon chief executive officer chairman diapers specifically daniel rizzo jefferies analyst okay i just want to make sure thanks operator there are no further questions at this time presenters you may continue thomas e salmon chief executive officer chairman well listen at this time i want to thank everyone for your interest in berry global we look forward to talking to you during our next call thanks everybody operator thank you for joining us today this concludes today s conference call you

he president of the world bank jim yong kim will step down on 1 february three and a half years before the end of his term in search of greener pastures his readiness to resign from the leadership of one the two most powerful international financial institutions is a worrying omen but it is also an important wake up call the world bank and the imf are the last remaining columns of the bretton woods edifice under which capitalism experienced its golden age in the 1950s and 1960s while that system and the fixed exchange rate regime it relied upon bit the dust in 1971 the two institutions continued to support global finance along purely atlanticist lines with europe s establishment choosing the imf s managing director and the united states selecting the head of the world bank kim a career physician who presented himself as a champion of poverty alleviation now leaves the fate of the bank s leadership in the hands of donald trump the global equivalent of a progressive supreme court justice hanging up his robes in the middle of a republican white house adding a touch of the absurd to the drama it is the us president s daughter ivanka trump who is now leading the search committee for kim s replacement but like every crisis of the trump era this sordid affair is an excellent opportunity to mobilize around an entirely new vision for the bretton woods institutions to push for radical reforms that would put the resources of the world bank and the imf in the service of the many rather than lubricating the wheels of global finance in the interest of the very few such a progressive vision would bring the bretton woods system much closer to the lofty intentions of its framers prosperity like peace is indivisible said the us treasury secretary henry morgenthau in his inaugural speech to the bretton woods conference which gave birth to the world bank then the international bank for reconstruction and development and to the imf we cannot afford to have it scattered here or there among the fortunate or enjoy it at the expense of others the original bretton woods plan was for exchange rates to be fixed with the imf helping heavily indebted countries restructure their debt and a stabilization fund curbing capital flight meanwhile the world bank would offer development finance and an international commodity stabilization corporation would bring about the orderly marketing of staple commodities at prices fair to the producer and consumer alike finally the whole system would be dollar denominated with the greenback being the only currency exchangeable for gold at a fixed rate john maynard keynes the chief british negotiator at bretton woods was worried that the new system could only rely on the dollar as long as america had a trade surplus the moment the united states became a deficit country the system would collapse so keynes suggested that instead of building the new world order on the dollar all major economies would subscribe to a multilateral international clearing union icu while keeping their own currencies and central banks countries would agree to denominate all international payments in a common accounting unit which keynes named the bancor and to clear all international payments through the icu once set up the icu would tax persistent surpluses and deficits symmetrically so as to balance out capital flows volatility global aggregate demand and productivity had it been instituted the icu would have worked alongside the world bank to keep the global economy in balance and build shared prosperity worldwide but keynes s icu was rejected the united states was unwilling to replace the dollar as the anchor of the new monetary system and so the imf was downgraded to a bailout fund the world bank was limited to lending from its own reserves contributed by stressed member states and crucially any possibility of the imf leveraging the world bank s investments like a central bank might have done was jettisoned following large us trade deficits then president richard nixon announced on 15 august 1971 the effective end of the bretton woods system just as keynes had predicted immediately the private banks which the bretton woods system had been keeping under a lid sprang up and the world was taken over by financialization rather than supporting governments and prosperity the world bank and the imf led the so called washington consensus an orchestrated campaign of mass privatization austerity and financial deregulation there are virtually no limits on what can be privatized wrote mary shirley the chief of the public sector management and private sector development division in 1992 jim yong kim s departure must be our cue to review role of the world bank and the imf photograph chip somodevilla getty images jim yong kim was once a fierce critic of the washington consensus in his book dying for growth published in 2000 kim railed against the world bank s free marketeering the costs of which have been borne by the poor the infirm and the vulnerable in poor countries that accepted the experts designs yet as president kim turbocharged the bank s commitment to private profits against the public interest maximizing finance for development mfd the strategy he adopted in 2015 transformed the world bank from a direct investor in developing countries to a mere facilitator of private finance the bank s core activity would not be lending to governments but to de risk projects sectors and entire countries in effect socializing the risks on behalf of the private investors and privatizing any gains from this perspective it makes perfect sense that mr kim resigned early to take up a post at a private equity firm his decision must however be our cue to review the role of the world bank and the imf today and perhaps to revisit keynes s prescient idea circa 1944 the world today needs as much as it did in 1944 a massive international investment program back then humanity needed reconstruction after a lethal world war today the planet is crying out for a green transition that will cost at least 8tn annually where will the money come from surely not from the stressed budgets of our states here s an idea build a new bretton woods and fund the international green new deal by simply mobilizing idle savings via a linkup between the revamped world bank and the new imf the imf can become the issuer of a digital currency unit in which all international payments are denominated countries can retain their currencies that will float freely against the imf s unit and a wealth fund can be built by depositing in it currency units in proportion to every country s trade deficits and surpluses meanwhile backed by the imf s capacity to issue the world currency unit the world bank can crowd idle savings from across the world into green investments reclaiming its soul after decades of investing in environmental destruction and human displacement kim s departure makes one thing clear the world bank is on the brink new development banks are growing in size and in scope filling the space that the world bank has long since abandoned now is the time to mobilize to push a new crop of progressive leaders to start thinking internationally taking their enthusiasm for the green new deal to the global level if we do not act quickly demanding a radical change of direction the world bank will likely fade into irrelevance or worse it will become a plaything for the trump family and its associates making the world into their great golf course david adler is a writer and a member of diem25 s coordinating collective yanis varoufakis is the co founder of diem25 he is also the former finance minister of greece as 2019 begins we re asking readers to make a new year

without a currency board venezuela s opposition will fail venezuela s currency the bolivar has tanked just take a look at the ugly chart below steve h hanke thanks to the collapse of the bolivar venezuela has earned the dreadful distinction of being the world s only country that is experiencing hyperinflation today its annual inflation rate is 121 583 yr see the accompanying chart by hyperinflation standards that s a relatively mild rate putting venezuela at the 23rd rank out of the world s 58 episodes of hyperinflation what makes venezuela s hyperinflation so brutal is that it has lasted for 27 months only four of the 58 episodes recorded in history have lasted longer prof steve h hanke so it s clear what venezuela s big problem is hyperinflation the first order of business for any new government in venezuela is to slay the hyperinflation dragon this can be done within 24 hours with the introduction of a currency board a currency board issues notes and coins convertible on demand into a foreign anchor currency at a fixed rate of exchange as reserves it holds low risk interest bearing bonds denominated in the anchor currency the reserve levels both floors and ceilings are set by law and are equal to 100 or slightly more of its monetary liabilities so the domestic currency issued via a currency board is nothing more than a clone of its anchor currency a currency board generates profits seigniorage from the difference between the interest it earns on its reserve assets and the expense of maintaining its liabilities by design a currency board unlike a central bank has no discretionary monetary powers and cannot engage in the fiduciary issue of money it has an exchange rate policy the exchange rate is fixed but no monetary policy a currency board s operations are passive and automatic the sole function of a currency board is to exchange the domestic currency it issues for an anchor currency at a fixed rate consequently the quantity of domestic currency in circulation is determined solely by market forces namely the demand for domestic currency a currency board cannot issue credit accordingly a currency board imposes a hard budget constraint and discipline on the government this is an underappreciated feature of currency boards unlike central banks a currency board can t be used as a means to finance government budgets currency boards have existed in about 70 countries and none have failed the first one was installed in the british indian ocean colony of mauritius in 1849 by the 1930s currency boards were widespread among the british colonies in africa asia the caribbean and the pacific islands they have also existed in a number of independent countries and city states such as danzig and singapore one of the more interesting currency boards was installed in north russia on november 11 1918 during the civil war its architect was none other than john maynard keynes who was a british treasury official at the time countries that have employed currency boards have delivered lower inflation rates smaller fiscal deficits lower debt levels relative to the gross domestic product fewer banking crises and higher real growth rates than comparable countries that have employed central banks to smash inflation and establish stability a currency board for venezuela would do the trick indeed that s why i proposed a currency board to venezuela s president rafael caldera when i was his adviser from 1995 96 the details of what i proposed then and now are contained in a book i co authored with kurt schuler juntas monetarias para países en desarrollo dinero inflación y estabilidad económica which was published in a second edition in 2015 by cedice in caracas before proceeding it is important to mention argentina s bout of hyperinflation that peaked in july 1989 particularly since the currency reform that crushed argentina s inflation is universally mischaracterized and misunderstood to put an end to hyperinflation president carlos menem with his right hand man minister of economy domingo cavallo established a new currency regime on april 1 1991 they dubbed it a convertibility system an uncommon term for an unusual system while convertibility gave the superficial appearance of being a currency board it was not a currency board most economists never understood that the convertibility system was not a currency board system like currency board arrangements the convertibility system maintained a fixed exchange rate between the peso and its anchor currency the u s dollar that nominal anchor crushed hyperinflation and prevented inflation from rearing its ugly head indeed the consumer price index at the end of 2001 was about where it was in 1994 by smashing inflation convertibility gave menem the credibility he desperately needed to carry out economic reforms the convertibility system was not trouble free however its deviations from currency board orthodoxy allowed it to behave more like a central bank than a true currency board these deviations were significant and prompted me to pen an op ed argentina should abolish its central bank it was published in the wall street journal on october 25 1991 as i wrote then to lock in the menem cavallo achievements and permanently remove skepticism from the argentine monetary scene argentina should abolish its central bank and replace it with a currency board alas the convertibility system after killing a hyperinflation and ushering in a decade long economic boom met its waterloo in 2001 just as i had anticipated in my 1991 wall street journal piece the banco central de la república argentina bcra used convertibility s deviations from currency board orthodoxy to engage in discretionary monetary policies in the end the bcra did just what it had always done it made a mess out of monetary policy and created a currency crisis i know that currency boards work from among other things a great deal of personal experience in stopping hyperinflations stopping them with the introduction of currency boards one such case was in bulgaria when i served as president petar stoyanov s adviser from 1997 2002 after bulgaria took the exit from communism in 1990 bulgarians encountered some potholes the economy plunged there were debt defaults and that balkan paradise experienced an episode of hyperinflation this episode peaked at an astounding 242 per month in february 1997 yes that s per month with the expectation that a currency board would be the best system to crush bulgaria s hyperinflation i wrote a book with kurt schuler that was translated into bulgarian in late 1996 it reached the top of the best seller list in sofia in january 1997 i became president stoyanov s adviser my primary tasks were to draft a currency board law for bulgaria and to explain to bulgarian politicians and the public how such a system would halt the episode of hyperinflation things moved rapidly there s nothing like a crisis to move the ball down the field the currency board was installed on july 1 1997 and inflation and interest rates plunged immediately i can recall the genuine pleasure perhaps relief too that president stoyanov displayed when he congratulated me on the outstanding results produced during the first few weeks of the currency board it was then that he confessed his hope that the currency board would kill inflation but that he had reservations and he was amazed when it worked even more rapidly than i had predicted much later president stoyanov confided that without the stability created by the currency board system bulgaria would have had much more difficulty entering the north atlantic treaty organization nato in 2004 and the european union in 2007 today venezuela should do exactly what bulgaria did in 1997 a currency board would make the bolivar sound a clone of the u s dollar the world s most important currency with that inflation would be smashed within 24 hours and stability established and while stability might not be everything everything is nothing without stability the political forces behind the introduction of a currency board would be seen as credible in the eyes of venezuelans by amassing a huge stock of political capital for slaying the hyperinflation dragon the politicians who introduce the currency board would be able to then begin to clean up venezuela s other messes but if the politicians fail to kill inflation first there will be no successful reforms that s why a currency board is a vital first step for venezuela by steve h hanke www cato org

chad pearson teaches history at collin college in plano texas and is the author of reform or repression organizing america s anti union movement he delivered shortened versions of this article before members of the department of history at the university of north texas in spring 2014 and at the 2017 u s intellectual history conference in plano texas he would like to thank david anderson l d burnett david cullen steve early rosemary feurer robert justin goldstein dolores janiewski mark a lause john marciano sandra mendiola bryan d palmer paul street elizabeth hayes turner michael d yates and camila valle for their help on this piece the smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion but allow very lively debate within the spectrum noam chomsky studies of american conservatism appear practically everywhere focusing chiefly though not exclusively on the post new deal decades this body of scholarship most of which has been produced by liberal academics has deepened our understanding of republican politicians religious and racist campaigns tax cutting activists in the south west and southwest and the often secretive forces behind the erosion of the nation s social safety net we have learned about business assaults on labor well funded think tanks like the american enterprise cato and hoover institutes and magazines like national review historians have provided us with studies of boogeymen like barry goldwater richard nixon ronald reagan milton friedman james mcgill buchanan and the koch brothers as well as examinations of boogeywomen like ayn rand phyllis schlafly sarah palin and margaret thatcher scholars have written decade specific studies underlining the conservative 1940s 50s 60s 70s and 80s a consensus has evolved around the idea that the last four decades mark the emergence of neoliberalism we have collections of essays primary source readers and history departments offer courses called from roosevelt to reagan and the rise and fall of the new deal order while the explosion of these studies has undoubtedly enriched our understanding of these powerful forces and individuals we are due for critical assessments of these studies from the left 1 this article is one such attempt focusing on some of the blind spots that plague this scholarship and on the arrogant dismissals of class based interpretations of the past over the past few decades these dismissals expressed by some of the profession s most institutionally privileged members have led to a narrowing of discussions and debates by limiting studies to the tensions between liberals and conservatives and by downplaying or ignoring leftist critiques of liberalism this is unfortunate since many of these same gatekeepers have exaggerated the differences between republicans and democrats refusing to acknowledge what establishment liberals and institutional rightists share although there are obvious differences between conservatives and liberals there are also meaningful similarities particularly regarding education financial regulation foreign policy policing trade and labor this article explores the development of this scholarly fad while offering a critical analysis of its writers and boosters these historians distancing themselves from leftist interpretations tell us almost as much about their own moderate values as they do about their subjects illiberal activities in fact they have helped marginalize the histories of class struggle by insisting that we focus our attention on the conflicts between conservatives and liberals rather than between ordinary people and capitalists or between activists and politicians from both mainstream political parties indeed these studies constitute part of a political project designed to draw attention away from establishment liberalism s various shortcomings this piece will mostly focus on these historians and the issue of labor 2 the new left labor and history from the bottom up the uptick in studies of conservatism dating from the early 1990s to the present represent a departure from the more radical historiographical tradition of the 1960s and 70s that was shaped by the social movements of the time the period s radicalism expressed by the antiwar civil rights women s liberation and gay liberation movements as well as by the widespread popularity of marxist study groups helped influence scholarship in two fundamental ways first there was the development of what the late historian jesse lemisch famously called in 1967 history from the bottom up 3 during this politically and intellectually exciting time public and professional historians wrote diverse histories of ordinary people rather than studies about kings presidents and business leaders second recognizing franklin d roosevelt s numerous shortcomings harry s truman s destructive cold war polices john f kennedy s foot dragging on civil rights lyndon b johnson s murderous campaigns in vietnam and the unwillingness of establishment liberals to challenge structural inequality new left scholars were deeply distrustful of the democratic party institutional liberalism and u s capitalist society many leftist historians openly disdained the democratic party viewing it as an enemy of the working classes as activist historian robert brenner put it in 1984 few radicals would have been caught dead inside the democratic party 4 in 1973 historian howard zinn wrote about the democrats tendency to hoodwink the public in postwar america 1945 1971 unlike today s political historians many of whom look favorably on those years by noting the widespread presence of a suburban white middle class high unionization rates and programs like the gi bill zinn focused on the persistence of inequality corporate hegemony and the deceitfulness of institutional liberals roosevelt in one of his boldest speeches had denounced the economic royalists of america yet neither he nor his administration zinn wrote acted to dislodge them from power 5 liberal spokespeople were insincere this was the free society the democratic state the affluent society these were the people of plenty truman spoke of a fair deal kennedy described a new frontier johnson bragged of a great society yet the resources of the richest nation on earth were still irrationally allocated to the production of war goods and luxury goods urgent social needs like housing health care schools were considered secondary in importance 6 others supplemented zinn s analyses with their own the introduction to a 1975 edition of radical america noted that establishment liberals have traditionally stood in the way of a revolutionary working class socialist movement 7 historian mike davis wrote in 1980 that organized labor suffered from a barren marriage with democrats 8 zinn the author of the popular 1980 a people s history of the united states had faith in the working classes not the politicians famously stating that what matters most is not who is sitting in the white house but who is sitting in and who is marching outside the white house pushing for change 9 moreover this generation appreciated the theoretical insights that helped them understand the past as historian linda gordon explained in 1981 frankly i cannot grasp how one can learn to think historically without reading marx 10 many of the new left s most innovative scholars were labor historians interested in exploring what george rawick termed working class self activity 11 rather than focusing on unions as a single entity they investigated the often militant activities of rank and file members while pointing to the bureaucratic tepid red baiting and imperialist tendencies of numerous union leaders labor historians certainly recognized reagan s punitive antiunionism but they were also candid about the periodic bouts of antiunion hostility expressed by democrats furthermore many illustrated the continued unwillingness of labor leaders to mobilize the membership while spotlighting their cushy relationships with democratic and sometimes republican politicians in doing so they offered multiple reasons for labor s failures 12 in the 1970s and 80s university based historians ensured that labor history the study of workplace conflicts as well as of working class life both in and outside of workplaces was firmly planted in the academy few u s labor historians were as influential as david montgomery a former machinist and communist party member over the course of his life montgomery took class struggle seriously as a scholar and activist his books such as beyond equality workers control in america the fall of the house of labor and citizen worker shed considerable light on the richness of working class struggles in a variety of different settings and involving a diverse set of individuals and groups 13 for him class as a category of analysis remained central a point he stressed in the first page of his masterful 1987 the fall of the house of labor it remains not only possible but imperative to analyze the american experience of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in terms of conflicting classes 14 montgomery enjoyed a fruitful academic career securing employment first at the university of pittsburgh and then in the late 1970s at yale as a distinguished professor but he repeatedly demonstrated that he was not a self important historian simply interested in advancing his own career rather during his tenure he spoke at union halls offered history lessons to strikers on picket lines inspired many social justice oriented aspiring professors to study with him and showed considerable amounts of generosity to in the words of henry heller countless other historians who were not his students 15 his impressive contributions to the study of labor and his overall importance to the profession were spelled out clearly in an obituary written by historian eric foner in late 2011 montgomery was one of the most prominent historians in the us and the model of a scholar activist 16 rather than give credit to middle class reformers or state actors for workplace improvements and social reforms rawick montgomery and davis like zinn spotlighted the various solidarity building roles played by workers from below labor activists rather than benevolent politicians were in the forefront of campaigns against excessive forms of managerial surveillance and exploitation in fact montgomery expressed annoyance at mainstream historians and labor leaders for suggesting that franklin d roosevelt changed all that 17 to understand the establishment of labor related new deal reforms he insisted one must acknowledge first and foremost the combative activism of union builders while the federal government under the new deal offered needed protections by lifting the suffocating burden of absolute managerial control from the working lives of americans the state also played a co optive role helping to tame the new unions by subjecting them to tight legal and political control 18 this generation of class conscious leftist scholars stood with ordinary people and their fights never ignoring managerial exploitation state repression or the historic injustice of capitalism 19 montgomery understood clearly what he called in 1979 the awesome power which a company wields over its employees and the coercive authority of government 20 for this generation capitalists their managers and both main political parties that have historically served the interests of big business deserved the primary blame for the problems faced by the diverse working class masses before during and after the years of the new deal if you can t beat em join em privileged academics careerism and the return of history from the top down some of the leading writers and promoters of rise of the right scholarship including former labor historians began distancing themselves from labor history and attacking radical interpretations of the past around the same time they started producing histories of conservatism the cases of princeton university s sean wilentz and georgetown university s michael kazin two scholars who had established their careers as labor historians but now identify as political historians are instructive in the 1990s wilentz the author of a book about new york city s working class became a political historian as well as an enthusiastic supporter and colleague of the clintons 21 in the introduction to his 2008 book on ronald reagan wilentz admitted that his views have ripened over time 22 kazin who left his first major academic mark in 1987 with a study of san francisco trade unions in the progressive era has expressed regret about parts of his past 23 despite claiming to be hard headed marxists kazin wrote in 2013 our analysis of american society was more emotional than rational kazin tells us that he and his comrades were strategically wrongheaded for referring to the police as pigs and for spelling america with three ks 24 kazin has since distanced himself from what he considers an irrational period tarnished by counter productive ultraleftism nevertheless he remains politically active and was partially responsible for launching historians for obama in 2007 these liberal historians of conservatism have responded to writers to their left in one of two ways disregarding them altogether or outright hostile engagement while they generally ignore marxist writers viewing their arguments as more of an annoying distraction than as a set of ideas worth engaging with some marxists including montgomery davis and especially zinn have made too big of a splash to be overlooked 25 all three in kazin s opinion overstated the significance of class in u s history zinn given his popular reach deserved special scorn from these formerly class conscious scholars after zinn s 2010 death wilentz faulted him for writing for a broad audience he s a popularizer and his view of history is topsy turvy turning old villains into heroes and after a while the glow gets unreal 26 in 2004 kazin wrote the first of several articles and speeches criticizing a people s history of the united states calling it simplistic and bad history because zinn in kazin s view exaggerated the power of elites without recognizing the real choices our left ancestors faced and the true pathos and drama of their decisions 27 for kazin the real choices include voting for one of the two mainstream parties zinn may have believed in the capacity of ordinary people to make meaningful changes from below but kazin a former editor of a university of pennsylvania press series publishing books on conservatism criticized him for failing to understand that the most reasonable option for the broad left is voting for the democratic party which he understands as the only political force capable of protecting americans from republican reactionaries if left leaning americans broadly defined elect enough democrats and apply pressure kazin insists that the party will work to solve the nation s race gender diplomatic environmental and class problems short of revolution kazin writes a strategic alliance with one element of the establishment is the only way social movements ever make lasting changes in law and public policy such pragmatism is according to kazin essential given conservatives ruthlessness which zinn supposedly never grasped conservatism itself doesn t even appear in the index 28 younger scholars have joined wilentz and kazin in promoting respect for and the study of mainstream politics princeton university s julian zelizer too young to have been involved in the new left has written that our contemporary historiographical moment shaped partially by studies of conservatism is superior to earlier periods when old fashioned labor historians were drawn to the question why no socialism in america with the implicit assumption that socialism should have happened 29 for the record many if not most labor historians were not focused on this question yet it would be wrong to claim that zelizer s comment signals intellectual laziness instead it likely reflects his desire to promote the study of official politics over the subject of class struggle for example in 2012 zelizer writing with new york university s kim phillips fein observed that policymakers in governmental institutions were unfairly criticized and often overlooked by a generation of class conscious historians they downplayed the ability of government to produce genuine reform and focused instead on grassroots efforts 30 zelizer an editor of a princeton university press political history series wants readers to perceive liberal scholars like him as more sophisticated than the new leftists maintaining that the best scholarship about conservatism has been written by liberals 31 his comments about socialism and the new left generation are primarily designed to delegitimize radical critiques of power relations while highlighting the virtues of more politically moderate scholarship the smug dismissals of labor history and the attacks on radical history more generally play an institutionally policing role that sets clear boundaries between different scholarly trends while simultaneously building liberal scholarship and sustaining its echo chambers the underlying message is rather clear these earlier labor historians hopelessly out of touch radicals were guilty of placing too much emphasis on class struggle and thus failed to acknowledge most americans appreciation for the nation and its institutions particularly its two mainstream political parties most americans according to their assumptions were religious law abiding and patriotic and these historians want their colleagues to recognize in short that the new left is now old and it is not coming back their boundary setting agendas are meant above all to convince fellow scholars to acknowledge that the most meaningful conflicts have taken place in the context of official politics not between antagonistic classes as editors of university press books and journals as well as faculty members at elite universities they enjoy the academic prestige and institutional power to call many of the shots and thus secure political moderation from career oriented junior historians indeed the popularity of scholarship on the rise of the right has coincided with the removal of labor historians from much of the academy the most obvious opponents of labor history are the intellectually incurious university administrators and conservative politicians who have sought to defund or altogether eliminate labor studies departments at public institutions in places such as alabama california indiana iowa massachusetts michigan and missouri 32 there are also less blatant but no less significant opponents departmental research committee members many of whom harbor an uneasiness with the subject of class indeed hiring committees on college campuses consisting mostly of liberal historians have played a critical part by refusing to advertise labor history jobs after the retirement of labor historians some professors even discourage their graduate students from identifying as labor historians through their actions such individuals have essentially helped stigmatize the study of class the contrasts with other areas of study including race gender and political history all important topics are easy to identify 33 but life appears relatively comfortable for the prominent liberal historians of conservatism a number of whom are based in the country s most exclusive and highly priced universities these individuals generally participate in elite and semi elite social and professional circles and are more inclined to hail examples of expertise from above than to praise confrontations from below they have taught us how conservative policies have hurt ordinary people but show no desire to promote movements that are independent of liberal establishment organizations and involve the combative self activity of the working classes against the right or any other oppressive forces instead they write favorably about and in some cases have established relationships with highly educated policymakers and democratic party politicians people who propose so called pragmatic solutions to the world s ills their values are aligned with upper middle class coastal professionals individuals active in liberal and moderate think tanks such as the brookings institution the new america foundation and the council on foreign relations prominent news outlets like the new york times washington post and national public radio and the american federation of labor congress of industrial organizations afl cio leadership 34 some even receive funding from think tanks and mainstream publications 35 the generational contrasts are easy to identify an earlier activist oriented cohort of academics looked to marx today s liberal scholars of conservatism are inspired by john maynard keynes while previous radical scholars denounced capitalism altogether today s liberals and even many leftists focus more narrowly on neoliberalism earlier writers like montgomery highlighted the deradicalizing roles official liberalism had on class conscious workers today s liberal historians see these same policies as empowering this political shift is also reflected in stylistic differences earlier scholars wrote much about struggle and conflict while today s historians prefer words like negotiated and contested while marxists have illustrated the ways in which the ruling classes have established considerable control over both mainstream parties today s liberal scholars generally ignore or downplay the tight relationships between democratic party politicians and capitalists while drawing our attention to stories of labor liberal electoral campaigns carefully managed coalitions led by moderate union and democratic party leaders 36 above all these historians like to tell tidy rise and fall stories that focus on voting behavior official union activities politicians and state institutions while often ignoring or marginalizing the role of radicals these well ordered narratives begin with the progressive era s various reforms and reformers climax with the labor victories of the 1930s and the civil rights triumphs of the 1960s and end dramatically under reagan s presidency a time characterized by tax cuts deregulation and crass union busting furthermore they tend to romanticize earlier periods when unions built coalitions with establishment liberals democrats won elections and politicians enacted progressive policies they celebrate features of the progressive era new deal and great society duke university s nancy maclean author of the best selling democracy in chains the deep history of the radical right s stealth plan for america identifies individuals from the past whom she considers honorable including supreme court justice oliver wendell holmes jr keynes franklin d roosevelt and progressive luminary louis brandeis whom she calls an extraordinary figure because he repeatedly voiced support for democracy transparency and unions 37 these historians see much to applaud in the 1930s and those interested in conservative forms of antiunionism often use this decade as their starting point illustrating the ways reactionaries challenged prolabor new deal policies top down policies that in maclean s words empowered working class americans 38 nelson lichtenstein a labor and political historian with a marxist past wrote in 2013 that the wagner act system looks a lot more attractive today than it did when he criticized it in the 1970s and 80s 39 and while these scholars are honest about the postwar era s gender and racial shortcomings many nevertheless find virtue in the job security and prosperity that numerous americans experienced before the neoliberal onslaught gutted thousands of factories and decimated once prosperous cities 40 like donald trump liberal scholars of conservatism yearn for a time when america was great 41 but they are usually vague about precisely how america s so called greatness emerged although most look approvingly at the role of unions and acknowledge labor s part in establishing good wages for industrial workers many fail properly to describe the bitter and militant struggles involved in building unions the role of far left groups in organizing campaigns and the state repression that frequently characterized picket line confrontations perhaps this is because many liberals fetishize nonviolent protests and find details of tire slashing window smashing and skull cracking unpleasant but such events were often necessary to win union recognition and labor battles even decades after the passage of ostensibly pro union developments like the wagner act 42 while franklin roosevelt may have liked the idea of responsible labor leaders engaging in give and take bargaining with management these historians typically deemphasize his discomfort with labor militancy and his disdain for radicalism in fact they have told us more about roosevelt s support for the wagner and fair labor standards acts than for example about his indifference to the police murders of steelworkers in chicago in 1937 or his embrace of the smith act the 1940 law named after congressman howard smith that helped destroy leftist unions including minneapolis s trotskyist teamsters responsible for the successful 1934 general strikes in that city 43 maclean has written about smith s opposition to numerous progressive polices but neglects the smith act a glaring omission 44 perhaps she made this decision because like others she wants us to consider roosevelt a champion of the working class instead of someone responsible for helping bosses ensure labor subordination while establishing capitalist stabilization roosevelt s smith act authorization like his second world war demand for a no strike pledge and his involvement in the internment of thousands of japanese americans was also an example of placing democracy in chains the near erasure of independent working class radicalism that is mostly leftist activists of various stripes who mobilized outside of official labor liberal coalitions from so much scholarship has led some historians of conservatism to mischaracterize the left take for example benjamin waterhouse a historian of business and conservatism in his 2013 book lobbying america the politics of business from nixon to nafta which was published as part of a princeton university press series partially edited by zelizer waterhouse refers to free trade opponents as the far left on the far left of the spectrum waterhouse writes some labor and public interest groups called for reciprocal tariffs trade quotas and other measures frequently demonized by opponents as protectionist 45 it is doubtful that afl cio officials a handsomely compensated group far more willing to deliver speeches announcing their desire to defend middle class america than actually to encourage militant mobilizations of rank and file members ever saw themselves in this way but waterhouse like more senior historians appears to have no interest in exploring the ideas of the true far left who are anticapitalists not merely anti free traders it appears that for him the left s limitations extend only to the liberal lobbyists who call for government regulatory programs not to those who champion the end of capitalism itself when we consider that radical interpretations of labor and politics used to be commonplace it is astonishing to see how far the left has been pushed back in the historical memory numerous like minded political historians remain interested in antiunionism but while earlier writers examined the reactionary activities of republicans liberalism s limits and the missteps and tepidity that characterized the actions of numerous union leaders many current scholars focus almost exclusively on one explanation for the failures of organized labor over the past several decades the rise of right wing forces and of course the pushback from employers we cannot ignore or deny these forces but if that is the most significant answer given by liberal writers how do they make sense of the many union failures that have occurred under democratic leaders in the introduction to their 2012 edited collection the right and labor lichtenstein and elizabeth tandy shermer express disappointment that barack obama the union friendly politician did not secure the passage of the employee free choice act efca which would have made union organizing easier revealingly they fail to mention that obama enjoying democratic majorities in both houses during his first two years in office hardly even discussed the efca they say simply that its passage was not to be they argue that conservatives sidelined it although they say nothing of obama and his congressional allies unexerted agency of course making this point would have undermined one of their cherished assumptions namely that the democrats are flawed labor allies not outright adversaries 46 after eight years of obama what progressive policies can we celebrate many liberal scholars of conservatism had hoped for a new new deal which we obviously did not get 47 the labor movement saw little in return for the dues money it invested in obama s 2008 campaign as union density continued to fall under his presidency and the number of antiunion right to work states increased there are currently twenty eight right to work states including several that were traditionally union strongholds obama had promised to wear walking shoes and join picket lines during protests but was missing in action when unions mobilized against attacks by bosses and republican legislators in indiana michigan and wisconsin yet obama managed to spend a lot of time with his obscenely rich wall street friends protecting them from any sort of punishment for launching a corporate crime wave immigrants muslims and journalists were less fortunate obama oversaw more deportations than any previous president bombed seven countries during his final year in office and cracked down on whistleblowers obama defenders including scholars of conservatism often point to the affordable care act as a worthy accomplishment even though it was based on a health care model first hatched by the conservative heritage foundation and secretly written by former health care industry lobbyists 48 the deep history of liberal antiunionism the liberal establishment s indifference to the plight of labor is not surprising if we look honestly at the deep politically flexible history of antiunionism the various narratives on the rise and fall of the new deal lack the explanatory power to account for antiunionism s depth and elasticity the antiunion open shop movement emerged in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries this powerful movement consisted of sizable numbers of self identified liberals powerful people in and outside of industrial relations settings who frequently proclaimed their willingness to protect the rights of unionists and nonunionists an unsustainable position because it undermines the practice of working class solidarity nobody was more important than theodore roosevelt who liberal leaning historians insist was prolabor 49 briefly roosevelt had established a commission to respond to the massive coal strike in northeastern pennsylvania in 1902 its final report legitimized the open shop principle which roosevelt called the square deal since it supposedly protected the rights of unionists business owners consumers and scabs many employers inspired by this outcome formed numerous square deal associations after the report s release and the citizens industrial association of america the biggest employers association named their monthly publication the square deal employers associations from the progressive era to the new deal years celebrated roosevelt s pro open shop square deal 50 theodore roosevelt was joined by other well known reformers mainstream figures like journalist ray stannard baker holmes jr brandeis and u s senator robert l owen best known for the 1916 keating owen child labor law supported union breaking campaigns in the early twentieth century 51 indeed none of the period s elite reformers endorsed the core ingredients necessary for a healthy labor movement militancy solidarity and independence from capitalist political parties while maclean and others want us to remember brandeis as an advocate of business and political transparency as well as a union supporter he hardly practiced what he preached he spent much of the progressive era representing several highly secretive antiunion associations 52 additionally many employers in the vanguard of anti labor union activities were civil war veterans and proudly cited abraham lincoln and his defense of free labor over slavery during workplace disputes 53 these details are usually absent from the trendiest studies of the rise of the right which ordinarily begin after the new deal and contend that antiunion ideas and actions emerged as part of a right wing movement the reality however is more complex a return to radicalism recently a growing number of leftist scholars have offered much needed critiques of establishment liberalism and in the process have shown the limitations of focusing largely on the republican party and its ideological backers this is true of historians of both domestic and foreign affairs scholars of race for instance have done excellent work in highlighting the ways liberals such as lyndon b johnson and bill clinton have aggressively promoted the politics of law and order and thus helped set the stage for the nation s excessively high incarceration rate which disproportionately punishes african americans and latinos 54 others have taught us much about the deceitful roles establishment liberals have played in selling u s wars under the banner of humanitarian intervention 55 indeed those seeking an honest account of the rise of the carceral state and the vicious nature of u s imperialism must grapple with the repressive actions of both conservatives and institutional liberals class conscious historians have honored the tradition of writing the type of radical working class history fought for by lemisch rawick montgomery zinn and others by producing their own multidimensional studies of labor militancy this has been true for postwar scholars some of whom have taught us about the deradicalizing and solidarity breaking nature of the national labor relations board while pointing to the emancipatory potential of confrontational rank and file activism on the local national and even international levels 56 and in the aftermath of the occupy wall street movement in 2011 several writers have produced scholarship that identifies the key source of our problems the 1 percent which maintains the dominant influence on politicians from both parties including chicago s labor hating democratic mayor rahm emanuel 57 these are encouraging developments as most democratic party politicians of all levels continue to disappoint by prioritizing the interests of the 1 percent over the working class majority new generations of scholar activists will discover the enduring value of applying a class analysis to the past and the usefulness of spotlighting the structural ills of capitalism itself how much influence these more critical monographs will have on the public s understanding of the past remains a question yet at this point we can safely say that this more radical scholarship has not caught up with the rapid pace of scholarly output about the various dimensions of conservatism indeed there is a long history of right wing activism and powerful conservative forces that are clearly different from mainstream liberalism it is important that we know about the activities of the koch brothers the american legislative exchange council the chicago school of economics and countless think tanks as detailed in books and articles written by liberal historians yet it seems that the ex leftists behind some of this scholarship who routinely display irritation at the latest reactionary outrage while remaining mostly silent about the comprehensive threats posed by both parties and capitalism itself are somehow compensating for their own shifts to the right whatever the case we should not allow them or their followers to bamboozle us into believing that the democrats somehow offer genuine solutions to our problems the democratic party and its salaried accomplices in think tanks journalism and academia share the blame with employers and republicans for the labor movement s decline extreme class inequality and the country s persistent poverty what zinn davis montgomery and many lesser known radicals stated in the 1960s 70s and 80s about institutional liberals protecting ruling class interests at the expense of workers was true then and remains true today fortunately many of today s scholar activists reinforcing the sharp insights of those from the new left generation recognize that we cannot simply criticize the rightists indeed we must take their words seriously and reject the bar lowering goals set by today s historians of conservatism notes

that have lasted longer alas the word hyperinflation is thrown around carelessly and misused frequently in the press indeed the debasement of language in the popular press has gone to such lengths that the word hyperinflation has almost lost its meaning so just what is the definition of this oft misused word the convention adopted in the scientific literature is to classify an inflation as a

washington feb 2 us job growth surged in january with employers hiring the most workers in 11 months pointing to underlying strength in the economy despite an uncertain outlook that has left the federal reserve wary about more interest rate hikes this year advertisement the labor department said its closely watched monthly employment report yesterday showed no discernible impact on job growth from a 35 day partial government shutdown while acknowledging it was unable to quantify the effect on private industry but the longest shutdown in history which ended a week ago pushed up the unemployment rate to a seven month high of 4 0 per cent the report came two days after the fed signaled its three year interest rate hike campaign might be ending because of rising headwinds to the economy including financial market volatility and softening global growth the brisk pace of hiring suggested still strong momentum in the economy a theme that was also underscored by a separate report showing a pickup in manufacturing activity in january wage gains however slowed pointing to tame inflation advertisement the fed chickened out on further rate hikes this year and boy are they ever misreading the tea leaves on where the economy is going next said chris rupkey chief economist at mufg in new york us companies have not let up one bit on their hiring in response to risks out there in the world economy nonfarm payrolls jumped by 304 000 jobs last month the largest gain since february 2018 the labor department said job growth was boosted by hiring at construction sites retailers and business services as well as at restaurants hotels and amusement parks the economy however added 70 000 fewer jobs than previously reported in november and december economists polled by reuters had forecast payrolls increasing by only 165 000 jobs in january roughly 100 000 per month are needed to keep up with growth in the working age population advertisement january marked a record 100 straight months of job gains the government shutdown saw about 380 000 workers furloughed but president donald trump signed a law guaranteeing these employees back pay as a result these workers were included in the survey of employers from which the payrolls number is calculated the furloughed workers were however considered unemployed on temporary layoff in the separate survey of households from which the jobless rate is derived this lifted the unemployment rate one tenth of a percentage point from 3 9 per cent in december the shutdown ended last friday after trump and congress agreed to temporary government funding without money for his us mexico border wall average hourly earnings rose three cents or 0 1 per cent in january after accelerating 0 4 per cent in december that lowered the annual increase in wages to 3 2 per cent from 3 3 per cent in december giving the employment report a goldilocks feel the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies as traders focused on the tepid monthly wage gain stocks on wall street rose while us treasury prices fell backward looking the fed on wednesday kept interest rates steady but said it would be patient in raising borrowing costs further this year the us central bank removed language from its december policy statement that risks to the outlook were roughly balanced st louis fed president james bullard yesterday defended the central bank s policy stance telling cnbc that the jobs numbers were backward looking and dallas fed chief robert kaplan called the payrolls report noisy pointing to a sharp rise in part time jobs a broader measure of unemployment which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part time because they cannot find full time employment jumped to an 11 month high of 8 1 per cent in january from 7 6 per cent in december it was boosted by a 500 000 increase in the number of people working part time likely because of the government shutdown the labour force participation rate or the proportion of working age americans who have a job or are looking for one rose to a more than five year high of 63 2 per cent with key data from the commerce department including the fourth quarter gross domestic product report still delayed because of the government shutdown the employment report is the clearest sign that the economy remains on solid ground other data yesterday showed factory activity rebounding in january with new orders rising strongly but consumer sentiment dropped to a more than two year low a reminder of the uncertainty over the economic expansion now in its ninth year and the second longest on record washington s trade war with beijing is the biggest headwind to the economy which will also have to deal with diminishing fiscal stimulus and weakening growth in china and europe as well as the risk of a disorderly departure by britain from the european union it s highly likely that an economic slowdown will occur in 2019 said sung won sohn chief economist at ss economics in los angeles the question is by how much annual revisions to payroll data showed the level of employment in march of last year was 1 000 lower on a seasonally adjusted basis than had been reported the government also incorporated new population estimates which had no impact on the unemployment and labor force participation rates employment at construction sites surged 52 000 the most since february 2018 after increasing 28 000 in december hiring was likely boosted by mild temperatures in january manufacturing payrolls increased by 13 000 slowing from december s 20 000 increase employment in the leisure and hospitality sector jumped by 74 000 retail payrolls rebounded by 20 800 jobs professional and business services employment increased by 30 000 jobs last month the government added 8 000 jobs last month there were increases in healthcare transportation and warehousing employment as well as financial activities but utilities and information payrolls fell in january the average workweek was unchanged at 34 5 hours in january reuters
introduction it is a pleasure to be here in toronto today and i d like to thank the toronto region board of trade for the invitation in many ways 2019 has gotten off to a challenging start what s happening in the housing market here at home lower oil prices the trade conflict between the united states and china and brexit are top of mind for all of us canadians will be more confident facing these challenges if they feel secure in their jobs this is vital to your bottom lines as business people without secure good paying work sooner or later demand for your products and services will suffer for central bankers like me the job market is a bellwether of financial health and a useful gauge of inflation pressures and by many measures the labour market in canada is in good shape the unemployment rate is at its lowest level in records going back more than 40 years firms across the country tell us that it s difficult to fill openings i suspect many employers here in toronto can relate these are signs of labour market strength certainly many are benefiting from the positive overall environment not everyone is though recent layoffs in the auto sector have touched many families in this region and there have been layoffs and closures elsewhere in the country moreover wages overall in canada are not rising as fast as we would expect given how low unemployment is today i will look under the hood of the canadian labour market to answer a few important questions how well is the job market really doing if firms are finding it so tough to fill jobs why don t they just offer higher wages what structural factors could weigh on wage growth going forward the answers to these questions will help the bank find the right path for interest rates to meet our inflation objective they will also help businesses and governments develop strategies to boost canada s prosperity over the longer term so how well is the job market really doing let s start with a few basic facts last year the economy added a net 163 000 jobs all full time positions the unemployment rate fell to 5 6 per cent a historic low the participation rate for prime age workers those aged 25 to 54 is around 87 per cent near its all time high if that sounds positive it s because it is however it raises the question for the bank of canada of whether the job market is at a point where inflation pressures are starting to build if you use the trend or natural rate of unemployment as a guide that s the rate that puts neither upward nor downward pressure on inflation then at first glance the answer could be yes that s because our most recent staff analysis puts canada s trend or natural rate of unemployment in the range of 5½ to 6½ per cent however i think this conclusion would be too hasty the natural rate of unemployment is like dark matter in physics estimates are subject to great uncertainty perhaps even more so than with other useful economic concepts like potential output they also move around as the structure of the economy changes the natural rate of unemployment in canada was estimated to be around 9 per cent during the 1990s it was brought down in large part by labour market reforms although estimates in real time only captured these changes with a lag this uncertainty means that it is imperative to look beyond such measures of full or maximum employment toward other indicators of labour market slack in this instance the bank has pointed to relatively subdued wage growth as a possible sign that the job market may have more room to run economic theory tells us that when the actual jobless rate is at the natural rate an economy is essentially at full employment at that point we would expect wages to be rising at the same pace as the target inflation rate plus the trend rate of productivity growth this is because the strongest underlying factors that determine worker pay in real terms are how productive workers are and their value to an employer s production process so for canada this implies wage growth of around 3 per cent 2 per cent for inflation and 1 per cent for trend productivity growth wage growth has picked up considerably to average about 2½ per cent in 2018 compared with 2 per cent over the past five years but we are still shy of what one would expect in a tight labour market the story is similar in the united states the us jobless rate has been below 4 per cent for a while this is much lower than the estimate of the us natural rate currently pegged at around 4½ per cent yet wage gains only recently reached the sum of inflation and productivity growth in canada regional and sectoral factors can explain a lot of why wage growth has been tame the steep drop in oil prices that occurred in the second half of 2014 had an impact that rippled across canada and is still being felt wage gains in energy intensive regions continue to lag behind those in the rest of the country to give you a sense of how big a deal this is wage growth in the third quarter of 2018 was just under 2 per cent in alberta saskatchewan and newfoundland and labrador it was about three quarters of a percentage point higher in ontario and quebec so closer to the 3 per cent one would expect that divergence makes sense when you consider that investment and jobs in energy intensive regions respond to oil prices in fact there was a massive increase in employment in these regions from 2000 to the end of 2014 and they led wage growth with much lower oil prices since 2015 employment in the oil and gas sector has fallen by about 20 per cent that is about 30 000 jobs other goods producing sectors such as manufacturing and agriculture are also becoming less prominent employers instead a range of service sectors have contributed to job growth in exactly the places you would expect given longer term trends digitalization has led to a burst of jobs in computer system design up by around 40 per cent over the past five years there has also been a boom in health related jobs particularly elder care almost all the jobs created in services have been full time and about two thirds have been in industries that pay higher than average wages over the past year service sector wage gains were much stronger than those in the goods sectors yet even after accounting for these regional and sectoral factors wage growth overall is still a bit short of what one would expect at this stage this is particularly puzzling when you consider what businesses are telling us about how hard it is to fill jobs firms in our latest business outlook survey reported one of the highest levels of labour shortages since the great recession and job vacancies continue to rise now totalling about 550 000 why aren t labour shortages driving up wages if the right workers are so hard to attract why not simply offer more money many firms are doing just that however other factors must be holding back wages or the national numbers would be higher as far as i can tell no one has found a smoking gun but there are at least a couple of compelling suspects the first is that it might be difficult to find the right person for the job attracting the right talent is rarely just about money i can tell you in my business it is not easy to find all the specialized talent the bank needs estimates suggest that about 1 out of every 10 jobs in canada is affected by mismatches between the skills that the job requires and the skills that workers actually have the sectors with skills shortages are no surprise health care and the digital economy top the list meanwhile sectors like manufacturing and natural resources have a surplus of people with the required skills the second suspect is a sense of caution people may be reluctant to search for a better job even if they would like one the data bear this out turnover in the canadian job market a process known as job churn is relatively low these days higher churn usually means higher wages because the people willing to change jobs to trade up typically drive wage gains in the economy job churn is especially sluggish in oil producing provinces where wage gains have been most restrained as a comparison job churn in the united states has recovered more quickly in part because the oil price shock was positive for the us expansion that churn has supported us wage growth another suspect is geography canada is a beautiful country but its sheer size does not help the data show that canadians have become more open over the past few decades to relocating for new opportunities still it is no small thing to pull up stakes and move to a new city or province often far from friends and family if you are fortunate enough to find a job that is a good match for your skills and ambition you still have to ask yourself will housing be affordable will the commute be a nightmare will my partner be able to find meaningful employment too i ll bet a few people in this room have had prize candidates slip away once they realized that they could not afford greater toronto area housing prices or were not keen to spend hours commuting to work every day if they lived further out as the expansion continues history tells us that job churn will pick up as employment continues to grow this should lead to more employers finding it necessary and worth their while to offer higher wages what structural factors could weigh on wage growth going forward all that said some forces that have been weighing on wage growth are structural and therefore are likely to persist in fact these forces are not unique to canada they are being felt in many advanced economies how innovation is playing out in the global economy is at the centre technological advances have lowered demand for many types of routine jobs both cognitive and manual in all advanced economies including canada these losses have been more than offset by jobs in other sectors that are experiencing stronger employment and wage growth high tech workers are the most obvious example at the same time more and more workers have to compete for jobs with people around the world as firms work to stay competitive in global markets another effect of the most recent wave of innovation is the rise of superstar firms that are making the competitive landscape more challenging while issues around market power are hardly new control of valuable consumer data and of electronic platforms can act as modern impediments to competition when a few firms dominate an industry or a firm becomes the only major employer in town workers have little choice but to stay in their jobs regardless of wages or other labour conditions consequently those firms may feel less pressure to raise wages for many of their workers even as the job market tightens it is not just digital firms concentration is growing across many industries in some countries including canada and the united states because workers wages have not kept pace with gains in productivity over the last few decades their share of income has fallen particularly in the united states but also in canada the relationship between employers and workers has also changed we know that employers are making greater use of employment agencies and short term contractors to replace salaried employees unionization rates in the private sector are down and we hear from labour market experts that this has changed the social contract between companies and their workers the gig economy has also created a new set of jobs in canada and elsewhere that reduces the bargaining power of workers as well these non standard jobs may have advantages such as the ability to work as needed uber drivers come to mind but many workers in these jobs indicate that they would prefer more stability a recent bank survey of canadians found that roughly one third of respondents were participating in some form of non standard or gig employment for many it was as a side job to top up income these workers were more likely to be young and to live in provinces where jobless rates are historically high by our count the number of people in canada doing non standard work because of weak economic conditions who would rather be doing something more formal is equivalent to about 700 000 full time positions to be sure monetary policy can do little to directly influence structural issues affecting the labour market and the wider economy my job is to keep inflation low and stable so that people like you in the business community can operate in a predictable environment that supports sustainable economic growth that said there is considerable scope for other public policies and for businesses to enhance the long term prosperity of workers your customer base and by extension the economy we all recognize the importance of investing heavily in the right skills for the digital economy and for other growing sectors like elder care services while governments may be on the front lines businesses need to play a stronger role in partnering with schools and universities we want more students to gain pertinent experience and to develop the working relationships that foster entrepreneurship this has been happening for years for instance about two thirds of university of waterloo students are in co op placements with firms across canada other schools such as carleton university are expanding their links to locally based tech industry leaders and it does not stop once you have made the hire more businesses need to invest in their employees throughout their careers many tell us that is exactly what they are doing through intensive in house training what is less prominent in discussions on how to improve the job market is supporting worker mobility this would help businesses attract the right people for the job affordable housing is front and centre it is to a large extent an issue of supply then there is the issue of transportation infrastructure in major job markets and supporting mobility also includes removing barriers to interprovincial trade finally let s not forget that the competitiveness of canadian businesses is at the foundation of a robust job market the tax changes made by the federal government last autumn are a positive step in this regard and should lead to more investment in capacity and productivity higher productivity would make it easier for wages to rise faster without increasing inflation pressures strategies geared to developing and adopting new technologies in a digital and data driven economy across all sectors will also be critical to our economic potential conclusion it is time to wrap up despite a challenging start to the year the labour market in canada is in a solid place overall it is worth looking under the hood of the job market to better understand emerging inflation pressures and what strategies might add to canada s prosperity some of the weakness in wage growth can be explained by continued adjustment in energy intensive regions to lower oil prices there are also some structural factors both inside and outside canada that may continue to weigh on overall wage growth that said we also need to be mindful of stronger wage gains and signs of labour shortages in other parts of the economy monetary policy must be forward looking as you know from our latest outlook published a couple of weeks ago the recent weakness in oil prices and softness in housing mean that we expect growth to slow temporarily we expect the economic expansion to pick up again after this detour in the second quarter of 2019 this should lead to a pickup in wage growth as well there are risks on both sides of this outlook so we will continue to pay close attention to wages and to other developments that are driving our projection for inflation this includes how oil prices the canadian housing market and global trade policy evolve rest assured that the bank of canada will do its part to meet our inflation objective and as i ve just discussed businesses and governments can help build an even more vibrant job market by investing in education and training encouraging labour mobility and improving the competitiveness of canadian companies i would like to thank eric santor rhys mendes and michael francis for their help in preparing this speech
by lucia mutikani washington reuters u s job growth surged in january with employers hiring the most workers in 11 months pointing to underlying strength in the economy despite an uncertain outlook that has left the federal reserve wary about more interest rate hikes this year the labor department said its closely watched monthly employment report on friday showed no discernible impact on job growth from a 35 day partial government shutdown while acknowledging it was unable to quantify the effect on private industry but the longest shutdown in history which ended a week ago pushed up the unemployment rate to a seven month high of 4 0 percent the report came two days after the fed signaled its three year interest rate hike campaign might be ending because of rising headwinds to the economy including financial market volatility and softening global growth the brisk pace of hiring suggested still strong momentum in the economy a theme that was also underscored by a separate report showing a pickup in manufacturing activity in january wage gains however slowed pointing to tame inflation the fed chickened out on further rate hikes this year and boy are they ever misreading the tea leaves on where the economy is going next said chris rupkey chief economist at mufg in new york u s companies have not let up one bit on their hiring in response to risks out there in the world economy nonfarm payrolls jumped by 304 000 jobs last month the largest gain since february 2018 the labor department said job growth was boosted by hiring at construction sites retailers and business services as well as at restaurants hotels and amusement parks the economy however added 70 000 fewer jobs than previously reported in november and december economists polled by reuters had forecast payrolls increasing by only 165 000 jobs in january roughly 100 000 per month are needed to keep up with growth in the working age population january marked a record 100 straight months of job gains the government shutdown saw about 380 000 workers furloughed but president donald trump signed a law guaranteeing these employees back pay as a result these workers were included in the survey of employers from which the payrolls number is calculated the furloughed workers were however considered unemployed on temporary layoff in the separate survey of households from which the jobless rate is derived this lifted the unemployment rate one tenth of a percentage point from 3 9 percent in december the shutdown ended last friday after trump and congress agreed to temporary government funding without money for his u s mexico border wall average hourly earnings rose three cents or 0 1 percent in january after accelerating 0 4 percent in december that lowered the annual increase in wages to 3 2 percent from 3 3 percent in december giving the employment report a goldilocks feel the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies as traders focused on the tepid monthly wage gain stocks on wall street rose while u s treasury prices fell backward looking the fed on wednesday kept interest rates steady but said it would be patient in raising borrowing costs further this year the u s central bank removed language from its december policy statement that risks to the outlook were roughly balanced st louis fed president james bullard on friday defended the central bank s policy stance telling cnbc that the jobs numbers were backward looking and dallas fed chief robert kaplan called the payrolls report noisy pointing to a sharp rise in part time jobs a broader measure of unemployment which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part time because they cannot find full time employment jumped to an 11 month high of 8 1 percent in january from 7 6 percent in december it was boosted by a 500 000 increase in the number of people working part time likely because of the government shutdown the labor force participation rate or the proportion of working age americans who have a job or are looking for one rose to a more than five year high of 63 2 percent struggling for hours with key data from the commerce department including the fourth quarter gross domestic product report still delayed because of the government shutdown the employment report is the clearest sign that the economy remains on solid ground other data on friday showed factory activity rebounding in january with new orders rising strongly but consumer sentiment dropped to a more than two year low a reminder of the uncertainty over the economic expansion now in its ninth year and the second longest on record washington s trade war with beijing is the biggest headwind to the economy which will also have to deal with diminishing fiscal stimulus and weakening growth in china and europe as well as the risk of a disorderly departure by britain from the european union it s highly likely that an economic slowdown will occur in 2019 said sung won sohn chief economist at ss economics in los angeles the question is by how much annual revisions to payroll data showed the level of employment in march of last year was 1 000 lower on a seasonally adjusted basis than had been reported the government also incorporated new population estimates which had no impact on the unemployment and labor force participation rates employment at construction sites surged 52 000 the most since february 2018 after increasing 28 000 in december hiring was likely boosted by mild temperatures in january manufacturing payrolls increased by 13 000 slowing from december s 20 000 increase employment in the leisure and hospitality sector jumped by 74 000 retail payrolls rebounded by 20 800 jobs professional and business services employment increased by 30 000 jobs last month the government added 8 000 jobs last month there were increases in healthcare transportation and warehousing employment as well as financial activities but utilities and information payrolls fell in january the average workweek was unchanged at 34 5 hours in january reporting by lucia mutikani editing by andrea ricci
who pharma gates government who s calling the shots by barbara loe fisher national vaccine information center on jan 16 2019 the world health organization who issued a report ranking vaccine hesitancy as one of the top ten threats to global health in 2019 alongside air pollution and climate change noncommunicable diseases global influenza pandemic antimicrobial resistance and infectious diseases such as ebola dengue fever and hiv 1 throughout history the greatest contributors to disease and early death in human populations have been poverty poor sanitation and poor nutrition 2 3 4 yet infectious diseases with pharmaceutical solutions dominated this list and there was no mention of the major opioid addiction crisis crippling and killing tens of thousands of people in the u s and europe 5 6 or the iatrogenic medical error epidemic that every year claims more than 750 000 lives in europe 7 and 250 000 lives in the u s where it is the third leading cause of death 8 the immediate mainstream media response to the who s announcement was to focus on vaccine hesitancy on jan 19 the editorial board of the new york times declared that anti vaxxers are the enemy and called on the u s government to get tough by waging a bold and aggressive pro vaccine campaign that includes tightening restrictions around how much leeway states can grant families that want to skip essential vaccines 9 by jan 23 the hill announced that washington state had declared a state of emergency because of 23 cases of measles reported in an anti vaccination community near portland oregon 10 and there was a public call in the uk for social media platforms to clamp down on fake news and censor misleading information and negative messaging around vaccination 11 12 the new york times editorial headline how to inoculate against anti vaxxers was a theme repeated in articles reacting to the who s suggestion that people wanting to make informed voluntary decisions about vaccination are a global menace one doctor suggested that parents who don t vaccinate their children are selfish it s a matter of i don t care about other people in the community i only care about the health and welfare of my own child 13 there was no discussion about institutionally acknowledged gaps in vaccine safety science 14 15 or the fact that most parents dutifully follow the advice of pediatricians and public health officials and only became vaccine safety critics after the risks of vaccination for their children turned out to be 100 percent 16 17 no discussion about the fact that since 2011 pharmaceutical companies have no liability for injuries and deaths caused by government recommended and mandated vaccines they sell in the u s 18 instead parents of vaccine injured children and others concerned about vaccine safety who for decades have been asking government and industry to produce better quality vaccine science and more humane vaccine policies that respect genetic and biological diversity were stereotyped as anti vaxxers and demonized as a threat to public health the editorial board of the new york times explained it s no mystery how we got here on the internet anti vaccine propaganda has outpaced pro vaccine public health information authoritatively the board its editor and the publisher of the new york times stated that scientists especially are uncomfortable with black and white statements because science is all about nuance but in the case of vaccines there are some hard truths that deserve to be trumpeted vaccines are not toxic and they do not cause autism full stop there was no discussion about why people are legitimately concerned about vaccine ingredients 19 and pharma paying the food and drug administration fda to fast track new vaccines to licensure without adequate testing 20 no discussion about the fact that doctors are giving children 69 doses of 16 vaccines starting on the day of birth 21 three times as many vaccinations as they got in 1983 22 and cannot explain why so many highly vaccinated children in the u s are sicker not healthier today 1 child in 6 learning disabled 23 and 1 in 40 with autism 24 and millions more suffering with asthma diabetes severe allergies epilepsy cancer schizophrenia depression and other chronic disease marked by chronic inflammation in the body the cdc states that 90 percent of the 3 3 trillion in annual health care expenditures are for people with chronic and mental health conditions 25 the largely unexplained chronic disease and disability epidemic in the u s is bankrupting the u s health care system and there is no research being funded to investigate the role that ever increasing numbers of vaccines given to infants children and adults may be playing multi national pharmaceutical corporations 26 27 in command of a global 34 billion dollar vaccine market 28 29 are holding billion dollar contracts with mass communication companies 30 and public private partnerships with governments to purchase vaccines and create vaccine marketing campaigns 31 32 33 34 that dwarf the relatively small number of websites and blogs labeled anti vax simply for criticizing vaccine science and government policy 35 yet there is no recognition by mainstream media articles of the fact that wealthy corporations and philanthropic foundations with political agendas 36 37 well paid medical doctors 38 39 40 and government health officials in charge of operating the vaccine system 41 are in privileged positions of power with a distinct advantage over ordinary people subjected to vaccine laws that place an unequal risk burden on individuals with genetic and biological susceptibility to suffering harm from vaccination 42 43 bio populism blamed for vaccine hesitancy in europe in the uk the economist published an article entitled the campaign against vaccination in which an anonymous author declared across europe the rise of populism is damaging public health a common feature is skepticism of vaccines 44 pointing to italy austria and france as hotbeds of political support for parental choice about vaccination the author attempted to politically tie growing public support for vaccine choice to a fear of migrants and coined a new term bio populism it is increasingly clear that europe s populists want for the body what they want for the nation purity unity and self governance populist health policies mean citizens being free from outside influences whether vaccines devised by doctors regulations invented by politicians or diseases supposedly carried by migrants and in control of their own epidemiology he or she went on to explain that bio populism is a combination of me first libertarianism and anti expertise herd mentality quoting italian medical professor dr roberto burioni who has stated authoritatively that vaccines are not an opinion and offered an explanation for why science can t be democratic the economist article ended with a warning that at least one pandemic will probably sweep the interconnected world in the next decade viruses after all know no borders there was no discussion of the fact that most parents and physicians calling for better quality vaccine science and informed consent protections in vaccine laws are ideologically diverse and do not all identify with one particular political party in fact a 2015 pew research center survey revealed that age and parenthood had more to do with vaccine hesitancy with young adults and parents with children under age 18 being less supportive of mandatory vaccination 45 vaccines autism erosion of trust in drug companies doctors in the u s live science trumpeted anti vaccine movement joins ebola drug resistance on list of top global threats 46 a doctor at johns hopkins center for health security was quoted as saying the reason that noncommunicable diseases and not infectious diseases made the who s top ten global threat list is a testament to how powerful vaccines are pointing to the jubilant public response to the release of polio vaccine in the 1950s he commented we need to get back to that era when vaccines were celebrated the way a new iphone is the headline people magazine chose was world health organization names anti vaxxers as a top threat to global health in 2019 47 at the beginning of the article the following statement appeared there is no scientific link between vaccines and autism according to the centers for disease control it ended with the statement to tackle the rising levels of vaccine hesitancy who plans to push forward with the goal of eliminating cervical cancer with greater application of hpv vaccine u s news world report ran this headline who anti vaccine movement a top threat in 2019 48 that author stated so called anti vaxxers refuse the required shots for their children on religious or philosophical grounds an increase in unvaccinated children has in part been tied to the medically discredited belief that vaccines cause autism spectrum disorder pointing out that a recent u s survey found that public trust in vaccination is on the decline she added the heightened mistrust researchers said was especially prevalent in small pockets of people in insular communities or like minded communities online pacific standard asked are anti vaxxers a major health threat the world health organization says yes 49 this article included a quote from a pediatrician the ongoing erosion of trust in the medical establishment as a whole is also to blame as frequent reports of dubious financial relationships between physicians professional medical societies and the pharmaceutical industry leave many questioning whether or not physicians can be trusted unsure of what to do and whom to listen to many seek answers to their questions elsewhere or simply rely on their gut feeling salon created the most sensational headline that asked the foreboding question the anti vaxxocalypse what happens to humanity if vaccine hesitancy continues 50 the author explained to readers in other words the anti vaccination movement which has inspired many in first world countries to refuse or hesitate vaccination for easily preventable diseases is now a threat to global health and ergo stability the exaggerated response to the who announcement by corporations owning mainstream media outlets has been curiously uniform often using identical talking points perspective from parents and physicians in the u s and europe rationally calling for reform of the vaccine policies and laws is left out 51 the politics of vaccination is in full swing but where is the money coming from to fund these vaccine marketing campaigns using name calling threats shaming and misinformation to demonize and call for discrimination against those who criticize vaccine science and government policy the world health organization who marketing vaccines immediately after world war ii in 1945 the united nations un voted to establish a new international health organization in 1948 the world health organization who was founded by the un after ratification by 26 members states and given a budget of 5m who is a specialized agency of

56 the bill melinda gates foundation is the largest non state funder of the who having donated more than 2b in earmarked grants to the international health agency since 1998 and is the second largest who funder overall after the u s government because gates foundation grant money is earmarked for specific programs such as vaccine purchase delivery and promotion the gates foundation significantly influences the setting of who s program priorities 57 in 2010 after a joint investigation by the british medical journal bmj in collaboration with the london based bureau of investigative journalism an article was published in the bmj revealing that three key scientists who influenced the who s decision to declare a swine flu h1n1 influenza pandemic in 2009 and recommend that all countries use and stockpile vaccines and pandemic flu drugs had financial ties to pharmaceutical companies profiting from the who recommendations glaxosmithkline and roche who was also criticized for lack of transparency for refusing to release the identities of the 16 members of an emergency committee formed in 2009 to guide pandemic policy 58 the 2009 pandemic h1n1 vaccine which was rushed to market to

immune mediated neurological disorder 59 gavi the vaccine alliance marketing vaccines the who and the u s government are founding partners of gavi the vaccine alliance in 2000 the bill and melinda gates foundation provided 750m in seed money to spearhead the creation of gavi a public private partnership and multilateral funding mechanism involving the who governments the vaccine industry the world bank philanthropic foundations and civil society groups to improve access to new and underused vaccines for children living in the world s poorest countries 60 of the more than 15b raised by gavi since 2000 to vaccinate the world s children u s government contributions have totaled 1 9b or 12 percent of all contributions received by gavi the united kingdom has contributed 2 2b or 14 percent of gavi s total contributions the single biggest funding source for gavi is the gates foundation which has donated more than 3b or 20 percent of gavi s total income 61 between 2000 and 2013 only about 10 percent of total funding provided by gavi 862m was used to strengthen health systems in developing countries such as improving sanitation and nutrition while nearly 80 percent was used to purchase deliver and promote vaccines 62 gavi is headquartered in geneva with an office in washington d c that carries out day to day operations and one of gavi s core goals is to shape markets for vaccines and other immunization products in 2006 gavi created the international finance facility immunisation ifflm to use donor funding commitments to back the issuance of special bonds in capital markets to provide up front financing to gavi in 2010 gavi created the advance market commitment amc model to accelerate access to pneumococcal vaccines with donors providing up front funding commitments to support vaccine purchase and speed the introduction and use of vaccines in countries partnering with gavi currently the amc incentivizes vaccine manufacturers to sign contracts to provide pneumococcal vaccine to developing countries at lower per dose prices and be reimbursed by gavi funds by march 2015 pfizer and glaxosmithkline had received more than 1b from gavi s amc funds 63 cdc officials provide gavi with technical support and guidance in 2015 the u s congress pledged to appropriate 1b to gavi that was spread over four years 2015 2018 64 on oct 16 2018 at the world health summit in berlin gavi ceo dr seth berkley announced that 11 heads of the world s leading health and development organizations had signed a landmark commitment to find new ways to accelerate achieving goals of the united nation s sustainable development goals created in 2015 the new global action plan vaccine marketing initiative is being coordinated by the who 65 relating sustainable development goals to vaccination of all the people in the world gavi states that 66 immunization protects people from being forced into poverty by high out of pocket expenses vaccines protect child health and support cognitive development allowing children to perform better at school and have more opportunities vaccinated healthy children grow into a productive workforce and become strong contributors to the economy and healthy children free up parents time so they are able to work vaccines are critical to building people s resilience to and mitigating the risk of disease outbreaks tied to climate change and good health is a critical determinant of peace and well being in a society people centered health systems are core social institutions in every country and immunisation is often the first point of contact between these systems and the population in 2016 dr berkley and other gavi executives came under criticism in the uk in 2016 for taking excessively high salary packages according to an investigative news report 67 seth berkley has taken home more than 2 million over the past four years as chief executive officer of global alliance for vaccines and immunisation gavi which has been given 1 5 billion by britain another official at the geneva based group collects a pay package of more than 500 000 a year incredibly dr berkley was given a housing allowance on top of his 623 370 pay package in december 2018 dr berkley told cnn that while measles is one of the few diseases we could potentially eradicate that will never happen if wealthy countries like the united states can t maintain herd immunity because a measles case anywhere is a threat everywhere he said parents in the u s are delaying their children s vaccinations perhaps because they believe in immunization but are worried by some of the anti vaccine scaremongering this needs to stop echoing the idea that parents who don t go along with the vaccine program are selfish he added in countries like the united states we need to stop thinking about vaccination as something you only do to protect the ones you love and instead view it also as a goodwill act for the benefit of others 68 according to the cdc in 2017 2018 vaccination coverage among kindergarteners remained high with 94 percent of children having received two doses of measles mumps and rubella mmr vaccine 4 or 5 doses of diphtheria tetanus and pertussis dtap vaccine and two doses of varicella zoster chickenpox vaccine among many other vaccines required by states for school attendance two percent of kindergarteners had an exemption from one or more state required vaccines 69 the bill and melinda gates foundation marketing vaccines the gates foundation was established in 2000 by microsoft corporation founder bill gates and his wife melinda 70 headquartered in seattle washington the gates foundation is the largest philanthropic foundation in the world with a 43 5b trust that makes grant payments of more than 3b annually to advance the foundation s goals for reforming education systems such as institution of common core curriculum in all u s schools 71 and funding public health initiatives primarily global vaccination programs 72 a major goal of the gates foundation is to make sure every child in the world is vaccinated 73 investor businessman warren buffet who took control of textile manufacturer berkshire hathaway inc in 1965 and went on to amass a personal fortune of more than 60b pledged 31b and became a co director of gates foundation in 2006 74 in 1998 the same year that the u s department of justice filed an anti trust lawsuit against microsoft corporation 75 bill and melinda gates committed 100m to create the bill melinda gates children s vaccine program one purpose of that program was to establish an international consensus on vaccine use recommendations efforts will be made to support international conferences and the development and dissemination of strong international consensus statements and recommendations for the use of the new vaccines 76 the homepage of the gates foundation proclaims all lives have equal value and states 77 we believe we can save lives by delivering the latest in science and technology to those with the greatest needs we work with partners to provide effective vaccines drugs and diagnostics and to develop innovative approaches to deliver health services to those who need it most and we invest heavily in developing new vaccines to prevent infectious diseases that impose the greatest burden in 2016 global justice now published an investigative report gated development is the gates foundation always a force for good authors were critical of the unchecked political power and influence on global health programs and agricultural policies of bill gates and the bill and melinda gates foundation bmgf 78 to say that the bmgf has become an important actor in international development would be an understatement when it comes to global health and agriculture policies two of its key grant areas the bmgf has become probably the most influential actor in the world it is also likely that bill gates who has regular access to world leaders and is in effect personally bankrolling hundreds of universities international organisations ngos and media outlets has become the single most influential voice in international development but the bmgf s increasing global influence is not being subjected to democratic scrutiny unlike governments which are formally accountable to their electorates the bmgf is a private us foundation and remains unaccountable to public bodies except for tax reporting purposes even worse the bmgf appears to have bought the silence of academics ngos and the media who might otherwise be expected to criticize aspects of the foundation s work money makes the world go around congress appropriated nearly 90b to the u s department of health and human services in 2018 and the biggest line item in the cdc s 11b budget was the vaccines for children program vfc 4 5b which was created by congress in 1993 79 under the vfc program the federal government purchases cdc recommended vaccines from vaccine manufacturers to administer to children who are on medicaid are uninsured or whose health insurance plans do not fully cover cdc recommended vaccines 80 81 hundreds of millions of dollars are additionally allocated in the hhs budget for vaccination programs including 700m for the national center for immunization and respiratory diseases one of the most politically powerful public private partnerships in the world today is the lucrative one that has been forged by the pharmaceutical industry with government 82 83 84 85 86 mainstream media 87 and wealthy philanthropic foundations with political agendas 88 89 in the past decade these public private partnerships have come under scrutiny by public policy analysts in 2015 authors of a special report published by the global policy forum observed 90 however it is not only big business but also big philanthropy that has an increasing influence in global development policy particularly large philanthropic foundations the scope of their influence in both past and present discourse and decision making processes is fully equal and in some cases goes beyond that of other private actors through the sheer size of their grant making personal networking and active advocacy large global foundations most notably the rockefeller foundation and the bill melinda gates foundation have played an increasingly active role in shaping the agenda setting and funding priorities of international organizations and governments for example the gates foundation has given johns hopkins more than 100m in research grants since 2015 including for vaccine development and promotion 91 at the same time johns hopkins university receives more than 2b per year in funding from u s government agencies such as the national institutes of health nih and the national science foundation nsf to conduct research including for vaccine development and vaccine use promotion 92 the national institutes of health nih and other federal health agencies give millions of dollars in taxpayer dollars to academic institutions and vaccine manufacturers to improve vaccine technology find new lucrative vaccine markets and boost vaccine marketability 93 the u s government also partners with the gates foundation to develop and promote vaccine use for example in 2013 the cdc foundation received three grants totaling 13 5m from the gates foundation to globally advance the implementation of meningitis and rotavirus vaccine programs 94 the centers for disease control and the cdc foundation have received more than 167m from the gates foundation 95 vaccine manufacturers have also received millions of dollars in grants from the gates foundation including glaxosmithkline over 50m 96 merck 1 4m 97 pfizer 16 5m 98 and sanofi pasteur 3 6m 99 big media under the influence mass media corporations are also under the influence of big pharma and big philanthropy money for example national public radio has received 20m in grants 100 and solutions journalism network has received 4m 101 in grants from the gates foundation recently gates microsoft corporation partnered with newsguard technologies inc 102 103 a new corporation that is rating websites and online publications to fight false news misinformation and disinformation 104 105 106 the newsguard corporation is also collaborating with other corporations such as google 107 108 which owns over 90 percent of the internet search market 109 one of the biggest investors in newsguard is publicis the oldest advertising company in the world and the third largest mass communications company today 110 publicis is paid billions of dollars by pharmaceutical companies to market vaccines 111 including a 1 5b media contract with glaxosmithkline 112 pdi a publicis health company states 113 vaccination coverage in the united state is high but in the face of the resurgence of vaccine preventable diseases such as pertussis and measles the existing gaps in the vaccination coverage of the us population have become worrisome gaps exist because not every patient who needs a vaccination gets it at the recommended age moreover the recommendations for new vaccines including vaccines for influenza and human papillomavirus hpv have been expanded pdi s field based medical sales representatives and inside medical sales representatives from our healthcare contact center can increase adoption of vaccines by responding to questions and concerns to increase immunization rates we must build sustainable systems for vaccination within the context of a changing healthcare system here some recommended steps toward achieving this goal assessment of the actual vaccination rate in a provider s practice consistently making recommendations for timely vaccinations to both the parents of pediatric patients and adult patients standing orders for non physician personnel to carry out vaccinations at the scheduled time without physician involvement educating physicians on emerging research of vaccine risks and on how to interact with parents who are concerned about the detrimental effects of the mmr and hpv vaccines and educating physicians about state sponsored and other programs that can help patients overcome financial barriers to vaccination it is clear that mass media communications today is being controlled by corporations financially tied to pharmaceutical companies and influenced by powerful political institutions in society it goes a long way to explaining why mainstream media outlets have been united in attacking parents and physicians who defend the ethical principle of informed consent including informed consent to vaccination and are calling for vaccine exemptions to be severely restricted or eliminated 114 the five largest companies in the world today are apple google microsoft amazon and facebook 115 these and other technology corporations dominate online communications and sales and are positioned to join together to aggressively market vaccines and promote no exceptions vaccine use policies endorsed by the who and governments the threat to autonomy and freedom of thought and speech posed by these companies especially in censoring online public conversations about vaccination and health is considerable 116 117 the people are not represented today everybody knows somebody who was healthy got vaccinated and was never healthy again the people whose lives are being impacted by business deals between governments big pharma and big philanthropy increasingly are being marginalized in the top down public policymaking process by wealthy and powerful institutions in society financing the global multi billion dollar vaccine industry 118 this is evident when the people raise their voices to ask for better vaccine science and more humane public health policies and are demonized discriminated against and punished by those in control of those wealthy and powerful institutions a system that will not bend will break the responsibility for the crisis of trust in the global vaccination system lies squarely at the feet of those who operate the system and refuse to acknowledge the suffering of the people harmed by vaccines 119 120 read the full article at nvic org comment on this article at vaccineimpact com references 1 world health organization who ten threats to global health in 2019 jan 16 2019 2 cdc

the uae s economic growth will accelerate this year spurred by increased private sector credit higher inward investment government stimuli and the approaching expo 2020 event in dubai the international monetary fund said in a new report growth momentum is set to strengthen in the next few years the washington based lender said in a report on friday night inflation is expected to remain low notwithstanding the introduction of value added tax vat earlier in 2018 although nonperforming loans rose during the slowdown banks remain liquid and well capitalised the country s non oil growth is projected to rise to 3 9 per cent in 2019 and 4 2 per cent in 2020 with overall real gdp growth including oil and non oil growth expected to reach 3 7 per cent for 2019 20 according to the imf s report this is a significant uplift from a projected 2 9 per cent last year and 0 7 per cent contraction in 2017 when the knock on impact of low oil prices took its biggest toll on regional economies the report is the outcome of the imf s latest economic outlook consultation with the uae in november with oil prices rising to above 80 per barrel last september a three year record high after they plummeted to below 30 in 2014 and now hovering at around 60 per barrel the uae s hydrocarbons sector has seen prospects improve as output ticks up higher oil prices have had a positive impact on the uae s current account surplus which nearly doubled last year to 6 9 per cent of gdp as imports remained flat boosting its external position that surplus is expected to rise further to nearly 8 per cent of gdp in 2019 owing to heftier oil revenues although it may settle at a lower level in the medium term as oil prices soften with rising production the imf s report noted meanwhile fiscal easing is taking place in the uae and other gcc economies which is facilitating economic growth abu dhabi announced a dh50 billion stimulus package last year to expand the private sector and encourage higher levels of inward investment and it is set to be rolled out in 2019 the expo 2020 dubai mega event to be staged over a six month period from next october is creating new investment opportunities as well as driving tourism and construction activity at the same time ramped up structural reforms and business friendly legislation is boosting the uae s medium term prospects as private sector activity picks up and stimulus measures are phased out fiscal consolidation is expected to resume to ensure sufficient saving of oil wealth for future generations the imf said the overall fiscal balance is projected to turn to a surplus next year on higher oil prices and remain positive over the medium term debt to gdp levels which remained robust even in the past three years are also improving noted the imf external debt as a percentage of gdp is forecast to shrink to 64 2 per cent from 73 5 per cent in 2017 downside external risks including geopolitical tensions rising global protectionism and greater volatility in emerging markets have increased in recent months the report noted

cag growth performance continues to outpace u s veterinary practice market growth reflected in our data set from approximately 5 000 clinics in q4 patient visits were up 0 3 and clinic revenues increased 4 per practice compared to the prior year period a relatively lower level of overall practice revenue growth compared to recent trends this same store growth data is for veterinary visits of all types and appears to be impacted by moderated growth in nonclinical visits as we ve seen growth for clinical visits trending closer to 2 these solid clinical visit trends are aligned with our continued strong business results we re refining our data tracking and analysis of clinical versus nonclinical visit trends and look forward to sharing more on this front on future conference calls international cag diagnostic recurring revenues increased 12 5 organically in q4 driven by 20 plus organic growth in international consumable revenues mid single digit reference lab growth improved relative to our third quarter results with overall gains constrained by continued softer performance in select markets impacting in part by a commercial focus in 2018 on driving very strong in clinic revenue gains veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging systems revenues increased 9 globally in q4 reflecting 8 organic gains and benefits from our recent acquisition of smart flow these results were supported by solid growth in recurring software services associated with our practice management platforms and continued strength in our diagnostic imaging business which posted a 20 increase in digital imaging system unit placements for the full year 2018 for the full year overall cag revenues increased 13 organically driven by 13 gains in cag diagnostic revenues strong premium instrument placements and solid growth in our veterinary software and digital imaging business full year cag diagnostics recurring revenue growth included 1 3 in nonrecurring growth rate benefit from the new revenue accounting standard changes adjusting for this effect our 2019 goals target continued low teen organic growth in our cag business building on our strong business momentum our water business revenues grew 8 organically in the fourth quarter to 30 million driven by strong gains in international markets which were offset to a degree by the timing of year end u s shipments which moderated overall q4 growth for the full year water revenues reached 125 million up 9 organically with faster operating profit growth reflecting 45 operating margins we re very pleased with our continued momentum in the water business and are targeting continued high single digit organic growth in this highly profitable business in 2019 livestock poultry and dairy revenue in q4 was 34 million down 5 organically as expected reflecting comparisons to high 2017 year end government program and distributer ordering quarterly growth was also pressured by end market impacts related to african swine fever outbreaks in china which is our largest market for swine diagnostic testing and the continued impact of low milk prices in key markets which has constrained demand for dairy testing and growth in bovine pregnancy test sales for the full year 2018 our lpd revenue was 131 million up 1 organically as our lpd revenues are 90 international macroeconomic pressures in markets like china can have a relatively larger impact on the lpd business segment than the company as a whole given these factors our 2019 outlook factors in expectations for relatively flat organic growth in our lpd business for the full year 2018 total u s revenues reached 1 358 000 000 up 13 organically and international revenues increased 10 organically to 855 million or approximately 39 of idexx total revenues full year revenue gains were driven by 13 growth in cag diagnostic recurring revenues in both u s and international markets solidly within our long term target growth ranges our strong q4 and full year results reflect continued benefits from global expansion of our premium instrument base globally we placed 3 957 premium analyzers in q4 an increase of 8 compared to high 2017 q4 levels bringing full year 2018 premium placements to 13 047 up 14 we placed 2 042 catalysts in total in q4 globally a 10 year on year increase 1 170 premium hematology instruments up 13 and 745 sedivue s in line with very strong prior year levels our focus on high economic value placements drove a 15 global increase in global catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts in q4 and solid evi gains in both north america and international in north america we placed 421 catalyst placements at newer competitive accounts or 76 of total north america catalyst placements international catalyst placements at newer competitive accounts increased 29 year on year in q4 to 710 instruments contributing 48 of total international catalyst placements for the full year our new and competitive catalyst placements totaled 3 626 globally an impressive 20 year over year increase in addition to strong premium instrument results we placed 2 345 snap pros in q4 supported by over 2 000 placements in north america bringing our worldwide installed base to over 25 000 cag diagnostic instrument revenues in q4 were 37 million a 3 increase organically off a strong compare in 2017 with gains moderated in the quarter by instrument program mix impacts q4 instrument revenues included 10 5 million in revenues attributed to the accounting standard primarily related to expansion of the idexx 360 customer program our strong q4 instrument placement results cap a year of substantial progress in expanding our premium instrument base we finished the year with 37 000 catalysts up 24 nearly 29 000 premium hematology analyzers up 11 and nearly 6 600 sedivue s up 69 reflecting a record 2 719 sedivue placements in 2018 combined our premium instrument base increased 21 globally in 2018 our expanding instrument base and benefits from new test innovation and our strength in commercial capability continues to drive strong recurring cag diagnostic revenue gains instrument consumable revenues of 157 million grew 19 organically in q4 results reflect continued 20 plus gains in international markets and sustained mid teen growth in the u s high volume driven consumer gains were supported by expansion of sedivue pay per run and sdma slide revenues which again contributed about 4 combined to year on year consumable revenue gains in the quarter reference laboratory and consulting services with revenues of 178 million grew 11 organically in the fourth quarter u s lab momentum remains strong reflected a mid teen volume driven organic revenue gains global lab revenue growth was moderated by mid single digit gains in international markets which while up from q3 were impacted by continued soft growth trends in select markets we re forecasting continued moderate lab growth in our international reference led businesses in the near term as we enhance our commercial focus to build on the very strong progress we ve driven in developing our idexx vetlab business in the international markets rapid assay revenues of 48 million grew 5 organically in q4 reflecting solid gains across u s and international markets rapid assay gains were primarily volume driven supported by continued growth of 4dx plus specialty and first generation products turning to the p l gross profit was 300 million in q4 up 10 on a reported basis adjusting for foreign exchange impacts gross margins increased about 70 basis points supported by continued solid net price gains and strong growth in consumable revenues foreign exchange hedge gains which benefit gross profits were 1 million in q4 operating profit in q4 was 115 million up 18 as reported or 20 on a constant currency basis operating profit results benefit from strong revenue gains and operating expense leverage supporting a 170 basis point improvement in constant currency operating margins in the quarter operating expenses in q4 were up 6 as reported or 7 on a constant currency basis driven by growth investments in sales and market and supporting g a resources in our cag business with overall opex growth mitigated by disciplined cost control and lpd for the full year operating profit was 491 million this reflects an operating margin of 22 2 for the full year an increase of 130 basis points on a constant currency basis this outstanding result reflects approximately 30 basis points of constant currency gross margin gains or about 50 basis points of improvement adjusted for impacts related to cost reclassifications in our lab business our strong full year operating margin results also reflect significant operating expense leverage benefiting from our accelerated revenue growth while we expanded our sales and marketing capability globally and increased investment in products and software r d which reached 118 million in 2018 or nearly 130 million on a cash basis eps in q4 was 0 98 per share including 0 01 per share in tax benefit related to share based compensation activity and 0 02 in negative impacts related to year over year fx changes on a comparable constant currency basis eps increased 40 including net benefits from u s tax reform for 2018 eps was 4 26 including 21 million or 0 24 per share in tax benefit related to share based compensation activity for the full year foreign exchange rate changes increased eps by 0 01 per share net of fx hedge loss impacts of 1 million adjusting for these factors and prior year discrete tax impacts 2018 eps growth was 36 on a comparable constant currency basis our effective tax rate for 2018 was 17 6 including approximately 5 of rate benefit related to share based compensation activity this tax rate was approximately 0 03 per share favorable to our earlier guidance estimates including about 0 02 of additional benefit related to share based compensation activity free cash flow was 284 million for 2018 or about 75 of net income our free cash flow was net of 116 million of capital investment including 42 million of combined investment related to our westbrook maine headquarters expansion and german core lab relocation we also supported 60 million in instrument program investments for the year an increase of 44 million year on year associated with our very successful idexx 360 program in the u s in support of strong premium instrument placement growth internationally we allocated 369 million in capital toward share repurchases for the full year 2018 including repurchases of 489 000 shares in q4 for 103 million our balance sheet is an excellent position we ended the year with 1 006 000 000 in debt 124 million in cash and 450 million in capacity under our revolving credit facility our leverage ratios is a multiple of adjusted ebitda of 1 67 times gross and 1 46 times net of cash our strong performance and disciplined capital allocation supported achievement of a 49 after tax return on invested capital excluding cash and investments for 2018 we re well positioned to build on this strong performance in 2019 with the financial outlook aligned with our long term goals we re maintaining consistent 2019 guidance for 9 5 to 11 organic revenue growth and revenue of 2 385 000 000 to 2 425 000 000 this outlook equates to reported revenue growth of 8 to 9 5 net of a consistent projected 1 5 fx growth headwind at the rates assumed in our press release we finalized the components of our revenue guidance as part of our year end planning and refined our cag diagnostic recurring revenue organic growth outlook to 11 to 12 building on our exceptional 13 2 organic growth in 2018 which included 1 3 of nonrecurring growth rate benefit related to the implementation of the new revenue standard we re raising our 2019 eps outlook to 4 66 to 4 78 an increase of 0 04 per share at the midpoint reflecting approximately 0 06 per share and flow through of 2018 profit upsides offset by a 0 02 per share reduction in estimated tax benefits from share based compensation activity this outlook factors in an estimated 0 03 negative year on year impact from fx net of 10 million in projected hedge gains consistent with our preliminary guidance estimates as a sensitivity a 1 change in the dollar from rates assumed in our press release would impact 2019 revenues by approximately 8 million and operating profit by approximately 2 million net of hedge positions currently in place we refined elements of our p l outlook as we finalize our 2019 plans while maintaining a consistent comparable eps growth outlook of 15 to 18 we re now targeting 50 to 80 basis points of constant currency operating margin improvement a slight reduction to the high end of our targeted improvement range we target year on year gains driven primarily by gross margin improvement this refinement is offset by favorable updates to our projections for interest expense and year on year share count reduction we re now projecting 37 million to 38 million in net interest costs in 2019 and a 1 to 1 5 reduction in average shares outstanding with both metrics aligned with an assumed maintenance of our net leveraged rate levels at approximately 1 5 times ebitda our outlook for effective tax rate in 2019 remains at 20 to 21 a sustained 2018 upsides are offset by updated estimates for tax rate benefits of stock based compensation reflecting more recent share price levels we now project 6 5 million to 8 5 million or approximately 2 in tax benefit from exercise of stock based compensation in 2019 approximately 0 02 per share below prior estimates and 0 15 per share below high 2018 levels in terms of free cash flow we expect to continue to invest in high return instrument growth programs globally and to deploy 160 million to 175 million in capital spending including approximately 70 million related to completion of our westbrook headquarter and german core lab projects for 2019 this results in an outlook for free cash flow of 60 to 65 of net income or approximately 80 of net income normalized for these two major projects in terms of our first quarter outlook in 2019 we expect q1 reported revenue growth in the 6 to 7 5 range reflecting organic gains of 9 to 10 5 net of a projected 1 equivalent days headwind q1 operating margins are expected to be at the lower end of our full year improvement goals of 50 to 80 basis points as we continue to advance implementation of our international commercial resource expansion we expect our effective tax rate in q1 to be 18 5 to 19 including projected benefits from share based compensation exercise activity that concludes the financial overview let me turn the call over to jon for his comments jon ayers chief executive officer ok brian thank you we ll call a commentary and we ll open up for questions we finished 2018 with strong revenue growth and impressive bottom line results even as we re making significant incremental investments in business to support our customers and that will generate sustained growth for years to come companion animal diagnostic recurring revenue which constitutes 75 of idexx overall revenues in 2018 grew organically 13 for the quarter and the full year consistent with our expectations u s cag diagnostic recurring revenue which represents almost two third of the total global generated organic growth of 13 3 while international generated 12 5 international growth was supported by 20 plus instrument consumable organic revenue growth clearly pet owners have an increasing appreciation of the importance of healthcare for their pets our growth trends in as 2018 wraps up are also a testament to the value our customers see in idexx unique diagnostic offering and the importance the idexx technologies play in healthcare the market for veterinary and medical and technician talent is really competitive right now as you can see from this morning s job report in fact it s been reported that there s one veterinarian available for every five job openings and so practiced owners need to attract and retain valued staff by providing them essential tools and a partner to support their job well and take the best care of patients thus the importance of idexx far more advanced innovations and so our customer retention metrics which are the foundation of growth in a recurring revenue model continue at exceptionally high levels in q4 if not inching up ever so slightly our organic growth remains primarily volume driven augmented by continued modest price realization the latter reflecting the benefits of how our offerings advance with the benefit of almost 130 million of cash r d and diagnostics and software in 2018 and are projected almost 150 million in cash r d in the same in 2019 this technology for life approach includes the behind the scenes software upgrades that happen regularly for our point of care instruments like the recently announced neural network 4 0 for sedivue advancing menu and the progesterone test for our catalyst platform our seventh new test in seven years on the catalyst platform as well as regular advances in vetconnect plus our cloud based diagnostic software for 2018 placements of catalysts in new and competitive accounts were up 20 new and competitive catalyst placements over the course of the year are an important contributor to the 19 organic growth in idexx vetlab instrument consumables in q4 we re pleased with the instrument placement results that q4 contributed to the year that brian has enumerated as well as the completion of the rollout of catalyst one analyzers at over 1 000 banfield hospitals we re entering 2019 having completed important commercial expansions around the world the u s expansion with the greater customer coverage from a deeper field based professional organization was in place for the start of q4 there s always some settling in during the first quarter of an expansion as our professionals including newly recruited professionals develop relationships with their customers in their new or reconfigured territories especially in this light the north american growth metrics also against a strong compare were very strong as we enter 2019 we re beyond this initial settling in period in our u s market our largest with an experienced world class team of professionals and frontline leadership this team is focused on growing diagnostic and software category advancing customers adoptions of new protocols such as preventive care diagnostics fecal antigen testing urinalysis sedivue and growing the overall number of customers that benefit from idexx unique technologies our u s field footprint isn t in place with our u s field footprint in place a quarter ago our 2019 u s focus is on the productivity that comes from rapid development in time and territory our commercial investments in the u s in 2019 will focus on high roi opportunities beyond field footprint our international teams expansion plans were timed generally about a quarter later than the u s at this point we re largely complete and hiring expanded commercial resources to advance instrument placements and a companion animal group diagnostic recurring revenue growth in accordance with our plans our international teams are building competencies with our key commercial strategies for example the economic value index of an instrument placement to prioritize high value chemistry placements which is one of the reasons why we saw a 29 growth in new income competitive catalyst placements in q4 internationally to a record over 700 units which was up 100 units from q3 of 2018 which itself was a quarterly record another strategic competency being adopted by international is leveraging the idexx 360 program to accelerate instrument placements and drive recurring revenue growth this type of program is slightly generally new to our idexx teams outside of north america and i m pleased with the teams progress here as the year wrapped up our international teams are poised to have a great 2019 spreading the benefits of idexx innovation such as idexx sdma including our catalyst placements and our best in class hematology offerings as the expansions complete their settling period in the first quarter of 2019 these international commercial expansions along with a unique diagnostic and software technology offering gives us confidence in our revenue growth target primarily driven by volume testing gains with secondary support from modest price realization and net new customer additions while current economic times bring a steady den of broader macro noise idexx growth remains solid reflecting the durable recurring nature of our revenues the benefit of our differentiation enabled by our industry leading investments in innovation and supported by the growing bond between pets and their owners in sum we are sustaining solid growth momentum as we enter 2019 which gives us confidence for the 11 to 12 projected organic growth of cag diagnostic recurring revenues in 2019 similar to the 2018 growth trends on an adjusted basis before i open the call to questions i want to express my deep gratitude to our employees for their accomplishments in 2018 in the pursuit of our purpose to enhance the health and well being of pets people and livestock and also my gratitude to the continued confidence that customers have in idexx as a value added technology partner so with this comment cynthia we ll open the call to questions questions and answers operator and our first question will come from the line of ryan daniels with william blair your line is open ryan daniels william blair company analyst yes good morning and thanks for taking the questions two somewhat disparate ones first off john for you as we think about the expanded international salesforce and your potential rollout of idexx 360 and kind of integrating a reference and point of care more actively is there an opportunity to push the preventive care protocols and challenge in those markets as well or is it still a bit too early in those markets to think that could be a organic growth driver jon ayers chief executive officer yes thank you for that we re actually beginning to look at that in some of the more advanced international markets i think it s an opportunity we have and in addition when we talk about the benefits of diagnostics in a preventive care scenario it reinforces the importance of foreign diagnostics when it is not a wellness presentation and so i think we ll see it s early days in international in 2019 very early days kind of where we were at the u s several years ago but preventive care really has come of age in 2018 and it s a big component of our growth in 2019 in the u s and now more and more in the canadian market ryan daniels william blair company analyst ok and then if we look at the u s market i thought it was somewhat noteworthy in the press release you called out millennials and that being a focus for the organization can you speak to that note in a little bit more detail as it relates to how that could serve as a tailwind for the industry and then anything you ll do specifically given the large size of that millennial market and their proclivity to spend more on pet care jon ayers chief executive officer yes so millennials which we generally define as the 15 year span from 37 to 22 are now in their taking care of their own pets they re also an important and growing part of the professional community of veterinarians and technicians and all the evidence that we see is that the millennial s visit the vet more they re more in tuned with their pets and i think that one metric kind of calls it out that while maybe 20 of other prior generations feel their pets have special health needs 46 of millennials think their pets have special health needs which really i think is an indication of how millennials are in touch with their pets and so we see this as and then the early evidence is even the generation beyond that maybe taking it even a bit further but this is obviously the largest component of the consumer category right now and i think will be a key long term driver for the growing importance of pet healthcare ryan daniels william blair company analyst ok great thank you i ll hop back in the queue operator thank you our next question will come from the line of erin wright with credit suisse your line is open erin wright credit suisse analyst great thanks looking at the patient visit growth metrics that you gave you gave some new color on the clinical visits which were up 2 how has that metric trended over the past few years and how would you characterize kind of underlying demand trends across the u s companion animal market i assume that is a u s metric you re giving there and what does your guidance assume in terms of underlying demand trends for the year can you speak to some of the more resilient aspect to your business that can withstand this fluctuations in underlying demand trends thanks jon ayers chief executive officer yes i want to start with the last part what we re doing is that we re growing the utilization importance of diagnostic and all kinds of presentations i think people are realizing that just by doing a physical exam and a history you re missing a lot of pieces the equation without running diagnostics and of course you re missing other piece of the equation if you re not running idexx diagnostics so even though we ve seen some slight some moderation in the pet visits over the course of second half of 2018 in the u s market which is really the only market that we have industry data and as you know i think the clinical visits are moderating a less yes we ve still got 2 growth in clinical visits so which is of course the only type of visit that is important to idexx the nonclinical visit is not really a factor for idexx we re seeing good demand growth and so our expectation in 2019 is consistent with really what we saw in 2018 brian mckeon chief financial officer second half of 2018 yes i think we re factoring in the recent trends and our outlook is very much in line with the adjusted growth that we re driving coming out of the back half jon ayers chief executive officer now let s also recognize we re seeing growth in the instrument consumables associated with our new tests catalyst sdma on slide and the growing installed base of sedivue and the growing use of preventative care so we have a number of growth drivers that make up the total of companion animal diagnostic recurring revenue projected growth for 2019 of 11 to 12 on an organic basis erin wright credit suisse analyst ok great thanks and on the international side i m going to ask another question on international reference lab but when will the salesforce be more meaningfully mature there and how quickly is that relative to what you typically see in the u s and then and how should we think about that quarterly cadence in international reference lab when do you really expect that to start to improve over the course of the year thanks jon ayers chief executive officer well i like to look at the results as a whole and what we ve done is we prioritized the catalyst placements to new and competitive accounts which is a little bit harder to sale than a catalyst placement to an existing idexx chemistry customer using vettest and while we ve largely upgraded the vettest volume in the international market there is some i think it s 10 of our chemistry consumable volume in the international market with that test remaining to go this is the 29 year over growth i think is really showing that the international is prioritizing the highest roi of work and let s recognize once we place a catalyst the loyalty internationally on catalyst is virtually 100 so these are going to be customers that are going to be using catalysts for life and this very enduring recurring revenue let alone any growth we get in utilization from menu our utilization or adoption of additional protocols we did see a nice we saw a couple of percent tick up in the international reference lab organic growth in q4 over q3 which really i think validates that part of what we saw in q3 was weather and part of it was some selective slowdown in markets as we prioritized those chemistry placements to get to really where will the idexx 360 program and our overall focus on both catalyst and reference lab i would say that s probably going to we ll probably see that in the second half of 2019 start to kick in but the productivity to saleforce are pretty high on the important instrument placement side of the equation erin wright credit suisse analyst ok great thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of michael ryskin with bank of america merrill lynch your line is open michael ryskin bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks guys thanks for taking the question i wanted to dig deeper on a couple of the moving pieces and the updated 2019 guide just to get some clarity so you mentioned that the cag or current revenues outlook you refined to 11 to 12 versus the 11 5 to 12 5 it sounds like the accounting standard is now a little bit more i think you said 1 3 and previously it was 1 so this is a bit of a two part question but i m wondering if that s the entire reason for the shift and it s just a bit of rounding decision and then the second part of the question is if that s now 11 to 12 but the total company guide has reiterated a 9 5 to 11 is there an offset somewhere else looks like lpd is still going to be challenged because of african swine fever is something better and a lot of quality or is this just a rounding between the various buckets brian mckeon chief financial officer yes mike it really is kind of the rounding effects as we re just finalizing our plans with the we try to provide input for each of the segments in the call so we said low teens cag high single digit water and relatively flat lpd and it really is a refinement to finalizing our plans it s not related to the accounting adjustment and that implies high single digit growth in areas like vss and digital and our instrument placement revenue so it s just wrapping up our plans very much in line with our trends coming out of the end of the year if you look at the cag recurring growth adjusted for that 1 3 effect it s very consistent with that we provide the extra decimal point it s been slightly above 1 through the year we ve just been rounding and we wanted you to have the exact number as we finish the year but again that is a nonrecurring growth rate benefit we should be through the account change adjustments and fully normalized heading into 2019 jon ayers chief executive officer yes yes mike i think as part of the brian comments and your comments i think you characterized it right we re pretty unique in providing revenue and profit guidance in october of the year before for the following year which really shows the enduring nature of our and predictable nature of it and it s really just as we finalize our plans and outlook we re talking about some rounding consideration brian mckeon chief financial officer and i would say we had an outlook in q4 for the international lab so mid to high single digit we re a bit at the lower end we did see improvement and some of that s factored in as well we think that we ve got that well calibrated michael ryskin bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok and then just if i could squeeze in one other quick one on the vet volume data you provided for 4q the 0 3 increase i m just wondering if you saw anything weird in the u s in terms of weather in the quarter we have the california wildfires in october or if you think there is any potential impact there from some of the macroeconomic data the gdp data that came out over in the year the stock market had a negative move throughout the year so i was wondering if you thought there is anything there that led to that decrease in vet clinic visits jon ayers chief executive officer that s a lot of moving parts i would say and then throw in the calendarization of december too which with the holidays and where they fell i think the 0 3 that s total visits we re getting a better understanding i think don t we re ready to talk in detail about it yet but we re getting a better understanding of what portion of our of those visits are clinical visits and what the clinical visit trends are our preliminary analysis says the clinical visits are closer to 2 of growth in q4 and so some of that deceleration may be really just revenue going from out of the practice management system into other channels some channels are channels that benefit the veterinarian through like a direct sales from the veterinarian but doesn t go through the practice management software which is of course what we re measuring so but i think the overall trends and certainly our companion animal diagnostic recurring revenue growth of 13 3 in the u s speaks for the fact the solid state of the growth in this in the in our portion of the industry michael ryskin bank of america merrill lynch analyst all right much appreciated i ll get back in the queue operator thank you we will go to line of jon block with stifel your line is open jon block stifel financial corp analyst great thanks guys and good morning i ll also ask probably a guidance related questions so brian the first one i think if i heard you correctly the midpoint of the 1q organic was about 9 75 and that s where the 1 days headwind that s largely in line with the 9 5 to 11 organic for the year so i guess where i m going with this is anything you can call out from a cadence perspective for the year on a top line should we think stable and then maybe the op margin expansion is a bit back end weighted any color would be helpful brian mckeon chief financial officer i think that s a fair call john i think we re not i don t think we have any meaningful targeted calendarization differences or things to note you always have segment by segment specific compares but i as we work through the year but i think that s fair and yes on the operating margin the full year is 50 to 80 and we re likely at the lower end of that coming out of the blocks and some of that s just the lapping of the investments that we made on the commercial expansion we re still advancing some of the international aspects of that and as john noted we ve got plans to increase our r d spending this year as well so that s all factored in but we ll expect to be build on that through the year and i did noted we are targeting primarily improvement from gross margins this year so that we expect that will be consistent too jon block stifel financial corp analyst ok very helpful and that s probably a good segue into the second question which is brian i haven t pushed on margin expansion for sometime so maybe i ll go back there for my second question in 17 and 18 the op margin expansion i believe was around 120 to 130 bps guidance this year like you said is 50 to 80 bps obviously to be fair the baseline is higher now but you have lapped a lot of investments notably in the sales force that you ve made over the past 12 to 24 months but maybe on a high level you can just speak to the incremental investments and why the amount of op margin expansion in 19 would be more muted versus the bad 12 to 24 months thanks guys brian mckeon chief financial officer yes it really is an operating expense story where we ve been highlighting the additional commercial expansions which will be as i noted lapping heading into this year and the cash on g metrics that john highlighted would imply closer to 15 growth in r d this year so we ve had very high return on our ongoing investment in the organic growth of the businesses as highlighted by our 49 after tax return on invested capital and jon ayers chief executive officer an investable business brian mckeon chief financial officer we are very pleased with the growth and want to keep investing toward that and look if we deliver at the higher end of our revenue goals that are that which we ve had the last couple of years that can have some favorable flow through benefits but we re very comfortable with the outlook that we re providing at this point jon block stifel financial corp analyst ok and maybe one quick one if i can the quality of the beat was really high in the quarter notably the r d expense came in ahead of what we were looking for you ve talked about per your comments brian solid r d expectations for 19 so jon maybe can you talk about the turnaround time if that s a good term to use for some of those projects would we expect that pipeline to materialize at all in 19 or is that something more of a 2020 bet thanks for your time guys jon ayers chief executive officer i don t i m not going to talk about anything specific in the r d pipeline that we haven t already talked about but i do want to reinforce that what if some of our r d a significant portion of r d is about our products expanding menu advancing their capabilities not only do we have cloud based software that s continually advancing whether it s in our veterinary software and services our digital imaging or of course vetconnet plus and r d investments are going to happen so it s no big product launch but it s a continual advancement in the capability that we re giving to the customers which of course supports recurring revenue growth our instruments are almost you could consider them as cloud based software that s continually advancing behind the scenes for our customers and this is the new model anyone who s got something powered by software better be continually advancing it through the cloud i know that s what salesforce is doing on automobiles and that s what we ve been doing for quite some time with now seven new menu items on catalyst in that in seven years in the advancement and hematology offering that we talked about over time with four new parameters on procyte and the investments in neural network the incremental capability we have in idexx vetlab station so there is a steady die of things that don t necessarily get a lot of individual play but they have a very meaningful impact on the sustainability of our growth and we have very good pipeline across the diagnostic and software categories r d group is very it s amazingly productive combined with our knowledge of the business and our customer requirements and our ability to leverage and access and input third party technology into our offering so the continued part as i said was close to 150 million of cash r d and diagnostics and software investment in 2019 we see this as a core part of idexx being the sole innovator in the industry jon block stifel financial corp analyst thanks guys jon ayers chief executive officer thank you jon operator thank you our next question comes from the line of mark massaro with canaccord genuity your line is open mark massaro canaccord genuity analyst hey guys thanks on a nice congrats on a nice quarter my first question is on the mix between u s and o u s so historically your international growth has trended higher than your u s growth largely given a lower base of business in international but also based on stronger trends ous when we think about q4 in your prepared remarks you talked about soft growth in select markets o u s so can you give us a sense of where those markets are and what your expectations are for o u s in 2019 brian mckeon chief financial officer yes so mark that was specifically a reference to international reference labs so we had consumable growth in international the 20 growth overall was strong across all of our markets it was really exceptional performance see if you look at the instrument placement growth and the resulting jon ayers chief executive officer 20 plus brian mckeon chief financial officer is was that we very pleased with that progress this year and that was the key driver of the recurring revenue gains as we ve been highlighting the mid single digit growth in reference labs what we saw in q4 was a recovery from the summer in some of our key markets and we don t like to highlight specific markets for competitive reasons but we saw a recovery from some of the weather impacts that we had highlighted and we do continue to have a relatively lower growth in some markets and we think this is largely related to the fact that we really shifted the commercial focus on driving the high in client gains this year and weren t as focused not by intent but just outcome on the reference lab business we re working to get that back on track and we expect that we ll be successful with that and but we ll take an annuity business this the growth rate is really a reflection of what s happened in the last four quarters so we ll hopefully be highlighting progress on that front jon ayers chief executive officer i do want to take the opportunity a big shout out to our german lab and our german commercial organization lab of course more than just germany but they really had a great q4 across the board that s a team we moved through the veterinary diagnostic consultant model we have in the u s at the beginning of the year and they ve really executed well of course that is the largest lab where we re building the new kornwestheim facility what you noted in the capital expansion so i think we re putting the money where the performance is and so that s the one market i d really give kudos to mark massaro canaccord genuity analyst great and then as we think about your new point of care progesterone test launching in the coming weeks ahead i know that you haven t raised your 2019 guidance but can you give us a sense for the size of the market how you intend to price it whether it s a premium to other innovations such as like sdma and a slide for instance and what type of market potential you think there is for progesterone jon ayers chief executive officer yes the list price of that test progesterone will be 34 99 in the u s market obviously international markets it s a little it s going to be market specific so that is a very attractive list price and but it s really very small direct contributor i think what it is is two things that are relevant to investors one is this continues to advance both the loyalty of catalyst customers and it gives us the opportunity to place catalysts that have a requirement to serve responsible breeders and second it s an indication that we re not done adding menu to our in house instruments and this is one of the things about our instrument platform it s very flexible to menu addition because each slide can be developed individually and we have the capability to do that really puts us in a unique position in chemistry as well as hematology and urinalysis to continue to advance the installed base capability and what we call technology for life mark massaro canaccord genuity analyst excellent and then if i can are you seeing any competitive dynamic changes as a result of some of the consolidation in the space and zoetis acquiring abaxis and just as we think about abaxis becoming more meaningful in europe and outside the u s do you see any changes to your strategy o u s this year jon ayers chief executive officer it s always been a competitive market i would say with regard to major markets the u s is the most competitive market and as you can see is are our wealth even with vettest customers outside u s in the high 90s so it s always been a competitive market we don t really see any changes that have come to play with that have been a consequence of the changing ownership of abaxis mark massaro canaccord genuity analyst great thank you operator thank you next we will go to the line of michael ryskin with bank of america merrill lynch your line is open michael ryskin bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks guys just had a couple of quick ones as a follow up i wanted to throw in there you mentioned minus one sale day in the first quarter just for modeling purposes could you give us the days and impact for the other rest of the year and just to confirm that there is no impact in 4q of 18 brian mckeon chief financial officer so on 2019 that we have a favorable day benefit in q3 so and i think the other quarters are not material enough to highlight q4 we had a favorable day benefit but we believe it was offset by the timing at year end of the christmas and new year s holiday which really impacted the year end both clinical activity but also our shipments and so we didn t call that out as a factor because we really think it was we had offsetting effects there so that was not an adjustment to our q4 results michael ryskin bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok appreciate that and just a follow up on one of the other questions after i heard about the international reference lab sounds like you had the improvement from the low single digit to mid single digits in the quarter i m just wondering when you called out the relative focus of the salesforce to draw then point of care reference lab as we think through to 2019 how quickly should that move up is it something that is reasonable to think can tick another step higher in 1q or is this sort of a more gradual to get the international back to the more high single digit range jon ayers chief executive officer we in the near term it will take time so we re brian mckeon chief financial officer probably i think we ll see gradual improvement over the course of 2019 i think we are coming back to the our german organization which moved to a veterinary diagnostic consultant model where you have one account manager representing in house and reference lab they moved to that in the first quarter of 2019 and they have very good fourth quarter across the board and i think that really shows what happens when we get with a little bit of time and territory and learning the new model every market is a little different some of them were already there some of them are making changes to that model some of them are distributor markets where that s not really relevant our markets really don t have a reference lab business so a lot of different models internationally but i think that s an indication of what we really expect to see over the course of 2019 michael ryskin bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok much appreciate it thanks operator thank you and our final question will come from the line of david westenberg with guggenheim security your line is open david westenberg guggenheim securities analyst hi thanks for squeezing me in so the number of the instrument placement number blew away my estimates but the instrument actual revenue number was a little bit below or at least in trend line so is that a function of strong international placements or is there an increase in rental style contracts brian mckeon chief financial officer it s a great question david it was up 3 some of that is the comparative of a very strong results last year we really had exceptional q4 in 2017 and the other factor we did note was instrument program mix impacts and as you pointed out very strong performance internationally can drive that and the growth of programs like rental programs internationally and 360 can have an effect too on the instrument revenue recognition they re all great programs really high return but can have a bit of a moderating effect on growth so those were the primary drivers jon ayers chief executive officer yes i also want to call out david the u s did a great job they had a tough compare where they were really rock and rolling in q4 of 2017 we q4 2018 was the first quarter of the expansion well the most recent expansion and in the context of a strong compare and the first quarter expansion they had very strong results as brian laid out and were up year over year so but to your point on revenue there can be program mix impacts we as i think international placements are going to generate are generally smaller practices that s a fair point and so each placement generates a little bit less incremental recurring revenue than a u s placement but having said that i think there is we re very very pleased with the instrument placements globally in q4 david westenberg guggenheim securities analyst and then maybe just one follow up on the revenue build side you had 17 consumable growth that s a great number right there can you maybe help us parse out contribution from sdma versus organic consumption or consumable utilization to help us understand really what sdma on a slide is kind of doing there brian mckeon chief financial officer yes i highlighted that 4 of the consumable growth the organic consumable growth in q4 was a combination of sdma slide and sedivue pay per run they re pretty equal i think where both contributing i think rounding about 2 jon ayers chief executive officer yes and we re very pleased with the catalyst sdma adoption we ve now topped 1 million runs on catalysts with sdma this adds to close to total 20 million of sdma results when we include the reference lab in the u s we have 58 of our practices who have outrun catalyst sdma in the last quarter and 64 who have purchased it these are really amazing adoption metrics and of course sdma is unique to the idexx solution so globally the metrics are very similar it s actually 58 adoption in the u s and 56 adoption meaning they re actually running at of course we can uniquely measure that because we have smartservice on our instruments which brings all sorts of benefits including our ability to measure and about 64 of global installed base as purchased the sdma slides so these are in the first of year launch these are amazing adoption metrics and it really shows the progress we ve made on providing education to the field of the importance of sdma as being highly correlated with gfr of a kidney meaning that elevated sdma so something that s going on and you need to look more closely and you re not going to traditional parameters so it s a great story and we re going to continue with our investments in sdma education as part of our 2019 marketing plans but i m certainly pleased with the adoption rate and as you ve at least mentioned it also contributes to the organic instrument consumable revenue growth david westenberg guggenheim securities analyst appreciate it thank you jon ayers chief executive officer thank you operator and with that i d like to turn it back over to mr ayers for any closing comment jon ayers chief executive officer yes i want to thank everybody for calling in and i know we ve got our some employees and other constituents and again i just want to express my gratitude for really a fantastic 2018 we run the company in a way that delivers the day and secures the future and i think we had a great delivering year as we ve enumerated here on this call and with the work that our employees do across the world i think we also made significant progress in securing the future for idexx and the and our customers in the veterinary market and the water market and the livestock poultry and dairy market and in the human blood gas markets through our opti medical systems and so with that we will conclude the call and get started on 2019 thank you operator duration 63 minutes call participants brian mckeon chief financial officer jon ayers chief executive officer ryan daniels william

cigna s consolidated adjusted revenues and fourth the company s financial statements are now reported on the basis of article 5 of regulation s x which is the general standard for service companies

comments with highlights from our exceptional 2018 financial results with cigna delivering substantial revenue and earnings growth across our businesses i ll also review how our combination with express scripts further strengthens the affordability of our programs expands choice for those we serve then i ll offer initial insights into our exceptional expectations for 2019 before eric addresses our full year 2018 financial results and 2019 outlook in more detail eric and i will take your questions after which i ll wrap up our call with a few closing comments let s dive into review some of our performance highlights from last year where we delivered strong revenue and earnings growth our full year consolidated adjusted revenue increased by 15 to 48 billion and we reported full year adjusted income from operations of 3 6 billion or 14 22 per share representing a per share increase of 36 these results were driven by substantial growth in contributions across each of our businesses including strong retention levels the continued expansion and deepening of our customer and client relationships and solid new growth across our portfolio cigna also delivered industry leading medical cost trends for the sixth consecutive year our sustained market leading performance will further be strengthened as we integrate and leverage the core capabilities of express scripts express scripts concluded 2018 with continued strong performance and delivered its lowest commercial pharmacy trend on record of 0 4 details of which will be provided next week in our annual drug trend report express scripts also achieve better than 98 client retention for 2019 all while continuing to invest in innovations that benefit customers patients clients as well as healthcare providers overall cigna delivered very strong results in 2018 with growth across our portfolio of businesses our continued growth reflect cigna s proven approach to service integration and how it delivers real value for the benefit of our customers patients clients and healthcare provider partners a recent report on the value of integration which was externally validated show the clients with cigna medical pharmacy and behavioral benefits reduced annual medical costs by an average of 645 for each person with an identified health improvement opportunity savings can increase to nearly 10 000 for individuals with certain chronic conditions as we look forward cigna is evolving our definition and approach to integration driven by the insights we gain from a deeper understanding of our customers as well as the broader capabilities from our express scripts combination our approach to integration focuses on the coordination of services around the individual and their whole person health needs both body and mind this approach also further expands choice so access is available anytime anywhere based on our customer and patients needs and preferences to do this we must remove friction and help our customers and patients connect to the services which are best aligned to their health status in an environment where some are restricting access in order to narrowly drive affordability at cigna we see an opportunity to further expand customer choice and to make it easier for people to access the health services they need how and when they need them this includes accessing care in a doctor s office an urgent care center a retail setting or an employer clinic or for more acute needs at a facility based settings such as the hospital or outpatient service center increasingly at home in a coordinated fashion and through digital platforms that are linked with their healthcare professionals this choice based delivery model also allows us to guide our customers and patients toward solutions that help the healthy stay healthy better predict and address risk factors for the healthy at risk and ensure we deliver affordable high quality healthcare choices for the chronically ill as well as those facing acute conditions making it easier for our customers and patients is important but it is also critical for a healthcare provider partners at cigna we see our role is being the connective tissue that links customers and patients with their healthcare providers in order to help them improve their health and well being we continue to partner align with and enable healthcare providers rather than seeking to own compete with or just intermediate them our combination with express scripts strengthens and accelerates our focus on coordinating services around our individual customers and patient needs one of the steps that is essential for cigna to unlock additional value for our stakeholders is the effective integration and leveraging of express scripts capabilities our immediate priority is to ensure we deliver on our commitments to customers patients and clients in 2019 and our position to do so in 2020 this includes the strong service delivery we were able to create in january 2009 an important implementation period i couldn t be more proud and appreciative of our team s focus passion and delivery as we stepped into 2019 as a health service company we see our 74 000 co workers around the world as the greatest asset we have in carrying out our mission and delivering exceptional value for those we serve as we move through 2019 and beyond with a focus on improving affordability expanding choice and broadening our reach we have three key areas of focus first to optimize the significant medical and pharmacy cost synergy opportunities which will directly benefit our customers patients and clients and help to improve affordability second to harness the breadth and depth of our combined data to better predict and identify conditions or behaviors and improve connectivity between our customers patients and healthcare providers and third to leverage new growth opportunities and expand reach across our businesses as we enter new geographies and broaden our solution portfolio let me use accredo as an example of how we ll create real value in improving affordability and leveraging data the first two items i referenced for accredo express scripts specialty pharmacy business brings a comprehensive patient center care model to improving prescribing adherence and clinical program co ordination accredo has more than 500 specialty pharmacist and a field force of 550 nurses providing in home care across the united states in fact an accredo at home nurse is within just one hour of a home visit for 85 of americans today cigna plans to begin leveraging specialty pharma service services from accredo in 2019 to deliver affordability improvements and better health outcomes for our customers and clients considering this specialty pharmacy is the fastest growing cost category in healthcare today this will create clear and meaningful affordability benefits second when looking at leveraging data today accredo and express scripts apply advanced informatics to identify patients who are likely to be non adherent or have demonstrable gaps in care for example bluetooth enabled health monitoring devices tied to blood glucose monitors or rescue inhalers track patients health in real time basis and trigger targeted outreach and support moving forward we will further strengthen and deepen the actual insights from this type of pharmacy data by connecting it with our medical and behavioral data additionally we will share resulting insights with our collaborative accountable care physician partners to further improve their patients health outcomes connecting our physician partners with these actionable insights is especially important when supporting people who suffer from chronic conditions for example those with chronic conditions are seven times more likely to suffer from depression and as many as 6 in 10 americans live with at least one chronic condition all of which further demonstrates the importance of effectively leveraging medical pharmacy and behavioral data to drive better health building on the consultative of selling success cigna and express scripts teams our teams are already on a targeted basis identifying pursuing new enterprise growth opportunities an example includes expanding pbm services for some health plans that we currently serve through cigna s payer business additionally we have already engaged in targeted expansion opportunities for cigna s health management capabilities to be offered to express scripts health plan clients taken as a whole our integration and value creation initiatives are off to a very strong start and we look forward to discussing this in more depth with you at our investor day on may 31st before i close let me briefly comment on our 2019 outlook our growth inaudible has a proven track record of delivery and provides multiple path for sustained growth in 2019 and beyond for 2019 we expect revenue growth attractive eps growth and strong free cash flows all positioning us to deliver a 15 average annual eps growth over the next three years and enabling us to achieve our 20 million to 21 million eps target in 2021 to conclude our team strategic framework along with capital position and significant free cash flow position us to lead an environment of continuous change improve affordability expand choice and enhance predictability for our customers patients and clients all while focusing on treating the whole person both body and mind we are positioned to continue delivering attractive sustainable growth we have high we have significant strategic flexibility and financial flexibility and high visibility toward achieving our 2021 eps target of 20 to 21 per share and with that i ll turn the call over to eric eric palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks david good morning everyone my remarks today i will review cigna s 2018 results and provide our outlook for 2019 key consolidated financial highlights for 2018 include adjusted revenue growth of 15 to 48 billion earnings growth of 33 to 3 6 billion after tax earnings per share growth of 36 to 14 22 and continued strong operating cash flow these results reflect the underlying strength of our business and provide us with considerable momentum as we drive growth and advance our integration priorities in 2019 regarding our segments i ll first comment on integrated medical 2018 revenues grew 13 to 33 billion driven by commercial customer growth and expansion of specialty relationships as well as premium growth reflecting underlying cost trends we ended 2018 with 17 million global medical customers driven by an organic increase of 584 000 lives led by growth in our select middle market and government segments as we completed our eighth consecutive year of organic medical customer growth we continue to grow in both risk and aso funding arrangements with a highly consultative approach that aligns affordable solutions with the needs of our customers and clients full year earnings grew 20 to 3 5 billion on a pre tax basis reflecting growth in medical customers and specialty relationships continued effective medical cost management and favorability in our us individual business turning to medical costs for our total us commercial book of business full year medical cost trend for 2018 was 3 6 we are pleased to have delivered industry leading medical cost trend results for a sixth consecutive year and we are focused on further expanding our capabilities to improve health outcomes and medical cost performance which drives increased value for customers and clients as they continue to confront challenges with the affordability of healthcare our combination with express scripts accelerate our ability to create that value enabling us to drive further personalization of services and deeper engagement and collaboration with customers patients clients and our healthcare professional partners our total medical care ratio or mcr of 78 9 for full year 2018 reflects the continued effectiveness of our medical cost management capabilities in both our commercial and government businesses favorability in our us individual business and the pricing effect of the resumption of the health insurance tax full year 2018 integrated medical earnings benefited from 97 million pre tax of favorable net prior year reserve development including 8 million of favorable prior year development in the fourth quarter i would note the days claims payable or dcp was 40 7 at december 31st for the integrated medical segment reflecting an increase of 0 7 days over the prior year and a decline of 2 9 days sequentially due to the normal fourth quarter claim payment seasonality and our stop loss business and consistent with prior years these claims payable is generally lower for the integrated medical segment than for our previous global healthcare segment as a result of the reclassification of international healthcare products which had higher than average days claims payable due to longer claim payment cycles that business transition to the international market segment overall cigna s integrated medical segment delivered very strong financial results in 2018 turning to our health services business full year 2018 revenues were 6 6 billion and pre tax earnings were 380 ph million results for 2018 reflect solid performance for cigna s mail order pharmacy operations in support of our integrated value proposition and contributions from the express scripts business following the close of the combination on december 20th turning to our international markets business our full year 2018 results reflect continued attractive growth and profitability as revenues grew to 5 4 billion an increase of 9 and full year 2018 pre tax earnings grew 12 to 735 million reflecting solid business growth continued administrative efficiency and strategic investments for long term growth for our group disability and other operations segments full year 2018 revenues were 5 1 billion full year pre tax earnings for this segment increased to 529 million with strong performance from our life business offset by unfavorable disability claims overall segment delivered strong growth and profitability in 2018 across each of our growth platforms as i turn to a discussion of our outlook for 2019 and specifically our expectations for continued attractive growth relative to our 2018 performance i will start by highlighting the headwinds and tailwinds that we have quantified previously specifically the 2018 earnings per share performance should be adjusted for the following three items a reduction of 0 40 per share of us individual business outperformance a reduction of 0 30 per share a favorable prior year reserve development and finally an increase of 0 20 per share associated with the industry tax which was in place for 2018 but is suspended for 2019 when adjusting for these impacts cigna s 2018 earnings per share was 13 72 as we continue to drive strong value for our customers and clients we step into 2019 with momentum in each of our businesses we remain intently focused on delivering on our promises to the marketplace of outstanding service delivery and clinical quality continued innovation and deepened customer and client relationships all while we continue to advance our integration priorities i would remind you that our outlook for 2019 adjusted revenues and adjusted income from operations excludes contributions from transitioning clients for full year 2019 we expect consolidated adjusted revenues in the range of 131 5 billion to 133 5 billion we expect full year 2019 consolidated adjusted income from operations to be 6 2 billion to 6 4 billion or 16 to 16 50 per share this represents very attractive growth in the range of 17 to 20 over our 2018 baseline we would expect the cadence of earnings per share in 2019 to be approximately 45 in the first half and 55 in the second half of the year taking into consideration seasonality patterns within our businesses with our health services segment in particular driving a greater proportion of its earnings in the second half of 2019 as well as continued progress on realization of administrative expense synergies throughout the year for 2019 we also project an expense ratio in the range of 10 to 10 5 which reflects ongoing efficiencies and administrative expense synergies in line with our previous estimate of 112 million pre tax we d also note that our outlook includes approximately 200 million pre tax of temporarily stranded operating costs associated with anthem s early termination of pharmacy services for 2019 we projected consolidated adjusted tax rate in the range of 23 5 to 24 5 additionally our outlook excludes any contribution from future share repurchases as well as prior year reserve developments i will now discuss our 2019 outlook for the integrated medical and health services segments we expect full year integrated medical pre tax earnings in the range of 3 65 billion to 3 80 billion this outlook reflects strength and growth in our businesses driven by continued benefits from organic customer growth deepening of customer relationships and effective medical cost management this outlook also contemplates a return to more normalized margins in our us individual business key assumptions reflected in our integrated medical earnings outlook for 2019 include the following regarding global medical customers we expect 2019 growth in the range of 300 000 to 400 000 customers driven by continued strong customer and client retention and new growth in our commercial business as well as mid single digit percentage growth in medicare advantage enrollment and our outlook for medical customer growth also contemplates an expected enrollment decline in our us individual business of approximately 70 000 customers turning to medical costs for our us commercial employer book of business we expect full year 2019 medical cost trend to be in the range of 3 5 to 4 5 with the expected increase over 2018 full year trend due to expected higher utilization of services as well as continued benefits from our initiatives to improve affordability including those we are further enabling through the combination with express scripts we expect the 2019 medical care ratio to be in the range of 80 5 to 81 5 reflecting continued strong performance of our commercial and government businesses the impact of the health insurance tax suspension in 2019 as well as changes in business mix for our health services business we expect full year 2019 pre tax earnings in the range of 5 05 billion to 5 2 billion for 2019 we expect adjusted pharmacy claims in the range of 1 17 billion to 1 99 billion claims i would note that this range includes all claim volumes associated with cigna s mail order and specialty pharmacy operation in addition to claims associated with the acquired express scripts business our 2019 guidance range is consistent with express scripts previous expectation of 2 to 3 growth in core adjusted pharmacy claims our guidance does not include cigna pharmacy claim volumes we expect to transition from optumrx and consistent with all of our key performance metrics this guidance range does not include pharmacy claim volumes associated with transition in clients we also expect strong growth in contributions from our international markets group disability and other businesses they continue to deliver more personalized and affordable solutions for the benefit of those we serve regarding interest expense we expect total costs of approximately 1 7 billion pre tax in 2019 inclusive of approximately 900 million of incremental interest associated with the financing of the combination with express scripts in the corporate segment all in for full year 2019 we expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of 6 2 billion to 6 4 billion or 16 to 16 50 per share this represents 17 to 20 growth over our 2018 baseline but also to remind you that our outlook continues to exclude the impact of future share repurchases and prior year reserve development overall these expected results represent a very attractive outlook aided by strong performance of our diverse and differentiated portfolio of businesses and the highly accretive combination with express scripts these expected results are also consistent with our multi year growth outlook and position us well to achieve our 2021 earnings per share target of 20 to 21 per share now moving to our 2019 capital management position and outlook our subsidiaries remain well capitalized and we expect them to continue to drive exceptional free cash flow with strong returns and capital even as we continue reinvesting to support long term growth and innovation in 2018 we deployed 130 million of parent company cash to repay current maturities of long term debt we completed our debt offering to finance the combination with express scripts and we repurchased 1 6 million shares of stock for 329 million with the resumption of share repurchase following the close of the combination we ended 2018 with a debt to capitalization ratio of 50 9 as previously discussed our top capital deployment priority is accelerated debt repayment with the objective of returning our debt to capitalization ratio to the upper 30s and debt to ebitda ratio in the mid 2s within the next 18 to 24 months for 2019 we project capital available for deployment of approximately 6 2 billion in 2019 we expect to deploy approximately 4 2 billion to debt repayment and approximately 0 8 billion to capital expenditures as we have communicated previously while we reduce leverage over the next two years we expect to also have capacity for additional capital deployment which can be allocated toward reinvestment back into our businesses to drive further innovation and growth strategic m a on a targeted basis and or returning capital to shareholders primarily through share repurchase in january of 2019 we repurchased 1 1 million shares for 209 million our balance sheet and free cash flow outlook remain strong benefiting from our highly efficient service based orientation that drives strategic flexibility strong margins and returns on capital now to recap our full year 2018 consolidated results reflect considerable strength and momentum across our diversified portfolio of global businesses and continued effective execution of our focused strategy the fundamentals of our business are strong we ve entered 2019 intently focused on delivering on our commitments to the marketplace while we advance our integration priorities and are well positioned to achieve the attractive financial targets we ve established for 2019 through 2021 we are confident in our ability to achieve our full year 2019 earnings outlook and have strong visibility into our 20 to 21 earnings per share target for 2021 which represent a 15 average annual growth rate over the next three years with that we ll turn it over to the operator for the q a portion of the call questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions the first question comes from ralph giacobbe with citi you may ask your question ralph giacobbe citigroup analyst thanks good morning just hoping you could help with the bridge or the underlying assumptions a bit more within the guidance i know you mentioned the jumping off point being closer to 13 72 i think in the past you ve talked about sort of high single digit growth in the legacy cigna business even if we use 7 that s kind of 14 65 and i think at the time of the deal you said core express would be mid teens accretive which i think is at least 2 sort of an incremental and would sort of suggest above the high end of the guidance so just hoping you can maybe help with where that s offered if something has changed from your initial view and just the assumptions in underlying core performance between the segments thanks david cordani president and chief executive officer it s david good morning let me frame and offer for eric to add onto my framing first big picture for 2019 our outlook is in line with our planned expectations broadly speaking and puts us on the trajectory to deliver on our 2021 commitment of 20 to 21 of eps to appreciate you re walking through the bridge you take the core portfolio the core legacy cigna portfolio is performing well then we ll continue to perform well we step into 2019 with strong performance within express scripts from that standpoint not to quibble with you on the math but you re about right it s about 2 going back to the announcement i would just point you to one additional data point eric emphasized and highlighted the fact that within our assumption for 2019 right now is approximately 200 million before tax of temporarily stranded overhead tied to the early termination that s temporary we will eradicate that through three mechanisms one execution of ebi which remains on track but there ll be some temporary dislocation to additional leverage from organic growth in three the significant capacity leverage that we ll be created as we utilize express scripts for the cigna volumes over the near term future so when you pull all that together we are on track both delivering an outstanding result in 2019 of 17 to 20 of eps growth even including that stranded overhead eric anything i missed eric palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer i think those are the major headlines david ralph giacobbe citigroup analyst thanks operator thank you mr giacobbe the next question comes from a j rice with credit suisse your line is open a j rice credit suisse analyst thanks and thanks for all the comments around guidance i guess you guys are the first guys to have a conference call since the hhs release last night so i m proud to ask you about that since that s a top the main topic for a lot of us can you there is a lot of aspects to that i guess i would just ask you broadly do you see any particular challenges there opportunities or what would the key open questions from that proposal be and then always the question i know hhs is saying they don t have the regulatory authority to implement anything in the commercial market but if this goes forward do you think we ll maintain a two tier system where the medicare part d will have its one set and in the commercial market we ll stay pretty much as it is any thoughts on those sounds would be helpful david cordani president and chief executive officer a j good morning it s david so just appreciate the questions stepping back we are 100 committed to providing affordable high quality health and well being services to our customers patients and clients in the us and across the globe a key driving force behind our strategic combination with express scripts is to further improve on affordability and we build off of strength with another year of outstanding medical cost trend in the cigna business portfolio of 3 6 six years in a row and just a phenomenal result in the express scripts portfolio at 0 4 pharmacy trend the headline number one is the proposed rebate rule will not have a meaningful impact on our growth or earnings trajectory specifically as you noted the proposed rule will be evaluated over the next 60 days applies to medicare advantage and pdp the mechanism that exists in terms of the way rates are built up for medicare advantage as well as pdp largely by design flow and respect the rebates and path through the way the rates are billed so we don t see a major amplification to that business portfolio and then inferred in your comment it does not apply to the commercial marketplace we do see some opportunities in the proposed rule as articulated for example i provide the mechanism to even further accelerate value based care programs with the pharmaceutical manufacturers you ll recall from the day we announced our proposed combination on march 8th we talked about that as an important initiative that we passionately believe in this will provide some further accelerant to that as well as potentially open up some additional chassis to work with pharmaceutical manufacturers to get better alignment but big picture we do not see it having a material effect on the business portfolio as configured and we re on track to deliver the 17 to 20 eps growth in 2019 a j rice credit suisse analyst okay great thanks a lot operator thank you mr rice the next question comes from josh raskin with nephron research your line is open joshua raskin nephron research analyst hi thanks good morning i just want the first one is just a clarification are you guys saying that express is indeed 2 accretive in 2019 as part of the guidance and then the rest is legacy core with the 200 million of stranded and then my real question is to the combined company and sort of when do you come to market with that pitch and i know you guys have been laying the foundation for that integrated approach but when is sort of that broker consultants education began when did the large employer group starting to hear that and when do you think that actually starts to resonate and how do we start thinking about changes in direction around membership growth especially on the on the us commercial side eric palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer josh it s eric i ll take the first part of the question i think to the nearest dollar 2 is part of the right number that s actually a little bit less than that so think of it in the 1 50 to 2 range in terms of the accretion from the express scripts acquisition for next year david you take the other portion of the question david cordani president and chief executive officer josh first specific to the go to market proposition it s important to note that each portfolio and each platform is performing well and growing well we re delighted that we re able to step into 2019 with very strong growth within the esi portfolio and another year of strong organic growth within the cigna portfolio additionally important to highlight as it relates to growth as we look inaudible into 2020 within our organization growth starts with outstanding retention deepening of relationships in addition of new business relationships within the express scripts portfolio there ll be a lower percentage of their business that s out to bid for 2020 than was for 2019 and you recall a phenomenal retention result for 2019 think about that is about 30 less business and out today for 2020 versus 2019 the early look in that has the health plan part of the portfolio which is the earlier part of the portfolio that is up for renewal in terms of decision making process and we re pretty well through that process with all known clients thus far making decisions renewing and no loan losses from that standpoint so strong platform we will step forward through 2019 and 2020 with evolve value propositions to answer the core of your question interactions are starting to take place with the broker and consulting community and that will happen in a phased mechanism there will not be a singular new product offering that is pushed on the market rather additional capabilities that will offer more choice both through the legacy of the cigna distribution model as well as through the express script distribution model so strong foundation an early look at outstanding retention stepping into 2020 within the express portfolio already today and then emerging momentum around expanding choice as we sit here in 2019 we re building momentum to 2020 joshua raskin nephron research analyst thanks operator thank you mr raskin the next question comes from gary taylor with j p morgan you may ask your question gary taylor j p morgan analyst hi good morning i just had a question around the new healthcare services segment the guidance of 5 05 billion to 5 2 billion can you tell us what growth that would represent year over year or what legacy cigna pbm plus express would represent essentially because it might sort of back the envelope looks like that would be flat is down slightly but there is obviously some disclosure we don t quite have eric palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer it s eric number of the moving pieces in there so probably not constructive to walk through all of the different kind of in s and out s and dynamics there fundamentally we ve got growth reflected in terms of the operations that make up the health services segment as well as the integrated medical segments there is good growth in both but really not able to kind of pull the pieces apart in the call today david cordani president and chief executive officer and gary it s david just one add on and maybe we ll ask will and team to follow up with you afterward as the new business segments are configured you may recall and i know it s all net new is a portion of the cigna pharmacy business for example is moved into the health service business the mail order aspect et cetera however the integrated aspects of the pharmacy business remain in the integrated health portfolio so we could take that offline with you and follow up to put walk through the pieces but at the end of the day there is solid organic growth in both of those portfolios driven by our retention and expansion relationships in the net new business adds gary taylor j p morgan analyst thank you operator thank you mr taylor the next question comes from justin lake with wolfe research you may ask your question justin lake wolfe research llc analyst thanks good morning i just want to clean up the 200 million commentary then i had a question so to be perfectly clear you re saying that 19 is carrying this overhead reduction of this 200 million is that the total number of lost overhead contribution from anthem or is that is there going to be more in 2020 eric palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer justin it s eric i think of the 200 million as the amount stranded in 2019 associated with the transitional time at about 0 40 earnings per share ultimately as that business transition we ll get those costs out of the system or on track for our 20 to 21 in 2021 that the final exact timing will play out in terms of cost coming out this year versus next year as anthem takes it works through their transition plan and such but again think of that as the amount we ve estimated for this year that we will absorb and that will need to come out of the system as we go into 2021 justin lake wolfe research llc analyst okay and to be clear that s a drag on the on the services business so even though it might look like there is not much growth there that would be 200 million that you didn t expect to have this year and is that also a drag versus the accretion number given if i didn t expect to have that as well because of the timing so we should track that for those dollars of the accretion their 2 of accretion eric palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer that s correct on all fronts so think about that is is almost entirely or entirely within the health services segment and i think about that as in the short term a drag on the cost it s temporary and we re still are on track for our long term expectations there justin lake wolfe research llc analyst okay then if i could just sneak in my question on rebates express historically put out a number of 400 million i know you don t think it all goes away with commercial and can you give us an update there worst case scenario if rebates go away where do you think that would be then any comment cvs put out some discussion around rebate guarantees being affected by inflation anything there that you see as a headwind for 2019 those two those two things would be helpful thanks david cordani president and chief executive officer justin it s david good morning you ve effectively put in about four questions let me try to wrap a couple of them together first specific to the commercial side of the equation as noted previously the rebate rule is articulated and proposed does not affect the commercial market as you go back you re correct let s go back and use the numbers that we put out first for express scripts about 95 of all rebates discounts et cetera pass back second per prior conversation about 50 of all clients with an express scripts opt for today will pass through rebate models that covers importantly about two thirds of the volume so there is a little disproportionality of that the net of that is we have multiple funding mechanisms already in hand today and a line payment models that work for clients across the commercial health plan and government agency sector that work for them and work for us to get levels of alignment and we ll continue to evolve those over time specific to the rebate guarantees you ll note that we did not call that out as a headwind stepping back our industry broadly speaking has guarantees as a part of it whether that s in the formal nature of a guarantee cost offering a discount guarantee a rebate guarantee a trend guarantee or otherwise and both legacy organizations have a great track record of effectively gaining alignment and managing those on a go forward basis lastly i would just add that express scripts had some visibility into the decelerating trend environment and as such took appropriate actions with their services contracts so again we have not called that out as a headwind justin lake wolfe research llc analyst thanks operator thank you mr lake the next question comes from kevin fischbeck with bank of america merrill lynch you may ask your question kevin fischbeck bank of america merrill lynch analyst great thanks wanted to go to the cash flow guidance which you guys are providing here the numbers that you ve been giving generally speaking have kind of excluded anthem as a client so does that 6 2 billion number include any cash flow that you d be earning from anthem and transitioning clients this year or is that excluding that and then just trying to think about this number it s kind of a base to think about next year is there anything onetime in this number or just a good number to think about for 20 plenty of cash flow available to the parent if we just add earnings growth per say to that eric palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer kevin it s eric so overall think about the 6 2 billion figure that i referenced as all in so it is comprehensive for the enterprise in terms of capital generated there will be the rate and pace of us achieving our synergies the rate and pace of capital investment and the rate and pace of our debt repayment will be the main things that will go into that come to mind in terms of the kind of the top tier impacts but we would expect to have in excess of 6 billion for each of the next couple of years available in this framework kevin fischbeck bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay so even though anthem goes away earnings growth kind of makes up for that 6 billion as starting point before all the other uses of cash eric palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer right kevin kevin fischbeck bank of america merrill lynch analyst alright great thanks operator thank you mr fischbeck the next question comes from steven valiquette with barclays you may ask your question steven valiquette barclays capital analyst great thanks guys good morning dave and eric so i guess for me just another quick question here on the early anthem pbm transition i guess other than the stranded costs that you alluded to i just want to hear your view hopefully confirmatory that they really should not be any other unexpected consequences in 2019 for the remaining pbm business that cigna express related to things like either let s say less purchasing power or lower rebate collections or something like that because of their early anthem transition thanks david cordani president and chief executive officer steve good morning it s david no there will not be any impact we from the day of the announcement we excluded transitioning clients from all aspects of how we looked at the combination the business the outlook et cetera but there are no other impacts that you need to be concerned about steven valiquette barclays capital analyst okay and just a quick mlr question here on the gains 80 5 to 81 5 could you just remind us again how that compares year over year on an apples to apples basis when adjusting for the half ph to the 78 9 you just posted in 2018 is that essentially flat when you do the adjustment or it s a little higher or little lower just wanted a little more color there as well thanks eric palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah steve its eric so in terms of the moving pieces with the mlr i think the industry fee suspension is the single biggest piece the other changes i would call out would be more auto factors we ve already talked about so industry fee suspension is the single biggest fees we ve talked about the normalization of our individual plans margin i mean in the absence of prior year development in our outlook those would be fees that would account for the movement from this year into our guidance for next year steven valiquette barclays capital analyst got it okay great thanks operator thank you mr valiquette the next question comes from steve tanal with goldman sachs you may ask your question stephen tanal goldman sachs analyst good morning guys thanks for the question just that two sort of topics i wanted to touch one is just thinking about the long term earnings growth algorithm or target the 10 to 13 you guys used to put out there how are you thinking about that now and then secondly just to round out kind of the discussion on the earlier transition of anthem i guess could you kind of just give us what the new level of year one accretion assumed in the low and high end of the guidance provided as now and how comfortable are you that those costs are truly temporary and i guess just separately like why was an earlier transition of anthem s business not sort of contemplated to the initial accretion targets provided given the change in control provision of the contract david cordani president and chief executive officer steve it s david first relative to your broader or big picture question first by way of background we ve delivered approximately 15 eps cagr since 2009 so take 2009 the initiation of our strategy in 2018 we ve been above the high end of the articulated 10 to 13 range over the next three years the next chapter of our strategic horizon we are on track again to deliver 15 eps accretion on average over the next three years and we look forward to refreshing our long term outlook as we go forward so we ll have an excess of a decade of 15 eps growth outperforming our long term targets as it relates to the latter part of your question all along we understood that we are transitioning clients and we excluded transitioning clients from our eps outlook our accretion outlook et cetera no one could predict the rate pace and timing of termination the termination is an early termination it may create a temporary dislocation as eric articulated of approximately 0 40 of eps or 200 million before tax even with that we re able to deliver 17 to 20 eps cagr year over year off of a tremendous base in 2018 and we did anticipate it hence the evi initiatives are under way but we re taking those in a paced fashion and we will deliver on the evi initiatives as well as tremendous organic growth so those costs will be eradicated there is just a temporary dislocation that takes place in 2019 and even with that we re able to deliver the 17 to 20 eps growth stephen tanal goldman sachs analyst thanks so just with that i guess it sounds like maybe you re still guiding to double digit accretion x the 0 40 or at the midpoint of guidance or any color on that part eric palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer the way i would think about it steve and as we ve discussed before the core accretion fundamentals of the combination remain intact hence we re on target for our 20 to 21 and the core fundamentals of the cigna business portfolio remain intact as eric referenced in the prior question that was asked if you take the accretion that would ve been inferred on date of announcement of mid teens about a 1 90 you back off about 0 40 for the temporary dislocation of overhead and you want to back into a buildup you re about right there in 2019 and even with that we re delivering the 17 to 20 eps growth rate thanks stephen tanal goldman sachs analyst perfect thank you operator thank you mr tanal the next question comes from zach sopcak with morgan stanley you may ask your question zach sopcak morgan stanley analyst hey thanks for the question so i want to ask about the other transition with your members shifting from optumrx two questions one is there how straightforward of a transition is that and is there anything in that process you re concerned about in terms of the member experience and two like i understand that s not going to impact 2019 earnings but is it at all a significant contributor to that 15 of cagr to get to your 2021 target range thank you david cordani president and chief executive officer zach good morning it s david so stepping back remind you today we own and operate our own pbm and it s successfully done so for many years we also implemented the successful strategy five six years ago to break it into modules and to partner with others to perform some of those modules for us initially catamaran that transitioned to optum and it s worked quite well and successfully with optum as a good constructive partner earlier this year we announced on a line plan in time frame with optum in terms of our shared view in terms of an orderly transition that will take place that positions us in a way to have a very disciplined orderly transition of those services and relationships and there is a good track record of transitioning services to them and transitioning services back to us within the respective modules and that ll take place over the next approximate two year horizon it ll create some significant volume uptake for express scripts which is a positive one way you can think about that is the cigna volumes on today s basis when internalized within express scripts make up order magnitude of 75 maybe a little higher 75 of the lost volumes from anthem so it s quite significant but it will take place on a rateable basis over the next couple of years and again we have a successful track record of in a very disciplined basis of transitioning services to and from other providers hope that helps operator thank you mr sopcak the next question comes from peter costa with wells fargo securities you may ask your question peter costa wells fargo securitiesq analyst so along that line david can you explain have you accelerated the optum timing of bringing that business in house relative to anthem choosing to go early away from you and when did anthem notify you of their decision to go early david cordani president and chief executive officer good morning answer to your questions is no we had a very orderly indiscipline process laid out we have a very successful and growing captive pbm we have a very successful strategy approach that we ve been executing within the captive pbm and a very strong partnership relationship with optum around shared value delivery we laid out a very orderly timeline that allows for a disciplined two year transition putting our customers front and center and the coordination services with our physician partners so that timeline and the strategy around that is commensurate what we believed was appropriate and highly aligned with our service provider partner peter costa wells fargo securitiesq analyst and then when did anthem notify you of their decision and should i assume that 75 of the 0 40 of stranded overhead goes away with just from optum coming in house eric palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer not going to get into the dates and timing i think peter to the second part of your statement a way to think about the overhead that we articulated before there are three mechanisms to dispatch of that and it will be removed first and foremost a very disciplined evi plan that was laid out and is being executed in an orderly basis two good organic growth and then we started 2019 with good organic growth in the express scripts portfolio and third the very disciplined leverage of the cigna volumes within the portfolio all of that will contribute to and the evi program was put in place to actually take out the cost structure so we see some additive opportunities as we look to the future from the sustained organic growth in the leverage of the cigna capabilities operator thank you mr costa the next question comes from david macdonald with suntrust you may ask your question david macdonald suntrust analyst yeah good morning david just one quick question you now have a meaningfully scaled mail order business i was wondering if there is an opportunity to potentially sell additional products or services through that channel over time and now that you ve deepen the combination of pharmacy and medical is there also an opportunity to expand and further leverage some of the incremental clinical horsepower express brings things like evercore therapeutic resource centers et cetera david cordani president and chief executive officer david good morning so to your first question i appreciate it tremendously and express scripts is built and has a proven track record of having a pretty phenomenal mail order fulfillment capability so it s a service capability that s aided by quite innovative technologies patents et cetera and we will on a disciplined fashion continue to look at how that core capability that you come back to potentially could be used and leverage for other services that benefit customers patients or clients on a go forward basis and i appreciate the call out specific to the clinical integration and clinical leverage absolutely absolutely a core part of our both organizations got excited about from early conversations was the shared leverage i articulated in their prepared remarks a little bit between leverage around the accredo capabilities relative to the deep clinical excellence they have coupled with the home health coordination services that exist and bringing some of that together secondly from a data set standpoint the ability to enrich insights for practicing clinicians to more comprehensively understand the life or health needs of patients and as you articulate within the core evercore capabilities there are tremendous opportunities where we are on a focused basis already working through additional step function improvements in the clinical capabilities of the combined corporation which gone back to benefiting our customers and clients and further improving affordability and clinical quality so yes to both points and we couldn t be more excited on the early traction on the second point already operator thank you mr mcdonald the next question comes from scott fidel with stephens you may ask your question scott fidel stephens inc analyst hi thanks good morning i had a question just on i know you are not giving specific earnings guidance anymore for our international and group insurance so just interested if you could give us maybe some more qualitative or directional commentary and how you re thinking about earnings trends for those two segments in 2019 eric palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer scott it s eric thanks for that a couple of headlines that come to mind for me on there so first of all i ll continue to have good growth momentum in both businesses we would expect that we will continue to grow in both and the differentiated return to work platform we ve got in the disability business continues to serve as well and again continues to be a growth chassis for us then the international markets business again continue to grow that platform as well closed on november 30th on our acquisition of onepath life in new zealand just as an example of the continued expansion of the international markets platform in chassis still continue to move that forward as well but overall really no changes to the underlying growth story and the momentum that we ve gotten into those businesses operator thank you mr fidel the next question comes from matthew borsch with bmo capital markets you may ask your question matthew borsch bmo capital markets analyst maybe just if i can ask a question this way on the rebates relative to the draft rule understanding that the commercial payers are not immediately into or not impacted by this rule but if so if rebates were to disappear entirely in theory what would be the earnings impact at this point for commercial eric palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning david we don t have a theoretical eps answer to the theoretical action you articulate stepping back an attempt to be helpful again about 95 of all discounts and rebates within the express scripts portfolio pass through and are shared about 50 of our clients opt for today for pass through rebate relationships and that equates to because of the scale of those clients equates about two thirds of the volumes and previously indicated express scripts retains about 400 million that s a before tax number i would add the reason why i think your question to be is unanswerable as the model continues to evolve so the evolution of value based contracts and our shared direction in terms of continuing to move toward and more comprehensively toward total cost total value relationships with our clients whether they are commercial clients health plan clients or governmental agencies is the direction that express scripts was on is the direction of the cigna has been on and it s the direction that the combined corporation goes forward on so those tools and leverage continue to evolve and you ll see us continue to move away from trying to perceive maximize a single lever as opposed to maximize the overall value which is total cost and total quality as we go forward operator thank you mr borsch the next question from comes from charles rhyee with cowen you may ask your question charles rhyee cowen and company analyst hey thanks for taking the question wanted to ask you obviously reaffirmed the year 2021 target of 20 to 21 a share i just wanted to put that into context with you previously kind of guided synergy target about 600 million and if we think about now with the transitioning of anthem a little bit early when we think about that number 20 21 in relation to the guidance and then you obviously outlined some your growth excited about growth opportunities and optimizing the medical and pharmacy side of it what pieces contribute that trajectory toward the 2021 and i guess what i m really asking is can you start to kind of quantify for us a little bit sort of sizing what you think these other opportunities are in relation to the 600 million because if i recall correctly that 600 million was largely an overhead kind of a synergy target thanks eric palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer charles it s eric i ll start with a couple of other pieces and maybe ask david to give some more overall color and commentary so at a macro level we continue to be on track with the synergies as assumed and as we discussed back in 2018 and as we disclosed in this for last year the synergies that we ve put out and that were quantified there primarily reflect lower administrative costs and we would expect that those would occur over multiple years over the first four years of the transaction we re generating 112 million of pre tax administrative synergies for 2019 and that builds to 600 million in 2022 you re correct that we expect to generate meaningful additional improvements in the pharmacy and medical costs through the combination both through the clinical combinations and some of the other items that david discussed today those benefits will primarily in order to the benefit of our customers and clients as it is again in terms of the synergy pieces those are the pieces you should think about and we re on track and consistent with how we teed up the transaction initially dave will give some additional color here david cordani president and chief executive officer and so just a bridge when you think about today to 2021 we try to articulate there is three major building blocks to get to the 20 to 21 per share the underlying base performance of both assets the synergies that eric just made reference to and you articulated the 600 million of before tax synergies and the impact to the p l of the deleveraging which we re already on board for the deleveraging path that s the basic crosswalk between 2018 and 2021 additional opportunities above and beyond that which we said are not built into the accretion model our further leverage and enhancements of the growth chassis of the portfolio as we go forward and identify additional opportunities for growth whether it s net new growth or further deepening of relationships anything beyond what the core businesses are performing is excluded from that today as well as potential additional value at a shareholder level versus passing back to the customer and clients from the leverage of express scripts for the transition of the cigna portfolio into the express scripts portfolio so the basic crosswalk is base performance synergies and deleveraging to get us from 2018 to 2021 operator thank you mr rhyee the next question comes from ana gupte with svb leerink you may ask your question ana gupte svb leerink analyst hey thanks good morning can i follow up on the this question just now on the express synergies more on a near term basis both administrative and medical can you talk about on the administrative side is there anything you can do to accelerate the schedule you provided in the s4 or in today s guidance and how much of it is potentially even going to retain your business in the july renewal season 11 2020 ph season given anthem is now talking about 3 billion in savings much sooner optum is 250 or 300 and pmpy savings just from rx and then to follow up on david your commentary around the power of express and cigna together when will we see proof of concept on that combined business as far as medical cost trend or medical loss ratio impact or you know accelerated share gains and growth david cordani president and chief executive officer ana good morning it s david let me try on the points to be responsive here specifically as eric has articulated a couple of times there is a 112 million of synergies shareholder synergies we signed up for in 2019 so a step toward the 600 million you ll note we re being very disciplined we re making sure that the expense has come out in an orderly basis we may outpace that but the business plan and the guidance we ve articulated doesn t assume that and with that and with the transitioning client impact et cetera we re delivering 17 to 20 of eps growth specifically as it relates to the medical and pharmacy cost synergies and value creation that will unfold throughout 2019 and 2020 and benefit our clients and customers on a client or customer basis depending on the products program and the services they have and i would note that we have very good growth and outstanding retention in all of our business portfolios stepping into 2019 and we can have another good growth year and i articulated an early glimpse to express scripts renewals for 2020 which we re tracking very very favorably right now as it relate to proof of concept you should not think about cigna coming back to you with a net new proof of concept of something de novo we are seeking to build that doesn t exist today as a concept to roll out in the marketplace rather we are systematically further enhancing the value propositions for our commercial clients for our health plan clients for our government agency clients and offering more choice which will unfold in 2019 and 2020 with expanded capabilities and further clinical integration and effective use of data at our investor day we will seek to bring some of those to life with both words examples and challenge ourselves to give some tangibility even in terms of some of the supporting technologies and workflows but it is not a net new concept the capabilities unfold pretty rapidly throughout 2019 and we ll expand additional choice for the benefit of clients and customers as we step into 2020 operator thank you ms gupte the next question comes from frank morgan with rbc capital markets you may ask your question frank morgan rbc capital markets analyst good morning thanks for the color on the anthem optum swap of business 75 of that volume could be recovered but when i think about it from a profitability standpoint how should you be thinking about the profitability on the anthem book loss versus the savings you ll realize by bringing that back in house that s number one and then number two was just one of the headwinds you re calling out for the year was the outperformance you saw last year in the integrated medical segment i think mainly the individual segment is there anything specifically that you would like to call out as to why that should revert or is it just simply conservatism thank you david cordani president and chief executive officer good morning it s david on your first question i would ask you not to think about the profitability of those two components step away from it we ve excluded the transitioning clients from all aspects of our conversation from the day we announced the proposed combination and the earnings impact of that from an eps standpoint have been excluded we have in 2019 this temporary dislocation of overhead that from a whole transparency basis we walked through laid out 200 million before tax and that ll be removed from the system in a pretty expeditious fashion and we have multiple levers to address that but i would ask you not to think about profitability of the cigna portfolio versus the anthem portfolio because they re not comparables from that standpoint as it relates to the individual market you are correct we articulated in our third quarter call the fact that we re quite pleased with the performance of the individual portfolio of businesses we expect it to be profitable in 2018 it is it s outpaced the high end of our strategic margin threshold and for 2019 planning purposes we believe it s prudent when you look at that program and the design of that program to plan for margins that are more in line with our strategic margin trajectory which is somewhere between 4 and 6 before tax and for 2019 we ve planned for it to be at the higher end of the range which we think is a more sustainable indication of what that portfolio programs there is nothing systematic beyond in terms of dislocation in that marketplace we just believe it was appropriate to plan for in view that marketplace runs in a 4 to 6 before tax margin versus the significant margin that was delivered above and beyond that in 2018 operator thank you mr morgan the final question comes from dave windley with jefferies you may ask your question david windley jefferies company analyst hi thank you good morning thanks for squeezing me in david the disability business has been on a journey to kind of evolve process and bring margins back up to normal levels and then this quarter calls out some unfavorable claims are those things at all related do any actions needed to be taken relative to the unfavorable disability claims and then one last clarification on the 200 million if you were as you have said excluding anthem from all the results were those 200 million allocated to that exclusion and now they become real or another way to think about it weren t those 200 million stranded from the very beginning because of the assumption that anthem would be excluded eric palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer david it s eric so maybe i ll take the second one first on that i really just think about the 200 million is kind of a timing matter right so the cost that would have been allocated to the contract they would have been gone away for all the reasons david described earlier it is in the q a session here i m thinking about the timing just because of the earlier transition now that those costs won t be able to be allocated to the volumes that would be going away through there but think about it that way on the group life and disability you know we ve talked a number of different calls over time about the variability that can happen on any one line quarter by quarter things along those lines i wouldn t call it anything particularly systemic or anything along those lines but just that we had favorable life insurance experience and a little bit unfavorable disability experience in the quarter here operator thank you mr windley and now i ll turn the call back to david cordani for closing remarks david cordani president and chief executive officer thank you to wrap up our call i d just like to highlight some key points from our discussion cigna delivered substantial earnings and revenue growth across our businesses in 2018 we re committed to broadening our approach to integration which

see all our earnings call transcripts prepared remarks operator good day everyone welcome to this exxonmobil corporation fourth quarter 2018 earnings call today s conference is being recorded at this time i d like to turn the call over to the vice president of investor relations and secretary mr neil hansen please go ahead sir neil hansen vice president of investor relations and secretary thank you good morning everyone welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call we appreciate your participation on the call and continued interest in exxonmobil this is neil hansen vice president of investor relations joining me on the call today is our chairman and ceo darren woods as we ll discuss on the call today we are very pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter and with our full year results this was a quarter highlighted by continued value generation from our integrated business model additional growth in liquids production and successful high grading of our downstream portfolio 10 stocks we like better than exxonmobil when investing geniuses david and tom gardner have a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has quadrupled the market david and tom just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now and exxonmobil wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of january 31 2019 in addition we made significant progress on investments that will generate long term accretive value for our shareholders after i review the quarterly financial and operating performance darren will provide his perspectives on our business reflecting on 2018 and the year ahead following this darren and i will be happy to take your questions our comments this morning will reference the slides available on the investors section of our website i d also like to draw your attention to the cautionary statement on slide 2 and the supplemental information at the end of this presentation which starting this quarter you ll notice includes a listing of significant nonoperational events that impacted quarterly earnings moving to slide 3 i ll now highlight the developments that influenced fourth quarter performance crude oil prices decreased during the quarter with brent down 7 51 and wti down 10 62 conversely gas realizations were up in the fourth quarter supported by strong lng prices and seasonal demand henry hub was also up 0 74 production in the permian increased another 12 relative to the third quarter and was up 93 from the fourth quarter of last year exploration success continued offshore guyana with the pluma discovery our 10th find so far on the stabroek block the resource estimate in guyana is now greater than 5 billion oil equivalent barrels in mozambique we secured offtake agreements for the rovuma lng project as we progress toward a final investment decision which remains on track industry refining margins weakened across the globe with lower seasonal gasoline demand and higher inventories this was partly offset by stronger distillate margin in north america we successfully leveraged our logistics capacity to capture significant value by moving advantaged crudes from the permian and western canada to our manufacturing facilities we also started up on the third of our six key refinery projects the advanced hydrocracker at our rotterdam refinery this advantaged investment increases our capacity to produce higher value products including ultra low sulfur fuels and group ii premium lubricant base stocks we continue to high grade our downstream portfolio with the divestment of our augusta refinery and related terminals in italy and our germany retail assets while long term fundamentals remain strong in the chemical business margins weakened during the quarter the supply length from recent capacity additions pressured realizations we safely completed a turnaround at our singapore facility and progressed integration of our jurong acquisition with our nearby petrochemical complex i ll now go through a more detailed review of fourth quarter results starting first with the upstream on slide 4 fourth quarter upstream earnings were 3 3 billion a 900 million decrease relative to the third quarter of 2018 the absence of favorable u s tax reform impacts and current quarter asset impairments negatively impacted earnings by 670 million crude realizations decreased by 18 during the quarter with a decline in industry markers and wider north american differentials the estimated unfavorable impact of those wider differentials on upstream earnings relative to the third quarter was 350 million however integration with logistics and manufacturing resulted in more than that value being realized in the downstream having takeaway capacity that exceeds our upstream production allowed us to realize a corresponding estimated benefit again relative to the third quarter of approximately 600 million in the downstream gas realizations increased 18 in the fourth quarter on stronger lng pricing and seasonal gas demand an increase in production driven by continued volume growth in the permian and seasonal gas demand in europe contributed 660 million to fourth quarter earnings favorable foreign exchange effects and other items each positively impacted earnings by 100 million moving to slide 5 and a comparison of fourth quarter upstream production to the third quarter of this year production in the fourth quarter was 4 million oil equivalent barrels per day an increase of more than 200 000 oil equivalent barrels per day if you exclude the impact of entitlements and divestments volumes were up 5 as a result of seasonal gas demand and continued liquids growth the absence of impacts from the downtime event that occurred earlier this year at syncrude and volume growth in the permian resulted in a 3 increase in liquids production in the fourth quarter natural gas production was up 11 primarily due to seasonal gas demand in the netherlands moving to slide 6 and a comparison of fourth quarter upstream earnings with the fourth quarter of 2017 if you exclude the effects of u s tax reform and impairments earnings increased 1 2 billion higher prices increased earnings by 660 million driven by a 2 increase in natural gas realizations partly offset by a decline in crude realizations and again that resulted primarily from wider north american differentials we estimate the unfavorable impact of those wider differentials on the upstream again relative to the fourth quarter of last year to be approximately 750 million the estimated corresponding margin benefit that we captured in the downstream from our fully integrated value chain was 1 2 billion when compared to the fourth quarter of last year liquids growth driven by permian and hebron increased earnings by 180 million favorable foreign exchange effects contributed approximately 80 million while all other impacts increased earnings by 270 million those other items included favorable non u s tax impacts and the absence of unfavorable onetime items from last year and that was partly offset by some higher operating and exploration expenses slide 7 provides a comparison of fourth quarter volumes relative to the same period as last year liquids production increased 7 excluding the impact from entitlements and divestments that growth included a 93 increase in permian production and an additional volume from hebron now while not shown on the page i also wanted to highlight that full year production was 3 8 million barrels per day and if you exclude the effect of entitlement and divestments of approximately 130 000 oil equivalent barrels per day volumes finished the year essentially in line with 2017 levels and the guidance we provided at the march 2018 investor day now moving to slide 8 i ll review downstream fourth quarter financial and operating results starting first with a comparison to the third quarter of this year downstream earnings of 2 7 billion increased by 1 billion with the capture of significant value from our north american integrated operations and portfolio high grading downstream refining margins weakened during the quarter however this was more than offset by the value we captured from north american crude differentials with our integrated logistics network this allowed us to connect barrels to our manufacturing facilities and contributed to a favorable margin impact in the downstream of approximately 500 million we had higher scheduled maintenance in the quarter which decreased earnings by 460 million proceeds from the divestment of germany retail assets and the augusta refinery and fuels terminals contributed 870 million to earnings improvements in refining yield and sales mix supported by the start ups of the beaumont hydrofiner and the antwerp coker partly offset by some related expenses contributed 70 million to earnings all other items included favorable inventory impacts and tax items turning now to slide 9 and a review of current quarter downstream earnings relative to the fourth quarter of last year again if you exclude the effects of u s tax reform and impairments downstream earnings were up almost 1 8 billion margins had a 550 million positive impact on earnings with significant value from wider crude differentials in north america and in fact we estimated a benefit across the integrated downstream value chain of approximately 1 2 billion relative to the same quarter as last year this was partly offset by a lower lubricants margins and lower refining margins in some regions significant reliability improvement was partly offset by higher scheduled maintenance resulting a resulting in a positive contribution of 130 million the divestment of the germany retail assets and the augusta refinery and fuels terminals which was partly offset by the absence of a norway retail divestment that occurred in 2017 contributed 680 million in the fourth quarter improvements in refining yield and sales mix with the start up of new refinery investments and a growing retail network in markets like mexico partly offset by some related expenses resulted in a positive contribution of 200 million all other items reflect favorable inventory impacts in tax turning now to slide 10 and a review of current quarter chemical earnings relative to the third quarter of this year fourth quarter chemical earnings were 737 million lower margins negatively impacted earnings by 110 million as polyolefins margins declined with lengthening supply from new industry capacity additions we had a onetime non u s tax impact that resulted in a positive contribution of 210 million other items included higher expenses from new assets and growth initiatives turning now to slide 11 and a review of current quarter chemical earnings relative to the fourth quarter of last year including the effects of u s tax reform and impairments chemical earnings decreased 190 million from the prior year quarter lower margins resulted in a 350 million decrease again driven by lengthening polyolefins supply with new industry capacity an increase in polyethylene sales from new assets had a positive contribution to earnings of 100 million scheduled turnaround activities in singapore which we completed in the fourth quarter had a negative impact of 90 million the same onetime non u s tax impact resulted in a positive contribution of 210 million while all other items included higher expenses from new assets and growth slide 12 provides a review of sources and uses of cash fourth quarter earnings adjusted for depreciation expense changes in working capital and asset sales gains yielded 8 6 billion in cash flow from operating activities and it s important to know that depreciation in the quarter was higher than the normal trend line through the previously mentioned current quarter asset impairments of approximately 700 million on a before tax basis we experienced a 1 3 billion negative working capital impact in the quarter this was driven by an inventory build for planned maintenance in the downstream and some seasonal tax payments mostly in europe other noncash items of approximately 1 billion included adjustments for gains on the fourth quarter divestments in germany and italy as a reminder although both the germany and augusta divestments occurred in the fourth quarter we actually received the cash proceeds from the germany divestment in the third quarter had those proceeds been received this quarter our cash from operations and asset sales would have fully covered divestments and distributions fourth quarter pp e additions were 6 5 billion driven primarily by increased activity in the permian basin we also reduced debt in the quarter by 2 3 billion i ll now move to slide 13 which summarizes full year 2018 financial results 2018 earnings excluding the impacts from the u s tax reform and impairments were 21 billion up 40 from the prior year driven by higher prices liquids growth and the value from north american integration cash flow from operations and asset sales was 40 billion including 4 billion in proceeds from asset sales now that 4 billion in asset sales was slightly above the previous five year average that we have of asset sales of about 3 3 billion 2018 capex was 26 billion 2 billion above the guidance provided at last year s investor day largely driven by incremental acquisitions during the year and notably related to brazilian acreage in the upstream and the indonesian lubricants company that we acquired in the downstream free cash flow after investments was 20 billion more than enough to cover the 14 billion in dividends paid during the year debt ended the year at 38 billion a 4 5 billion decrease compared to the end of 2017 now let me provide a few observations regarding the first quarter before i hand it over to darren upstream volumes should be largely consistent with fourth quarter levels in the downstream we are seeing significantly weaker industry refining margins with lower seasonal gasoline demand and excess production in addition the curtailments in canada coupled with additional logistics capacity coming online in the permian has led to much narrower crude differentials to start the year while these changes will impact results versus the fourth quarter they again demonstrate the advantage of integration as opportunities open and close across the markets along the value chain we are positioned to capture them scheduled maintenance this year will be like what we experienced in 2018 with the level of activity in the first quarter similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter of 2018 chemical margins are expected to remain under pressure as the market continues to work through supply length from recent capacity additions we expect quarterly corporate and financing charges to be somewhere between 700 million and 900 million and finally we do not expect any significant asset sales in the first quarter at this time i would like to hand it over to darren darren woods chairman and chief executive officer thank you neil and good morning everyone it s great to be on the call today let me just start by providing my perspective on the past year i think as you all know and will recall in march of last year we laid out an investment plan to structurally improve the earnings and cash flow potential of our business while improving our returns across a wide range of price environments as i reflect on 2018 i am extremely pleased with the progress we ve made on those plans we not only delivered on our commitments for the year we identified additional upside the price environment in 2018 was unpredictable which once again demonstrated the value of our integrated business model we saw significant swings in commodity prices compounded by the transportation constraints in the permian basin in western canada our upstream integrated logistics and manufacturing position allowed us to avoid the impact of market dislocations and thus capture the full value of our barrels this reflects a deliberate strategy to leverage the scale and breadth of our integrated business model which certainly paid off in 2018 against the backdrop of a fairly volatile margin and price enviroment we met earnings expectations for the year and generated 40 billion in cash flow from operations and asset sales the highest level since 2014 this in turn enabled us to fund our ongoing investment program reduce our debt and consistent with one of our long standing priorities increase the dividend in 2018 we increased our dividend by 6 marking the 36th consecutive year of increases central to our plans for growing value is the advancement of a portfolio of advantaged investments throughout the year we continued to develop and rigorously test our investments to make sure that our company s competitive advantages were translating directly into project advantages giving us some of industry s lowest cost of supply developments over the past year have reaffirmed our belief in the strength of our investment portfolio which is the best we ve seen since the merger of exxon and mobil in fact as we worked through the year we identified significant upside to our plans which brings me to a critical focus area of 2018 on delivering on the project milestones for the plans that we laid out back in march we remain extremely confident in our ability to deliver on our plans and let me give you a brief overview of the advances that we made in 2018 i ll start with the upstream each of the five growth area growth opportunities we outlined back in march saw significant progress over the year in guyana our track record of exploration success continued with five additional discoveries during the year resulting in an updated resource estimate of more than 5 billion oil equivalent barrels with our success we added another drillship to accelerate the pace of exploration and the pace of drilling we now see the potential for at least five fpsos producing more than 750 000 barrels per day by 2025 another key focus for deepwater development is brazil where we have quickly built an industry leading acreage position since the investor day last year we increased our acreage position to 2 3 million net acres in the permian we continue to expand and accelerate activities we believe we have a unique opportunity here to bring the full strength of exxonmobil through the development of unconventional resources to bring scale bring fundamental science and technology bring large scale efficient development and bring an integrated well to market approach it s one of the reasons we moved xto to houston to integrate their work and skills into the broader capabilities of exxonmobil it s why we believe our approach will deliver the lowest cost supply and give us a significant advantage over the rest of industry as we ve optimized our development with further drilling and delineation we see additional upside well beyond the growth trajectory that we shared previously we ll discuss this in more detail in march when we meet at our investor day we continue to make good progress on projects in our lng portfolio tng and mozambique remain on track for a final investment decision we ve also been working very closely with qp our partner in golden pass to advance that investment and look forward to announcing something here in the very near term in the downstream the widening crude differentials in north america are a good reminder for why it s important to keep our growth plans for the permian integrated with our logistics and manufacturing footprint in the gulf coast we ve been very active in securing additional takeaway capacity for our production in the permian as well as putting plans in place to ensure that our logistics capacity grows in tandem with our production and refining expansions to meet growing demand for higher value fuels and lubricants we are progressing six major refining investments all advantaged versus industry over the past year three of those facilities started up namely the beaumont hydrofiner antwerp delayed coker and the rotterdam advanced hydrocracker these projects significantly enhance the earnings and cash flow capacity of our downstream business and position us well for the upcoming imo spec changes next year the remaining three projects are progressing in line with the plans that we shared in march in our chemical business we outlined plans for 13 new facilities to meet growing demand seven have been brought online the remaining six are on schedule we expect these investments to support a 30 growth in sales by 2025 driven by our proprietary technologies that provide advantaged products and applications we made excellent progress toward this objective in 2018 with sales growth of 6 as we said last march all of our investments leverage some combination of our competitive advantages to deliver industry leading returns technology almost always plays a critical role a great example is our advanced hydrocracker project in rotterdam the project uses a first in the world combination of proprietary process and catalyst technology which convert heavy intermediate streams into group ii base stocks a significant upgrade with this investment rotterdam becomes the only worldscale group ii base stock produced in europe and it supplements our group ii production in the u s and asia allowing us to more effectively serve our global customer base we expect this one project alone to double earnings for the rotterdam site making it one of the most competitive refineries in europe as we speak today the hydrocracker is up and running and producing on spec product in line with our expectations let me shift now to 2019 and some key themes for the year ahead starting in the upstream we expect to sanction a number of key projects including the next two phases of guyana liza 2 and as well as two significant lng projects mozambique and golden pass let me just add here too that we advanced the fid of from the middle of 2020 to late 2019 again reflecting the development plans and the progress that we re making beyond the plans we laid out last year later this year we plan to mobilize the fpso for the first development of phase in guyana putting us on track for an early 2020 start up with the advances we ve made and our permian development plans we expect to accelerate the pace of our investments and increase our production profile consistent with this this week we announced a final investment decision for the beaumont refinery expansion which will further add to our integrated permian advantage we also announced the formation of the wink to webster jv to progress the permian long haul pipeline that will give both baytown and beaumont the industry s most efficient transportation link to the permian we brought three important refinery projects on in the back year of last year back end of last year in 2019 our focus will be on fully leveraging their advantages in addition we re going to continue our push into new growth markets like mexico and indonesia ensuring that we capitalize fully on our brands in the chemical business we re on track for a midyear start up of our beaumont polyethylene expansion further strengthening our position in the gulf coast we also plan to fid two projects at baytown that will produce vistamaxx which is a high growth high performance propylene plastomer and alpha olefins used in packaging oils waxes and other specialty chemicals these projects along with the others we ve discussed will allow us to continue to grow sales of high value high performance products as i step back and reflect on the opportunities we have across all three of our business sectors i remain very excited by the potential to generate significant value for our shareholders as you may have seen yesterday we announced the formation of new upstream and project organizations these new organizations will help facilitate the successful delivery of our investment opportunities the upstream is reorganizing into three companies down from seven the upstream oil and gas company will have five distinct global businesses each business will have full accountability for end to end results from resource development to production to marketing over the entire life of the resource from discovery to abandonment the upstream integrated solutions company will provide functional expertise to bring the full advantage of the company s scale our technology and experience to each global business third company upstream business development will oversee the upstream strategy and activities to upgrade the asset portfolio through exploration acquisitions and divestments this will increase the focus on portfolio optimization and ensure that we continue to aggressively pursue all available value added opportunities including divestments we re also combining the project s organizations from the upstream downstream and chemical into one global projects company which will allow us to more effectively leverage the company s proven project capabilities neil hansen vice president of investor relations and secretary we understand the webcast dropped we apologize for that so we re going to turn it back to darren and let him finish and then we ll take q a darren woods chairman and chief executive officer i ll try to pick up where i understand we dropped off which was turning to 2019 perspectives in the chemical business i was saying that we re on track for a midyear start up of our beaumont polyethylene expansion which is going to further strengthen our position in the gulf coast we re also planning to fid two projects at baytown that will produce vistamaxx which is a high growth high performance propylene plastomer and alpha olefins used in packaging oils waxes and some other specialty chemicals these projects along with the others we discussed will allow us to continue to grow sales of high value high performance products as i step back and reflect on the opportunities we have across all three of our business sectors i m very excited by the potential to generate significant value for our shareholders you may have seen yesterday that we announced the formation of new upstream and project organizations these new organizations will help to facilitate the successful delivery of our investment opportunities the upstream is reorganizing to three companies down from seven the upstream oil and gas company will have five distinct global businesses each business will have full accountability for end to end results from resource development to production to marketing over the life of the resource from discovery to abandonment the upstream integrated solutions company will provide functional expertise to bring the full advantage of the company s scale our technology and experience to each global business the third company upstream business development will oversee the upstream strategy and activities to upgrade the asset portfolio through exploration acquisitions and divestments this will increase the focus on portfolio optimization and ensure that we continue to aggressively pursue all available value added opportunities including divestments we re also combining the project organizations from the upstream downstream and chemical into one global projects company which will allow us to more effectively leverage the company s proven project capabilities across our entire investment portfolio now we already implemented many of the concepts behind the new design about a year to 18 months ago the permian development and the chemical cracker in corpus are two great examples of what came from that rewiring the organization will allow us to sustain the new way of working and make it easier to leverage across all of our businesses and opportunities in addition it will improve the upstream integration with our downstream and chemical businesses this is particularly important given the growth and value opportunities we are capturing with the increased upside particularly in the permian and guyana we expect capex to be 30 billion in 2019 an increase of about 2 billion from the guidance we gave in march before i hand it back to neil let me just offer a few closing thoughts we remain fully committed to growing shareholder value that commitment is the driving force behind the growth plans that we ve shared with you we feel good about the progress we made in 2018 and the delivery on our commitments we remain very confident on our ability to execute our forward plans and are very excited about the additional upsides the management team and i are looking forward to reaffirming the plans we laid out last year and sharing additional detail on the upside when we meet next month at our investor day with that let me hand it back to neil neil hansen vice president of investor relations and secretary ok thank you for your comments darren we ll try again on q a so we ll turn it over now for any questions you might have questions and answers operator thank you mr woods and mr hansen we ll take our first question from doug terreson with evercore isi doug terreson evercore isi analyst good morning guys and congratulations on your results and your progress neil hansen vice president of investor relations and secretary thank you doug good morning doug terreson evercore isi analyst so darren while the returns profile of your investment portfolio looks to be pretty strong i think you highlighted that as the super majors refocused on areas of competitive advantage during the past decade or so that you use divestitures as a fairly productive capital management tool and on this point while you guys have had divestitures too your activity levels have been below peers whether including bp which obviously had an event or not and so you talked about this a minute ago i just want to see if you would elaborate on your comments about divestitures as a portfolio management tool or portfolio optimization tool i think is the way you termed it whether there s a philosophical reason why exxonmobil hasn t been as active as some of the peers and whether divestitures might be more prominent for you guys in the future given the restructuring that you highlighted darren woods chairman and chief executive officer sure thanks doug thanks for the question happy to spend some time talking about that i think we made reference to it last march one of the advantages that we have today is as the prices came off in the back end of 2014 and we leaned into the markets and as we ve talked about loaded up our pipeline of investment opportunity with some very attractive projects that has allowed us to reoptimize and look at the total value of portfolio if you go back in time we ve had a pretty regular divestment program investing about 50 billion worth of assets since 2008 what we can now do in the upstream with this additional project and these investment opportunities we have is increase the focus there so i would expect to see more activity in divestments in the upstream side of the portfolio that s going to be driven really by the opportunities that the market brings we ve got i think a pipeline of assets that we think would make sense to market we re actively doing that and we ll see as we go through the year what opportunities kind of come to fruition i would add though doug that this is a value play we re not trying to hit some schedule associated with it we re really trying to make sure that we can realize the maximum value out of the assets that we have in our portfolio as i mentioned the new organization is going to help us do that doug terreson evercore isi analyst no i m sure thanks a lot darren darren woods chairman and chief executive officer thank you doug neil hansen vice president of investor relations and secretary thanks doug operator next we ll go to phil gresh with jpmorgan phil gresh j p morgan analyst hi good morning darren and thanks for being on the call today i guess the first question would be around you talked about some areas where capital spending is moving higher and your permian rig count has certainly accelerated versus what you talked about in march so without getting too far ahead what you want to talk about at the analyst day maybe you could talk about at least how you re thinking about 2019 are you comfortable with the level that you re running at now or do you see further opportunity darren woods chairman and chief executive officer yes hi phil thanks what i will say if you look at 2018 and as neil mentioned the additional capex we spent there was really the acquisition of a couple in a couple areas brazilian acreage and then we had i think a real nice opportunity in indonesia to supplement our lubricants business and so i think ex the acquisitions that weren t built into the plan we were pretty much in line with where we expected to be on capex as i just said going into 2019 we expect to be around 30 billion and that does reflect the progress and the opportunities that we re seeing in guyana the upside that we ve seen there as well as the permian we just talked a little bit about the permian because i think one of the things we re challenging ourselves with and looking at the unconventional resources is what value what unique value can exxonmobil bring to this resource play and so we have spent the year really making sure that we understand the play that we ve got doing some delineation but at the same time leveraging the full capability of exxonmobil to bring scale and scale development along with technology additional technology and research into the permian so i think what you ll hear in march is a good overview around how exxonmobil is uniquely coming into the unconventional resources to make this a low cost long term successful development play phil gresh j p morgan analyst ok and i guess just my second question would be on chemicals that would be if you think about 2018 that was an area i think you expected to see some earnings growth in 18 and it was bit more challenging so maybe you could just talk a little bit more about what you re seeing both from macro factors but whether maybe there are any company specific factors there as well or if it s all just kind of a macro situation darren woods chairman and chief executive officer yes i think in the chemical business and across all of them frankly one of the points we try to make at the analyst meeting is we don t try to take a position on price for margins and where things are going to be we try to make sure that the investments we re making are robust to the cycles that we see in these businesses and are aligned with one our advantages but two the long term potential for these businesses so if i look at chemical the growth that we see in chemical remained and the foundational elements of that business in industry remained very strong we continue to see demand growth above gdp going out into the future saw that in 2018 4 demand growth so very comfortable with what we see as the macro trends from a demand standpoint in chemicals the challenge that we saw in 2018 i think will carry some into 2019 is the amount of supply that s come on if you look at the demand growth and focus on stream crackers for a minute you probably need about three to four world scale steam crackers every year to keep up with demand in 2018 i think six came on so a lot more supply than what the annual growth would be but the industry will grow out of that and we positioned ourselves to make sure that we capture that long term growth we don t get overly focused on the timing of every project and when they re going to show up those things shift around a bit we ve got more projects the industry projects coming on in 2019 that timing will move around and i think we ll see margins move with the timing of that new supply coming on but again i think the current environment is not a concern for us we ve leveraged all those projects we ve put in place have leveraged our advantages and made sure that we re on the low cost of supply so irrespective of where we re at in the cycle we re going to be advantaged versus the rest of the industry phil gresh j p morgan analyst ok thank you operator we ll take our next question from sam margolin with wolfe research sam margolin wolfe research analyst good morning darren woods chairman and chief executive officer good morning sam margolin wolfe research analyst you touched on this a little bit darren in your perspective section and neil quantified it too with the integration benefit of 1 2 billion but i was hoping to ask you to elaborate a little bit in the context of the pipeline and the refinery fids in the u s that were announced this week you ve got a lot of crude coming on stream in other places and so is the fact that there s a lot of u s kind of value chain investment a function of trying to balance the portfolio and the u s is the easiest place for you to do that given your existing footprint or is there something commercially about the u s and where these supply chains go through that kind of makes you feel like the u s is a place where you really want to be an exporter of finished products and not necessarily incremental crude just a little bit of background on your on the molecules you specifically want to target in the u s versus internationally darren woods chairman and chief executive officer we re happy to do that sam thank you and good morning yes i think as we look at that and the value of integration it is really a function of the markets that you re in and the structure of those markets so let me just give you an example of why we think there s a big opportunity here in the permian it s a very fast growing area it s inland and so you ve got key you need key logistics to move in and out of that and so as we re rapidly growing production in the permian as the industry is rapidly growing production in the permian there are going to be periods of disconnect as the pipeline and logistic systems try to keep up with that rapid production growth our view is we don t want to be exposed to those disconnects and so we have been looking across our integrated chain and one of the advantages that exxonmobil has is we can see across that whole value chain because we participate along the whole value chain and so making sure that as we are developing our plans in the permian at the same time we re developing our plans and our logistic system s developing the plans in the refineries so that we make sure that that stays connected the refinery investments that we re making stands somewhat alone they accommodate our production but they re somewhat alone and disconnected from our physical molecules the opportunity there is just take advantage of the transportation differential between bringing crude in from west texas in the permian versus importing it in from some of the locations so that s the margins and what we expect to get out of the refinery expansion is just really a transportation differential in play and that combined with our advantages make those attractive so when you look at us and hear us talking a lot about the integration it is really with western canada crude and in permian because of the specific nature of those markets and some of the other markets we re in we are close to tidewater we don t have the same kind of market dynamics that value doesn t manifest itself as explicitly sam margolin wolfe research analyst ok thanks so much and then just a quick follow up you mentioned the small step up in capex in 2018 versus your analyst day guidance was a function of some acquisitions some opportunistic acquisitions you had specifically in brazil going forward are you going to try to pair asset sales with opportunistic acquisitions like that or are these adds just a function of returns and there s no sort of cash balancing consideration at work here as well darren woods chairman and chief executive officer yes i would tell you we re not we don t have a formula where we re trying to balance ins and outs it really comes back to maximizing value so if we see an acquisition an opportunity there that we think has some high potential and is accretive to value we re going to pursue that i d also say at the same time we recognize as we bring more attractive opportunities into our portfolio that gives us an opportunity to trade out some of the existing assets and the more we bring in and front end load the pipeline and we prioritize across the highest value investment opportunities by definition some will get moved out as we move those assets and those projects back we have the opportunity to trade on that others that don t have the same pipeline of opportunities that we do will see a higher value sooner and gives us a chance to trade so i would expect to see that ramp up and i don t think we re going to constrain ourselves to try to balance those things out but i d expect to see more divestments coming out of the upstream and i know neil chapman and his team are very focused on that sam margolin wolfe research analyst ok thank you so much darren woods chairman and chief executive officer you re welcome neil hansen vice president of investor relations and secretary thanks sam operator next we ll go to neil mehta with goldman sachs neil mehta goldman sachs analyst good morning and thanks darren for being on the call today the first question i had was just on the base business and can you just talk about outside of the major capital projects when you think about the balance of the existing portfolio how you see declines playing out from here what are you doing to mitigate those declines and talk about some of the larger legacy assets like groningen where we have seen some volume declines and how do you intend to either offset that or do you look to allow that to continue to happen as you try to maximize returns and cash flow darren woods chairman and chief executive officer sure hi neil it s good to hear from you again let me just say too i m happy to be on the call and spend some time talking about our business i m real happy and pleased with how the organization has kind of come together and we ve challenged them to make sure that we re maximizing and leveraging the full capability of the corporation one of the changes driving our upstream reorganization is to make sure that the upstream businesses have the accountability and the ownership to maximize profitability and value for their assets and for their value chain and that philosophy as i mentioned in my comments have already been pushed out into the organization and so what we re seeing in terms of short term day to day operations is i think real aggressiveness at looking for opportunities to grow value i mentioned to you that we ve identified a number of upsides as we went through the year those were bottom up upsides as the organization really focus on where they could find and extract additional value not just from the new projects but also from the base business so i feel good about that and they will make decisions day to day around what s economic in terms of offsetting decline and making sure that we re getting a good return for every dollar that we spend to bring that production back with respect to groningen that s a slightly different dynamic as you know with some of the tremors and the concerns legitimate concerns expressed by the community there we worked fairly closely with the government and made sure that we had a mechanism to kind of address those concerns in a responsible way that agreement that we reached with the government entailed a change in the fiscals take the fiscals for the groningen resource back in line with the rest of the gas business and the netherlands and so i think all of that has been reflected in our go forward plans and very comfortable that what we re doing and the growth that we ve got will more than offset any reduction that we see there neil mehta goldman sachs analyst i appreciate it and the follow up question is just on liza just as we talked about in miami it sounds like you guys are full steam ahead toward that 750 000 barrel a day long term target do you see potential upside to that base case number and then curious how you re thinking about the timing of phase 2 especially given some of the uncertainty from a political perspective down in guyana darren woods chairman and chief executive officer yes we still feel really confident about what we re doing there and advancing liza i think as we ve talked about already with the discoveries that we ve announced we see additional fpsos there and that resource we re still a long way as i mentioned in miami from fully exploring the opportunity set there so as we continue to advance that exploration we ll see how it plays out and we re optimistic that we ll find some additional opportunities there and that will continue to grow that resource with respect to phase 2 liza 2 that continues to be on track with the schedule that we ve put in place and let me just address this the comment that you made around the government and some of the things happening there i think it s important to keep in mind when we go into countries we go in with a mindset that we re going to be there for a lifetime 30 to 40 years you can t have a successful development if you re only talking to a subset or a narrow section of your stakeholder group so we have been engaged with the sitting government with the opposition with communities making sure that the development and what we re doing is understood and the people are aligned on that so the opposition understands the contracts that we have in place i think they understand the value that will that that development will bring to guyana and the people of guyana so i think it s very consistent with how we think about a long term approach to engaging with companies and countries neil mehta goldman sachs analyst thanks darren we appreciate the increased transparency darren woods chairman and chief executive officer sure neil hansen vice president of investor relations and secretary thanks neil operator next we ll go to alastair syme with citi alastair syme citigroup analyst hi thanks for taking my questions my first question just as you look at the lng market you re clearly trying to sanction a lot of projects over the next couple of years so historically exxonmobil have sought to secure most of the offtake before a sanction is that still the way you look at the market and do you have increasing observations about the changing market dynamics darren woods chairman and chief executive officer yes well thanks alastair you re right that has been the historical model i think as you kind of make reference implicit in your question is that market is evolving i m not sure it s going to evolve as quickly as some people are predicting it but we certainly see a change and i would anticipate as we make those investments and bring lng on that we ll evolve along with the market and make sure that we re positioned to maximize the value of those investments and that may mean more portfolio activity in the future but again we re going to pace that in that development consistent with how that market develops alastair syme citigroup analyst ok thank you a quick follow up question just a point of clarification on the capex i think in 2018 you had around about 3 billion of acquisition capital does your 2019 budget incorporate something around a similar level is that how you think about the budget darren woods chairman and chief executive officer no typically when we re putting together our plans if we ve got something a line of sight on something that we think has got a high chance of closing we ll try to reflect some of that if we don t have any of those then it won t show up in the plans so it tends to kind of vary depending on where we re at and the line of sight that we have on the opportunities alastair syme citigroup analyst great thank you for taking my questions darren woods chairman and chief executive officer you re welcome thank you operator next question comes from the line of john herrlin with societe generale john herrlin societe generale analyst yes hi darren with respect to the upstream reorg are all these new entities or groups going to report still to neil or do they report to the committee darren woods chairman and chief executive officer so the new streamlined organization one of the big benefits that we have there is moving from seven upstream companies down to three those three companies and presidents will report to neil chapman john herrlin societe generale analyst ok great then a next one for me is i guess for neil could you address what the impairments were in the u s and internationally upstream neil hansen vice president of investor relations and secretary yes so john as i mentioned there were and you can see the detail in the supplemental information as well we had about 400 million after tax in impairments in 2018 about half of that related to a u s gulf of mexico asset and then the other half related to unconventional activity in north america john herrlin societe generale analyst ok i missed that thank you neil hansen vice president of investor relations and secretary you re welcome operator we ll next move to biraj borkhataria with rbc biraj borkhataria rbc analyst hi thanks for taking my question it was on lng again could you just talk a little bit about the rationale to move forward with the golden pass project and then also how that competes with some of the other options you have particularly mozambique and then a potential qatar expansion if you were to participate there thank you darren woods chairman and chief executive officer sure thanks biraj let me just maybe start with the philosophy of how we look at competing investments if you will or the opportunities within our portfolio i ve said this before in different audiences but our strategy here and the way we make decisions on investment is those investments have to compete versus the whole of industry not just what we have in our portfolio so the emphasis that we put on our different projects is how do they fit in with the industry s projects and the additional capacity that they re going to bring on and make sure that those projects have the advantages needed to be on the lower end of the cost of supply curve so that they will be very competitive versus any other industry projects that come on that s very important because as we just talked about with the chemical business in a high growth while we see a lot of high growth opportunities in lng capacity will come on in big chunks it won t be necessarily coordinated so we ll see i suspect periods of oversupply and so when we see that period we re going to have to make sure that our investments are robust to lower market prices and then as the growth continues and the market tightens up we ll see advantages there as well so the focus is really on making sure our projects are competitive in the landscape of the industry with respect to golden pass i think it s got a lot of strategic value if you think about the gas business in the u s the quantity of gas available to the marketplace the associated gas that comes on with some of the crude development we continue to see from a supply standpoint a very attractive supply gas market in the u s for us then we ve got an opportunity to leverage our existing turn facilities which gives us an advantage and then it also allows us with a supply point here in the atlantic basin and north america for a lot of optimization as we look to supply the global markets and so i think we ve got some unique advantages with the existing facilities we ve got advantages with the industry supply source here in the u s and then we ve got advantages in terms of a global lng business and the ability to optimize across that whole portfolio and including the work that we do with qp and optimization with that integrated portfolio biraj borkhataria rbc analyst can i just ask a very quick follow up in terms of timing you ve got mozambique which maybe fid 2019 and 2020 and then golden pass moving forward would you expect to you re going to do both the developments concurrently or should we expect one to be pushed back a little bit darren woods chairman and chief executive officer yes each of them will be a function of kind of the contract availability and how that plays itself out i ll tell you with the strong growth that we re seeing in the lng market lots of demand that supply is going to chase here and so i think we ll make sure we re going to make sure that those developments occur on a very efficient cost effective way and as i said before with the advantages that we are building into these projects it ll be low cost to the supply and so less worried about what others are doing and making sure that we bring those on in a cost effective manner biraj borkhataria rbc analyst great that s helpful thank you darren woods chairman and chief executive officer you re welcome operator next question comes from the line of doug leggate with bank of america merrill lynch doug leggate bank of america merrill lynch analyst thank you apologies folks i don t know if there was a technical issue on your end as well but i had to dial back in again so sorry about that first of all darren let me also reiterate my thanks for you getting on the call today but i wonder if i could get pre empt you a little bit on the upcoming analyst day your rig count in the permian is about 50 above what you guided last year or at least the target for the end of the year and clearly there is multiple additional growth potential in guyana is your intention on a high level to would that notionally increase the targeted growth or would you intend to do more with less or perhaps accelerate disposals to keep the overall kind of scale of your expectations through 2025 darren woods chairman and chief executive officer yes thanks doug well i think in march we re going to have a really comprehensive conversation about how all this pulls together i ll tell you with what we laid out for the permian last march that was very early into the development of that resource and what i talked about earlier with respect to trying to leverage the capacity and the skills of not only xto but the full exxonmobil advantages has led us to i think a very unique concept for developing the permian resource and so i think and we ll lay that out in march talk about how we re approaching that and the investments that we re making there so that will be kind of a story onto itself we re also with guyana as we continue to see opportunities and leverage what we re already doing there s a lot of efficiencies continuing to roll into production as we have more discoveries and find resources that we can bring on so i think again we re going to we ll update you with that but if we continue to have success in exploration continue to build on that momentum take advantage of the efficiencies and bring on very attractive very low cost of supply as all that kind of comes to fruition our expectation is we d see more earnings and more cash and bring in more returns and at the same time we ve got the opportunity now to kind of flex that portfolio and we ll optimize to make sure that we re not leaving any value on the table we want to bring in npv forward as much as possible but do it in a way that keeps cost in control and stays within the capability of our organization so that s kind of a constant evaluation and testing that we re doing i think the new organization that we re putting in place is going to help us more effectively advance some of these investment opportunities so we ll kind of roll all that together and lay out what the implications are going forward in march doug leggate bank of america merrill lynch analyst i appreciate that my follow up hopefully a quick one is just on the reorganization i realize your disposals this year run i think above the kind of guidance or the list guidance you ve typically given in the past about what you d expect that scale to be should we read the reorganization in somehow accelerate or brings forward the focus a little bit more in other words would you anticipate your disposal program to get even larger as you move forward and i ll leave it there thanks darren woods chairman and chief executive officer yes yes thanks doug i think as we mentioned we ve got the upstream business development group which is really their focus is on what i ll call as the frontend of the pipeline the project s portfolio and optimizing that portfolio that i think is going to bring an additional degree of focus into that space not only from an exploration standpoint but from an acquisition as well as divestment so i would anticipate from an upstream standpoint we will see the pace of divestments accelerate if you step back and look at it in the context of the corporation and you go back in time a lot of the divestments we ve seen came out of the downstream and so the mix will change as we go forward and then the level maybe slightly up or consistent with what we ve done in the past doug leggate bank of america merrill lynch analyst i appreciate you taking my questions guys thank you darren woods chairman and chief executive officer you bet thank you doug operator next question comes from the line of roger read with wells fargo roger read wells fargo analyst good morning and like everyone else welcome to the call darren darren woods chairman and chief executive officer thanks roger roger read wells fargo analyst i guess we could maybe just talk about capex plan this year the 30 billion and you re able to pay off some debt last year but i think if we were to take the capex back to the 30 billion level we d be more of a neutral level in 19 and then if you adjust crude prices to the strip we d probably be looking a little bit of a debt add in 19 i was just curious not so much whether or not you need to borrow a couple billion or pay back a couple of billion but just understanding how you re thinking about capex within the overall cash flow environment and then what that could mean for increased shareholder distributions presumably at this point just on the dividend front darren woods chairman and chief executive officer sure let me kind of maybe just remind reemphasize the priorities that we ve got about capital allocation and how we re approaching that first and foremost if you re looking at the long term value of our corporation particularly on the upstream side which is a depletion business you ve got to have a healthy pipeline of attractive investment opportunities and that has been one of the things that i know over the last several years the management team here has really been challenging themselves with around reloading that pipeline and making sure that we got projects and project opportunities that go way up to the future to bring value in and our intention would be to bring those projects on consistent with our plans irrespective of the price environment and the reason for that is we built those projects and tested those projects to make sure they re robust to a low price environment so if we were to find ourselves in an environment where prices were low that would actually i think benefit those projects in terms of as as activity falls away in the industry you tend to get lower cost construction so that might play in our favor but we would continue on that path and then consistent with that and one of the reasons why we keep a balance sheet the way we do is to allow that to happen and not have to adjust the business up and down with the cycles that makes for a very inefficient capital development it also prevents you from taking advantage of the down cycle and a lot of the things that come positive from a down cycle and so our strategy has always been to make sure that we ve got robust capital structure to support continued investment at capex through the cycle making sure we ve got enough dry powder to take advantage of the down cycle if an opportunity presents itself an acquisition opportunity potentially and at the same time make sure that our cost of leverage remains very competitive and to do all that with investments with our balance sheet continue to fund reliable and growing dividend we feel like that s an important priority for a lot of our shareholders so that s kind of the equation then we get into buybacks and i ll tell you we ve challenged ourselves on the investment front we ve challenged ourselves on our organization and our ability to effectively deliver the advantages that we have as a corporation and to bottom line results i think you ve seen changes there and we re also challenging ourselves around the optimum capital structure and what we want to make sure that we re leveraging the full advantage of that capital structure that s what s going on and i m very optimistic that we ve got a very strong portfolio of investments that are backed up by very strong capacity and capability of the corporation roger read wells fargo analyst ok thanks for that and maybe just as the follow up as we think about maybe more dispositions coming from the upstream sector how should we think about the cash flow that comes from that is that to reinvest in the upstream or do you think as you move forward obviously nothing in q1 probably but as we think about the latter part of 19 and into 20 does the cash flow go to the balance sheet or is it capex supporting or is that maybe what you re thinking about in terms of getting back to more of the historical shareholder returns darren woods chairman and chief executive officer i would say as we progress that divestment program and to the extent we have success finding buyers out there that put a value on it that we think is attractive for a transaction we re not waiting for that in order to fund our capex our investment program is not a function of waiting for cash to come so i would not expect to see as divestments progress see that translate into additional projects in capital investment that is an independent decision again related to some of the things i talked about in terms of the strength of the opportunities we re looking for which then says any addition cash would come in would came to the point i just made around the optimum capital structure and whether we pay that down in debt or whether we move it out as a buyback and as i said we re taking a real hard look at that and making sure that we re striking the right balance there operator all right your next question comes from the line of jason gabelman with cowen jason gabelman cowen and company analyst yes hey guys just a couple of questions firstly on guyana what s going on with the government there i appreciate that you ve already addressed this question a bit but if i could push a little deeper if there is kind of a pause in who s running the government i mean are you one concerned that you may have to ramp down investments there and two is there somewhere else where you would put that money to work in if there is a potential pause or slowdown in the pace that your developing that asset darren woods chairman and chief executive officer yes i frankly given the discussions that we ve had since really coming to guyana with the stakeholders that we ve got across the political spectrum there given the discussions about the advantages this development brings and the recognition of those advantages by a very wide constituency in guyana we really don t have any concerns about the political dynamics that are happening there we understand that that s the nature of governments and countries around the world we basically expect governments to change over time again when you re coming into a country for 30 plus years i think it would be extremely naïve to think that you re only going to have one constituency there for the time frame so again we take a very broad based approach i think all the feedback we ve got the alignment that we have in country supports what we re doing here because they recognize the value that it s going to bring to guyana so real happy about that and as i said i think the phase 2 is on track remains on track we don t see that coming off at this point and obviously we ll see how things develop there but we re not particularly worried about it given the value and the strength of that investment jason gabelman cowen and company analyst that s very clear thanks secondly just on capital spend and i appreciate the 2019 guidance that you provided do you have a view on what 2020 and beyond is going to look like relative to the guidance you gave at the at your last analyst day darren woods chairman and chief executive officer yes jason i think i m going to stick with the guidance we gave for 2019 i think in a month s time we re going to kind of layout the longer term plan again consistent with the 2025 time frame and talk about the upgrades that we re seeing and the opportunities that we re seeing and how we re factoring that into the plan and we ll provide some a better prospective at that time jason gabelman cowen and company analyst all right thanks a lot darren woods chairman and chief executive officer you re welcome operator next we ll go to jason gammel with jefferies jason gammel jefferies analyst thank you very much gentlemen my first question relates to the technology that you have deployed at the hydro cracker in rotterdam it seems to be a pretty significant uplift on margins relative to the old technology i was just curious whether this is something that you will be able to deploy on a wider scale or is there something unique about rotterdam that really kind of restricts it to that location for now darren woods chairman and chief executive officer yes thanks for the question i think so what that development or that project in rotterdam leverages is the catalysis and the technology we have the advantages that we have in catalysis and so that s a unique application based on our understanding and our ability to develop unique value added catalysts opportunities like that exist across the portfolio obviously it may involve different catalysts but we ve talked about our singapore project where we re looking at upgrading heavy residue molecules that would also look to leverage some of this technology and use some of this proprietary catalyst to make that conversion from a very low heavy low value residue into higher value products diesel and loose base stocks so there is broader application obviously it depends on the nature of the molecules that you re trying to upgrade but we feel and that s one of the reasons why we ve challenged ourselves for a long time we weren t investing in the downstream because and i can say this with a lot of intimacy because i was involved it in at the time we weren t going to put in kind of a bog standard industry technology and get industry returns we were going to force ourselves to find technology that allowed us to get above industry returns rotterdam is a great example of that i think singapore will be another great example of that and hopefully we ll be able to share some additional examples as we move forward and find additional applications i m pretty optimistic jason gammel jefferies analyst i look forward to that my second question also relates to the lng portfolio can you discuss whether you were interested in participating in the expansion at qatar lng and if so how would that rank relative to the three other lng opportunities that you have in the portfolio currently darren woods chairman and chief executive officer yes we ve got a very long term presence and partnership in qatar i think we value that there it s a good partnership we ve had a lot of success working with qp i would certainly look to continue to extend that i think we re aligned to how we think about the business and the opportunity and value each other s partnership so yes absolutely interested in continuing to partner with that and to develop resources and opportunities in qatar it is a very low cost supply gas which as you ve heard me talk about is an important element in the lng projects that we re advancing with respect to how that would fit into our portfolio i d come back to the discussion we ve had we are looking at these opportunities not on the basis of what we have in our portfolio but on the basis of what industry has in its portfolio and we re going to advance the opportunities that we think are advantage versus the rest of industry if we can t find an investment that does that even if it looks good in our portfolio we won t pursue it because frankly it s going to have to compete on an industry wide basis and that is the hurdle that we re using we don t want to make decisions based on what we have we want to make decisions based on how competitive it will be in the industry and that applies not only to lng but every other thing that we re doing in this company from an investment standpoint jason gammel jefferies analyst i appreciate your thoughts gentlemen thank you darren woods chairman and chief executive officer you re welcome operator all right we ll next go to paul cheng with barclays paul cheng barclays analyst hi guys good morning darren woods chairman and chief executive officer hi paul neil hansen vice president of investor relations and secretary good morning paul paul cheng barclays analyst first i d just want to say thank you to neil hansen to put in the page identified the large earning item impacting on the quarter that we really appreciate on that for darren a couple of questions then first with your reorganization you talked about how that it may accelerate your asset sales effort how about on the other side of the ledger on the acquisitions side is that going to have any meaningful impact and also if you can comment on what you believe today in the market is the bid ask environment is still too wide apart or you actually think that there s a reasonable expectation on the environment at this point darren woods chairman and chief executive officer ok yes thanks paul i think it s hard to what i would tell you is the reorganization is definitely going to improve the focus that we have on both sides divestments and acquisitions so i would expect to see additional thinking and focus on opportunities on both sides of the ledger there whether that results in anything or any acceleration on the acquisition side is really difficult to tell because frankly it comes to your second question which is the bid ask spread for us to pursue an acquisition it has got to have to bring some unique value to our shareholders we re not going to do a me too deal out there and so i think what we have to look for is something that fits in the portfolio and allows us to leverage something unique to exxonmobil which brings more value than on a stand alone basis and i think that s going to be the key driver i don t think there s anybody s out there looking to discount their business and so it s really got to find a way to bring some value there that doesn t exist otherwise and i think those opportunities are there it s just a function of finding them and seeing where the market goes and how willing sellers are and what their expectations are so i d just say we re going to stay very focused on that and see what opportunities bring us paul cheng barclays analyst the second question then i think digitalization seems to be the best word among some of your peers and some people may even try to quantify that how big is the potential impact of the saving to the business but exxon given your technology that we were actually a little bit surprised that you guys haven t really talked too much about that and then when are you coming up with any quantification that how much it may mean to your business is that something that you can share on that i m sure that you guys all have the expert looking at that darren woods chairman and chief executive officer yes you re right we do i think it is as some of our peers may have talked about a very high potential area a lot of opportunity to bring additional value we ve got an organization dedicated at looking at that i think one of the advantages that we have that organization is not is looking across the entire portfolio there are a lot of synergies when it comes to digital across our manufacturing and production platforms across our operations and chemicals downstream and the upstream and so we think given our size given the fact that we participate all along the value chain the data that we have probably is the best in industry and then our ability to mine and leverage that data to improve operations i would say our capacity continues to grow we re taking a what i would say is a thoughtful methodical approach to it to make sure that we re building structures and data structures and digital tools that allow us to do that in a comprehensive way across the globe and to leverage that value and so it s a very important area i would not expect us to start putting numbers on that and sharing it i think for us it s an advantage it s going to be a competitive advantage it s one we ll keep in house paul cheng barclays analyst i see all right very good thank you darren woods chairman and chief executive officer you re welcome neil hansen vice president of investor relations and secretary i think we have time for one more question operator we ll take our last question from pavel molchanov with raymond james pavel molchanov raymond james analyst thanks for squeezing me in guys just one question from me you ve alluded to the well known regulatory issues at the groningen field but when we look at your total european gas volumes down 12 versus a year ago even if we exclude groningen there would be close to a double digit decline so what explains the continual declines in your north sea gas outside of groningen darren woods chairman and chief executive officer well we divested our norway business last year and so that s going to have a material impact and that s probably what you re seeing there and then on top of that obviously gas demand and gas production is very seasonal depending on weather and temperatures and that s going to play into it as well pavel molchanov raymond james analyst ok wasn t this kind of a cold winter though in europe darren woods chairman and chief executive officer not if you look not if you look at compared to previous no pavel molchanov raymond james analyst ok thank you guys darren woods chairman and chief executive officer you re welcome thank you pavel neil hansen vice president of investor relations and secretary great thank you for your time and thoughtful questions this morning we appreciate you allowing us the opportunity today to highlight our fourth quarter and full year that included strong earnings and cash flow performance supported by continued liquids growth and value capture from our integrated business model

the current cycle of economic expansion has reached 74 months and is now tentatively the longest in japan s postwar history according to the government s monthly economic report for january since the boom cycle corresponds to the second administration of prime minister shinzo abe who returned to the government s helm in december 2012 administration officials are touting the benefits of the extended boom such as an improved job market and corporate earnings as the fruits of the prime minister s trademark abenomics policy and indeed they may be but the generally modest growth over this period also reflects what has not been achieved under abenomics the nation s workforce has increased by 3 75 million during this boom cycle close to the number of jobs created during the asset inflated bubble boom from the late 1980s to the early 1990s with brisk demand backed by strong corporate profits combined with the intensifying manpower shortage in the rapidly graying population the labor market is now the tightest it has been since the mid 1970s there is an average of more than 1 6 job openings for each job seeker listed companies have been posting record profits for several years and the nikkei average on the tokyo stock exchange has more than doubled with the government taking steps to promote inbound tourism as a key growth sector the number of foreign tourists has more than tripled to top 30 million last year on the other hand economic growth has been much more moderate than in past boom cycles average annual gdp growth has come to a mere 1 2 percent lower than the 1 6 percent during the previous longest boom from 2002 to 2008 and a far cry from the 5 3 percent during the bubble or the robust 11 5 percent in the izanagi boom from 1965 to 1970 when strong demand for consumer durables backed by people s rapidly rising income shored up the economy despite the robust corporate earnings and the tight labor market growth in inflation adjusted net wages has stagnated as a result consumer spending grew only 0 4 percent a year on average meanwhile the 2 percent annual inflation target set by the boj and the government in 2013 as a benchmark for busting deflation remains nowhere in sight though the nation is now certainly out of the deflationary spiral of continuous price declines that stifled economic activity
for the last 20 years venezuela has been conducting an experiment into what happens when a government declares war on all forms of expertise and in the last five years the results have become clear you get one of the biggest economic catastrophes in modern history despite having the largest oil reserves in the world venezuela s economy has shrunk by 47 per cent since the end of 2013 that to put things in perspective is twice as bad as greece has done during the euro crisis and if trends continue will soon be worse than either zimbabwe did during its hyperinflation or even ukraine did in the years after communism collapsed which is to say that barring countries beset by civil war venezuela is on the verge of having suffered more economic damage than anyone else in recent times what s made this even more painful though is that venezuela also has the worst inflation in the world today the international monetary fund for its part guesses that it will be 10 million per cent by the end of this year but it s just that a guess our best estimate is that it s actually only around 112 000 per cent not that that s much consolation the price controls that the government has used to try to deny this reality meanwhile have only led to the country being short on food and medicine why stock your shelves if you re forced to sell things at a loss and long on lines and violence it s an economic crisis that s begotten a humanitarian crisis that s fueling a migrant one about 3 million people or 10 per cent of their total population have fled to neighboring countries such as colombia the venezuelan currency is so worthless that some artisans are making purses and other figures out of banknotes more than a thousand bills worth just a few us cents are used photo getty images how did a country that should have been so rich end up so poor well there are two stories you normally hear and neither is correct the first is that this is just about oil venezuela s economy after all depends on it so it doesn t exactly seem like a surprise that the one has collapsed when the other one has too the only problem with this is that as true as it is it isn t true enough all you have to do is look at saudi arabia it s no less reliant on oil but it has managed to grow 11 per cent the past five years something else then must be going on in venezuela and if you listen to fox news you know what that s supposed to be socialism the idea as former new york mayor michael bloomberg put it is that radical redistribution has inevitably killed venezuela s golden goose if that were the case though why has a country such as again saudi arabia been able to spend a lot of its oil money on its people without suffering the same sort of fate or a country such as denmark been able to raise taxes far above what venezuela s ever tried while still growing at a healthy clip the answer of course is that socialism is not really to blame what s actually happened is that low oil prices have revealed the extent of the venezuelan government s mistakes which had nothing to do with taxing the economy too much and everything to do with managing it too poorly read more money so worthless workers are paid in tyres the simple story is that the government took over one sector of the economy after another steel mining agriculture just to name a few and got rid of people who were good at their jobs so they could bring in ones who were good at being loyal this made production predictably crater and things that used to be made at home suddenly needed to be bought from overseas the government could at least cover up how much of the economy had been hollowed out this way as long as high oil prices gave it the money it needed to buy things but it was never able to cover up as much as it should have because its oil industry was being hollowed out too the chavistas you see had fired most of the experienced engineers who had been striking against them forced out foreign companies that actually knew what they were doing and just generally treated the state owned oil company as a piggy bank that they could take money out of without ever having to put anything back even as oil production fell off for lack of investment that s why the government had to turn to the printing press to pay for things even when oil prices were in the triple digits and has really had to now that crude prices have fallen so much the past few years the best way to think about the chavista regime then is as an extremely shortsighted mafia instead of charging businesses for protection nice factory you got here be a shame if anything happened to it the government simply looted them until there was nothing left it tried to pretend this wasn t happening by using some of its oil profits to give people homes and health care and when that wasn t enough printing the money it needed instead but eventually it couldn t even do that once those profits disappeared and it had to print so much money that it became worthless and despite all this there s no guarantee that the chavistas are going to lose their grip on power far from it the military is staying on their side against the opposition why because as bad as the chavistas have been for the economy they ve been kind of good for themselves and their cronies it s not just about the wealth they ve expropriated it s that they ve set up a system where they can make money off its destruction for some of them that s meant using the machinery of the state for drug trafficking for others it s been using the regime s preferential access to dollars to make risk free profits in the currency markets but in any case the story s been the same ruin is working out just fine for them which when you think about it might be the worst news of all it means that this experiment in human misery may have a long way to go
chinas growing presence among the islands of the south pacific worries australia new zealand and the united states and some island governments are now pushing back against that presence but when it comes to both island governments and many local citizens the biggest issue at the moment appears not to be geopolitics but the issue of illegal chinese fishing chinese fishing trawlers have been scooping up tuna fish a main source of protein for islanders for tourists the south pacific conjures up visions of romantic beaches heritage and culture world class diving and natural wonders as an australian travel agent put it but on the less sunny side the writer michael field warned nearly two years ago that illegal fishing much of it by china is costing some of the worlds smallest and poorest nations hundreds of millions of dollars its important to keep in mind that in six of the 18 pacific nations and territories the gdp per capita comes to only 2 100 to 5 700 a year possible destruction of tuna industry inside esoteric fishing rights conferences it is common knowledge that chinas new and powerful boats could within a decade destroy the 3 billion a year pacific tuna industry field wrote forthe spinoff bulletin in new zealand overfishing of a single species can reduce the size of a fish population to the point where it can no longer reproduce resulting in what is sometimes referred to as a crash in that population the congressionally funded u s china economic and security review commission uscc said in a report published in mid june of last year that tuna is a vital source of food and employment for pacific islanders for some south pacific countries it said the tuna within their 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zones eezs are their only major renewable resource however in recent years the uscc report said increasing competition with subsidized chinese vessels declining catches and depressed tuna prices are pushing many local tuna fishing fleets to exit the industry in contrast the growth of chinese fishing fleets worldwide has been sustained by chinese tax exemptions as well as by central and local government subsidies chinese fishermen reach as far from home as west africa and latin america so it should be no surprise that theyve begun showing up in greater numbers in the south pacific chinese fishing companies are motivated by high profits and members of chinas growing middle class are willing to pay for high quality fish china underreports distant water catches a 2012 european parliament study found that china massively underreports the catch of its distant water fleets but chinese boats are not the only foreign vessels to fish in the south pacific boats from taiwan and sometimes from italy and spain can be seen there though in smaller numbers than those from mainland china the united states is also part of the picture as the uscc notes the united states negotiates access to pacific island fisheries through a south pacific tuna treaty the treaty allows 40 u s purse seine fishing boats to fish in the islands waters along with vessels from australia and new zealand a purse seine is a large line of netting a kind of vertical net curtain used to surround a school of fish the bottom is drawn together much like a purse to enclose the fish according to the uscc report the chinese government has been sensitive to the criticism of its distant water fleets and has taken some steps to deter illegal fishing in the western central pacific ocean those steps include fining and terminating the licenses of some chinese companies found to have fished without authorization toward the end of 2017 the chinese government stopped calling for an expansion of the fleets chinas ministry of agriculture released a five year plan that restricts the total number of offshore fishing boats to under 3 000 by the year 2021 worth watching in the future are chinese provinces and fishing companies that would still like to expand their fishing catch rather than curb it on jan 7 bloomberg magazines editorial board argued that illegal fishing carried out not only by chinese fleets but also by other foreign fleets has reached the point where it needs to be taken seriously as a global security threat more than 50 countries have signed a pact to better manage ports by denying entry to boats that cant document their catches bloomberg says but illegal fishermen head to smaller ports that still lack monitoring and that includes some in the south pacific chinese investment in the south pacific as the uscc reports chinese direct investment in pacific island countries has grown rapidly reaching 2 8 billion in 2016 nearly 70 percent of that investment was concentrated in papua new guinea by far the most heavily populated of the pacific island countries president xi jinpings visit to papua new guinea to attend a summit meeting of the asia pacific economic cooperation apec organization held nov 17 and 18 2018 underlined chinas growing links with papua new guinea but it also triggered criticism of chinas timber exports from papua new guinea from local environmental and community leaders on nov 22 2018 john cannon writing for the website mongabay an environmental nonprofit organization reported on a letter written bythese local leaders during the apec meeting and addressed to president xi in the letter which was delivered to chinas ambassador to papua new guinea the group spoke of illegalities and corruption that plague pngs forestry sector chinas influence in png is strong and growing peter bosip executive director of the papua new guinea center for environmental law and community rights celor said in a statement but meanwhile the forests that sustain our livelihoods and culture are being liquidated bosip said cannon reported that communities had not given their consent for the forests they are charged with managing to be cut down and according to cannon agricultural companies have improperly used leases that were meant to promote food production to instead harvest and export timber the belt and road initiative while the pacific islands receive less chinese attention than other areas of the world beijing includes the region in president xis jinpings signature belt and road initiative this suggests that china has geostrategic interests in the region the uscc says anapril 2018news report on purported discussions over a potential chinese military base on vanuatu raised concerns because it could pose challenges to u s defense interests as well as those of australia and new zealand u s partners in the region the economist magazine said in its jan 19 edition this year that the report that vanuatu might allow china to build a military base there really galvanized the australian establishment that development had it been realized the magazine said would have crossed a red line the first potential military threat in australias near abroad since the second world war both china and vanuatu said that the report about a potential base was inaccurate but chinas diplomatic and strategic aims clearly include gaining access to raw materials and natural resources as well as reducing taiwans presence among the pacific islands the pacific islands are home to six of taiwans 18 diplomatic partners chinas inroads in micronesia where most of the united states engagement in the pacific islands is concentrated could threaten u s agreements with palau the marshall islands and the federated states of micronesia according to the uscc report in a u s territory near guam in the northern mariana islands chinese investors casino resort development could complicate u s department of defense plans for extensive training and exercises for u s marines based in guam marianas authorities and citizens have opposed the plans for training drills on guam for fear that they will cause damage to a fast growing tourism industry and casino business according to rnz a new zealand radio station climate change climate change is understandably also a big issue for many of the pacific islands governments the cook islands prime minister henry puma has asserted that once the united states withdrew from the 2017 paris agreement on climate change other countries were prepared to step into the vacuum of leadership that is left by america in the south pacific but apart from its access to pacific island fisheries through a south pacific treaty the u s plays a role in fisheries management through its involvement in a western and central pacific fisheries commission and the u s maintains a number of programs to help pacific island countries combat illegal fishing these include agreements with 10 of these countries that allow u s coast guard ships and aircraft to patrol national eezs on their behalf backlash against a chinese diplomat in nauru meanwhile china has increased pressure on taiwans unofficial partners in the pacific islands in an attempt to further reduce taiwans influence in the region according to the uscc report following taiwan president tsai ing wens visit to the island nation of palau in 2017 china was reported to have banned chinese tour group visits to palau in an attempt to pressure palau to abandon taiwan tourism plays a key role in palaus economy and chinese tourists comprise nearly half of all tourists visiting the island according to the uscc while beijing has bolstered its diplomatic presence in the south pacific chinese diplomats have a mixed record so far in their efforts to enhance chinas image in one case in mid september of last year an island leaders angry pushback against a chinese diplomat went public naurus president baron waqu demanded that china apologize for arrogance shown at a pacific islands forum pif where he accused the chinese of buying their way through the region theyre not our friends they just need us for their own purposes president waqu told reporters according to a report from agence france presse afp the summits usual discussion on climate change was overshadowed by naurus row with china over its treatment of asylum seekers held on the island under a deal with australia as afp reported the diplomatic spat pitted nauru with a population of some 11 000 people and an area of eight square miles against an asian superpower dan southerland is rfa s founding executive editor copyright 1998

upsides from approximately 50 basis points of favorability in our effective tax rate which we expect will sustain in 2019 these gains are partially offset by a 0 02 per share reduction in our estimate for share based compensation tax benefits related to changes in our stock price which is excluded in our comparable constant currency eps growth calculation our guidance reflects consistent expectations for year on year foreign exchange impacts we ll walk you through the details of our 2019 guidance later in my comments let s begin with a review of our fourth quarter and full year 2018 results by segment and region q4 results were driven by ongoing momentum in our companion animal group global cag revenues were 479 million up 12 organically reflecting continuous strong gains and recurring cag diagnostics revenues global cag diagnostics recurring revenues increased 13 organically including 4 5 million or 1 3 in growth benefit from a new revenue accounting standard primarily related to our modified retrospective restatement by region u s cag diagnostic recurring revenues increased 13 3 organically driven by mid teen growth in consumables and reference lab sales and continued solid growth in rapid assay revenues u s cag diagnostics recurring revenue growth was primarily volume driven with overall net price gains of approximately 2 u s recurring cag diagnostics customer retention metrics sustained at high levels reinforcing the durability of a recurring revenue base idexx u s recurring cag growth performance continues to outpace u s advertisement advertisement veterinary practice market growth reflected in our data set from approximately 5 000 clinics in q4 patient visits were up 0 3 and clinic revenues increased 4 per practice compared to the prior year period a relatively lower level of overall practice revenue growth compared to recent trends this same store growth data is for veterinary visits of all types and appears to be impacted by moderated growth in nonclinical visits as we ve seen growth for clinical visits trending closer to 2 these solid clinical visit trends are aligned with our continued strong business results we re refining our data tracking and analysis of clinical versus nonclinical visit trends and look forward to sharing more on this front on future conference calls international cag diagnostic recurring revenues increased 12 5 organically in q4 driven by 20 plus organic growth in international consumable revenues mid single digit reference lab growth improved relative to our third quarter results with overall gains constrained by continued softer performance in select markets impacting in part by a commercial focus in 2018 on driving very strong in clinic revenue gains veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging systems revenues increased 9 globally in q4 reflecting 8 organic gains and benefits from our recent acquisition of smart flow these results were supported by solid growth in recurring software services associated with our practice management platforms and continued strength in our diagnostic imaging business which posted a 20 increase in digital imaging system

continued momentum in the water business and are targeting continued high single digit organic growth in this highly profitable business in 2019 livestock poultry and dairy revenue in q4 was 34 million down 5 organically as expected reflecting comparisons to high 2017 year end government program and distributer ordering quarterly growth was also pressured by end market impacts related to african swine fever outbreaks in china which is our largest market for swine diagnostic testing and the continued impact of low milk prices in key markets which has constrained demand for dairy testing and growth in bovine pregnancy test sales for the full year 2018 our lpd revenue was 131 million up 1 organically as our lpd revenues are 90 international macroeconomic pressures in markets like china can have a relatively larger impact on the lpd business segment than the company as a whole given these factors our 2019 outlook factors in expectations for relatively flat organic growth

recurring revenue organic growth outlook to 11 to 12 building on our exceptional 13 2 organic growth in 2018 which included 1 3 of nonrecurring growth rate benefit related to the implementation of the new revenue standard we re raising our 2019 eps outlook to 4 66 to 4 78 an increase of 0 04 per share at the midpoint reflecting approximately 0 06 per share and flow through of 2018 profit upsides offset by a 0 02 per share reduction in estimated tax benefits from share based compensation activity this outlook factors in an estimated 0 03 negative year on year impact from fx net of 10 million in projected hedge gains consistent with our preliminary guidance estimates as a sensitivity a 1 change in the dollar from rates assumed in our press release would impact 2019 revenues by approximately 8 million and operating profit by approximately 2 million net of hedge positions currently in place we refined elements of our p l outlook as we finalize our 2019 plans while maintaining a consistent comparable eps growth outlook of 15 to 18 we re now targeting 50 to 80 basis points of constant currency operating margin improvement a slight reduction to the high end of our targeted improvement range we target year on year gains driven primarily by gross margin improvement this refinement is offset by favorable updates to our projections for interest expense and year on year share count reduction we re now projecting 37 million to 38 million in net interest costs in 2019 and a 1 to 1 5 reduction in average shares outstanding with both metrics aligned with an assumed maintenance of our net leveraged rate levels at approximately 1 5 times ebitda our outlook for effective tax rate in 2019 remains at 20 to 21 a sustained 2018 upsides are offset by updated estimates for tax rate benefits of stock based compensation reflecting more recent share price levels we now project 6 5 million to 8 5 million or approximately 2 in tax benefit from exercise of stock based compensation in 2019 approximately 0 02 per share below prior estimates and 0 15 per share below high 2018 levels in terms of free cash flow we expect to continue to invest in high return instrument growth programs globally and to deploy 160 million to 175 million in capital spending including approximately 70 million related to completion of our westbrook headquarter and german core lab projects for 2019 this results in an outlook for free cash flow of 60 to 65 of net income or approximately 80 of net income normalized for these two major projects in terms of our first quarter outlook in 2019 we expect q1 reported revenue growth in the 6 to 7 5 range reflecting organic gains of 9 to 10 5 net of a projected 1 equivalent days headwind q1 operating margins are expected to be at the lower end of our full year improvement goals of 50 to 80 basis points as we continue to advance implementation of our international commercial resource expansion we expect our effective tax rate in q1 to be 18 5 to 19 including projected benefits from share based compensation exercise activity that concludes the financial overview let me turn the call over to jon for his comments jon ayers chief executive officer ok brian thank you we ll call a commentary and we ll open up for questions we finished 2018 with strong revenue growth and impressive bottom line results even as we re making significant incremental investments in business to support our customers and that will generate sustained growth for years to come companion animal diagnostic recurring revenue which constitutes 75 of idexx overall revenues in 2018 grew organically 13 for the quarter and the full year consistent with our expectations u s cag diagnostic recurring revenue which represents almost two third of the total global generated organic growth of 13 3 while international generated 12 5 international growth was supported by 20 plus instrument consumable organic revenue growth clearly pet owners have an increasing appreciation of the importance of healthcare for their pets our growth trends in as 2018 wraps up are also a testament to the value our customers see in idexx unique diagnostic offering and the importance the idexx technologies play in healthcare the market for veterinary and medical and technician talent is really competitive right now as you can see from this morning s job report in fact it s been reported that there s one veterinarian available for every five job openings and so practiced owners need to attract and retain valued staff by providing them essential tools and a partner to support their job well and take the best care of patients thus the importance of idexx far more advanced innovations and so our customer retention metrics which are the foundation of growth in a recurring revenue model continue at exceptionally high levels in q4 if not inching up ever so slightly our organic growth remains primarily volume driven augmented by continued modest price realization the latter reflecting the benefits of how our offerings advance with the benefit of almost 130 million of cash r d and diagnostics and software in 2018 and are projected almost 150 million in cash r d in the same in 2019 this technology for life approach includes the behind the scenes software upgrades that happen regularly for our point of care instruments like the recently announced neural network 4 0 for sedivue advancing menu and the progesterone test for our catalyst platform our seventh new test in seven years on the catalyst platform as well as regular advances in vetconnect plus our cloud based diagnostic software for 2018 placements of catalysts in new and competitive accounts were up 20 new and competitive catalyst placements over the course of the year are an important contributor to the 19 organic growth in idexx vetlab instrument consumables in q4 we re pleased with the instrument placement results that q4 contributed to the year that brian has enumerated as well as the completion of the rollout of catalyst one analyzers at over 1 000 banfield hospitals we re entering 2019 having completed important commercial expansions around the world the u s expansion with the greater customer coverage from a deeper field based professional organization was in place for the start of q4 there s always some settling in during the first quarter of an expansion as our professionals including newly recruited professionals develop relationships with their customers in their new or reconfigured territories especially in this light the north american growth metrics also against a strong compare were very strong as we enter 2019 we re beyond this initial settling in period in our u s market our largest with an experienced world class team of professionals and frontline leadership this team is focused on growing diagnostic and software category advancing customers adoptions of new protocols such as preventive care diagnostics fecal antigen testing urinalysis sedivue and growing the overall number of customers that benefit from idexx unique technologies our u s field footprint isn t in place with our u s field footprint in place a quarter ago our 2019 u s focus is on the productivity that comes from rapid development in time and territory our commercial investments in the u s in 2019 will focus on high roi opportunities beyond field footprint our international teams expansion plans were timed generally about a quarter later than the u s at this point we re largely complete and hiring expanded commercial resources to advance instrument placements and a companion animal group diagnostic recurring revenue growth in accordance with our plans our international teams are building competencies with our key commercial strategies for example the economic value index of an instrument placement to prioritize high value chemistry placements which is one of the reasons why we saw a 29 growth in new income competitive catalyst placements in q4 internationally to a record over 700 units which was up 100 units from q3 of 2018 which itself was a quarterly record another strategic competency being adopted by international is leveraging the idexx 360 program to accelerate instrument placements and drive recurring revenue growth this type of program is slightly generally new to our idexx teams outside of north america and i m pleased with the teams progress here as the year wrapped up our international teams are poised to have a great 2019 spreading the benefits of idexx innovation such as idexx sdma including our catalyst placements and our best in class hematology offerings as the expansions complete their settling period in the first quarter of 2019 these international commercial expansions along with a unique diagnostic and software technology offering gives us confidence in our revenue growth target primarily driven by volume testing gains with secondary support from modest price realization and net new customer additions while current economic times bring a steady den of broader macro noise idexx growth remains solid reflecting the durable recurring nature of our revenues the benefit of our differentiation enabled by our industry leading investments in innovation and supported by the growing bond between pets and their owners in sum we are sustaining solid growth momentum as we enter 2019 which gives us confidence for the 11 to 12 projected organic growth of cag diagnostic recurring revenues in 2019 similar to the 2018 growth trends on an adjusted basis before i open the call to questions i want to express my deep gratitude to our employees for their accomplishments in 2018 in the pursuit of our purpose to enhance the health and well being of pets people and livestock and also my gratitude to the continued confidence that customers have in idexx as a value added technology partner so with this comment cynthia we ll open the call to questions questions and answers operator and our first question will come from the line of ryan daniels with william blair your line is open ryan daniels william blair company analyst yes good morning and thanks for taking the questions two somewhat disparate ones first off john for you as we think about the expanded international salesforce and your potential rollout of idexx 360 and kind of integrating a reference and point of care more actively is there an opportunity to push the preventive care protocols and challenge in those markets as well or is it still a bit too early in those markets to think that could be a organic growth driver jon ayers chief executive officer yes thank you for that we re actually beginning to look at that in some of the more advanced international markets i think it s an opportunity we have and in addition when we talk about the benefits of diagnostics in a preventive care scenario it reinforces the importance of foreign diagnostics when it is not a wellness presentation and so i think we ll see it s early days in international in 2019 very early days kind of where we were at the u s several years ago but preventive care really has come of age in 2018 and it s a big component of our growth in 2019 in the u s and now more and more in the canadian market ryan daniels william blair company analyst ok and then if we look at the u s market i thought it was somewhat noteworthy in the press release you called out millennials and that being a focus for the organization can you speak to that note in a little bit more detail as it relates to how that could serve as a tailwind for the industry and then anything you ll do specifically given the large size of that millennial market and their proclivity to spend more on pet care jon ayers chief executive officer yes so millennials which we generally define as the 15 year span from 37 to 22 are now in their taking care of their own pets they re also an important and growing part of the professional community of veterinarians and technicians and all the evidence that we see is that the millennial s visit the vet more they re more in tuned with their pets and i think that one metric kind of calls it out that while maybe 20 of other prior generations feel their pets have special health needs 46 of millennials think their pets have special health needs which really i think is an indication of how millennials are in touch with their pets and so we see this as and then the early evidence is even the generation beyond that maybe taking it even a bit further but this is obviously the largest component of the consumer category right now and i think will be a key long term driver for the growing importance of pet healthcare ryan daniels william blair company analyst ok great thank you i ll hop back in the queue operator thank you our next question will come from the line of erin wright with credit suisse your line is open erin wright credit suisse analyst great thanks looking at the patient visit growth metrics that you gave you gave some new color on the clinical visits which were up 2 how has that metric trended over the past few years and how would you characterize kind of underlying demand trends across the u s companion animal market i assume that is a u s metric you re giving there and what does your guidance assume in terms of underlying demand trends for the year can you speak to some of the more resilient aspect to your business that can withstand this fluctuations in underlying demand trends thanks jon ayers chief executive officer yes i want to start with the last part what we re doing is that we re growing the utilization importance of diagnostic and all kinds of presentations i think people are realizing that just by doing a physical exam and a history you re missing a lot of pieces the equation without running diagnostics and of course you re missing other piece of the equation if you re not running idexx diagnostics so even though we ve seen some slight some moderation in the pet visits over the course of second half of 2018 in the u s market which is really the only market that we have industry data and as you know i think the clinical visits are moderating a less yes we ve still got 2 growth in clinical visits so which is of course the only type of visit that is important to idexx the nonclinical visit is not really a factor for idexx we re seeing good demand growth and so our expectation in 2019 is consistent with really what we saw in 2018 brian mckeon chief financial officer second half of 2018 yes i think we re factoring in the recent trends and our outlook is very much in line with the adjusted growth that we re driving coming out of the back half jon ayers chief executive officer now let s also recognize we re seeing growth in the instrument consumables associated with our new tests catalyst sdma on slide and the growing installed base of sedivue and the growing use of preventative care so we have a number of growth drivers that make up the total of companion animal diagnostic recurring revenue projected growth for 2019 of 11 to 12 on an organic basis erin wright credit suisse analyst ok great thanks and on the international side i m going to ask another question on international reference lab but when will the salesforce be more meaningfully mature there and how quickly is that relative to what you typically see in the u s and then and how should we think about that quarterly cadence in international reference lab when do you really expect that to start to improve over the course of the year thanks jon ayers chief executive officer well i like to look at the results as a whole and what we ve done is we prioritized the catalyst placements to new and competitive accounts which is a little bit harder to sale than a catalyst placement to an existing idexx chemistry customer using vettest and while we ve largely upgraded the vettest volume in the international market there is some i think it s 10 of our chemistry consumable volume in the international market with that test remaining to go this is the 29 year over growth i think is really showing that the international is prioritizing the highest roi of work and let s recognize once we place a catalyst the loyalty internationally on catalyst is virtually 100 so these are going to be customers that are going to be using catalysts for life and this very enduring recurring revenue let alone any growth we get in utilization from menu our utilization or adoption of additional protocols we did see a nice we saw a couple of percent tick up in the international reference lab organic growth in q4 over q3 which really i think validates that part of what we saw in q3 was weather and part of it was some selective slowdown in markets as we prioritized those chemistry placements to get to really where will the idexx 360 program and our overall focus on both catalyst and reference lab i would say that s probably going to we ll probably see that in the second half of 2019 start to kick in but the productivity to saleforce are pretty high on the important instrument placement side of the equation erin wright credit suisse analyst ok great thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of michael ryskin with bank of america merrill lynch your line is open michael ryskin bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks guys thanks for taking the question i wanted to dig deeper on a couple of the moving pieces and the updated 2019 guide just to get some clarity so you mentioned that the cag or current revenues outlook you refined to 11 to 12 versus the 11 5 to 12 5 it sounds like the accounting standard is now a little bit more i think you said 1 3 and previously it was 1 so this is a bit of a two part question but i m wondering if that s the entire reason for the shift and it s just a bit of rounding decision and then the second part of the question is if that s now 11 to 12 but the total company guide has reiterated a 9 5 to 11 is there an offset somewhere else looks like lpd is still going to be challenged because of african swine fever is something better and a lot of quality or is this just a rounding between the various buckets brian mckeon chief financial officer yes mike it really is kind of the rounding effects as we re just finalizing our plans with the we try to provide input for each of the segments in the call so we said low teens cag high single digit water and relatively flat lpd and it really is a refinement to finalizing our plans it s not related to the accounting adjustment and that implies high single digit growth in areas like vss and digital and our instrument placement revenue so it s just wrapping up our plans very much in line with our trends coming out of the end of the year if you look at the cag recurring growth adjusted for that 1 3 effect it s very consistent with that we provide the extra decimal point it s been slightly above 1 through the year we ve just been rounding and we wanted you to have the exact number as we finish the year but again that is a nonrecurring growth rate benefit we should be through the account change adjustments and fully normalized heading into 2019 jon ayers chief executive officer yes yes mike i think as part of the brian comments and your comments i think you characterized it right we re pretty unique in providing revenue and profit guidance in october of the year before for the following year which really shows the enduring nature of our and predictable nature of it and it s really just as we finalize our plans and outlook we re talking about some rounding consideration brian mckeon chief financial officer and i would say we had an outlook in q4 for the international lab so mid to high single digit we re a bit at the lower end we did see improvement and some of that s factored in as well we think that we ve got that well calibrated michael ryskin bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok and then just if i could squeeze in one other quick one on the vet volume data you provided for 4q the 0 3 increase i m just wondering if you saw anything weird in the u s in terms of weather in the quarter we have the california wildfires in october or if you think there is any potential impact there from some of the macroeconomic data the gdp data that came out over in the year the stock market had a negative move throughout the year so i was wondering if you thought there is anything there that led to that decrease in vet clinic visits jon ayers chief executive officer that s a lot of moving parts i would say and then throw in the calendarization of december too which with the holidays and where they fell i think the 0 3 that s total visits we re getting a better understanding i think don t we re ready to talk in detail about it yet but we re getting a better understanding of what portion of our of those visits are clinical visits and what the clinical visit trends are our preliminary analysis says the clinical visits are closer to 2 of growth in q4 and so some of that deceleration may be really just revenue going from out of the practice management system into other channels some channels are channels that benefit the veterinarian through like a direct sales from the veterinarian but doesn t go through the practice management software which is of course what we re measuring so but i think the overall trends and certainly our companion animal diagnostic recurring revenue growth of 13 3 in the u s speaks for the fact the solid state of the growth in this in the in our portion of the industry michael ryskin bank of america merrill lynch analyst all right much appreciated i ll get back in the queue operator thank you we will go to line of jon block with stifel your line is open jon block stifel financial corp analyst great thanks guys and good morning i ll also ask probably a guidance related questions so brian the first one i think if i heard you correctly the midpoint of the 1q organic was about 9 75 and that s where the 1 days headwind that s largely in line with the 9 5 to 11 organic for the year so i guess where i m going with this is anything you can call out from a cadence perspective for the year on a top line should we think stable and then maybe the op margin expansion is a bit back end weighted any color would be helpful brian mckeon chief financial officer i think that s a fair call john i think we re not i don t think we have any meaningful targeted calendarization differences or things to note you always have segment by segment specific compares but i as we work through the year but i think that s fair and yes on the operating margin the full year is 50 to 80 and we re likely at the lower end of that coming out of the blocks and some of that s just the lapping of the investments that we made on the commercial expansion we re still advancing some of the international aspects of that and as john noted we ve got plans to increase our r d spending this year as well so that s all factored in but we ll expect to be build on that through the year and i did noted we are targeting primarily improvement from gross margins this year so that we expect that will be consistent too jon block stifel financial corp analyst ok very helpful and that s probably a good segue into the second question which is brian i haven t pushed on margin expansion for sometime so maybe i ll go back there for my second question in 17 and 18 the op margin expansion i believe was around 120 to 130 bps guidance this year like you said is 50 to 80 bps obviously to be fair the baseline is higher now but you have lapped a lot of investments notably in the sales force that you ve made over the past 12 to 24 months but maybe on a high level you can just speak to the incremental investments and why the amount of op margin expansion in 19 would be more muted versus the bad 12 to 24 months thanks guys brian mckeon chief financial officer yes it really is an operating expense story where we ve been highlighting the additional commercial expansions which will be as i noted lapping heading into this year and the cash on g metrics that john highlighted would imply closer to 15 growth in r d this year so we ve had very high return on our ongoing investment in the organic growth of the businesses as highlighted by our 49 after tax return on invested capital and jon ayers chief executive officer an investable business brian mckeon chief financial officer we are very pleased with the growth and want to keep investing toward that and look if we deliver at the higher end of our revenue goals that are that which we ve had the last couple of years that can have some favorable flow through benefits but we re very comfortable with the outlook that we re providing at this point jon block stifel financial corp analyst ok and maybe one quick one if i can the quality of the beat was really high in the quarter notably the r d expense came in ahead of what we were looking for you ve talked about per your comments brian solid r d expectations for 19 so jon maybe can you talk about the turnaround time if that s a good term to use for some of those projects would we expect that pipeline to materialize at all in 19 or is that something more of a 2020 bet thanks for your time guys jon ayers chief executive officer i don t i m not going to talk about anything specific in the r d pipeline that we haven t already talked about but i do want to reinforce that what if some of our r d a significant portion of r d is about our products expanding menu advancing their capabilities not only do we have cloud based software that s continually advancing whether it s in our veterinary software and services our digital imaging or of course vetconnet plus and r d investments are going to happen so it s no big product launch but it s a continual advancement in the capability that we re giving to the customers which of course supports recurring revenue growth our instruments are almost you could consider them as cloud based software that s continually advancing behind the scenes for our customers and this is the new model anyone who s got something powered by software better be continually advancing it through the cloud i know that s what salesforce is doing on automobiles and that s what we ve been doing for quite some time with now seven new menu items on catalyst in that in seven years in the advancement and hematology offering that we talked about over time with four new parameters on procyte and the investments in neural network the incremental capability we have in idexx vetlab station so there is a steady die of things that don t necessarily get a lot of individual play but they have a very meaningful impact on the sustainability of our growth and we have very good pipeline across the diagnostic and software categories r d group is very it s amazingly productive combined with our knowledge of the business and our customer requirements and our ability to leverage and access and input third party technology into our offering so the continued part as i said was close to 150 million of cash r d and diagnostics and software investment in 2019 we see this as a core part of idexx being the sole innovator in the industry jon block stifel financial corp analyst thanks guys jon ayers chief executive officer thank you jon operator thank you our next question comes from the line of mark massaro with canaccord genuity your line is open mark massaro canaccord genuity analyst hey guys thanks on a nice congrats on a nice quarter my first question is on the mix between u s and o u s so historically your international growth has trended higher than your u s growth largely given a lower base of business in international but also based on stronger trends ous when we think about q4 in your prepared remarks you talked about soft growth in select markets o u s so can you give us a sense of where those markets are and what your expectations are for o u s in 2019 brian mckeon chief financial officer yes so mark that was specifically a reference to international reference labs so we had consumable growth in international the 20 growth overall was strong across all of our markets it was really exceptional performance see if you look at the instrument placement growth and the resulting jon ayers chief executive officer 20 plus brian mckeon chief financial officer is was that we very pleased with that progress this year and that was the key driver of the recurring revenue gains as we ve been highlighting the mid single digit growth in reference labs what we saw in q4 was a recovery from the summer in some of our key markets and we don t like to highlight specific markets for competitive reasons but we saw a recovery from some of the weather impacts that we had highlighted and we do continue to have a relatively lower growth in some markets and we think this is largely related to the fact that we really shifted the commercial focus on driving the high in client gains this year and weren t as focused not by intent but just outcome on the reference lab business we re working to get that back on track and we expect that we ll be successful with that and but we ll take an annuity business this the growth rate is really a reflection of what s happened in the last four quarters so we ll hopefully be highlighting progress on that front jon ayers chief executive officer i do want to take the opportunity a big shout out to our german lab and our german commercial organization lab of course more than just germany but they really had a great q4 across the board that s a team we moved through the veterinary diagnostic consultant model we have in the u s at the beginning of the year and they ve really executed well of course that is the largest lab where we re building the new kornwestheim facility what you noted in the capital expansion so i think we re putting the money where the performance is and so that s the one market i d really give kudos to mark massaro canaccord genuity analyst great and then as we think about your new point of care progesterone test launching in the coming weeks ahead i know that you haven t raised your 2019 guidance but can you give us a sense for the size of the market how you intend to price it whether it s a premium to other innovations such as like sdma and a slide for instance and what type of market potential you think there is for progesterone jon ayers chief executive officer yes the list price of that test progesterone will be 34 99 in the u s market obviously international markets it s a little it s going to be market specific so that is a very attractive list price and but it s really very small direct contributor i think what it is is two things that are relevant to investors one is this continues to advance both the loyalty of catalyst customers and it gives us the opportunity to place catalysts that have a requirement to serve responsible breeders and second it s an indication that we re not done adding menu to our in house instruments and this is one of the things about our instrument platform it s very flexible to menu addition because each slide can be developed individually and we have the capability to do that really puts us in a unique position in chemistry as well as hematology and urinalysis to continue to advance the installed base capability and what we call technology for life mark massaro canaccord genuity analyst excellent and then if i can are you seeing any competitive dynamic changes as a result of some of the consolidation in the space and zoetis acquiring abaxis and just as we think about abaxis becoming more meaningful in europe and outside the u s do you see any changes to your strategy o u s this year jon ayers chief executive officer it s always been a competitive market i would say with regard to major markets the u s is the most competitive market and as you can see is are our wealth even with vettest customers outside u s in the high 90s so it s always been a competitive market we don t really see any changes that have come to play with that have been a consequence of the changing ownership of abaxis mark massaro canaccord genuity analyst great thank you operator thank you next we will go to the line of michael ryskin with bank of america merrill lynch your line is open michael ryskin bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks guys just had a couple of quick ones as a follow up i wanted to throw in there you mentioned minus one sale day in the first quarter just for modeling purposes could you give us the days and impact for the other rest of the year and just to confirm that there is no impact in 4q of 18 brian mckeon chief financial officer so on 2019 that we have a favorable day benefit in q3 so and i think the other quarters are not material enough to highlight q4 we had a favorable day benefit but we believe it was offset by the timing at year end of the christmas and new year s holiday which really impacted the year end both clinical activity but also our shipments and so we didn t call that out as a factor because we really think it was we had offsetting effects there so that was not an adjustment to our q4 results michael ryskin bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok appreciate that and just a follow up on one of the other questions after i heard about the international reference lab sounds like you had the improvement from the low single digit to mid single digits in the quarter i m just wondering when you called out the relative focus of the salesforce to draw then point of care reference lab as we think through to 2019 how quickly should that move up is it something that is reasonable to think can tick another step higher in 1q or is this sort of a more gradual to get the international back to the more high single digit range jon ayers chief executive officer we in the near term it will take time so we re brian mckeon chief financial officer probably i think we ll see gradual improvement over the course of 2019 i think we are coming back to the our german organization which moved to a veterinary diagnostic consultant model where you have one account manager representing in house and reference lab they moved to that in the first quarter of 2019 and they have very good fourth quarter across the board and i think that really shows what happens when we get with a little bit of time and territory and learning the new model every market is a little different some of them were already there some of them are making changes to that model some of them are distributor markets where that s not really relevant our markets really don t have a reference lab business so a lot of different models internationally but i think that s an indication of what we really expect to see over the course of 2019 michael ryskin bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok much appreciate it thanks operator thank you and our final question will come from the line of david westenberg with guggenheim security your line is open david westenberg guggenheim securities analyst hi thanks for squeezing me in so the number of the instrument placement number blew away my estimates but the instrument actual revenue number was a little bit below or at least in trend line so is that a function of strong international placements or is there an increase in rental style contracts brian mckeon chief financial officer it s a great question david it was up 3 some of that is the comparative of a very strong results last year we really had exceptional q4 in 2017 and the other factor we did note was instrument program mix impacts and as you pointed out very strong performance internationally can drive that and the growth of programs like rental programs internationally and 360 can have an effect too on the instrument revenue recognition they re all great programs really high return but can have a bit of a moderating effect on growth so those were the primary drivers jon ayers chief executive officer yes i also want to call out david the u s did a great job they had a tough compare where they were really rock and rolling in q4 of 2017 we q4 2018 was the first quarter of the expansion well the most recent expansion and in the context of a strong compare and the first quarter expansion they had very strong results as brian laid out and were up year over year so but to your point on revenue there can be program mix impacts we as i think international placements are going to generate are generally smaller practices that s a fair point and so each placement generates a little bit less incremental recurring revenue than a u s placement but having said that i think there is we re very very pleased with the instrument placements globally in q4 david westenberg guggenheim securities analyst and then maybe just one follow up on the revenue build side you had 17 consumable growth that s a great number right there can you maybe help us parse out contribution from sdma versus organic consumption or consumable utilization to help us understand really what sdma on a slide is kind of doing there brian mckeon chief financial officer yes i highlighted that 4 of the consumable growth the organic consumable growth in q4 was a combination of sdma slide and sedivue pay per run they re pretty equal i think where both contributing i think rounding about 2 jon ayers chief executive officer yes and we re very pleased with the catalyst sdma adoption we ve now topped 1 million runs on catalysts with sdma this adds to close to total 20 million of sdma results when we include the reference lab in the u s we have 58 of our practices who have outrun catalyst sdma in the last quarter and 64 who have purchased it these are really amazing adoption metrics and of course sdma is unique to the idexx solution so globally the metrics are very similar it s actually 58 adoption in the u s and 56 adoption meaning they re actually running at of course we can uniquely measure that because we have smartservice on our instruments which brings all sorts of benefits including our ability to measure and about 64 of global installed base as purchased the sdma slides so these are in the first of year launch these are amazing adoption metrics and it really shows the progress we ve made on providing education to the field of the importance of sdma as being highly correlated with gfr of a kidney

by barbara loe fisher national vaccine information center on jan 16 2019 the world health organization who issued a report ranking vaccine hesitancy as one of the top ten threats to global health in 2019 alongside air pollution and climate change noncommunicable diseases global influenza pandemic antimicrobial resistance and infectious diseases such as ebola dengue fever and hiv 1 throughout history the greatest contributors to disease and early death in human populations have been poverty poor sanitation and poor nutrition 2 3 4 yet infectious diseases with pharmaceutical solutions dominated this list and there was no mention of the major opioid addiction crisis crippling and killing tens of thousands of people in the u s and europe 5 6 or the iatrogenic medical error epidemic that every year claims more than 750 000 lives in europe 7 and 250 000 lives in the u s where it is the third leading cause of death 8 the immediate mainstream media response to the who s announcement was to focus on vaccine hesitancy on jan 19 the editorial board of the new york times declared that anti vaxxers are the enemy and called on the u s government to get tough by waging a bold and aggressive pro vaccine campaign that includes tightening restrictions around how much leeway states can grant families that want to skip essential vaccines 9 by jan 23 the hill announced that washington state had declared a state of emergency because of 23 cases of measles reported in an anti vaccination community near portland oregon 10 and there was a public call in the uk for social media platforms to clamp down on fake news and censor misleading information and negative messaging around vaccination 11 12 the new york times editorial headline how to inoculate against anti vaxxers was a theme repeated in articles reacting to the who s suggestion that people wanting to make informed voluntary decisions about vaccination are a global menace one doctor suggested that parents who don t vaccinate their children are selfish it s a matter of i don t care about other people in the community i only care about the health and welfare of my own child 13 there was no discussion about institutionally acknowledged gaps in vaccine safety science 14 15 or the fact that most parents dutifully follow the advice of pediatricians and public health officials and only became vaccine safety critics after the risks of vaccination for their children turned out to be 100 percent 16 17 no discussion about the fact that since 2011 pharmaceutical companies have no liability for injuries and deaths caused by government recommended and mandated vaccines they sell in the u s 18 instead parents of vaccine injured children and others concerned about vaccine safety who for decades have been asking government and industry to produce better quality vaccine science and more humane vaccine policies that respect genetic and biological diversity were stereotyped as anti vaxxers and demonized as a threat to public health the editorial board of the new york times explained it s no mystery how we got here on the internet anti vaccine propaganda has outpaced pro vaccine public health information authoritatively the board its editor and the publisher of the new york times stated that scientists especially are uncomfortable with black and white statements because science is all about nuance but in the case of vaccines there are some hard truths that deserve to be trumpeted vaccines are not toxic and they do not cause autism full stop there was no discussion about why people are legitimately concerned about vaccine ingredients 19 and pharma paying the food and drug administration fda to fast track new vaccines to licensure without adequate testing 20 no discussion about the fact that doctors are giving children 69 doses of 16 vaccines starting on the day of birth 21 three times as many vaccinations as they got in 1983 22 and cannot explain why so many highly vaccinated children in the u s are sicker not healthier today 1 child in 6 learning disabled 23 and 1 in 40 with autism 24 and millions more suffering with asthma diabetes severe allergies epilepsy cancer schizophrenia depression and other chronic disease marked by chronic inflammation in the body the cdc states that 90 percent of the 3 3 trillion in annual health care expenditures are for people with chronic and mental health conditions 25 the largely unexplained chronic disease and disability epidemic in the u s is bankrupting the u s health care system and there is no research being funded to investigate the role that ever increasing numbers of vaccines given to infants children and adults may be playing multi national pharmaceutical corporations 26 27 in command of a global 34 billion dollar vaccine market 28 29 are holding billion dollar contracts with mass communication companies 30 and public private partnerships with governments to purchase vaccines and create vaccine marketing campaigns 31 32 33 34 that dwarf the relatively small number of websites and blogs labeled anti vax simply for criticizing vaccine science and government policy 35 yet there is no recognition by mainstream media articles of the fact that wealthy corporations and philanthropic foundations with political agendas 36 37 well paid medical doctors 38 39 40 and government health officials in charge of operating the vaccine system 41 are in privileged positions of power with a distinct advantage over ordinary people subjected to vaccine laws that place an unequal risk burden on individuals with genetic and biological susceptibility to suffering harm from vaccination 42 43 bio populism blamed for vaccine hesitancy in europe in the uk the economist published an article entitled the campaign against vaccination in which an anonymous author declared across europe the rise of populism is damaging public health a common feature is skepticism of vaccines 44 pointing to italy austria and france as hotbeds of political support for parental choice about vaccination the author attempted to politically tie growing public support for vaccine choice to a fear of migrants and coined a new term bio populism it is increasingly clear that europe s populists want for the body what they want for the nation purity unity and self governance populist health policies mean citizens being free from outside influences whether vaccines devised by doctors regulations invented by politicians or diseases supposedly carried by migrants and in control of their own epidemiology he or she went on to explain that bio populism is a combination of me first libertarianism and anti expertise herd mentality quoting italian medical professor dr roberto burioni who has stated authoritatively that vaccines are not an opinion and offered an explanation for why science can t be democratic the economist article ended with a warning that at least one pandemic will probably sweep the interconnected world in the next decade viruses after all know no borders there was no discussion of the fact that most parents and physicians calling for better quality vaccine science and informed consent protections in vaccine laws are ideologically diverse and do not all identify with one particular political party in fact a 2015 pew research center survey revealed that age and parenthood had more to do with vaccine hesitancy with young adults and parents with children under age 18 being less supportive of mandatory vaccination 45 vaccines autism erosion of trust in drug companies doctors in the u s live science trumpeted anti vaccine movement joins ebola drug resistance on list of top global threats 46 a doctor at johns hopkins center for health security was quoted as saying the reason that noncommunicable diseases and not infectious diseases made the who s top ten global threat list is a testament to how powerful vaccines are pointing to the jubilant public response to the release of polio vaccine in the 1950s he commented we need to get back to that era when vaccines were celebrated the way a new iphone is the headline people magazine chose was world health organization names anti vaxxers as a top threat to global health in 2019 47 at the beginning of the article the following statement appeared there is no scientific link between vaccines and autism according to the centers for disease control it ended with the statement to tackle the rising levels of vaccine hesitancy who plans to push forward with the goal of eliminating cervical cancer with greater application of hpv vaccine u s news world report ran this headline who anti vaccine movement a top threat in 2019 48 that author stated so called anti vaxxers refuse the required shots for their children on religious or philosophical grounds an increase in unvaccinated children has in part been tied to the medically discredited belief that vaccines cause autism spectrum disorder pointing out that a recent u s survey found that public trust in vaccination is on the decline she added the heightened mistrust researchers said was especially prevalent in small pockets of people in insular communities or like minded communities online pacific standard asked are anti vaxxers a major health threat the world health organization says yes 49 this article included a quote from a pediatrician the ongoing erosion of trust in the medical establishment as a whole is also to blame as frequent reports of dubious financial relationships between physicians professional medical societies and the pharmaceutical industry leave many questioning whether or not physicians can be trusted unsure of what to do and whom to listen to many seek answers to their questions elsewhere or simply rely on their gut feeling salon created the most sensational headline that asked the foreboding question the anti vaxxocalypse what happens to humanity if vaccine hesitancy continues 50 the author explained to readers in other words the anti vaccination movement which has inspired many in first world countries to refuse or hesitate vaccination for easily preventable diseases is now a threat to global health and ergo stability the exaggerated response to the who announcement by corporations owning mainstream media outlets has been curiously uniform often using identical talking points perspective from parents and physicians in the u s and europe rationally calling for reform of the vaccine policies and laws is left out 51 the politics of vaccination is in full swing but where is the money coming from to fund these vaccine marketing campaigns using name calling threats shaming and misinformation to demonize and call for discrimination against those who criticize vaccine science and government policy the world health organization who marketing vaccines immediately after world war ii in 1945 the united nations un voted to establish a new international health organization in 1948 the world health organization who was founded by the un after ratification by 26 members states and given a budget of 5m who is a specialized agency of the un headquartered in geneva switzerland and is composed of six regional offices operating in different parts of the world including the pan american health organization paho located in washington d c today 194 members states of the united nations are impacted by the activities of the who which has a broad mandate to act as the directing and coordinating authority on international health work 52 the who constitution revised in 2006 states that its objective is the attainment by all peoples of the highest possible level of health and health is defined as a state of complete physical mental and social well being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity 53 the who constitution also states that informed opinion and active co operation on the part of the public are of the utmost importance in the improvement of the health of the people the top priorities of the who when it was founded seventy years ago were malaria tuberculosis venereal diseases maternal and child health sanitary engineering and nutrition during the first 30 years of who s operation the un agency spearheaded a global smallpox eradication campaign 1958 1980 prevention and control of yaws endemic syphilis leprosy trachoma cholera and yellow fever 1960s fertility regulation and birth control 1970s childhood vaccination programs initiated 1974 and the institution of primary health care of all national health systems

is funded by assessments on member states and the remaining 80 percent funded by voluntary contributions the biggest individual programs funded by who are for polio eradication vaccine campaigns 903m vaccine campaigns for other communicable diseases 805m and corporate services enabling functions 715 5m currently the top 10 un member state annual funders of who are the governments of united states

is the largest non state funder of the who having donated more than 2b in earmarked grants to the international health agency since 1998 and is the second largest who funder overall after the u s government because gates foundation grant money is earmarked for specific programs such as vaccine purchase delivery and promotion the gates foundation significantly influences the setting of who s program priorities 57 in 2010 after a joint investigation by the british medical journal bmj in collaboration with the london based bureau of investigative journalism an article was published in the bmj revealing that three key scientists who influenced the who s decision to declare a swine flu h1n1 influenza pandemic in 2009 and recommend that all countries use and stockpile vaccines and pandemic flu drugs had financial ties to pharmaceutical companies profiting from the who recommendations glaxosmithkline and roche who was also criticized for lack of transparency for refusing to release the identities of the 16 members of an emergency committee formed in 2009 to guide pandemic policy 58 the 2009 pandemic h1n1 vaccine which was rushed to market to address a who declared pandemic that did not happen triggered an autoimmune reaction in more than 1 300 people in europe who got gsk s pandemrix vaccine and left them with narcolepsy an incurable immune mediated neurological disorder 59 gavi the vaccine alliance marketing vaccines the who and the u s government are founding partners of gavi the vaccine alliance in 2000 the bill and melinda gates foundation provided 750m in seed money to spearhead the creation of gavi a public private partnership and multilateral funding mechanism involving the who governments the vaccine industry the world bank philanthropic foundations and civil society groups to improve access to new and underused vaccines for children living in the world s poorest countries 60 of the more than 15b raised by gavi since 2000 to vaccinate the world s children u s government contributions have totaled 1 9b or 12 percent of all contributions received by gavi the united kingdom has contributed 2 2b or 14 percent of gavi s total contributions the single biggest funding source for gavi is the gates foundation which has donated more than 3b or 20 percent of gavi s total income 61 between 2000 and 2013 only about 10 percent of total funding provided by gavi 862m was used to strengthen health systems in developing countries such as improving sanitation and nutrition while nearly 80 percent was used to purchase deliver and promote vaccines 62 gavi is headquartered in geneva with an office in washington d c that carries out day to day operations and one of gavi s core goals is to shape markets for vaccines and other immunization products in 2006 gavi created the international finance facility immunisation ifflm to use donor funding commitments to back the issuance of special bonds in capital markets to provide up front financing to gavi in 2010 gavi created the advance market commitment amc model to accelerate access to pneumococcal vaccines with donors providing up front funding commitments to support vaccine purchase and speed the introduction and use of vaccines in countries partnering with gavi currently the amc incentivizes vaccine manufacturers to sign contracts to provide pneumococcal vaccine to developing countries at lower per dose prices and be reimbursed by gavi funds by march 2015 pfizer and glaxosmithkline had received more than 1b from gavi s amc funds 63 cdc officials provide gavi with technical support and guidance in 2015 the u s congress pledged to appropriate 1b to gavi that was spread over four years 2015 2018 64 on oct 16 2018 at the world health summit in berlin gavi ceo dr seth berkley announced that 11 heads of the world s leading health and development organizations had signed a landmark commitment to find new ways to accelerate achieving goals of the united nation s sustainable development goals created in 2015 the new global action plan vaccine marketing initiative is being coordinated by the who 65 relating sustainable development goals to vaccination of all the people in the world gavi states that 66 immunization protects people from being forced into poverty by high out of pocket expenses vaccines protect child health and support cognitive development allowing children to perform better at school and have more opportunities vaccinated healthy children grow into a productive workforce and become strong contributors to the economy and healthy children free up parents time so they are able to work vaccines are critical to building people s resilience to and mitigating the risk of disease outbreaks tied to climate change and good health is a critical determinant of peace and well being in a society people centered health systems are core social institutions in every country and immunisation is often the first point of contact between these systems and the population in 2016 dr berkley and other gavi executives came under criticism in the uk in 2016 for taking excessively high salary packages according to an investigative news report 67 seth berkley has taken home more than 2 million over the past four years as chief executive officer of global alliance for vaccines and immunisation gavi which has been given 1 5 billion by britain another official at the geneva based group collects a pay package of more than 500 000 a year incredibly dr berkley was given a housing allowance on top of his 623 370 pay package in december 2018 dr berkley told cnn that while measles is one of the few diseases we could potentially eradicate that will never happen if wealthy countries like the united states can t maintain herd immunity because a measles case anywhere is a threat everywhere he said parents in the u s are delaying their children s vaccinations perhaps because they believe in immunization but are worried by some of the anti vaccine scaremongering this needs to stop echoing the idea that parents who don t go along with the vaccine program are selfish he added in countries like the united states we need to stop thinking about vaccination as something you only do to protect the ones you love and instead view it also as a goodwill act for the benefit of others 68 according to the cdc in 2017 2018 vaccination coverage among kindergarteners remained high with 94 percent of children having received two doses of measles mumps and rubella mmr vaccine 4 or 5 doses of diphtheria tetanus and pertussis dtap vaccine and two doses of varicella zoster chickenpox vaccine among many other vaccines required by states for school attendance two percent of kindergarteners had an exemption from one or more state required vaccines 69 the bill and melinda gates foundation marketing vaccines the gates foundation was established in 2000 by microsoft corporation founder bill gates and his wife melinda 70 headquartered in seattle washington the gates foundation is the largest philanthropic foundation in the world with a 43 5b trust that makes grant payments of more than 3b annually to advance the foundation s goals for reforming education systems such as institution of common core curriculum in all u s schools 71 and funding public health initiatives primarily global vaccination programs 72 a major goal of the gates foundation is to make sure every child in the world is vaccinated 73 investor businessman warren buffet who took control of textile manufacturer berkshire hathaway inc in 1965 and went on to amass a personal fortune of more than 60b pledged 31b and became a co director of gates foundation in 2006 74 in 1998 the same year that the u s department of justice filed an anti trust lawsuit against microsoft corporation 75 bill and melinda gates committed 100m to create the bill melinda gates children s vaccine program one purpose of that program was to establish an international consensus on vaccine use recommendations efforts will be made to support international conferences and the development and dissemination of strong international consensus statements and recommendations for the use of the new vaccines 76 the homepage of the gates foundation proclaims all lives have equal value and states 77 we believe we can save lives by delivering the latest in science and technology to those with the greatest needs we work with partners to provide effective vaccines drugs and diagnostics and to develop innovative approaches to deliver health services to those who need it most and we invest heavily in developing new vaccines to prevent infectious diseases that impose the greatest burden in 2016 global justice now published an investigative report gated development is the gates foundation always a force for good authors were critical of the unchecked political power and influence on global health programs and agricultural policies of bill gates and the bill and melinda gates foundation bmgf 78 to say that the bmgf has become an important actor in international development would be an understatement when it comes to global health and agriculture policies two of its key grant areas the bmgf has become probably the most influential actor in the world it is also likely that bill gates who has regular access to world leaders and is in effect personally bankrolling hundreds of universities international organisations ngos and media outlets has become the single most influential voice in international development but the bmgf s increasing global influence is not being subjected to democratic scrutiny unlike governments which are formally accountable to their electorates the bmgf is a private us foundation and remains unaccountable to public bodies except for tax reporting purposes even worse the bmgf appears to have bought the silence of academics ngos and the media who might otherwise be expected to criticize aspects of the foundation s work money makes the world go around congress appropriated nearly 90b to the u s department of health and human services in 2018 and the biggest line item in the cdc s 11b budget was the vaccines for children program vfc 4 5b which was created by congress in 1993 79 under the vfc program the federal government purchases cdc recommended vaccines from vaccine manufacturers to administer to children who are on medicaid are uninsured or whose health insurance plans do not fully cover cdc recommended vaccines 80 81 hundreds of millions of dollars are additionally allocated in the hhs budget for vaccination programs including 700m for the national center for immunization and respiratory diseases one of the most politically powerful public private partnerships in the world today is the lucrative one that has been forged by the pharmaceutical industry with government 82 83 84 85 86 mainstream media 87 and wealthy philanthropic foundations with political agendas 88 89 in the past decade these public private partnerships have come under scrutiny by public policy analysts in 2015 authors of a special report published by the global policy forum observed 90 however it is not only big business but also big philanthropy that has an increasing influence in global development policy particularly large philanthropic foundations the scope of their influence in both past and present discourse and decision making processes is fully equal and in some cases goes beyond that of other private actors through the sheer size of their grant making personal networking and active advocacy large global foundations most notably the rockefeller foundation and the bill melinda gates foundation have played an increasingly active role in shaping the agenda setting and funding priorities of international organizations and governments for example the gates foundation has given johns hopkins more than 100m in research grants since 2015 including for vaccine development and promotion 91 at the same time johns hopkins university receives more than 2b per year in funding from u s government agencies such as the national institutes of health nih and the national science foundation nsf to conduct research including for vaccine development and vaccine use promotion 92 the national institutes of health nih and other federal health agencies give millions of dollars in taxpayer dollars to academic institutions and vaccine manufacturers to improve vaccine technology find new lucrative vaccine markets and boost vaccine marketability 93 the u s government also partners with the gates foundation to develop and promote vaccine use for example in 2013 the cdc foundation received three grants totaling 13 5m from the gates foundation to globally advance the implementation of meningitis and rotavirus vaccine programs 94 the centers for disease control and the cdc foundation have received more than 167m from the gates foundation 95 vaccine manufacturers have also received millions of dollars in grants from the gates foundation including glaxosmithkline over 50m 96 merck 1 4m 97 pfizer 16 5m 98 and sanofi pasteur 3 6m 99 big media under the influence mass media corporations are also under the influence of big pharma and big philanthropy money for example national public radio has received 20m in grants 100 and solutions journalism network has received 4m 101 in grants from the gates foundation recently gates microsoft corporation partnered with newsguard technologies inc 102 103 a new corporation that is rating websites and online publications to fight false news misinformation and disinformation 104 105 106 the newsguard corporation is also collaborating with other corporations such as google 107 108 which owns over 90 percent of the internet search market 109 one of the biggest investors in newsguard is publicis the oldest advertising company in the world and the third largest mass communications company today 110 publicis is paid billions of dollars by pharmaceutical companies to market vaccines 111 including a 1 5b media contract with glaxosmithkline 112 pdi a publicis health company states 113 vaccination coverage in the united state is high but in the face of the resurgence of vaccine preventable diseases such as pertussis and measles the existing gaps in the vaccination coverage of the us population have become worrisome gaps exist because not every patient who needs a vaccination gets it at the recommended age moreover the recommendations for new vaccines including vaccines for influenza and human papillomavirus hpv have been expanded pdi s field based medical sales representatives and inside medical sales representatives from our healthcare contact center can increase adoption of vaccines by responding to questions and concerns to increase immunization rates we must build sustainable systems for vaccination within the context of a changing healthcare system here some recommended steps toward achieving this goal assessment of the actual vaccination rate in a provider s practice consistently making recommendations for timely vaccinations to both the parents of pediatric patients and adult patients standing orders for non physician personnel to carry out vaccinations at the scheduled time without physician involvement educating physicians on emerging research of vaccine risks and on how to interact with parents who are concerned about the detrimental effects of the mmr and hpv vaccines and educating physicians about state sponsored and other programs that can help patients overcome financial barriers to vaccination it is clear that mass media communications today is being controlled by corporations financially tied to pharmaceutical companies and influenced by powerful political institutions in society it goes a long way to explaining why mainstream media outlets have been united in attacking parents and physicians who defend the ethical principle of informed consent including informed consent to vaccination and are calling for vaccine exemptions to be severely restricted or eliminated 114 the five largest companies in the world today are apple google microsoft amazon and facebook 115 these and other technology corporations dominate online communications and sales and are positioned to join together to aggressively market vaccines and promote no exceptions vaccine use policies endorsed by the who and governments the threat to autonomy and freedom of thought and speech posed by these companies especially in censoring online public conversations about vaccination and health is considerable 116 117 the people are not represented today everybody knows somebody who was healthy got vaccinated and was never healthy again the people whose lives are being impacted by business deals between governments big pharma and big philanthropy increasingly are being marginalized in the top down public policymaking process by wealthy and powerful institutions in society financing the global multi billion dollar vaccine industry 118 this is evident when the people raise their voices to ask for better vaccine science and more humane public health policies and are demonized discriminated against and punished by those in control of those wealthy and powerful institutions a system that will not bend will break the responsibility for the crisis of trust in the global vaccination system lies squarely at the feet of those who operate the system and refuse to acknowledge the suffering of the people harmed by vaccines 119 120 read the full article at nvic org dr andrew moulden every vaccine produces harm retail 13 99 now 9 99 order here canadian physician dr andrew moulden provided clear scientific evidence to prove that every dose of vaccine given to a child or an adult produces harm the truth that he uncovered was rejected by the conventional medical system and the pharmaceutical industry nevertheless his warning and his message to america remains as a solid legacy of the man who stood up against big pharma and their program to vaccinate every person on the earth dr moulden died unexpectedly in november of 2013 at age 49 because of the strong opposition from big pharma concerning dr moulden s research we became concerned that the name of this brilliant researcher and his life s work had nearly been deleted from the internet his reputation was being disparaged and his message of warning and hope was being distorted and buried without a tombstone this book summarizes his teaching and is a must read for everyone who wants to learn the other side of the vaccine debate that the mainstream media routinely censors read dr andrew moulden every vaccine produces harm on your

chinas growing presence among the islands of the south pacific worries australia new zealand and the united states and some island governments are now pushing back against that presence but when it comes to both island governments and many local citizens the biggest issue at the moment appears not to be geopolitics but the issue of illegal chinese fishing chinese fishing trawlers have been scooping up tuna fish a main source of protein for islanders for tourists the south pacific conjures up visions of romantic beaches heritage and culture world class diving and natural wonders as an australian travel agent put it but on the less sunny side the writer michael field warned nearly two years ago that illegal fishing much of it by china is costing some of the worlds smallest and poorest nations hundreds of millions of dollars its important to keep in mind that in six of the 18 pacific nations and territories the gdp per capita comes to only 2 100 to 5 700 a year possible destruction of tuna industry inside esoteric fishing rights conferences it is common knowledge that chinas new and powerful boats could within a decade destroy the 3 billion a year pacific tuna industry field wrote forthe spinoff bulletin in new zealand overfishing of a single species can reduce the size of a fish population to the point where it can no longer reproduce resulting in what is sometimes referred to as a crash in that population the congressionally funded u s china economic and security review commission uscc said in a report published in mid june of last year that tuna is a vital source of food and employment for pacific islanders for some south pacific countries it said the tuna within their 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zones eezs are their only major renewable resource however in recent years the uscc report said increasing competition with subsidized chinese vessels declining catches and depressed tuna prices are pushing many local tuna fishing fleets to exit the industry in contrast the growth of chinese fishing fleets worldwide has been sustained by chinese tax exemptions as well as by central and local government subsidies chinese fishermen reach as far from home as west africa and latin america so it should be no surprise that theyve begun showing up in greater numbers in the south pacific chinese fishing companies are motivated by high profits and members of chinas growing middle class are willing to pay for high quality fish china underreports distant water catches a 2012 european parliament study found that china massively underreports the catch of its distant water fleets but chinese boats are not the only foreign vessels to fish in the south pacific boats from taiwan and sometimes from italy and spain can be seen there though in smaller numbers than those from mainland china the united states is also part of the picture as the uscc notes the united states negotiates access to pacific island fisheries through a south pacific tuna treaty the treaty allows 40 u s purse seine fishing boats to fish in the islands waters along with vessels from australia and new zealand a purse seine is a large line of netting a kind of vertical net curtain used to surround a school of fish the bottom is drawn together much like a purse to enclose the fish according to the uscc report the chinese government has been sensitive to the criticism of its distant water fleets and has taken some steps to deter illegal fishing in the western central pacific ocean those steps include fining and terminating the licenses of some chinese companies found to have fished without authorization toward the end of 2017 the chinese government stopped calling for an expansion of the fleets chinas ministry of agriculture released a five year plan that restricts the total number of offshore fishing boats to under 3 000 by the year 2021 worth watching in the future are chinese provinces and fishing companies that would still like to expand their fishing catch rather than curb it on jan 7 bloomberg magazines editorial board argued that illegal fishing carried out not only by chinese fleets but also by other foreign fleets has reached the point where it needs to be taken seriously as a global security threat more than 50 countries have signed a pact to better manage ports by denying entry to boats that cant document their catches bloomberg says but illegal fishermen head to smaller ports that still lack monitoring and that includes some in the south pacific chinese investment in the south pacific as the uscc reports chinese direct investment in pacific island countries has grown rapidly reaching 2 8 billion in 2016 nearly 70 percent of that investment was concentrated in papua new guinea by far the most heavily populated of the pacific island countries president xi jinpings visit to papua new guinea to attend a summit meeting of the asia pacific economic cooperation apec organization held nov 17 and 18 2018 underlined chinas growing links with papua new guinea but it also triggered criticism of chinas timber exports from papua new guinea from local environmental and community leaders on nov 22 2018 john cannon writing for the website mongabay an environmental nonprofit organization reported on a letter written bythese local leaders during the apec meeting and addressed to president xi in the letter which was delivered to chinas ambassador to papua new guinea the group spoke of illegalities and corruption that plague pngs forestry sector chinas influence in png is strong and growing peter bosip executive director of the papua new guinea center for environmental law and community rights celor said in a statement but meanwhile the forests that sustain our livelihoods and culture are being liquidated bosip said cannon reported that communities had not given their consent for the forests they are charged with managing to be cut down and according to cannon agricultural companies have improperly used leases that were meant to promote food production to instead harvest and export timber the belt and road initiative while the pacific islands receive less chinese attention than other areas of the world beijing includes the region in president xis jinpings signature belt and road initiative this suggests that china has geostrategic interests in the region the uscc says anapril 2018news report on purported discussions over a potential chinese military base on vanuatu raised concerns because it could pose challenges to u s defense interests as well as those of australia and new zealand u s partners in the region the economist magazine said in its jan 19 edition this year that the report that vanuatu might allow china to build a military base there really galvanized the australian establishment that development had it been realized the magazine said would have crossed a red line the first potential military threat in australias near abroad since the second world war both china and vanuatu said that the report about a potential base was inaccurate but chinas diplomatic and strategic aims clearly include gaining access to raw materials and natural resources as well as reducing taiwans presence among the pacific islands the pacific islands are home to six of taiwans 18 diplomatic partners chinas inroads in micronesia where most of the united states engagement in the pacific islands is concentrated could threaten u s agreements with palau the marshall islands and the federated states of micronesia according to the uscc report in a u s territory near guam in the northern mariana islands chinese investors casino resort development could complicate u s department of defense plans for extensive training and exercises for u s marines based in guam marianas authorities and citizens have opposed the plans for training drills on guam for fear that they will cause damage to a fast growing tourism industry and casino business according to rnz a new zealand radio station climate change climate change is understandably also a big issue for many of the pacific islands governments the cook islands prime minister henry puma has asserted that once the united states withdrew from the 2017 paris agreement on climate change other countries were prepared to step into the vacuum of leadership that is left by america in the south pacific but apart from its access to pacific island fisheries through a south pacific treaty the u s plays a role in fisheries management through its involvement in a western and central pacific fisheries commission and the u s maintains a number of programs to help pacific island countries combat illegal fishing these include agreements with 10 of these countries that allow u s coast guard ships and aircraft to patrol national eezs on their behalf backlash against a chinese diplomat in nauru meanwhile china has increased pressure on taiwans unofficial partners in the pacific islands in an attempt to further reduce taiwans influence in the region according to the uscc report following taiwan president tsai ing wens visit to the island nation of palau in 2017 china was reported to have banned chinese tour group visits to palau in an attempt to pressure palau to abandon taiwan tourism plays a key role in palaus economy and chinese tourists comprise nearly half of all tourists visiting the island according to the uscc while beijing has bolstered its diplomatic presence in the south pacific chinese diplomats have a mixed record so far in their efforts to enhance chinas image in one case in mid september of last year an island leaders angry pushback against a chinese diplomat went public naurus president baron waqu demanded that china apologize for arrogance shown at a pacific islands forum pif where he accused the chinese of buying their way through the region theyre not our friends they just need us for their own purposes president waqu told reporters according to a report from agence france presse afp the summits usual discussion on climate change was overshadowed by naurus row with china over its treatment of asylum seekers held on the island under a deal with australia as afp reported the

addresses our full year 2018 financial results and 2019 outlook in more detail eric and i will take your questions after which i ll wrap up our call with a few closing comments let s dive into review some of our performance highlights from last year where we delivered strong revenue and earnings growth our full year consolidated adjusted revenue increased by 15 to 48 billion and we reported full year adjusted income from operations of 3 6 billion or 14 22 per share representing a per share increase of 36 these results were driven by substantial growth in contributions across each of our businesses including strong retention levels the continued expansion and deepening of our customer and client relationships and solid new growth across our portfolio cigna also delivered industry leading medical cost trends for the sixth consecutive year our sustained market leading performance will further be strengthened as we integrate and leverage the core capabilities of express scripts express scripts concluded 2018 with continued strong performance and delivered its lowest commercial pharmacy trend on record of 0 4 details of which will be provided next week in our annual drug trend report express scripts also achieve better than 98 client retention for 2019 all while continuing to invest in innovations that benefit customers patients clients as well as healthcare providers overall cigna delivered very strong results in 2018 with growth across our portfolio of businesses our continued growth reflect cigna s proven approach to service integration and how it delivers real value for the benefit of our customers patients clients and healthcare provider partners a recent report on the value of integration which was externally validated show the clients with cigna medical pharmacy and behavioral benefits reduced annual medical costs by an average of 645 for each person with an identified health improvement opportunity savings can increase to nearly 10 000 for individuals with certain chronic conditions as we look forward cigna is evolving our definition and approach to integration driven by the insights we gain from a deeper understanding of our customers as well as the broader capabilities from our express scripts combination our approach to integration focuses on the coordination of services around the individual and their whole person health needs both body and mind this approach also further expands choice so access is available anytime anywhere based on our customer and patients needs and preferences to do this we must remove friction and help our customers and patients connect to the services which are best aligned to their health status in an environment where some are restricting access in order to narrowly drive affordability at cigna we see an opportunity to further expand customer choice and to make it easier for people to access the health services they need how and when they need them this includes accessing care in a doctor s office an urgent care center a retail setting or an employer clinic or for more acute needs at a facility based settings such as the hospital or outpatient service center increasingly at home in a coordinated fashion and through digital platforms that are linked with their healthcare professionals this choice based delivery model also allows us to guide our customers and patients toward solutions that help the healthy stay healthy better predict and address risk factors for the healthy at risk and ensure we deliver affordable high quality healthcare choices for the chronically ill as well as those facing acute conditions making it easier for our customers and patients is important but it is also critical for a healthcare provider partners at cigna we see our role is being the connective tissue that links customers and patients with their healthcare providers in order to help them improve their health and well being we continue to partner align with and enable healthcare providers rather than seeking to own compete with or just intermediate them our combination with express scripts strengthens and accelerates our focus on coordinating services around our individual customers and patient needs one of the steps that is essential for cigna to unlock additional value for our stakeholders is the effective integration and leveraging of express scripts capabilities our immediate priority is to ensure we deliver on our commitments to customers patients and clients in 2019 and our position to do so in 2020 this includes the strong service delivery we were able to create in january 2009 an important implementation period i couldn t be more proud and appreciative of our team s focus passion and delivery as we stepped into 2019 as a health service company we see our 74 000 co workers around the world as the greatest asset we have in carrying out our mission and delivering exceptional value for those we serve as we move through 2019 and beyond with a focus on improving affordability expanding choice and broadening our reach we have three key areas of focus first to optimize the significant medical and pharmacy cost synergy opportunities which will directly benefit our customers patients and clients and help to improve affordability second to harness the breadth and depth of our combined data to better predict and identify conditions or behaviors and improve connectivity between our customers patients and healthcare providers and third to leverage new growth opportunities and expand reach across our businesses as we enter new geographies and broaden our solution portfolio let me use accredo as an example of how we ll create real value in improving affordability and leveraging data the first two items i referenced for accredo express scripts specialty pharmacy business brings a comprehensive patient center care model to improving prescribing adherence and clinical program co ordination accredo has more than 500 specialty pharmacist and a field force of 550 nurses providing in home care across the united states in fact an accredo at home nurse is within just one hour of a home visit for 85 of americans today cigna plans to begin leveraging specialty pharma service services from accredo in 2019 to deliver affordability improvements and better health outcomes for our customers and clients considering this specialty pharmacy is the fastest growing cost category in healthcare today this will create clear and meaningful affordability benefits second when looking at leveraging data today accredo and express scripts apply advanced informatics to identify patients who are likely to be non adherent or have demonstrable gaps in care for example bluetooth enabled health monitoring devices tied to blood glucose monitors or rescue inhalers track patients health in real time basis and trigger targeted outreach and support moving forward we will further strengthen and deepen the actual insights from this type of pharmacy data by connecting it with our medical and behavioral data additionally we will share resulting insights with our collaborative accountable care physician partners to further improve their patients health outcomes connecting our physician partners with these actionable insights is especially important when supporting people who suffer from chronic conditions for example those with chronic conditions are seven times more likely to suffer from depression and as many as 6 in 10 americans live with at least one chronic condition all of which further demonstrates the importance of effectively leveraging medical pharmacy and behavioral data to drive better health building on the consultative of selling success cigna and express scripts teams our teams are already on a targeted basis identifying pursuing new enterprise growth opportunities an example includes expanding pbm services for some health plans that we currently serve through cigna s payer business additionally we have already engaged in targeted expansion opportunities for cigna s health management capabilities to be offered to express scripts health plan clients taken as a whole our integration and value creation initiatives are off to a very strong start and we look forward to discussing this in more depth with you at our investor day on may 31st before i close let me briefly comment on our 2019 outlook our growth inaudible has a proven track record of delivery and provides multiple path for sustained growth in 2019 and beyond for 2019 we expect revenue growth attractive eps growth and strong free cash flows all positioning us to deliver a 15 average annual eps growth over the next three years and enabling us to achieve our 20 million to 21 million eps target in 2021 to conclude our team strategic framework along with capital position and significant free cash flow position us to lead an environment of continuous change improve affordability expand choice and enhance predictability for our customers patients and clients all while focusing on treating the whole person both body and mind we are positioned to continue delivering attractive sustainable growth we have high we have significant strategic flexibility and financial flexibility and high visibility toward achieving our 2021 eps target of 20 to 21 per share and with that i ll turn the call over to eric eric palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks david good morning everyone my remarks today i will review cigna s 2018 results and provide our outlook for 2019 key consolidated financial highlights for 2018 include adjusted revenue growth of 15 to 48 billion earnings growth of 33 to 3 6 billion after tax earnings per share growth of 36 to 14 22 and continued strong operating cash flow these results reflect the underlying strength of our business and provide us with considerable momentum as we drive growth and advance our integration priorities in 2019 regarding our segments i ll first comment on integrated medical 2018 revenues grew 13 to 33 billion driven by commercial customer growth and expansion of specialty relationships as well as premium growth reflecting underlying cost trends we ended 2018 with 17 million global medical customers driven by an organic increase of 584 000 lives led by growth in our select middle market and government segments as we completed our eighth consecutive year of organic medical customer growth we continue to grow in both risk and aso funding arrangements with a highly consultative approach that aligns affordable solutions with the needs of our customers and clients full year earnings grew 20 to 3 5 billion on a pre tax basis reflecting growth in medical customers and specialty relationships continued effective medical cost management and favorability in our us individual business turning to medical costs for our total us commercial book of business full year medical cost trend for 2018 was 3 6 we are pleased to have delivered industry leading medical cost trend results for a sixth consecutive year and we are focused on further expanding our capabilities to improve health outcomes and medical cost performance which drives increased value for customers and clients as they continue to confront challenges with the affordability of healthcare our combination with express scripts accelerate our ability to create that value enabling us to drive further personalization of services and deeper engagement and collaboration with customers patients clients and our healthcare professional partners our total medical care ratio or mcr of 78 9 for full year 2018 reflects the continued effectiveness of our medical cost management capabilities in both our commercial and government businesses favorability in our us individual business and the pricing effect of the resumption of the health insurance tax full year 2018 integrated medical earnings benefited from 97 million pre tax of favorable net prior year reserve development including 8 million of favorable prior year development in the fourth quarter i would note the days claims payable or dcp was 40 7 at december 31st for the integrated medical segment reflecting an increase of 0 7 days over the prior year and a decline of 2 9 days sequentially due to the normal fourth quarter claim payment seasonality and our stop loss business and consistent with prior years these claims payable is generally lower for the integrated medical segment than for our previous global healthcare segment as a result of the reclassification of international healthcare products which had higher than average days claims payable due to longer claim payment cycles that business transition to the international market segment overall cigna s integrated medical segment delivered very strong financial results in 2018 turning to our health services business full year 2018 revenues were 6 6 billion and pre tax earnings were 380 ph million results for 2018 reflect solid performance for cigna s mail order pharmacy operations in support of our integrated value proposition and contributions from the express scripts business following the close of the combination on december 20th turning to our international markets business our full year 2018 results reflect continued attractive growth and profitability as revenues grew to 5 4 billion an increase of 9 and full year 2018 pre tax earnings grew 12 to 735 million reflecting solid business growth continued administrative efficiency and strategic investments for long term growth for our group disability and other operations segments full year 2018 revenues were 5 1 billion full year pre tax earnings for this segment increased to 529 million with strong performance from our life business offset by unfavorable disability claims overall segment delivered strong growth and profitability in 2018 across each of our growth platforms as i turn to a discussion of our outlook for 2019 and specifically our expectations for continued attractive growth relative to our 2018 performance i will start by highlighting the headwinds and tailwinds that we have quantified previously specifically the 2018 earnings per share performance should be adjusted for the following three items a reduction of 0 40 per share of us individual business outperformance a reduction of 0 30 per share a favorable prior year reserve development and finally an increase of 0 20 per share associated with the industry tax which was in place for 2018 but is suspended for 2019 when adjusting for these impacts cigna s 2018 earnings per share was 13 72 as we continue to drive strong value for our customers and clients we step into 2019 with momentum in each of our businesses we remain intently focused on delivering on our promises to the marketplace of outstanding service delivery and clinical quality continued innovation and deepened customer and client relationships all while we continue to advance our integration priorities i would remind you that our outlook for 2019 adjusted revenues and adjusted income from operations excludes contributions from transitioning clients for full year 2019 we expect consolidated adjusted revenues in the range of 131 5 billion to 133 5 billion we expect full year 2019 consolidated adjusted income from operations to be 6 2 billion to 6 4 billion or 16 to 16 50 per share this represents very attractive growth in the range of 17 to 20 over our 2018 baseline we would expect the cadence of earnings per share in 2019 to be approximately 45 in the first half and 55 in the second half of the year taking into consideration seasonality patterns within our businesses with our health services segment in particular driving a greater proportion of its earnings in the second half of 2019 as well as continued progress on realization of administrative expense synergies throughout the year for 2019 we also project an expense ratio in the range of 10 to 10 5 which reflects ongoing efficiencies and administrative expense synergies in line with our previous estimate of 112 million pre tax we d also note that our outlook includes approximately 200 million pre tax of temporarily stranded operating costs associated with anthem s early termination of pharmacy services for 2019 we projected consolidated adjusted tax rate in the range of 23 5 to 24 5 additionally our outlook excludes any contribution from future share repurchases as well as prior year reserve developments i will now discuss our 2019 outlook for the integrated medical and health services segments we expect full year integrated medical pre tax earnings in the range of 3 65 billion to 3 80 billion this outlook reflects strength and growth in our businesses driven by continued benefits from organic customer growth deepening of customer relationships and effective medical cost management this outlook also contemplates a return to more normalized margins in our us individual business key assumptions reflected in our integrated medical earnings outlook for 2019 include the following regarding global medical customers we expect 2019 growth in the range of 300 000 to 400 000 customers driven by continued strong customer and client retention and new growth in our commercial business as well as mid single digit percentage growth in medicare advantage enrollment and our outlook for medical customer growth also contemplates an expected enrollment decline in our us individual business of approximately 70 000 customers turning to medical costs for our us commercial employer book of business we expect full year 2019 medical cost trend to be in the range of 3 5 to 4 5 with the expected increase over 2018 full year trend due to expected higher utilization of services as well as continued benefits from our initiatives to improve affordability including those we are further enabling through the combination with express scripts we expect the 2019 medical care ratio to be in the range of 80 5 to 81 5 reflecting continued strong performance of our commercial and government businesses the impact of the health insurance tax suspension in 2019 as well as changes in business mix for our health services business we expect full year 2019 pre tax earnings in the range of 5 05 billion to 5 2 billion for 2019 we expect adjusted pharmacy claims in the range of 1 17 billion to 1 99 billion claims i would note that this range includes all claim volumes associated with cigna s mail order and specialty pharmacy operation in addition to claims associated with the acquired express scripts business our 2019 guidance range is consistent with express scripts previous expectation of 2 to 3 growth in core adjusted pharmacy claims our guidance does not include cigna pharmacy claim volumes we expect to transition from optumrx and consistent with all of our key performance metrics this guidance range does not include pharmacy claim volumes associated with transition in clients we also expect strong growth in contributions from our international markets group disability and other businesses they continue to deliver more personalized and affordable solutions for the benefit of those we serve regarding interest expense we expect total costs of approximately 1 7 billion pre tax in 2019 inclusive of approximately 900 million of incremental interest associated with the financing of the combination with express scripts in the corporate segment all in for full year 2019 we expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of 6 2 billion to 6 4 billion or 16 to 16 50 per share this represents 17 to 20 growth over our 2018 baseline but also to remind you that our outlook continues to exclude the impact of future share repurchases and prior year reserve development overall these expected results represent a very attractive outlook aided by strong performance of our diverse and differentiated portfolio of businesses and the highly accretive combination with express scripts these expected results are also consistent with our multi year growth outlook and position us well to achieve our 2021 earnings per share target of 20 to 21 per share now moving to our 2019 capital management position and outlook our subsidiaries remain well capitalized and we expect them to continue to drive exceptional free cash flow with strong returns and capital even as we continue reinvesting to support long term growth and innovation in 2018 we deployed 130 million of parent company cash to repay current maturities of long term debt we completed our debt offering to finance the combination with express scripts and we repurchased 1 6 million shares of stock for 329 million with the resumption of share repurchase following the close of the combination we ended 2018 with a debt to capitalization ratio of 50 9 as previously discussed our top capital deployment priority is accelerated debt repayment with the objective of returning our debt to capitalization ratio to the upper 30s and debt to ebitda ratio in the mid 2s within the next 18 to 24 months for 2019 we project capital available for deployment of approximately 6 2 billion in 2019 we expect to deploy approximately 4 2 billion to debt repayment and approximately 0 8 billion to capital expenditures as we have communicated previously while we reduce leverage over the next two years we expect to also have capacity for additional capital deployment which can be allocated toward reinvestment back into our businesses to drive further innovation and growth strategic m a on a targeted basis and or returning capital to shareholders primarily through share repurchase in january of 2019 we repurchased 1 1 million shares for 209 million our balance sheet and free cash flow outlook remain strong benefiting from our highly efficient service based orientation that drives strategic flexibility strong margins and returns on capital now to recap our full year 2018 consolidated results reflect considerable strength and momentum across our diversified portfolio of global businesses and continued effective execution of our focused strategy the fundamentals of our business are strong we ve entered 2019 intently focused on delivering on our commitments to the marketplace while we advance our integration priorities and are well positioned to achieve the attractive financial targets we ve established for 2019 through 2021 we are confident in our ability to achieve our full year 2019 earnings outlook and have strong visibility into our 20 to 21 earnings per share target for 2021 which represent a 15 average annual growth rate over the next three years with that we ll turn it over to the operator for the q a portion of the call questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions the first question comes from ralph giacobbe with citi you may ask your question ralph giacobbe citigroup analyst thanks good morning just hoping you could help with the bridge or the underlying assumptions a bit more within the guidance i know you mentioned the jumping off point being closer to 13 72 i think in the past you ve talked about sort of high single digit growth in the legacy cigna business even if we use 7 that s kind of 14 65 and i think at the time of the deal you said core express would be mid teens accretive which i think is at least 2 sort of an incremental and would sort of suggest above the high end of the guidance so just hoping you can maybe help with where that s offered if something has changed from your initial view and just the assumptions in underlying core performance between the segments thanks david cordani president and chief executive officer it s david good morning let me frame and offer for eric to add onto my framing first big picture for 2019 our outlook is in line with our planned expectations broadly speaking and puts us on the trajectory to deliver on our 2021 commitment of 20 to 21 of eps to appreciate you re walking through the bridge you take the core portfolio the core legacy cigna portfolio is performing well then we ll continue to perform well we step into 2019 with strong performance within express scripts from that standpoint not to quibble with you on the math but you re about right it s about 2 going back to the announcement i would just point you to one additional data point eric emphasized and highlighted the fact that within our assumption for 2019 right now is approximately 200 million before tax of temporarily stranded overhead tied to the early termination that s temporary we will eradicate that through three mechanisms one execution of ebi which remains on track but there ll be some temporary dislocation to additional leverage from organic growth in three the significant capacity leverage that we ll be created as we utilize express scripts for the cigna volumes over the near term future so when you pull all that together we are on track both delivering an outstanding result in 2019 of 17 to 20 of eps growth even including that stranded overhead eric anything i missed eric palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer i think those are the major headlines david ralph giacobbe citigroup analyst thanks operator thank you mr giacobbe the next question comes from a j rice with credit suisse your line is open a j rice credit suisse analyst thanks and thanks for all the comments around guidance i guess you guys are the first guys to have a conference call since the hhs release last night so i m proud to ask you about that since that s a top the main topic for a lot of us can you there is a lot of aspects to that i guess i would just ask you broadly do you see any particular challenges there opportunities or what would the key open questions from that proposal be and then always the question i know hhs is saying they don t have the regulatory authority to implement anything in the commercial market but if this goes forward do you think we ll maintain a two tier system where the medicare part d will have its one set and in the commercial market we ll stay pretty much as it is any thoughts on those sounds would be helpful david cordani president and chief executive officer a j good morning it s david so just appreciate the questions stepping back we are 100 committed to providing affordable high quality health and well being services to our customers patients and clients in the us and across the globe a key driving force behind our strategic combination with express scripts is to further improve on affordability and we build off of strength with another year of outstanding medical cost trend in the cigna business portfolio of 3 6 six years in a row and just a phenomenal result in the express scripts portfolio at 0 4 pharmacy trend the headline number one is the proposed rebate rule will not have a meaningful impact on our growth or earnings trajectory specifically as you noted the proposed rule will be evaluated over the next 60 days applies to medicare advantage and pdp the mechanism that exists in terms of the way rates are built up for medicare advantage as well as pdp largely by design flow and respect the rebates and path through the way the rates are billed so we don t see a major amplification to that business portfolio and then inferred in your comment it does not apply to the commercial marketplace we do see some opportunities in the proposed rule as articulated for example i provide the mechanism to even further accelerate value based care programs with the pharmaceutical manufacturers you ll recall from the day we announced our proposed combination on march 8th we talked about that as an important initiative that we passionately believe in this will provide some further accelerant to that as well as potentially open up some additional chassis to work with pharmaceutical manufacturers to get better alignment but big picture we do not see it having a material effect on the business portfolio as configured and we re on track to deliver the 17 to 20 eps growth in 2019 a j rice credit suisse analyst okay great thanks a lot operator thank you mr rice the next question comes from josh raskin with nephron research your line is open joshua raskin nephron research analyst hi thanks good morning i just want the first one is just a clarification are you guys saying that express is indeed 2 accretive in 2019 as part of the guidance and then the rest is legacy core with the 200 million of stranded and then my real question is to the combined company and sort of when do you come to market with that pitch and i know you guys have been laying the foundation for that integrated approach but when is sort of that broker consultants education began when did the large employer group starting to hear that and when do you think that actually starts to resonate and how do we start thinking about changes in direction around membership growth especially on the on the us commercial side eric palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer josh it s eric i ll take the first part of the question i think to the nearest dollar 2 is part of the right number that s actually a little bit less than that so think of it in the 1 50 to 2 range in terms of the accretion from the express scripts acquisition for next year david you take the other portion of the question david cordani president and chief executive officer josh first specific to the go to market proposition it s important to note that each portfolio and each platform is performing well and growing well we re delighted that we re able to step into 2019 with very strong growth within the esi portfolio and another year of strong organic growth within the cigna portfolio additionally important to highlight as it relates to growth as we look inaudible into 2020 within our organization growth starts with outstanding retention deepening of relationships in addition of new business relationships within the express scripts portfolio there ll be a lower percentage of their business that s out to bid for 2020 than was for 2019 and you recall a phenomenal retention result for 2019 think about that is about 30 less business and out today for 2020 versus 2019 the early look in that has the health plan part of the portfolio which is the earlier part of the portfolio that is up for renewal in terms of decision making process and we re pretty well through that process with all known clients thus far making decisions renewing and no loan losses from that standpoint so strong platform we will step forward through 2019 and 2020 with evolve value propositions to answer the core of your question interactions are starting to take place with the broker and consulting community and that will happen in a phased mechanism there will not be a singular new product offering that is pushed on the market rather additional capabilities that will offer more choice both through the legacy of the cigna distribution model as well as through the express script distribution model so strong foundation an early look at outstanding retention stepping into 2020 within the express portfolio already today and then emerging momentum around expanding choice as we sit here in 2019 we re building momentum to 2020 joshua raskin nephron research analyst thanks operator thank you mr raskin the next question comes from gary taylor with j p morgan you may ask your question gary taylor j p morgan analyst hi good morning i just had a question around the new healthcare services segment the guidance of 5 05 billion to 5 2 billion can you tell us what growth that would represent year over year or what legacy cigna pbm plus express would represent essentially because it might sort of back the envelope looks like that would be flat is down slightly but there is obviously some disclosure we don t quite have eric palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer it s eric number of the moving pieces in there so probably not constructive to walk through all of the different kind of in s and out s and dynamics there fundamentally we ve got growth reflected in terms of the operations that make up the health services segment as well as the integrated medical segments there is good growth in both but really not able to kind of pull the pieces apart in the call today david cordani president and chief executive officer and gary it s david just one add on and maybe we ll ask will and team to follow up with you afterward as the new business segments are configured you may recall and i know it s all net new is a portion of the cigna pharmacy business for example is moved into the health service business the mail order aspect et cetera however the integrated aspects of the pharmacy business remain in the integrated health portfolio so we could take that offline with you and follow up to put walk through the pieces but at the end of the day there is solid organic growth in both of those portfolios driven by our retention and expansion relationships in the net new business adds gary taylor j p morgan analyst thank you operator thank you mr taylor the next question comes from justin lake with wolfe research you may ask your question justin lake wolfe research llc analyst thanks good morning i just want to clean up the 200 million commentary then i had a question so to be perfectly clear you re saying that 19 is carrying this overhead reduction of this 200 million is that the total number of lost overhead contribution from anthem or is that is there going to be more in 2020 eric palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer justin it s eric i think of the 200 million as the amount stranded in 2019 associated with the transitional time at about 0 40 earnings per share ultimately as that business transition we ll get those costs out of the system or on track for our 20 to 21 in 2021 that the final exact timing will play out in terms of cost coming out this year versus next year as anthem takes it works through their transition plan and such but again think of that as the amount we ve estimated for this year that we will absorb and that will need to come out of the system as we go into 2021 justin lake wolfe research llc analyst okay and to be clear that s a drag on the on the services business so even though it might look like there is not much growth there that would be 200 million that you didn t expect to have this year and is that also a drag versus the accretion number given if i didn t expect to have that as well because of the timing so we should track that for those dollars of the accretion their 2 of accretion eric palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer that s correct on all fronts so think about that is is almost entirely or entirely within the health services segment and i think about that as in the short term a drag on the cost it s temporary and we re still are on track for our long term expectations there justin lake wolfe research llc analyst okay then if i could just sneak in my question on rebates express historically put out a number of 400 million i know you don t think it all goes away with commercial and can you give us an update there worst case scenario if rebates go away where do you think that would be then any comment cvs put out some discussion around rebate guarantees being affected by inflation anything there that you see as a headwind for 2019 those two those two things would be helpful thanks david cordani president and chief executive officer justin it s david good morning you ve effectively put in about four questions let me try to wrap a couple of them together first specific to the commercial side of the equation as noted previously the rebate rule is articulated and proposed does not affect the commercial market as you go back you re correct let s go back and use the numbers that we put out first for express scripts about 95 of all rebates discounts et cetera pass back second per prior conversation about 50 of all clients with an express scripts opt for today will pass through rebate models that covers importantly about two thirds of the volume so there is a little disproportionality of that the net of that is we have multiple funding mechanisms already in hand today and a line payment models that work for clients across the commercial health plan and government agency sector that work for them and work for us to get levels of alignment and we ll continue to evolve those over time specific to the rebate guarantees you ll note that we did not call that out as a headwind stepping back our industry broadly speaking has guarantees as a part of it whether that s in the formal nature of a guarantee cost offering a discount guarantee a rebate guarantee a trend guarantee or otherwise and both legacy organizations have a great track record of effectively gaining alignment and managing those on a go forward basis lastly i would just add that express scripts had some visibility into the decelerating trend environment and as such took appropriate actions with their services contracts so again we have not called that out as a headwind justin lake wolfe research llc analyst thanks operator thank you mr lake the next question comes from kevin fischbeck with bank of america merrill lynch you may ask your question kevin fischbeck bank of america merrill lynch analyst great thanks wanted to go to the cash flow guidance which you guys are providing here the numbers that you ve been giving generally speaking have kind of excluded anthem as a client so does that 6 2 billion number include any cash flow that you d be earning from anthem and transitioning clients this year or is that excluding that and then just trying to think about this number it s kind of a base to think about next year is there anything onetime in this number or just a good number to think about for 20 plenty of cash flow available to the parent if we just add earnings growth per say to that eric palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer kevin it s eric so overall think about the 6 2 billion figure that i referenced as all in so it is comprehensive for the enterprise in terms of capital generated there will be the rate and pace of us achieving our synergies the rate and pace of capital investment and the rate and pace of our debt repayment will be the main things that will go into that come to mind in terms of the kind of the top tier impacts but we would expect to have in excess of 6 billion for each of the next couple of years available in this framework kevin fischbeck bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay so even though anthem goes away earnings growth kind of makes up for that 6 billion as starting point before all the other uses of cash eric palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer right kevin kevin fischbeck bank of america merrill lynch analyst alright great thanks operator thank you mr fischbeck the next question comes from steven valiquette with barclays you may ask your question steven valiquette barclays capital analyst great thanks guys good morning dave and eric so i guess for me just another quick question here on the early anthem pbm transition i guess other than the stranded costs that you alluded to i just want to hear your view hopefully confirmatory that they really should not be any other unexpected consequences in 2019 for the remaining pbm business that cigna express related to things like either let s say less purchasing power or lower rebate collections or something like that because of their early anthem transition thanks david cordani president and chief executive officer steve good morning it s david no there will not be any impact we from the day of the announcement we excluded transitioning clients from all aspects of how we looked at the combination the business the outlook et cetera but there are no other impacts that you need to be concerned about steven valiquette barclays capital analyst okay and just a quick mlr question here on the gains 80 5 to 81 5 could you just remind us again how that compares year over year on an apples to apples basis when adjusting for the half ph to the 78 9 you just posted in 2018 is that essentially flat when you do the adjustment or it s a little higher or little lower just wanted a little more color there as well thanks eric palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah steve its eric so in terms of the moving pieces with the mlr i think the industry fee suspension is the single biggest piece the other changes i would call out would be more auto factors we ve already talked about so industry fee suspension is the single biggest fees we ve talked about the normalization of our individual plans margin i mean in the absence of prior year development in our outlook those would be fees that would account for the movement from this year into our guidance for next year steven valiquette barclays capital analyst got it okay great thanks operator thank you mr valiquette the next question comes from steve tanal with goldman sachs you may ask your question stephen tanal goldman sachs analyst good morning guys thanks for the question just that two sort of topics i wanted to touch one is just thinking about the long term earnings growth algorithm or target the 10 to 13 you guys used to put out there how are you thinking about that now and then secondly just to round out kind of the discussion on the earlier transition of anthem i guess could you kind of just give us what the new level of year one accretion assumed in the low and high end of the guidance provided as now and how comfortable are you that those costs are truly temporary and i guess just separately like why was an earlier transition of anthem s business not sort of contemplated to the initial accretion targets provided given the change in control provision of the contract david cordani president and chief executive officer steve it s david first relative to your broader or big picture question first by way of background we ve delivered approximately 15 eps cagr since 2009 so take 2009 the initiation of our strategy in 2018 we ve been above the high end of the articulated 10 to 13 range over the next three years the next chapter of our strategic horizon we are on track again to deliver 15 eps accretion on average over the next three years and we look forward to refreshing our long term outlook as we go forward so we ll have an excess of a decade of 15 eps growth outperforming our long term targets as it relates to the latter part of your question all along we understood that we are transitioning clients and we excluded transitioning clients from our eps outlook our accretion outlook et cetera no one could predict the rate pace and timing of termination the termination is an early termination it may create a temporary dislocation as eric articulated of approximately 0 40 of eps or 200 million before tax even with that we re able to deliver 17 to 20 eps cagr year over year off of a tremendous base in 2018 and we did anticipate it hence the evi initiatives are under way but we re taking those in a paced fashion and we will deliver on the evi initiatives as well as tremendous organic growth so those costs will be eradicated there is just a temporary dislocation that takes place in 2019 and even with that we re able to deliver the 17 to 20 eps growth stephen tanal goldman sachs analyst thanks so just with that i guess it sounds like maybe you re still guiding to double digit accretion x the 0 40 or at the midpoint of guidance or any color on that part eric palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer the way i would think about it steve and as we ve discussed before the core accretion fundamentals of the combination remain intact hence we re on target for our 20 to 21 and the core fundamentals of the cigna business portfolio remain intact as eric referenced in the prior question that was asked if you take the accretion that would ve been inferred on date of announcement of mid teens about a 1 90 you back off about 0 40 for the temporary dislocation of overhead and you want to back into a buildup you re about right there in 2019 and even with that we re delivering the 17 to 20 eps growth rate thanks stephen tanal goldman sachs analyst perfect thank you operator thank you mr tanal the next question comes from zach sopcak with morgan stanley you may ask your question zach sopcak morgan stanley analyst hey thanks for the question so i want to ask about the other transition with your members shifting from optumrx two questions one is there how straightforward of a transition is that and is there anything in that process you re concerned about in terms of the member experience and two like i understand that s not going to impact 2019 earnings but is it at all a significant contributor to that 15 of cagr to get to your 2021 target range thank you david cordani president and chief executive officer zach good morning it s david so stepping back remind you today we own and operate our own pbm and it s successfully done so for many years we also implemented the successful strategy five six years ago to break it into modules and to partner with others to perform some of those modules for us initially catamaran that transitioned to optum and it s worked quite well and successfully with optum as a good constructive partner earlier this year we announced on a line plan in time frame with optum in terms of our shared view in terms of an orderly transition that will take place that positions us in a way to have a very disciplined orderly transition of those services and relationships and there is a good track record of transitioning services to them and transitioning services back to us within the respective modules and that ll take place over the next approximate two year horizon it ll create some significant volume uptake for express scripts which is a positive one way you can think about that is the cigna volumes on today s basis when internalized within express scripts make up order magnitude of 75 maybe a little higher 75 of the lost volumes from anthem so it s quite significant but it will take place on a rateable basis over the next couple of years and again we have a successful track record of in a very disciplined basis of transitioning services to and from other providers hope that helps operator thank you mr sopcak the next question comes from peter costa with wells fargo securities you may ask your question peter costa wells fargo securitiesq analyst so along that line david can you explain have you accelerated the optum timing of bringing that business in house relative to anthem choosing to go early away from you and when did anthem notify you of their decision to go early david cordani president and chief executive officer good morning answer to your questions is no we had a very orderly indiscipline process laid out we have a very successful and growing captive pbm we have a very successful strategy approach that we ve been executing within the captive pbm and a very strong partnership relationship with optum around shared value delivery we laid out a very orderly timeline that allows for a disciplined two year transition putting our customers front and center and the coordination services with our physician partners so that timeline and the strategy around that is commensurate what we believed was appropriate and highly aligned with our service provider partner peter costa wells fargo securitiesq analyst and then when did anthem notify you of their decision and should i assume that 75 of the 0 40 of stranded overhead goes away with just from optum coming in house eric palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer not going to get into the dates and timing i think peter to the second part of your statement a way to think about the overhead that we articulated before there are three mechanisms to dispatch of that and it will be removed first and foremost a very disciplined evi plan that was laid out and is being executed in an orderly basis two good organic growth and then we started 2019 with good organic growth in the express scripts portfolio and third the very disciplined leverage of the cigna volumes within the portfolio all of that will contribute to and the evi program was put in place to actually take out the cost structure so we see some additive opportunities as we look to the future from the sustained organic growth in the leverage of the cigna capabilities operator thank you mr costa the next question comes from david macdonald with suntrust you may ask your question david macdonald suntrust analyst yeah good morning david just one quick question you now have a meaningfully scaled mail order business i was wondering if there is an opportunity to potentially sell additional products or services through that channel over time and now that you ve deepen the combination of pharmacy and medical is there also an opportunity to expand and further leverage some of the incremental clinical horsepower express brings things like evercore therapeutic resource centers et cetera david cordani president and chief executive officer david good morning so to your first question i appreciate it tremendously and express scripts is built and has a proven track record of having a pretty phenomenal mail order fulfillment capability so it s a service capability that s aided by quite innovative technologies patents et cetera and we will on a disciplined fashion continue to look at how that core capability that you come back to potentially could be used and leverage for other services that benefit customers patients or clients on a go forward basis and i appreciate the call out specific to the clinical integration and clinical leverage absolutely absolutely a core part of our both organizations got excited about from early conversations was the shared leverage i articulated in their prepared remarks a little bit between leverage around the accredo capabilities relative to the deep clinical excellence they have coupled with the home health coordination services that exist and bringing some of that together secondly from a data set standpoint the ability to enrich insights for practicing clinicians to more comprehensively understand the life or health needs of patients and as you articulate within the core evercore capabilities there are tremendous opportunities where we are on a focused basis already working through additional step function improvements in the clinical capabilities of the combined corporation which gone back to benefiting our customers and clients and further improving affordability and clinical quality so yes to both points and we couldn t be more excited on the early traction on the second point already operator thank you mr mcdonald the next question comes from scott fidel with stephens you may ask your question scott fidel stephens inc analyst hi thanks good morning i had a question just on i know you are not giving specific earnings guidance anymore for our international and group insurance so just interested if you could give us maybe some more qualitative or directional commentary and how you re thinking about earnings trends for those two segments in 2019 eric palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer scott it s eric thanks for that a couple of headlines that come to mind for me on there so first of all i ll continue to have good growth momentum in both businesses we would expect that we will continue to grow in both and the differentiated return to work platform we ve got in the disability business continues to serve as well and again continues to be a growth chassis for us then the international markets business again continue to grow that platform as well closed on november 30th on our acquisition of onepath life in new zealand just as an example of the continued expansion of the international markets platform in chassis still continue to move that forward as well but overall really no changes to the underlying growth story and the momentum that we ve gotten into those businesses operator thank you mr fidel the next question comes from matthew borsch with bmo capital markets you may ask your question matthew borsch bmo capital markets analyst maybe just if i can ask a question this way on the rebates relative to the draft rule understanding that the commercial payers are not immediately into or not impacted by this rule but if so if rebates were to disappear entirely in theory what would be the earnings impact at this point for commercial eric palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning david we don t have a theoretical eps answer to the theoretical action you articulate stepping back an attempt to be helpful again about 95 of all discounts and rebates within the express scripts portfolio pass through and are shared about 50 of our clients opt for today for pass through rebate relationships and that equates to because of the scale of those clients equates about two thirds of the volumes and previously indicated express scripts retains about 400 million that s a before tax number i would add the reason why i think your question to be is unanswerable as the model continues to evolve so the evolution of value based contracts and our shared direction in terms of continuing to move toward and more comprehensively toward total cost total value relationships with our clients whether they are commercial clients health plan clients or governmental agencies is the direction that express scripts was on is the direction of the cigna has been on and it s the direction that the combined corporation goes forward on so those tools and leverage continue to evolve and you ll see us continue to move away from trying to perceive maximize a single lever as opposed to maximize the overall value which is total cost and total quality as we go forward operator thank you mr borsch the next question from comes from charles rhyee with cowen you may ask your question charles rhyee cowen and company analyst hey thanks for taking the question wanted to ask you obviously reaffirmed the year 2021 target of 20 to 21 a share i just wanted to put that into context with you previously kind of guided synergy target about 600 million and if we think about now with the transitioning of anthem a little bit early when we think about that number 20 21 in relation to the guidance and then you obviously outlined some your growth excited about growth opportunities and optimizing the medical and pharmacy side of it what pieces contribute that trajectory toward the 2021 and i guess what i m really asking is can you start to kind of quantify for us a little bit sort of sizing what you think these other opportunities are in relation to the 600 million because if i recall correctly that 600 million was largely an overhead kind of a synergy target thanks eric palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer charles it s eric i ll start with a couple of other pieces and maybe ask david to give some more overall color and commentary so at a macro level we continue to be on track with the synergies as assumed and as we discussed back in 2018 and as we disclosed in this for last year the synergies that we ve put out and that were quantified there primarily reflect lower administrative costs and we would expect that those would occur over multiple years over the first four years of the transaction we re generating 112 million of pre tax administrative synergies for 2019 and that builds to 600 million in 2022 you re correct that we expect to generate meaningful additional improvements in the pharmacy and medical costs through the combination both through the clinical combinations and some of the other items that david discussed today those benefits will primarily in order to the benefit of our customers and clients as it is again in terms of the synergy pieces those are the pieces you should think about and we re on track and consistent with how we teed up the transaction initially dave will give some additional color here david cordani president and chief executive officer and so just a bridge when you think about today to 2021 we try to articulate there is three major building blocks to get to the 20 to 21 per share the underlying base performance of both assets the synergies that eric just made reference to and you articulated the 600 million of before tax synergies and the impact to the p l of the deleveraging which we re already on board for the deleveraging path that s the basic crosswalk between 2018 and 2021 additional opportunities above and beyond that which we said are not built into the accretion model our further leverage and enhancements of the growth chassis of the portfolio as we go forward and identify additional opportunities for growth whether it s net new growth or further deepening of relationships anything beyond what the core businesses are performing is excluded from that today as well as potential additional value at a shareholder level versus passing back to the customer and clients from the leverage of express scripts for the transition of the cigna portfolio into the express scripts portfolio so the basic crosswalk is base performance synergies and deleveraging to get us from 2018 to 2021 operator thank you mr rhyee the next question comes from ana gupte with svb leerink you may ask your question ana gupte svb leerink analyst hey thanks good morning can i follow up on the this question just now on the express synergies more on a near term basis both administrative and medical can you talk about on the administrative side is there anything you can do to accelerate the schedule you provided in the s4 or in today s guidance and how much of it is potentially even going to retain your business in the july renewal season 11 2020 ph season given anthem is now talking about 3 billion in savings much sooner optum is 250 or 300 and pmpy savings just from rx and then to follow up on david your commentary around the power of express and cigna together when will we see proof of concept on that combined business as far as medical cost trend or medical loss ratio impact or you know accelerated share gains and growth david cordani president and chief executive officer ana good morning it s david let me try on the points to be responsive here specifically as eric has articulated a couple of times there is a 112 million of synergies shareholder synergies we signed up for in 2019 so a step toward the 600 million you ll note we re being very disciplined we re making sure that the expense has come out in an orderly basis we may outpace that but the business plan and the guidance we ve articulated doesn t assume that and with that and with the transitioning client impact et cetera we re delivering 17 to 20 of eps growth specifically as it relates to the medical and pharmacy cost synergies and value creation that will unfold throughout 2019 and 2020 and benefit our clients and customers on a client or customer basis depending on the products program and the services they have and i would note that we have very good growth and outstanding retention in all of our business portfolios stepping into 2019 and we can have another good growth year and i articulated an early glimpse to express scripts renewals for 2020 which we re tracking very very favorably right now as it relate to proof of concept you should not think about cigna coming back to you with a net new proof of concept of something de novo we are seeking to build that doesn t exist today as a concept to roll out in the marketplace rather we are systematically further enhancing the value propositions for our commercial clients for our health plan clients for our government agency clients and offering more choice which will unfold in 2019 and 2020 with expanded capabilities and further clinical integration and effective use of data at our investor day we will seek to bring some of those to life with both words examples and challenge ourselves to give some tangibility even in terms of some of the supporting technologies and workflows but it is not a net new concept the capabilities unfold pretty rapidly throughout 2019 and we ll expand additional choice for the benefit of clients and customers as we step into 2020 operator thank you ms gupte the next question comes from frank morgan with rbc capital markets you may ask your question frank morgan rbc capital markets analyst good morning thanks for the color on the anthem optum swap of business 75 of that volume could be recovered but when i think about it from a profitability standpoint how should you be thinking about the profitability on the anthem book loss versus the savings you ll realize by bringing that back in house that s number one and then number two was just one of the headwinds you re calling out for the year was the outperformance you saw last year in the integrated medical segment i think mainly the individual segment is there anything specifically that you would like to call out as to why that should revert or is it just simply conservatism thank you david cordani president and chief executive officer good morning it s david on your first question i would ask you not to think about the profitability of those two components step away from it we ve excluded the transitioning clients from all aspects of our conversation from the day we announced the proposed combination and the earnings impact of that from an eps standpoint have been excluded we have in 2019 this temporary dislocation of overhead that from a whole transparency basis we walked through laid out 200 million before tax and that ll be removed from the system in a pretty expeditious fashion and we have multiple levers to address that but i would ask you not to think about profitability of the cigna portfolio versus the anthem portfolio because they re not comparables from that standpoint as it relates to the individual market you are correct we articulated in our third quarter call the fact that we re quite pleased with the performance of the individual portfolio of businesses we expect it to be profitable in 2018 it is it s outpaced the high end of our strategic margin threshold and for 2019 planning purposes we believe it s prudent when you look at that program and the design of that program to plan for margins that are more in line with our strategic margin trajectory which is somewhere between 4 and 6 before tax and for 2019 we ve planned for it to be at the higher end of the range which we think is a more sustainable indication of what that portfolio programs there is nothing systematic beyond in terms of dislocation in that marketplace we just believe it was appropriate to plan for in view that marketplace runs in a 4 to 6 before tax margin versus the significant margin that was delivered above and beyond that in 2018 operator thank you mr morgan the final question comes from dave windley with jefferies you may ask your question david windley jefferies company analyst hi thank you good morning thanks for squeezing me in david the disability business has been on a journey to kind of evolve process and bring margins back up to normal levels and then this quarter calls out some unfavorable claims are those things at all related do any actions needed to be taken relative to the unfavorable disability claims and then one last clarification on the 200 million if you were as you have said excluding anthem from all the results were those 200 million allocated to that exclusion and now they become real or another way to think about it weren t those 200 million stranded from the very beginning because of the assumption that anthem would be excluded eric palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer david it s eric so maybe i ll take the second one first on that i really just think about the 200 million is kind of a timing matter right so the cost that would have been allocated to the contract they would have been gone away for all the reasons david described earlier it is in the q a session here i m thinking about the timing just because of the earlier transition now that those costs won t be able to be allocated to the volumes that would be going away through there but think about it that way on the group life and disability you know we ve talked a number of different calls over time about the variability that can happen on any one line quarter by quarter things along those lines i wouldn t call it anything particularly systemic or anything along those lines but just that we had favorable life insurance experience and a little bit unfavorable disability experience in the quarter here operator thank you mr windley and now i ll turn the call back to david cordani for closing remarks david cordani president and chief executive officer thank you to wrap up our call i d just like to highlight some key points from our discussion cigna delivered substantial earnings and revenue growth across our businesses in 2018 we re committed to broadening our approach to integration which focuses on coordination of services around the individual and their whole person health needs both body and mind this approach also further expands choice so access is available anytime anywhere based on the customers and patients needs and preferences we have a well positioned portfolio of businesses with multiple paths for sustained growth in 2019 and beyond for 2019 we expect revenue growth attractive eps growth and strong free cash flows which position us to deliver 15 average annual eps growth over the next three years and put us on target to deliver our 20 to 21 eps target 2021 we thank you for joining our call today we look forward to our future conversations operator ladies and gentlemen this concludes cigna s fourth quarter 2018 results review cigna investor relations will

thanks for taking the time today to join us as i walk you through our results for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2018 i ll give you my insights on the past year along with our key achievements and then matt will provide more details on our financial results and outlook for the first quarter of 2019 with that i ll conclude with my perspective on 2019 and the most notable trends we re seeing across our businesses put 2018 in perspective what we re most encouraged about is our team s ability to advance our growth strategy and deliver strong financial and operating performance while having to contend with a number of challenging conditions our performance this past year testament to our continuous improvement culture and to the mti employees who are the backbone of it alignment of our entire organization behind our culture values and performance objectives have been instrumental in expanding mti s leadership positions in many key markets product lines and geographies now let me take you through some of the highlights of the fourth quarter we delivered earnings per share of 1 17 6 increase compared to last year we achieved 5 eps growth for the full year total sales for the quarter increased 4 marking our sixth consecutive quarter of sales growth i ll provide more details on my full year remarks on what s driving our growth and our confidence in the trend continuing sales in the minerals businesses grew 3 in the fourth quarter much of this driven by our performance materials segment which grew sales by 6 despite the recent slowdown in the china automotive market metalcasting business drove higher volumes of greensand bonds across asia and north america resulting in a 6 sales growth household and personal care sales increased 50 with a contribution of sivomatic continued solid growth of our pet care products in north america and asia performance in our service businesses were solid as well sales growing 6 driven primarily by higher volumes of refractory products supported by strong steel market conditions total operating income for the quarter was 64 million and we delivered double digit operating margins across all segments cash flows were also strong with the fourth quarter being our highest cash generating quarter of the year key takeaway for the fourth quarter as well for the year is our ability to tightly manage what was in our control higher raw material energy and logistics costs persisted through the fourth quarter however our pricing actions and operating performance driven by strong productivity improvement and tight expense control allowed us to more than offset these inflationary costs in the fourth quarter as well as for the second half of the year as i mentioned we continue to make progress on our growth initiatives i ll talk about more details shortly here is a chart that shows our quarterly eps performance for the last several years as i mentioned earlier our eps for the fourth quarter was up 6 compared to 2017 continuing our earnings growth trend this chart shows our full year earnings trend 2018 marked the ninth consecutive year of record earnings for mti a reflection of our company s ability to successfully execute on opportunities as well as navigate the challenges faced over the past several years before getting into specific highlights and how we achieved our top and bottom line results i d like to provide a brief overview of 2018 challenging year but i m proud of what we achieved and the resiliency our team showed foundation business fundamentals and key growth drivers are on solid footing sales increased 8 over last year to 1 8 billion a record sales level for the company and our earnings per share grew 5 to 4 84 sales in all four of our segments increased during the year and we made significant progress on all three facets of our growth strategy geographic expansion new product development and acquisitions from a geographic expansion standpoint asia continued to be a strong growth region for us given the large market opportunities we have there in paper pcc and metalcasting these are two product lines i ve highlighted on previous calls and for good reason they continue to provide attractive near and long term expansion and penetration opportunities to drive growth over the past two years we ve secured contracts for over 400 000 tons of pcc capacity 165 000 tons of which was secured during the past year our penetration strategy for metalcasting in asia also continues to progress sales in the region up 7 over last year as i ve mentioned in the past we have significant growth prospects for our metalcasting business in asia i m encouraged with how we ve been able to leverage our deep technical expertise and value proposition to capture new opportunities with foundry customers in the region geographic expansion is occurring throughout asia as well as other regions and across multiple product lines i ll highlight a few places we saw double digit sales growth in india turkey indonesia and thailand india led the way with sales up 24 driven primarily by metalcasting sales in turkey were up 14 driven by both metalcasting and refractory indonesia sales grew 21 as a result of increased paper pcc sales and sales in thailand were up 11 driven by both metalcasting and household and personal care second aspect of our growth strategy innovation and new product development has always been a key focus area for mti our actions to drive accelerated new product development are paying off we have a robust pipeline of innovative value added products that continues to be strengthened as we better leverage the voice of our customers emphasize speed of development and utilize standardized processes past year we commercialized 35 new products and increased the speed of development by 21 products have the potential to deliver over 100 million in revenue additionally the amount of revenue we generated in 2018 from our new product pipeline increased 13 over last year we continue to improve the speed of our development and the revenue derived from our new products highlighted many of our new products throughout the year such as the launch of inaudible envirofil and variations of our new yield technology created these specifically to meet the demands of our customers who require environmental sustainable and recycling solutions and lastly we also executed on the third part of our growth strategy acquisitions through the addition and successful integration of sivomatic sivomatic met all of our m a criteria and is an excellent strategic fit with our company doubled the size of our cat litter business expanded its global reach brought additional premium products to our portfolio and increased our bentonite mineral reserves around the world sivomatic is performing above our expectations and we see additional opportunities to leverage it and extend our global cat litter reach purchased the company integrated it and largely paid down the acquisition debt in the six months time frame is a clear indicator for our financial and operating capability to grow inorganically turning to our operating performance we had a strong year we overcame difficult mining and operating conditions in the first half of 2018 ended the year with a 6 overall productivity improvement which is the ninth consecutive year of achieving 5 or higher we also maintained tight control of our costs holding them flat over 2017 while absorbing the full sivomatic overhead we ve discussed throughout the year a number of external dynamics weighed on our business and margins most significant of which was rising raw materials logistics and energy costs took decisive actions to mitigate each of these including diversifying our raw material sources utilizing our internal logistics capability leveraging our close relationships with suppliers reducing costs and increasing prices initiatives began to take hold in the middle of the year we finished 2018 on an upward trajectory with our performance more than offsetting these inflationary pressures situation during the year played out as we described it would with margins improving in the second half there were other external factors such as tariffs currency fluctuations and rising interest rates all of which our organization successfully navigated our continuous improvement culture is the foundation of mti and its importance to driving performance couldn t have been clear during the last year our employees across the globe demonstrated their deep level of engagement they were instrumental in helping mti solve the challenges we face through suggestions to reduce costs as well as hosting kaizen events designed to remove waste from our processes all of which helped drive productivity improvements and expense reduction these efforts by our employees across the company underscore how we can successfully leverage our operating platform and mitigate pressures on our performance shifting to the capital deployment activities in 2018 we maintained a strong balance sheet through our disciplined approach to capital allocation free cash flow grew 9 over last year excluding the tax efficient pension contributions we made and we deployed that cash in a balanced manner 76 million of this cash was used to fund high return organic opportunities as well as to maintain and improve the performance and safety of our facilities we used a portion of our cash to acquire sivomatic and also returned 29 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends all in all 2018 was a solid year for mti though we faced some distinct challenges in our operating environment i am proud of what our team accomplished especially on the growth cost reduction and continuous improvement fronts we ve laid the foundation for profitable growth and operational improvements heading into 2018 2019 with that let me turn it over to matt who will take you through our financial results and outlook in more detail after matt s remarks i ll come back and conclude with what we re currently seeing for 2019 matt matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury and chief financial officer thanks doug and hello everyone i ll review our fourth quarter and full year results the performance of our four segments and also provide you with our outlook for the first quarter fourth quarter sales grew 4 versus the prior year or 5 after adjusting for foreign exchange our sales growth was driven by higher pricing and higher volumes across several product lines as well as the acquisition of sivomatic gross margin was 25 2 of sales versus 26 5 in the prior year as we continue to face higher raw material freight and energy costs we ll detail for you in a few minutes how we are strengthening our margins and advancing on recovering inflationary costs in the fourth quarter we reduced both the absolute and percentage sg a year over year including the addition of sivomatic overhead sg a costs were 10 9 of sales in the quarter a 100 basis point reduction from the prior year as the operating income bridge shows profitable growth and the actions we have taken on price productivity and expenses generated 13 5 million of business performance which more than offset 12 3 million of cost increases in the fourth quarter overall operating income increased 2 versus the prior year to 64 1 million earnings per share grew 6 to 1 17 driven by the solid operating performance as well as a lower tax rate reported earnings per share were 1 22 a difference of 0 05 per share it s primarily due to a one time benefit from adjustments related to the us tax law change let s move to the full year for the full year sales grew 8 to 1 8 billion driven by growth across all segments notably metalcasting sales grew 12 on higher volumes of greensand bonds in north america and continued penetration in asia hpc sales grew 47 primarily due to the contribution of sivomatic higher pet care revenue in both north america and asia and increased european fabric care sales refractory segment sales grew 12 driven by higher refractory product volumes in north america and europe as well as higher pricing gross margin for the full year was 25 6 versus 27 9 in the prior year as we ve previously discussed higher raw material freight and energy costs were the primary drivers of the year over year margin decline sg a as a percent of sales was down 90 basis points as we managed expenses tightly throughout the year operating income was 2 lower than the prior year driven by 41 4 million of inflationary cost increases we mostly offset these increases with 37 1 million of business performance which includes necessary pricing actions operating margin was 14 4 in 2018 140 basis points lower than the prior year revenue associated with cost pass through diluted margin by 30 basis points while the net of inflationary costs and higher business performance reduced margin by 110 basis points this margin dilution is reversing as our pricing actions are overcoming costs and we expect margins to improve over the course of 2019 and lastly earnings per share for the full year grew 5 to 4 84 which is a record performance for the company now let s take a closer look at how we are recovering inflationary costs as you re aware we faced significant increases in raw material freight and energy costs throughout the year the major raw materials that impacted our businesses were lime and paper pcc and magnesium oxide in refractories freight rates and truck and rail availability impacted logistics costs across our businesses and higher energy rates impacted production and mobile equipment fuel costs as shown by the red bars in the chart we experienced significant cost inflation in the first half of the year which accelerated by 9 million in the second half the green bars in the chart show that our business performance lagged the inflationary cost increases in the first half however with improved pricing some of which was contractually lagged productivity and profitable sales growth business performance increased by 17 1 million in the second half and exceeded the higher inflationary costs that we faced looking ahead we are diligently managing what is in our control driving pricing productivity and cost control all of which will help us advance our margins now let s review the performance materials segment in more detail performance materials sales increased 6 in the fourth quarter compared to last year sales improved on 6 higher metalcasting and 50 higher hpc sales due to the contribution of sivomatic and increased pet care sales in north america and asia this growth was partially offset by lower sales in building materials resulting from fewer large projects and a decrease in basic minerals due to prior year bulk chromite sales in the quarter the business absorbed 4 2 million of higher raw material and logistics costs which we more than offset with 5 3 million of higher pricing productivity cost control and the full integration of sivomatic segment operating income increased 4 to 29 2 million and operating margin was 14 1 versus the prior year of 14 4 looking to the first quarter pricing actions will largely mitigate continued logistics and energy inflation also hpc will benefit from continued strength in pet care and fabric care markets while building materials and environmental products will experience typical seasonality in metalcasting we re seeing a slowdown in china automotive production which is impacting our customers casting production volume however we still expect positive overall growth in our metalcasting business in china driven by further penetration of our value added greensand bond products we re also seeing some casting production shifting from china to southeast asia and europe as a result of global tariff changes and in addition the us foundry market continues to be stable overall our global metalcasting footprint positions us well to pick up these geographic shifts in volume now for the segment we expect operating income in the first quarter to be similar to that of the fourth quarter let s turn our specialty minerals segment specialty minerals fourth quarter sales were down 1 year over year at 142 5 million in pcc 2 growth in asia and 3 higher specialty pcc sales partially offset the previously announced paper machine shutdowns in north america processed minerals sales were flat versus the prior year as sales to the automotive industry remained strong while sales to the construction markets in the us and europe were slower segment operating income was 21 9 million down 1 4 million from last year segment faced inflationary cost increases of 4 1 million driven by higher energy and lime costs which we partially offset with 2 8 million in business performance as i mentioned last quarter we absorbed higher lime costs in the fourth quarter and we will recapture with contractual price increases in the first quarter however we are seeing higher lime pricing continuing into 2019 and we will be recapturing these costs on our typical lagged basis turning to the first quarter we expect lower volume in north america and continued growth in asia a recent announcement of the closure of the georgia pacific port hudson facility however will impact paper pcc volumes in north america starting in the first quarter of 2019 based on our analysis and customer feedback we do expect a portion of these paper volumes to eventually be absorbed by other producers where we have satellite facilities we will continue with pricing actions to recover higher energy and logistics costs and we expect more moderate growth in our automotive markets typical seasonality will impact construction activity with sales expected to pick up in the spring for the segment we expect operating income to be 1 million lower than the fourth quarter primarily due to the lower volume in north america now let s turn to our refractory segment refractory segment sales increased 9 in the fourth quarter and operating income increased 6 refractory product sales were up 14 on continued strong steel utilization rates and higher pricing this segment faced 19 million in higher raw materials and energy costs over the course of 2018 primarily driven by magnesium oxide and other refractory raw material increases despite these challenges refractories achieved record operating income for the full year due to a proactive sourcing strategy value added product substitutions for our customers and necessary pricing actions now looking to the first quarter we expect continued strong conditions in north america however we are seeing signs of slowing steel production in turkey and in addition while we expect another strong year for laser measurement equipment sales we plan to deliver fewer units in the first quarter therefore we expect operating income to be lower by 1 million sequentially let s move to energy services energy services sales were slightly lower in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year and 1 million higher sequentially operating income grew to 2 3 million as offshore market activity has moderately improved and we are participating in larger longer lasting jobs operating income in the first quarter is expected to be similar to the fourth quarter and we see a healthy pipeline of projects for the first half of 2019 particularly in filtration equipment sales now let s review our liquidity and debt highlights we continued to generate strong cash flow in 2018 and we deployed our cash in a balanced way across internal investments the sivomatic acquisition debt repayment and returns to shareholders cash from operations was 204 million in the year this included 15 million of incremental discretionary pension contributions that we made to take advantage of a one time tax savings opportunity we deployed 76 million of capital expenditures spread across high return projects sustaining our operations for future profitability and environmental health and safety projects to ensure a healthy and safe environment for our employees and other stakeholders we acquired sivomatic for 123 million using both cash on hand and debt we also repaid 80 million of associated debt to end the year with a net leverage ratio of 2 2 times ebitda finally we returned 29 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends total liquidity for the company remains strong at 413 million comprised of cash and equivalents of 213 million and 200 million available capacity on our revolving credit facility our balance sheet remains strong and we have the liquidity to continue our balanced approach to capital deployment now let me summarize what we expect for the first quarter in performance materials we expect our actions around pricing productivity and cost control to offset logistics and energy inflation in specialty minerals we expect continued growth in asia and contractual price adjustments related to lime increases in 2018 we ll also take additional pricing actions as inflationary cost increases continue we expect operating income to be 1 million lower sequentially due to a combination of higher lime costs and the volume impact of the port hudson closure for the refractories segment we expect strong conditions in north america and europe to continue we expect operating income to be 1 million lower sequentially due to softness in the turkey steel market and the timing of laser measurement equipment sales for energy services we expect a similar level of offshore activity cold snap in the us is expected to result in supply chain delays and increased logistics costs and in addition foreign exchange translation is expected to be unfavorable relative to prior periods in total then first quarter earnings per share is expected to be around 1 10 while we are seeing a slower start to the year we expect the growth opportunities we have created to deliver another year of solid earnings growth for mti now i ll hand it back over to doug for our perspectives on the year ahead douglas t dietrich chief executive officer thanks matt before moving to q a let me provide some high level themes on the year ahead first and foremost our team is energized focused and prepared to build on the momentum in 2018 continue to pursue our growth strategy strengthen and deepen the value realized from our operating culture and execute on the opportunities we generated last year global economic backdrop that we face in 2019 is different from what we experienced in 2018 from a macro perspective we re seeing slowing growth rates in china as well as more modest growth rates in europe however we still expect relatively positive markets in the us across most of our product lines within this backdrop we are confident in our ability to advance a number of key growth drivers that i ve discussed today paper pcc expansion strategy in asia will continue to build momentum with the addition of 300 000 tons of capacity coming on line driving volume growth later this year and into 2020 in addition we have a robust pipeline of satellite targets and new technology opportunities globally and expect to secure additional paper pcc contracts this year in our metalcasting business we anticipate another solid year and expect overall volumes to continue to grow in china primarily through strong penetration of our greensand bonds the significant opportunities to grow our global pet care platform through increased demand for our products and by leveraging the sivomatic business to expand our market position and we ll be exhilarating our new product development and commercialization efforts geared toward providing our customers higher value solutions to address the needs there will be some cost inflation challenges in the year ahead but as we demonstrated last year our strong operating performance along with the necessary pricing actions and cost control measures will drive continued margin improvement throughout the year mti is entering 2019 with strong alignment on all fronts we re aligned on our strategy and objectives and we re focused on building mti for the long term profitable growth strong earnings and high returns for shareholders we re a company to be counted on in all parts of the economic cycle for our strong operating culture a solid balance sheet and our ability to closely control costs all of this gives us confidence that 2019 will be another year of profitable growth for mti with that let s open the call for questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions and our first question will come from daniel moore with cjs securities daniel j moore cjs securities analyst doug matt good morning thanks for taking the questions douglas t dietrich chief executive officer hi dan matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury and chief financial officer good morning daniel j moore cjs securities analyst i want to start out i guess kind of the bridge between the two the q1 guide and doug the more optimistic sort of outlook for the full year as we look into 19 earnings growth has lagged top line growth for a few quarters that reversed here this quarter but it looks like you won ph a few challenges once again so you talked in general terms about continued operating expansion in the coming year what are the puts and takes that you see and what kind of range of sort of pre tax or ebit margin expansion do you think is reasonable to think about for fiscal 2019 douglas t dietrich chief executive officer yes i think to answer the first part of your question dan first piece of it was look we are seeing a little bit of a slower start to the year got a couple of challenges just recently actually with some of the cold temperatures freezing up some logistics and we re working through that right now we expect that might be a little bit of a cost to us in the quarter but we did see some right out of the gate in the first couple of weeks of the year some slower pull from some of the markets we don t see that that s going to continue foreign exchange matt said that over the past several quarters that started to become a little bit more of a drag but so we think it s a little bit slower start to the quarter and the guidance we gave but what i m trying to contrast there is we ve got a lot of things coming at us for the rest of the year the pricing actions that we know will take hold we re building we have some expansions that came online we see some strong pull from customers in our newest products some of our new commercializations that were new products commercialized late last year that we feel had some good traction moving into the year later this year 300 000 tons of capacity in paper pcc is going to be coming online so there s a number of kind of forward upward momentum that we started last year that will continue to take hold through the year that we think will offset kind of the slower start and continue to drive those earnings as far as margins we think at a normalized rate this company certainly at 15 can i tell you that that s going to happen this year i think as we see costs continue to go up matt mentioned contractually we re going to lag a little bit that we see they might plane over toward the second half of the year and i think we ll catch up i think as we get to kind of average pricing those normalized margins will get back to 15 so do i see the end of our cost inflation no i haven t seen it yet i think that s going to continue through the first half but should that go over i think we ll start with our pricing actions operating cost structure we ll get back to that kind of normalized rate of 15 daniel j moore cjs securities analyst very helpful the port hudson with the impact of the closure can you give us a sense for both q1 and full year 19 either tons and or revenue on a year on year basis douglas t dietrich chief executive officer sure i think last year that facility over the past couple of years has probably bounced between 70 000 tons 80 000 tons of pcc what we know now is that that s going to start to ramp down this quarter i think probably late february march that will impact the quarter as matt mentioned we do though one of the things that s interesting about this is with operating rates this closure came with operating rates in north america in the low 90s around 90 typically we see a closure like that as you ve seen in the past you d see something when the operating rates dip below around 80 so this one is a little different and what we are feeling right now is some pull from customers pcc pull from other customers and that gives us an indication that this paper is probably going to shift around we re not exactly sure of that yet we don t have any indication of exactly where but we re getting some customer higher customer pull from pcc in other facilities which leads us to believe that probably some of this will be absorbed elsewhere and most likely where we have some facilities i can t give you the full impact on the year but that s the range it was in terms of total tons for last year daniel j moore cjs securities analyst very helpful understood and then maybe one more and i ll turn jump back to queue in terms of just looking back to the quarter basic materials are we through now with the tough comps as far as chromite is concerned do we have any revenue in q1 q2 of 2018 and besides chromite was there anything else that sort of contributed to the decline in q4 maybe a little sharper than what we ve experienced over the last few quarters matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury and chief financial officer dan you characterized it the right way we are done with bulk chromite impacting us on the revenue and on the operating income line within basic minerals so you won t see that going forward in the quarter it did have a little bit of a drag as i spoke to but on a go forward basis fully out daniel j moore cjs securities analyst perfect understood thanks for the color matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury and chief financial officer beyond bulk sorry i just remembered you asked anything else inaudible place in basic minerals beyond bulk chromite what you have in the other parts of performance materials you do have some drilling fluids that go into the permian basin for the energy markets and you are starting to see with a little bit of a drilling slowdown and some of the rig counts coming down onshore that some of our business may be slowing a bit related to drilling muds in the energy sector daniel j moore cjs securities analyst got it okay thank you again operator and moving on we ll go to silke kueck with jpmorgan silke kueck jpmorgan analyst hi good morning how are you douglas t dietrich chief executive officer hi silke silke kueck jpmorgan analyst i was wondering whether you can identify what the magnitude of price increase was this quarter and how much freight pass through contributed to sales and also what the magnitude of like the sivomatic acquisition was on sales this quarter matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury and chief financial officer when you step through the bridge on the 4 increase you did have that fx that went against us about a 1 pure price pass through related to freight and lime was about 1 percentage point and then you had other pricing that we were driving which was about another 2 percentage points the remainder of that is really the net from lower bulk chromite sales and the addition of sivomatic in the quarter silke kueck jpmorgan analyst okay douglas t dietrich chief executive officer so total sivomatic sales for the year included in our results is about 62 million it s only nine months eight months it was so on an annualized rate it s about 4 higher than what we had described when we purchased the company back in april so that gives you a rate that s why we re saying sivomatic is really performing well for us it s still growing sales and we ve seen strong performance out of it for the eight months that it has been the part of the company silke kueck jpmorgan analyst secondly what s your total pcc production capacity how many tons did you make in 2018 douglas t dietrich chief executive officer capacity or tons matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury and chief financial officer yeah douglas t dietrich chief executive officer yes we re selling around 300 million tons i think in total for the year of capacity we generally run pretty high end in that capacity we re probably 85 90 is typical we make sure that we have enough room in there for high filler technologies when we deploy them we have enough room for customer growth and expansions and also some of that is just an efficient capital deployment so when we build the facility we have half of a carbonator you are putting it in so we run about 85 90 total of capacity i can t give you exact capacity number but that s around it silke kueck jpmorgan analyst okay helpful and lastly yet again the sg a cost you managed very well given all the headwinds and given the acquisition do you think you have the right headcount or do you think you may need more people to grow the business as you expand the inaudible offshore with respect to foundry for metalcasting in china and india and other opportunities douglas t dietrich chief executive officer yeah the question you re asking do we have the right headcount i think we ve not held back on headcount required to ensure that we re efficiently growing sales producing our products innovating et cetera that said we re always looking for opportunities and i don t want to call it just in heads just in discretionary expenses we re always looking for ways to leverage our platform that we have and the company through shared services and our resource units we want to make sure that sales deployment as we grow that we are not we don t feel we need to incrementally grow that overhead fixed cost base we put in a system to be able to leverage it and that s what we look to do how that ends up in number of heads no we re always looking at opportunities and making sure that they have the right horsepower and people power to make sure we secure it so i can t really tell you whether we have the right or not but we re in the context we are open to making sure it s the right headcount for what we need to do and execute our strategy silke kueck jpmorgan analyst and a last question for matt if i may will you plan to continue your share repurchase program in 2019 to set ph a goal what you want to accomplish in terms of what you re going to return to shareholders and do you have a free cash flow target in mind for 2019 matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury and chief financial officer yeah silke so if you recall in 2018 free cash flow ended up being 128 million but i m going to go ahead and add back the discretionary pension contributions in my view so that gave us about 143 million in overall free cash flow with that i think we detailed for you look we acquired sivomatic we paid down 80 million in debt we returned about 29 million in shareholder value that included 22 million of share purchases those were done on an opportunistic basis and we ll very much keep the opportunistic stance going forward looking to 2019 we re targeting a higher level of free cash flow generation in that 150 million range and we ll continue to manage that with a very sound balanced approach making sure that our balance sheet approaches our target level of 2 times net leverage against ebitda as well as funding strong investments within the company organically looking for inorganic opportunities and making opportunistic share repurchases and returns to shareholders douglas t dietrich chief executive officer yes i think just to add to that we ve always taken the approach that says internal mti investments in growth are probably the number one focus of the company so steering our cash to organic opportunities around the world that makes sense high return and also to maintaining our facilities we balance then keeping our balance sheet in the right spot and as we see acquisition opportunities kind of move up and move down come forward or wane we look to opportunistically steer that capital as inaudible toward shareholders and share repurchases are the mechanisms we use so we re going to continue with that approach we have what we see is we meet regularly to talk about acquisition opportunities i can t give you anything where we are in those but it s healthy pipeline of things that we continue to look at and as they move forward and they make sense for the company similar to type of acquisition like sivomatic we think that s a strategically that s where we see value to deploy cash outside of that we can move it back to shareholders through share repurchases hope that helps you to frame it up silke kueck jpmorgan analyst yeah thanks very much for your thoughts on that operator and next we ll go to steve schwartz with first analysis steven k schwartz first analysis securities analyst good morning everyone douglas t dietrich chief executive officer hi steve steven k schwartz first analysis securities analyst first question just with respect to freight costs i want to make sure i understand clearly when you talk about you mentioned in the prepared remarks higher rail but i m also wondering if the expansion in the growth you are seeing in asia isn t also a part of higher freight costs or is that considered a completely different element within the discussion douglas t dietrich chief executive officer no it s part of it steve i think the majority of our higher freight costs we ve seen here in north america partially europe we have seen a real tightness in being able to get trucks and rail freight increases just general across the board and even specific types of trucks we do use flatbed trucks here in the north american and those of been particularly tight in 2018 in china freight costs were a piece of it a little bit different kind of influence there and that was a little bit of tightening of regulations in terms of weights on roads and so as we saw those regulations come through and lower loading levels of trucks that required more trucks and that more expense and that had to be purchased pushed through on a per ton basis so that s same truck fewer tons to the customer and so it did increase our cost there albeit a little bit smaller than what we saw in north america but yes we had to manage through that as well steven k schwartz first analysis securities analyst okay put it for the most part those costs are regional so in other words it s not you re not talking about higher freight costs because the growth in the asian business and pursuing that business is causing you to have to shift things farther at higher rates there s nothing like that in this conversation correct douglas t dietrich chief executive officer correct we re largely localized meaning we supply customers produce source produce and supply customers largely within the same region so we do shift bentonite around the world we ship other projects around the world but we highlighted on a call or two ago that those numbers are relatively small less than 5 of kind of our sales the majority is localized in region steven k schwartz first analysis securities analyst okay got it and my second question just with respect to your gross growth in the paper pcc business talk about the additional 300 000 tons coming on just wondering from a gross growth standpoint how much is are programs like fulfill and newyield unusual adding to your growth as compared to the new facilities douglas t dietrich chief executive officer got you let me kick it off frame it and then i ll let d j talk a little bit more specifically about some of these technologies and the filler contracts that we re building our satellites are billing filler tons obviously hitting revenue that s the volume the revenue associated with those tons is different around the world you ll see a lower per ton revenue sometimes in asia regions than you will in north america and europe and that s just because the input costs tend to be a little bit lower so lime cost in particular so on a revenue basis we sometimes like to talk in tons because that ton generates the same ebitda around the world newyield is a kind of per ton revenue fulfill we ve always mentioned before it s priced a little bit differently it s more technology and technology fees so that it s not necessarily revenue it kind of drops right to the bottom line so fulfill doesn t move the needle on revenue it does move the needle in operating income but i m going to let d j talk to you about a little bit about what we re building and some of what s happening with newyield in asia and other parts d j monagle group president specialty minerals and refractories thanks for the question steve couple of things so regarding the details on the 300 000 we ve got the start up in china with the chenming paper company that ll be coming on line in the second half coming toward in the second quarter so first half we ll be ramping up the facility in indonesia those two make up and they are standard pcc they make up the 300 000 tons fulfill will be offered in both those locations but probably not part of the ramp up we usually get things stabilized before the next level of technology goes in one of the other things that we had mentioned or alluded to during the third quarter call was discussions with expansions with folks and so we ve also been able to get agreement on somewhere between 25 000 and 50 000 tons that we ll be putting in india as expansions and that s just part of us applying the latest technology and helping our customers grow in their use of pcc so those will be coming on in the second half as well with regard to the other technologies like newyield and doug had also mentioned envirofil in the past both of those right now just have are being deployed one location each but i will tell you as i look at the pipeline that s going we ve got about a dozen or so satellites in the pipeline a couple of them are in envirofil a couple of them are newyield and the majority are still standard pcc majority of that being in asia but we are seeing increased interest in these new technologies in south america primarily brazil and getting some pull in europe as well so that s kind of how the pipeline is looking right now did that help steven k schwartz first analysis securities analyst yeah that s very helpful just to keep all of these different growth elements in perspective with each other so i appreciate that douglas t dietrich chief executive officer steve i will add to that a little bit d j mentioned certainly we see that opportunity to grow the base filler level but we are seeing a lot more kind of interest in and it s what s feeding ph our new product development pipeline in more environmental sustainable recycling solutions d j mentioned envirofil that is a recycling solution newyield is a recycling solutions we ve got other in our environmental products business we talk a lot about environmental solutions like fluoro sorb that s helping with waste water cleanup we ve got some low emission demand for low emission greensand bond products so as with the casting process the emissions are reduced we see some of that pull from customers so i d tell you a lot of the 35 products and a lot of what s in the pipeline is geared toward helping those customers with these type of solutions and certainly leveraging our position on that paper mill we re there every day 24 7 and helping them expand where they have issues they are facing issues water recycling and reducing fiber consumption with higher pcc so i just gave you a flavor that s not just in pcc it s kind of across the company where we re innovating in this way steven k schwartz first analysis securities analyst got it and i appreciate that thank you operator and moving on we ll move to rosemarie morbelli with g research rosemarie j morbelli gabelli company analyst good morning every one douglas t dietrich chief executive officer hi rosemarie rosemarie j morbelli gabelli company analyst i was wondering if you could talk about the revenues for the quarter it was below my expectations and i am just wondering how it stood against your own internal projections whether you were positively surprised in some areas and negatively in others matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury and chief financial officer rosemarie as we went through the quarter we generated 5 growth adjusting for foreign exchange it was very much consistent with i think how we were trying to look at the opportunities that laid against us and also consistent with what we were thinking about in terms of profitable growth over the course of the quarter on a year over year basis and also trend line where we were for most of the year in terms of overall growth and i think it lays the groundwork and doug will want to probably provide a little more detail again around the actions and activities we were taking in 2018 capturing some of those this year laying the ground work for continued top line growth in 2019 as we look forward douglas t dietrich chief executive officer hi rosemarie i think i will add to that i don t think we were i think you were saying are we surprised by it and is this something is this a trend that s going to continue what we re looking at right now i think at the end of the year sometimes it s a and matt mentioned 5 and that s a little bit below our kind of full year average of 8 but at the end of the year sometimes what happens is especially in these markets you do see some orders shift around and not exactly sure when that s going to happen i think it happened a little bit in pcc in china we had one individual customer kind of slow down in the last two weeks of the year but i will tell you that they re pulling strong as they get into the beginning of the year that tells me there is a little bit of de stocking going on i think in the construction sometimes in automotive builds we did see a slowdown in metalcasting in china i think that contributed to some of it but again i think if you want to go into the full year and we re seeing a little bit of that persistent here in january but we think going into the full year with what we have in terms of big projects that we put in place started last year that will be coming online the pricing actions the new volume the new products and certainly with the pcc that will be coming on latter half we think that that growth trend continues that said we are seeing some softening markets do i think that 8 again is possible i m not sure right now we think we can continue with our kind of mid single digits growth throughout the year might be a little bit lower than last year given where we are in china and with some of the softest we re seeing in europe but right now we re pretty confident we can continue our growth trend rosemarie j morbelli gabelli company analyst that is very helpful thank you and then looking at the metalcasting yes auto has slowed down in china but on the other hand you are working on substitution and gaining share versus the two parts greensand or whatever it is called i was wondering if you could talk about the success in substitution and whether you could grow faster than the overall market in that particular category douglas t dietrich chief executive officer yeah let me start and i will let jon hastings take it through kind of the specifics we mentioned that yes we think we see continued growth in china we probably averaged 12 to 15 type of growth over the past three years given the base demand it will probably be a little bit lower china is still growing it s just albeit slower in some of our casting products and it s not just all automotive but our penetration strategy has been a success and will continue to be this year offsetting some of that slower base volume growth jon do you want to how we do that and how we put resources to it jonathan j hastings group president performance materials sure rosemarie i ll echo a lot of the comments that doug just made overall the casting industry you can look at it in a couple of different ways automotive certainly has been impacted by changes in the tax policy and the lending practices but the remainder industrial and heavy equipment seems to be a little bit more robust you asked about our blended product strategy that does continue to work what we re seeing is consolidations in the foundry industry we are also seeing new investments in highly automated casting lines that are producing castings that are equivalent to the quality that we see in north america in order to do that those customers require high quality high consistent products that we offer to our customers as you know we tailor our products specifically to the needs of each foundry so we continue to innovate with them and those products continue to be in fairly high demand so as we get into 2019 although we don t expect a double digit growth we do continue to see the mid single digit growth as we continue to penetrate with the blending strategy douglas t dietrich chief executive officer and those blending products i ll just add jon mentioned but from the base clay to the kind of engineered solution that s a different profit profile as well and so though sales may be a little bit lower than last year or lower than last year i do see that that will help our margin expansion that s one of the elements that continues to drive margins higher rosemarie j morbelli gabelli company analyst thank you and if i may ask one last question before getting back on queue i was wondering if you could talk about the growth of the pet business excluding sivomatic douglas t dietrich chief executive officer sure jon do you want to take that one as well jonathan j hastings group president performance materials yeah so certainly you know the sivomatic story but in north america we continue to grow as well what we have found is that now that we have a premium position in both europe and north america we ve got a lot of customers that are asking to expand business with us the reason for that is multiple fold some of it is related to innovation we continue to deploy new products like lightweight litters but now we re expanding into other fragrance products as well so while we continue to work pricing to offset costs our customers are looking at us as a premier supplier in pet care and we continue to have growth in north america rosemarie j morbelli gabelli company analyst so i know you that are selling the pet care both under private labels and under your own name and i should know that but what is the mti name it is sold under jonathan j hastings group president performance materials premium choice there s a wide variety premium choices is one but again you can find those in many different ways we can come back to you with a full list of what we do douglas t dietrich chief executive officer yeah the mti brand is called premium choice but there is because we re private label you ll see kind of our bentonite and packaging throughout a number of stores walmart you ll also see it through tractor supply and petco et cetera so there are a number of outlets where you ll see private label brands there s a good chance that we re probably the one supplying that bentonite and or packaging it but ours is premium choice i hope you if you have a cat i hope you pick up that one rosemarie j morbelli gabelli company analyst thank you and no i no longer have a cat matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury and chief financial officer rosemarie also we should mention that we continue to grow that pet care business in asia in asia outside of sivomatic but asia especially in china but also other countries we continue to penetrate small base right now but same value proposition continues to play over in asia as well rosemarie j morbelli gabelli company analyst okay thank you douglas t dietrich chief executive officer thanks rosemarie operator at this time i would like to turn the call back to ms buckwalter for any closing remarks cindi buckwalter vice president investor relations and

there is a widespread concern in the world regarding china s decelerating economic growth the slowdown if it continues threatens economic activity almost everywhere growth in germany for example has already cooled due to its exports of high quality machinery to china dropping precipitously those in the oil market also worry about china the country s economic growth has been a key driver of global crude oil consumption indeed china accounts for one third of the international energy agency s projected 2019 increase in world oil use weak chinese economic growth is not the end of the oil market s prospective ills however few recognize the additional trouble on tap from the chinese independent refiners affectionally known as teapots the danger occurs because lower oil demand growth in china comes just when independent refining capacity there is rising the capacity growth has been financed primarily by debt most likely supplied by china s alternative lenders as demand slows these refiners will turn to international markets dumping products in singapore the americas or europe to earn hard cash in doing so they could plunge the global refining industry into a serious recession and drive crude prices down sharply this will not be the first time that refineries in asia caused a crisis in the oil sector in 1997 korean refiners did the same during the asian financial collapse that incident is described in the december 1997 oil market intelligence omi the report begins by noting that korean refiners had begun to seek exports markets before the crisis hit mostly to employ 620 000 b d of new refining capacity that came on stream since late 1966 the effort intensified as domestic consumption collapsed but once the won started its second descent in two years it dropped over 94 against the dollar between july 1 and december 10 much of it in early december the push to export became more desperate because the five big refiners could not recoup in domestic product prices the staggering dollar price of crude oil feedstock economic crisis spills over onto oil markets oil market intelligence december 1997 p 11 the article noted that korean refiners were trying to sell products to china taiwan and japan it added that korea s exports to china rose fourfold between january and october while its share of the chinese gasoil import market went from seven to twenty six percent the asian refining center in singapore lost market share falling from seventy five to twenty six percent the omi report also observed ominously that shippers and traders report that korean refiners are lowering prices to meet their need to expand that share the gasoil market suffered significantly the omi editors explained that korea s use was declining consumption dropped one hundred fifty thousand barrels per day or thirty three percent in december 1997 from december 1996 causing refiners to push gasoil to china those sales pressured margins at refineries in singapore the editors added if its five refiners can keep importing crude oil and the government is now talking of using foreign exchange reserves to finance crude purchases and overcome private credit squeezes it is likely to keep pumping out the product to its neighbors looking back twenty years one sees this is what happened figure 1 traces the price of gasoil and premium gasoline in singapore by month from january 1997 to december 1999 spot gasoil prices plunged from a peak of 32 50 per barrel in december 1996 to a low of 13 80 in october 1998 distillate cracks measured against spot dubai crude dropped from 9 per barrel in december 1996 to zero in 1999 arbitrage carried the impact of the korean fire sale across the globe gasoil prices fell fifty eight percent in singapore from december 1996 to october 1998 in the us gulf coast market they declined fifty eight percent from december 1996 to february 1999 in europe the decline was fifty one percent korea s fire sale of products precipitated a crude price decrease as i have written often product prices often lead crude prices this was the case in the asian crisis energy intelligence group data show that the netback on dubai crude at singapore declined from 23 per barrel in december 1996 to 9 in february 1999 spot crude prices followed as did prices for export contracts linked to spot crude prices chinese independent refiners may be emulating the action of korean refiners in 1997 and 1998 the wall street journal warned on january 23 that the economic slowdown in china could curb chinese gasoline consumption which would mean a flood of exports to the rest of asia the wsj author kevin kingsbury added that regional refining margins could be pressured kingsbury explained that the economic slowdown would reduce growth in china s oil consumption as refining capacity there increased nomura forecasts demand growth of 0 5 this year slowing from an estimated 4 last year at the same time chinese refineries will increase production capacity by some 6 according to fitch solutions he also noted that export quotas for gasoline jet fuel and fuel oil rose thirty five percent last year further increases are expected for 2019 so chinese refiners can maintain production in this regard a january 24 report from bloomberg is concerning in it jack wittels wrote that a fleet of giant newly built oil tankers is gearing up to ship diesel out of east asia five new tankers are positioned off china s coast each with a capacity of two million barrels two additional tankers will shortly join the armada four of the parked vessels are already loaded or loading the products will likely move to europe where margins are high these will not be the last shipments from china in past economic downturns the decrease in petroleum product consumption has lagged the falloff in economic activity for example the december 1997 omi began its discussion of problems in asia with this observation a few short months ago it seemed that asia s economic woes were unlikely to affect oil demand in a major way and that the financial crisis could be contained in thailand malaysia indonesia and the philippines the article then continued ruefully neither proposition looks valid anymore the increased exports from china will reduce refining margins across the globe just as margins are being squeezed by a gasoline surplus and as refiners get ready to meet the imo 2020 standard this situation could have serious impacts on us and european refiners profits could come under intense pressure particularly at firms that have been boosting product exports from the united states to europe and the americas attention must stay riveted on china for the rest of 2019 the volume of product exports from its refineries will keep rising if its economy continues to falter as many believe it will the country s problems and problems for the world refining industry will be compounded if the united states and china cannot resolve their trade war in this regard further news on wednesday january 29 was ominous platts reported that china s refiners are looking beyond asia to boost exports in 2018 chinese gasoline exports rose twelve percent from 2017 and gasoil exports seven percent there could be much larger increases in 2019 as more refining capacity comes on stream especially if china s domestic consumption stays the same or decreases by philip verleger for oilprice com
hyperinflation a kaleidoscope of uses and abuses the word hyperinflation is sprinkled throughout the press each day we read that iran is hyperinflating the same is written about zimbabwe and venezuela as well as a potpourri of other countries that are experiencing inflation flare ups while iran came close to a hyperinflation in the fall of 2012 it has never experienced an episode of hyperinflation and while zimbabwe experienced hyperinflation episodes in 2007 2008 and 2017 it is not hyperinflating now at present venezuela is the only country experiencing a hyperinflation it s clear that journalists and those they interview tend to play fast and loose with the word hyperinflation to clean up the hyperinflation landscape we must heed the words of the great eugen von böhm bawerk one of the founders of the austrian school of economics who in 1891 wrote we too must bring into our science a strict order and discipline which we are still far from having by a disorderly and ambiguous terminology we are led into the most palpable mistakes and misunderstandings all these failings are of so frequent occurrence in our science that they almost seem to be characteristic of its style yes nothing cleans up ambiguity and disorder better than clear definitions so just what is the definition of the oft misused word hyperinflation the convention adopted in the scientific literature is to classify an inflation as a hyperinflation if the monthly inflation rate exceeds 50 this definition was adopted in 1956 after phillip cagan published his seminal analysis of hyperinflation which appeared in a book edited by milton friedman studies in the quantity theory of money since i use high frequency data to measure inflation in countries where inflation is elevated i have been able to refine cagan s 50 per month hyperinflation hurdle with improved measurement techniques i now define a hyperinflation as an inflation in which the inflation rate exceeds 50 per month for at least thirty consecutive days after years of research with the help of many assistants i have documented with primary data 58 episodes of hyperinflation those episodes are listed in the hanke krus world hyperinflation table 2013 amended 2017 below hanke krus world hyperinflation table 2013 amended 2017 prof steve h hanke hungary holds down the top spot its peak hyperinflation occurred in july 1946 when prices were doubling every 15 hours zimbabwe s november 2008 hyperinflation peak is second highest but way behind hungary s indeed at their peaks the daily inflation rates were 207 in hungary and 98 in zimbabwe the most memorable hyperinflation was germany s but it only ranks as the fifth highest with a peak daily rate of inflation of 20 9 way lower than the top four rates now let s turn to the world s only current hyperinflation venezuela it ranks as the 23rd most severe today the annual rate of inflation is 120 810 yr while this rate is modest by hyperinflation standards the duration of venezuela s hyperinflation episode as of today is long 27 months only four episodes of hyperinflation have been more long lived so how do we accurately measure hyperinflations well let s take a look at venezuela s case there is only one reliable way to measure the most important price in an economy is the exchange rate between the local currency in this case the bolivar and the world s reserve currency the u s dollar as long as there is an active black market read free market for currency and the data are available changes in the black market exchange rate can be reliably transformed into accurate measurements of countrywide inflation rates the economic principle of purchasing power parity ppp allows for this transformation and the application of ppp to measure elevated inflation rates is rather simple evidence from germany s 1920 1923 hyperinflation episode as reported by jacob frenkel in the july 1976 issue of the scandinavian journal of economics confirms the accuracy of ppp during hyperinflations frenkel plotted the deutschmark u s dollar exchange rate against both the german wholesale price index and the consumer price index cpi the correlations between germany s exchange rate and the two price indices were very close to unity throughout the period with the correlations moving to unity as the inflation rate increased beyond the theory of ppp the intuition of why ppp represents the gold standard for measuring inflation during hyperinflation episodes is clear all items in an economy that is hyperinflating are either priced in a stable foreign currency the u s dollar or a local currency the bolivar if goods are priced in terms of bolivars those prices are determined by referring to the dollar prices of goods and then converting them to local bolivar prices after checking with the spot black market exchange rate indeed when the price level is increasing rapidly and erratically on a day by day hour by hour or even minute by minute basis exchange rate quotations are the only source of information on how fast inflation is actually proceeding that is why ppp holds and why we can use high frequency daily data to calculate venezuela s inflation rate even during episodes of hyperinflation even though we can measure hyperinflation very accurately using ppp no one has ever been able to forecast the magnitude or direction of hyperinflations but that hasn t stopped the international monetary fund imf from producing forecasts for hyperinflation in venezuela even though the imf does not measure venezuela s hyperinflation something that can be reliably done the imf does forecast hyperinflation something that cannot be reliably done indeed forecasts for hyperinflation can t be found in the scientific literature that impossibility hasn t stopped the imf from throwing economic science to the winds yes the imf has regularly been reporting what are in fact absurd inflation forecasts for venezuela these forecasts have been issued under the watchful eye of alejandro werner the head of the imf s western hemisphere department the chart below presents the imf s finger in the wind forecasts read nonsensical folly the imf s 2018 year end inflation projections for venezuelaprof steve h hanke surprisingly the press dutifully reported the imf s forecasts that venezuela s annual inflation rate would hit a whopping 2 500 000 by the end of 2018 in some cases this figure was reported as a forecast which it was by some it was even reported as an actual measurement which it was not in any case the imf s guestimation was a bit off i measured venezuela s annual inflation rate on december 31 2018 and it was 80 000 yr when it comes to hyperinflation and its abuses there is no one more guilty of malfeasance than the imf it repeatedly produces what no one can produce reliable forecasts of hyperinflation by steve h hanke www cato org people hanke html twitter steve_hanke steve h hanke is a professor of applied

at this time i would like to turn the call over to cindi buckwalter head of investor relations from minerals technologies please go ahead ms buckwalter cindi buckwalter vice president investor relations and corporate communications thank you paula good morning everyone and welcome to our fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call today s call will be led by chief executive officer doug dietrich and chief financial officer matt garth following doug and matt s prepared remarks we ll open it up to questions i would like to remind you that beginning on page 13 of our 2017 10 k we list the various risk factors and conditions that may affect our future results i will also point out the safe harbor disclaimer on this slide statements related to future performance by members of our team are subject to these limitations cautionary remarks and conditions now i ll turn the call over to doug doug douglas t dietrich chief executive officer thanks for the introduction cindi and good morning everyone thanks for taking the time today to join us as i walk you through our results for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2018 i ll give you my insights on the past year along with our key achievements and then matt will provide more details on our financial results and outlook for the first quarter of 2019 with that i ll conclude with my perspective on 2019 and the most notable trends we re seeing across our businesses put 2018 in perspective what we re most encouraged about is our team s ability to advance our growth strategy and deliver strong financial and operating performance while having to contend with a number of challenging conditions our performance this past year testament to our continuous improvement culture and to the mti employees who are the backbone of it alignment of our entire organization behind our culture values and performance objectives have been instrumental in expanding mti s leadership positions in many key markets product lines and geographies now let me take you through some of the highlights of the fourth quarter we delivered earnings per share of 1 17 6 increase compared to last year we achieved 5 eps growth for the full year total sales for the quarter increased 4 marking our sixth consecutive quarter of sales growth i ll provide more details on my full year remarks on what s driving our growth and our confidence in the trend continuing sales in the minerals businesses grew 3 in the fourth quarter much of this driven by our performance materials segment which grew sales by 6 despite the recent slowdown in the china automotive market metalcasting business drove higher volumes of greensand bonds across asia and north america resulting in a 6 sales growth household and personal care sales increased 50 with a contribution of sivomatic continued solid growth of our pet care products in north america and asia performance in our service businesses were solid as well sales growing 6 driven primarily by higher volumes of refractory products supported by strong steel market conditions total operating income for the quarter was 64 million and we delivered double digit operating margins across all segments cash flows were also strong with the fourth quarter being our highest cash generating quarter of the year key takeaway for the fourth quarter as well for the year is our ability to tightly manage what was in our control higher raw material energy and logistics costs persisted through the fourth quarter however our pricing actions and operating performance driven by strong productivity improvement and tight expense control allowed us to more than offset these inflationary costs in the fourth quarter as well as for the second half of the year as i mentioned we continue to make progress on our growth initiatives i ll talk about more details shortly here is a chart that shows our quarterly eps performance for the last several years as i mentioned earlier our eps for the fourth quarter was up 6 compared to 2017 continuing our earnings growth trend this chart shows our full year earnings trend 2018 marked the ninth consecutive year of record earnings for mti a reflection of our company s ability to successfully execute on opportunities as well as navigate the challenges faced over the past several years before getting into specific highlights and how we achieved our top and bottom line results i d like to provide a brief overview of 2018 challenging year but i m proud of what we achieved and the resiliency our team showed foundation business fundamentals and key growth drivers are on solid footing sales increased 8 over last year to 1 8 billion a record sales level for the company and our earnings per share grew 5 to 4 84 sales in all four of our segments increased during the year and we made significant progress on all three facets of our growth strategy geographic expansion new product development and acquisitions from a geographic expansion standpoint asia continued to be a strong growth region for us given the large market opportunities we have there in paper pcc and metalcasting these are two product lines i ve highlighted on previous calls and for good reason they continue to provide attractive near and long term expansion and penetration opportunities to drive growth over the past two years we ve secured contracts for over 400 000 tons of pcc capacity 165 000 tons of which was secured during the past year our penetration strategy for metalcasting in asia also continues to progress sales in the region up 7 over last year as i ve mentioned in the past we have significant growth prospects for our metalcasting business in asia i m encouraged with how we ve been able to leverage our deep technical expertise and value proposition to capture new opportunities with foundry customers in the region geographic expansion is occurring throughout asia as well as other regions and across multiple product lines i ll highlight a few places we saw double digit sales growth in india turkey indonesia and thailand india led the way with sales up 24 driven primarily by metalcasting sales in turkey were up 14 driven by both metalcasting and refractory indonesia sales grew 21 as a result of increased paper pcc sales and sales in thailand were up 11 driven by both metalcasting and household and personal care second aspect of our growth strategy innovation and new product development has always been a key focus area for mti our actions to drive accelerated new product development are paying off we have a robust pipeline of innovative value added products that continues to be strengthened as we better leverage the voice of our customers emphasize speed of development and utilize standardized processes past year we commercialized 35 new products and increased the speed of development by 21 products have the potential to deliver over 100 million in revenue additionally the amount of revenue we generated in 2018 from our new product pipeline increased 13 over last year we continue to improve the speed of our development and the revenue derived from our new products highlighted many of our new products throughout the year such as the launch of inaudible envirofil and variations of our new yield technology created these specifically to meet the demands of our customers who require environmental sustainable and recycling solutions and lastly we also executed on the third part of our growth strategy acquisitions through the addition and successful integration of sivomatic sivomatic met all of our m a criteria and is an excellent strategic fit with our company doubled the size of our cat litter business expanded its global reach brought additional premium products to our portfolio and increased our bentonite mineral reserves around the world sivomatic is performing above our expectations and we see additional opportunities to leverage it and extend our global cat litter reach purchased the company integrated it and largely paid down the acquisition debt in the six months time frame is a clear indicator for our financial and operating capability to grow inorganically turning to our operating performance we had a strong year we overcame difficult mining and operating conditions in the first half of 2018 ended the year with a 6 overall productivity improvement which is the ninth consecutive year of achieving 5 or higher we also maintained tight control of our costs holding them flat over 2017 while absorbing the full sivomatic overhead we ve discussed throughout the year a number of external dynamics weighed on our business and margins most significant of which was rising raw materials logistics and energy costs took decisive actions to mitigate each of these including diversifying our raw material sources utilizing our internal logistics capability leveraging our close relationships with suppliers reducing costs and increasing prices initiatives began to take hold in the middle of the year we finished 2018 on an upward trajectory with our performance more than offsetting these inflationary pressures situation during the year played out as we described it would with margins improving in the second half there were other external factors such as tariffs currency fluctuations and rising interest rates all of which our organization successfully navigated our continuous improvement culture is the foundation of mti and its importance to driving performance couldn t have been clear during the last year our employees across the globe demonstrated their deep level of engagement they were instrumental in helping mti solve the challenges we face through suggestions to reduce costs as well as hosting kaizen events designed to remove waste from our processes all of which helped drive productivity improvements and expense reduction these efforts by our employees across the company underscore how we can successfully leverage our operating platform and mitigate pressures on our performance shifting to the capital deployment activities in 2018 we maintained a strong balance sheet through our disciplined approach to capital allocation free cash flow grew 9 over last year excluding the tax efficient pension contributions we made and we deployed that cash in a balanced manner 76 million of this cash was used to fund high return organic opportunities as well as to maintain and improve the performance and safety of our facilities we used a portion of our cash to acquire sivomatic and also returned 29 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends all in all 2018 was a solid year for mti though we faced some distinct challenges in our operating environment i am proud of what our team accomplished especially on the growth cost reduction and continuous improvement fronts we ve laid the foundation for profitable growth and operational improvements heading into 2018 2019 with that let me turn it over to matt who will take you through our financial results and outlook in more detail after matt s remarks i ll come back and conclude with what we re currently seeing for 2019 matt matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury and chief financial officer thanks doug and hello everyone i ll review our fourth quarter and full year results the performance of our four segments and also provide you with our outlook for the first quarter fourth quarter sales grew 4 versus the prior year or 5 after adjusting for foreign exchange our sales growth was driven by higher pricing and higher volumes across several product lines as well as the acquisition of sivomatic gross margin was 25 2 of sales versus 26 5 in the prior year as we continue to face higher raw material freight and energy costs we ll detail for you in a few minutes how we are strengthening our margins and advancing on recovering inflationary costs in the fourth quarter we reduced both the absolute and percentage sg a year over year including the addition of sivomatic overhead sg a costs were 10 9 of sales in the quarter a 100 basis point reduction from the prior year as the operating income bridge shows profitable growth and the actions we have taken on price productivity and expenses generated 13 5 million of business performance which more than offset 12 3 million of cost increases in the fourth quarter overall operating income increased 2 versus the prior year to 64 1 million earnings per share grew 6 to 1 17 driven by the solid operating performance as well as a lower tax rate reported earnings per share were 1 22 a difference of 0 05 per share it s primarily due to a one time benefit from adjustments related to the us tax law change let s move to the full year for the full year sales grew 8 to 1 8 billion driven by growth across all segments notably metalcasting sales grew 12 on higher volumes of greensand bonds in north america and continued penetration in asia hpc sales grew 47 primarily due to the contribution of sivomatic higher pet care revenue in both north america and asia and increased european fabric care sales refractory segment sales grew 12 driven by higher refractory product volumes in north america and europe as well as higher pricing gross margin for the full year was 25 6 versus 27 9 in the prior year as we ve previously discussed higher raw material freight and energy costs were the primary drivers of the year over year margin decline sg a as a percent of sales was down 90 basis points as we managed expenses tightly throughout the year operating income was 2 lower than the prior year driven by 41 4 million of inflationary cost increases we mostly offset these increases with 37 1 million of business performance which includes necessary pricing actions operating margin was 14 4 in 2018 140 basis points lower than the prior year revenue associated with cost pass through diluted margin by 30 basis points while the net of inflationary costs and higher business performance reduced margin by 110 basis points this margin dilution is reversing as our pricing actions are overcoming costs and we expect margins to improve over the course of 2019 and lastly earnings per share for the full year grew 5 to 4 84 which is a record performance for the company now let s take a closer look at how we are recovering inflationary costs as you re aware we faced significant increases in raw material freight and energy costs throughout the year the major raw materials that impacted our businesses were lime and paper pcc and magnesium oxide in refractories freight rates and truck and rail availability impacted logistics costs across our businesses and higher energy rates impacted production and mobile equipment fuel costs as shown by the red bars in the chart we experienced significant cost inflation in the first half of the year which accelerated by 9 million in the second half the green bars in the chart show that our business performance lagged the inflationary cost increases in the first half however with improved pricing some of which was contractually lagged productivity and profitable sales growth business performance increased by 17 1 million in the second half and exceeded the higher inflationary costs that we faced looking ahead we are diligently managing what is in our control driving pricing productivity and cost control all of which will help us advance our margins now let s review the performance materials segment in more detail performance materials sales increased 6 in the fourth quarter compared to last year sales improved on 6 higher metalcasting and 50 higher hpc sales due to the contribution of sivomatic and increased pet care sales in north america and asia this growth was partially offset by lower sales in building materials resulting from fewer large projects and a decrease in basic minerals due to prior year bulk chromite sales in the quarter the business absorbed 4 2 million of higher raw material and logistics costs which we more than offset with 5 3 million of higher pricing productivity cost control and the full integration of sivomatic segment operating income increased 4 to 29 2 million and operating margin was 14 1 versus the prior year of 14 4 looking to the first quarter pricing actions will largely mitigate continued logistics and energy inflation also hpc will benefit from continued strength in pet care and fabric care markets while building materials and environmental products will experience typical seasonality in metalcasting we re seeing a slowdown in china automotive production which is impacting our customers casting production volume however we still expect positive overall growth in our metalcasting business in china driven by further penetration of our value added greensand bond products we re also seeing some casting production shifting from china to southeast asia and europe as a result of global tariff changes and in addition the us foundry market continues to be stable overall our global metalcasting footprint positions us well to pick up these geographic shifts in volume now for the segment we expect operating income in the first quarter to be similar to that of the fourth quarter let s turn our specialty minerals segment specialty minerals fourth quarter sales were down 1 year over year at 142 5 million in pcc 2 growth in asia and 3 higher specialty pcc sales partially offset the previously announced paper machine shutdowns in north america processed minerals sales were flat versus the prior year as sales to the automotive industry remained strong while sales to the construction markets in the us and europe were slower segment operating income was 21 9 million down 1 4 million from last year segment faced inflationary cost increases of 4 1 million driven by higher energy and lime costs which we partially offset with 2 8 million in business performance as i mentioned last quarter we absorbed higher lime costs in the fourth quarter and we will recapture with contractual price increases in the first quarter however we are seeing higher lime pricing continuing into 2019 and we will be recapturing these costs on our typical lagged basis turning to the first quarter we expect lower volume in north america and continued growth in asia a recent announcement of the closure of the georgia pacific port hudson facility however will impact paper pcc volumes in north america starting in the first quarter of 2019 based on our analysis and customer feedback we do expect a portion of these paper volumes to eventually be absorbed by other producers where we have satellite facilities we will continue with pricing actions to recover higher energy and logistics costs and we expect more moderate growth in our automotive markets typical seasonality will impact construction activity with sales expected to pick up in the spring for the segment we expect operating income to be 1 million lower than the fourth quarter primarily due to the lower volume in north america now let s turn to our refractory segment refractory segment sales increased 9 in the fourth quarter and operating income increased 6 refractory product sales were up 14 on continued strong steel utilization rates and higher pricing this segment faced 19 million in higher raw materials and energy costs over the course of 2018 primarily driven by magnesium oxide and other refractory raw material increases despite these challenges refractories achieved record operating income for the full year due to a proactive sourcing strategy value added product substitutions for our customers and necessary pricing actions now looking to the first quarter we expect continued strong conditions in north america however we are seeing signs of slowing steel production in turkey and in addition while we expect another strong year for laser measurement equipment sales we plan to deliver fewer units in the first quarter therefore we expect operating income to be lower by 1 million sequentially let s move to energy services energy services sales were slightly lower in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year and 1 million higher sequentially operating income grew to 2 3 million as offshore market activity has moderately improved and we are participating in larger longer lasting jobs operating income in the first quarter is expected to be similar to the fourth quarter and we see a healthy pipeline of projects for the first half of 2019 particularly in filtration equipment sales now let s review our liquidity and debt highlights we continued to generate strong cash flow in 2018 and we deployed our cash in a balanced way across internal investments the sivomatic acquisition debt repayment and returns to shareholders cash from operations was 204 million in the year this included 15 million of incremental discretionary pension contributions that we made to take advantage of a one time tax savings opportunity we deployed 76 million of capital expenditures spread across high return projects sustaining our operations for future profitability and environmental health and safety projects to ensure a healthy and safe environment for our employees and other stakeholders we acquired sivomatic for 123 million using both cash on hand and debt we also repaid 80 million of associated debt to end the year with a net leverage ratio of 2 2 times ebitda finally we returned 29 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends total liquidity for the company remains strong at 413 million comprised of cash and equivalents of 213 million and 200 million available capacity on our revolving credit facility our balance sheet remains strong and we have the liquidity to continue our balanced approach to capital deployment now let me summarize what we expect for the first quarter in performance materials we expect our actions around pricing productivity and cost control to offset logistics and energy inflation in specialty minerals we expect continued growth in asia and contractual price adjustments related to lime increases in 2018 we ll also take additional pricing actions as inflationary cost increases continue we expect operating income to be 1 million lower sequentially due to a combination of higher lime costs and the volume impact of the port hudson closure for the refractories segment we expect strong conditions in north america and europe to continue we expect operating income to be 1 million lower sequentially due to softness in the turkey steel market and the timing of laser measurement equipment sales for energy services we expect a similar level of offshore activity cold snap in the us is expected to result in supply chain delays and increased logistics costs and in addition foreign exchange translation is expected to be unfavorable relative to prior periods in total then first quarter earnings per share is expected to be around 1 10 while we are seeing a slower start to the year we expect the growth opportunities we have created to deliver another year of solid earnings growth for mti now i ll hand it back over to doug for our perspectives on the year ahead douglas t dietrich chief executive officer thanks matt before moving to q a let me provide some high level themes on the year ahead first and foremost our team is energized focused and prepared to build on the momentum in 2018 continue to pursue our growth strategy strengthen and deepen the value realized from our operating culture and execute on the opportunities we generated last year global economic backdrop that we face in 2019 is different from what we experienced in 2018 from a macro perspective we re seeing slowing growth rates in china as well as more modest growth rates in europe however we still expect relatively positive markets in the us across most of our product lines within this backdrop we are confident in our ability to advance a number of key growth drivers that i ve discussed today paper pcc expansion strategy in asia will continue to build momentum with the addition of 300 000 tons of capacity coming on line driving volume growth later this year and into 2020 in addition we have a robust pipeline of satellite targets and new technology opportunities globally and expect to secure additional paper pcc contracts this year in our metalcasting business we anticipate another solid year and expect overall volumes to continue to grow in china primarily through strong penetration of our greensand bonds the significant opportunities to grow our global pet care platform through increased demand for our products and by leveraging the sivomatic business to expand our market position and we ll be exhilarating our new product development and commercialization efforts geared toward providing our customers higher value solutions to address the needs there will be some cost inflation challenges in the year ahead but as we demonstrated last year our strong operating performance along with the necessary pricing actions and cost control measures will drive continued margin improvement throughout the year mti is entering 2019 with strong alignment on all fronts we re aligned on our strategy and objectives and we re focused on building mti for the long term profitable growth strong earnings and high returns for shareholders we re a company to be counted on in all parts of the economic cycle for our strong operating culture a solid balance sheet and our ability to closely control costs all of this gives us confidence that 2019 will be another year of profitable growth for mti with that let s open the call for questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions and our first question will come from daniel moore with cjs securities daniel j moore cjs securities analyst doug matt good morning thanks for taking the questions douglas t dietrich chief executive officer hi dan matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury and chief financial officer good morning daniel j moore cjs securities analyst i want to start out i guess kind of the bridge between the two the q1 guide and doug the more optimistic sort of outlook for the full year as we look into 19 earnings growth has lagged top line growth for a few quarters that reversed here this quarter but it looks like you won ph a few challenges once again so you talked in general terms about continued operating expansion in the coming year what are the puts and takes that you see and what kind of range of sort of pre tax or ebit margin expansion do you think is reasonable to think about for fiscal 2019 douglas t dietrich chief executive officer yes i think to answer the first part of your question dan first piece of it was look we are seeing a little bit of a slower start to the year got a couple of challenges just recently actually with some of the cold temperatures freezing up some logistics and we re working through that right now we expect that might be a little bit of a cost to us in the quarter but we did see some right out of the gate in the first couple of weeks of the year some slower pull from some of the markets we don t see that that s going to continue foreign exchange matt said that over the past several quarters that started to become a little bit more of a drag but so we think it s a little bit slower start to the quarter and the guidance we gave but what i m trying to contrast there is we ve got a lot of things coming at us for the rest of the year the pricing actions that we know will take hold we re building we have some expansions that came online we see some strong pull from customers in our newest products some of our new commercializations that were new products commercialized late last year that we feel had some good traction moving into the year later this year 300 000 tons of capacity in paper pcc is going to be coming online so there s a number of kind of forward upward momentum that we started last year that will continue to take hold through the year that we think will offset kind of the slower start and continue to drive those earnings as far as margins we think at a normalized rate this company certainly at 15 can i tell you that that s going to happen this year i think as we see costs continue to go up matt mentioned contractually we re going to lag a little bit that we see they might plane over toward the second half of the year and i think we ll catch up i think as we get to kind of average pricing those normalized margins will get back to 15 so do i see the end of our cost inflation no i haven t seen it yet i think that s going to continue through the first half but should that go over i think we ll start with our pricing actions operating cost structure we ll get back to that kind of normalized rate of 15 daniel j moore cjs securities analyst very helpful the port hudson with the impact of the closure can you give us a sense for both q1 and full year 19 either tons and or revenue on a year on year basis douglas t dietrich chief executive officer sure i think last year that facility over the past couple of years has probably bounced between 70 000 tons 80 000 tons of pcc what we know now is that that s going to start to ramp down this quarter i think probably late february march that will impact the quarter as matt mentioned we do though one of the things that s interesting about this is with operating rates this closure came with operating rates in north america in the low 90s around 90 typically we see a closure like that as you ve seen in the past you d see something when the operating rates dip below around 80 so this one is a little different and what we are feeling right now is some pull from customers pcc pull from other customers and that gives us an indication that this paper is probably going to shift around we re not exactly sure of that yet we don t have any indication of exactly where but we re getting some customer higher customer pull from pcc in other facilities which leads us to believe that probably some of this will be absorbed elsewhere and most likely where we have some facilities i can t give you the full impact on the year but that s the range it was in terms of total tons for last year daniel j moore cjs securities analyst very helpful understood and then maybe one more and i ll turn jump back to queue in terms of just looking back to the quarter basic materials are we through now with the tough comps as far as chromite is concerned do we have any revenue in q1 q2 of 2018 and besides chromite was there anything else that sort of contributed to the decline in q4 maybe a little sharper than what we ve experienced over the last few quarters matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury and chief financial officer dan you characterized it the right way we are done with bulk chromite impacting us on the revenue and on the operating income line within basic minerals so you won t see that going forward in the quarter it did have a little bit of a drag as i spoke to but on a go forward basis fully out daniel j moore cjs securities analyst perfect understood thanks for the color matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury and chief financial officer beyond bulk sorry i just remembered you asked anything else inaudible place in basic minerals beyond bulk chromite what you have in the other parts of performance materials you do have some drilling fluids that go into the permian basin for the energy markets and you are starting to see with a little bit of a drilling slowdown and some of the rig counts coming down onshore that some of our business may be slowing a bit related to drilling muds in the energy sector daniel j moore cjs securities analyst got it okay thank you again operator and moving on we ll go to silke kueck with jpmorgan silke kueck jpmorgan analyst hi good morning how are you douglas t dietrich chief executive officer hi silke silke kueck jpmorgan analyst i was wondering whether you can identify what the magnitude of price increase was this quarter and how much freight pass through contributed to sales and also what the magnitude of like the sivomatic acquisition was on sales this quarter matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury and chief financial officer when you step through the bridge on the 4 increase you did have that fx that went against us about a 1 pure price pass through related to freight and lime was about 1 percentage point and then you had other pricing that we were driving which was about another 2 percentage points the remainder of that is really the net from lower bulk chromite sales and the addition of sivomatic in the quarter silke kueck jpmorgan analyst okay douglas t dietrich chief executive officer so total sivomatic sales for the year included in our results is about 62 million it s only nine months eight months it was so on an annualized rate it s about 4 higher than what we had described when we purchased the company back in april so that gives you a rate that s why we re saying sivomatic is really performing well for us it s still growing sales and we ve seen strong performance out of it for the eight months that it has been the part of the company silke kueck jpmorgan analyst secondly what s your total pcc production capacity how many tons did you make in 2018 douglas t dietrich chief executive officer capacity or tons matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury and chief financial officer yeah douglas t dietrich chief executive officer yes we re selling around 300 million tons i think in total for the year of capacity we generally run pretty high end in that capacity we re probably 85 90 is typical we make sure that we have enough room in there for high filler technologies when we deploy them we have enough room for customer growth and expansions and also some of that is just an efficient capital deployment so when we build the facility we have half of a carbonator you are putting it in so we run about 85 90 total of capacity i can t give you exact capacity number but that s around it silke kueck jpmorgan analyst okay helpful and lastly yet again the sg a cost you managed very well given all the headwinds and given the acquisition do you think you have the right headcount or do you think you may need more people to grow the business as you expand the inaudible offshore with respect to foundry for metalcasting in china and india and other opportunities douglas t dietrich chief executive officer yeah the question you re asking do we have the right headcount i think we ve not held back on headcount required to ensure that we re efficiently growing sales producing our products innovating et cetera that said we re always looking for opportunities and i don t want to call it just in heads just in discretionary expenses we re always looking for ways to leverage our platform that we have and the company through shared services and our resource units we want to make sure that sales deployment as we grow that we are not we don t feel we need to incrementally grow that overhead fixed cost base we put in a system to be able to leverage it and that s what we look to do how that ends up in number of heads no we re always looking at opportunities and making sure that they have the right horsepower and people power to make sure we secure it so i can t really tell you whether we have the right or not but we re in the context we are open to making sure it s the right headcount for what we need to do and execute our strategy silke kueck jpmorgan analyst and a last question for matt if i may will you plan to continue your share repurchase program in 2019 to set ph a goal what you want to accomplish in terms of what you re going to return to shareholders and do you have a free cash flow target in mind for 2019 matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury and chief financial officer yeah silke so if you recall in 2018 free cash flow ended up being 128 million but i m going to go ahead and add back the discretionary pension contributions in my view so that gave us about 143 million in overall free cash flow with that i think we detailed for you look we acquired sivomatic we paid down 80 million in debt we returned about 29 million in shareholder value that included 22 million of share purchases those were done on an opportunistic basis and we ll very much keep the opportunistic stance going forward looking to 2019 we re targeting a higher level of free cash flow generation in that 150 million range and we ll continue to manage that with a very sound balanced approach making sure that our balance sheet approaches our target level of 2 times net leverage against ebitda as well as funding strong investments within the company organically looking for inorganic opportunities and making opportunistic share repurchases and returns to shareholders douglas t dietrich chief executive officer yes i think just to add to that we ve always taken the approach that says internal mti investments in growth are probably the number one focus of the company so steering our cash to organic opportunities around the world that makes sense high return and also to maintaining our facilities we balance then keeping our balance sheet in the right spot and as we see acquisition opportunities kind of move up and move down come forward or wane we look to opportunistically steer that capital as inaudible toward shareholders and share repurchases are the mechanisms we use so we re going to continue with that approach we have what we see is we meet regularly to talk about acquisition opportunities i can t give you anything where we are in those but it s healthy pipeline of things that we continue to look at and as they move forward and they make sense for the company similar to type of acquisition like sivomatic we think that s a strategically that s where we see value to deploy cash outside of that we can move it back to shareholders through share repurchases hope that helps you to frame it up silke kueck jpmorgan analyst yeah thanks very much for your thoughts on that operator and next we ll go to steve schwartz with first analysis steven k schwartz first analysis securities analyst good morning everyone douglas t dietrich chief executive officer hi steve steven k schwartz first analysis securities analyst first question just with respect to freight costs i want to make sure i understand clearly when you talk about you mentioned in the prepared remarks higher rail but i m also wondering if the expansion in the growth you are seeing in asia isn t also a part of higher freight costs or is that considered a completely different element within the discussion douglas t dietrich chief executive officer no it s part of it steve i think the majority of our higher freight costs we ve seen here in north america partially europe we have seen a real tightness in being able to get trucks and rail freight increases just general across the board and even specific types of trucks we do use flatbed trucks here in the north american and those of been particularly tight in 2018 in china freight costs were a piece of it a little bit different kind of influence there and that was a little bit of tightening of regulations in terms of weights on roads and so as we saw those regulations come through and lower loading levels of trucks that required more trucks and that more expense and that had to be purchased pushed through on a per ton basis so that s same truck fewer tons to the customer and so it did increase our cost there albeit a little bit smaller than what we saw in north america but yes we had to manage through that as well steven k schwartz first analysis securities analyst okay put it for the most part those costs are regional so in other words it s not you re not talking about higher freight costs because the growth in the asian business and pursuing that business is causing you to have to shift things farther at higher rates there s nothing like that in this conversation correct douglas t dietrich chief executive officer correct we re largely localized meaning we supply customers produce source produce and supply customers largely within the same region so we do shift bentonite around the world we ship other projects around the world but we highlighted on a call or two ago that those numbers are relatively small less than 5 of kind of our sales the majority is localized in region steven k schwartz first analysis securities analyst okay got it and my second question just with respect to your gross growth in the paper pcc business talk about the additional 300 000 tons coming on just wondering from a gross growth standpoint how much is are programs like fulfill and newyield unusual adding to your growth as compared to the new facilities douglas t dietrich chief executive officer got you let me kick it off frame it and then i ll let d j talk a little bit more specifically about some of these technologies and the filler contracts that we re building our satellites are billing filler tons obviously hitting revenue that s the volume the revenue associated with those tons is different around the world you ll see a lower per ton revenue sometimes in asia regions than you will in north america and europe and that s just because the input costs tend to be a little bit lower so lime cost in particular so on a revenue basis we sometimes like to talk in tons because that ton generates the same ebitda around the world newyield is a kind of per ton revenue fulfill we ve always mentioned before it s priced a little bit differently it s more technology and technology fees so that it s not necessarily revenue it kind of drops right to the bottom line so fulfill doesn t move the needle on revenue it does move the needle in operating income but i m going to let d j talk to you about a little bit about what we re building and some of what s happening with newyield in asia and other parts d j monagle group president specialty minerals and refractories thanks for the question steve couple of things so regarding the details on the 300 000 we ve got the start up in china with the chenming paper company that ll be coming on line in the second half coming toward in the second quarter so first half we ll be ramping up the facility in indonesia those two make up and they are standard pcc they make up the 300 000 tons fulfill will be offered in both those locations but probably not part of the ramp up we usually get things stabilized before the next level of technology goes in one of the other things that we had mentioned or alluded to during the third quarter call was discussions with expansions with folks and so we ve also been able to get agreement on somewhere between 25 000 and 50 000 tons that we ll be putting in india as expansions and that s just part of us applying the latest technology and helping our customers grow in their use of pcc so those will be coming on in the second half as well with regard to the other technologies like newyield and doug had also mentioned envirofil in the past both of those right now just have are being deployed one location each but i will tell you as i look at the pipeline that s going we ve got about a dozen or so satellites in the pipeline a couple of them are in envirofil a couple of them are newyield and the majority are still standard pcc majority of that being in asia but we are seeing increased interest in these new technologies in south america primarily brazil and getting some pull in europe as well so that s kind of how the pipeline is looking right now did that help steven k schwartz first analysis securities analyst yeah that s very helpful just to keep all of these different growth elements in perspective with each other so i appreciate that douglas t dietrich chief executive officer steve i will add to that a little bit d j mentioned certainly we see that opportunity to grow the base filler level but we are seeing a lot more kind of interest in and it s what s feeding ph our new product development pipeline in more environmental sustainable recycling solutions d j mentioned envirofil that is a recycling solution newyield is a recycling solutions we ve got other in our environmental products business we talk a lot about environmental solutions like fluoro sorb that s helping with waste water cleanup we ve got some low emission demand for low emission greensand bond products so as with the casting process the emissions are reduced we see some of that pull from customers so i d tell you a lot of the 35 products and a lot of what s in the pipeline is geared toward helping those customers with these type of solutions and certainly leveraging our position on that paper mill we re there every day 24 7 and helping them expand where they have issues they are facing issues water recycling and reducing fiber consumption with higher pcc so i just gave you a flavor that s not just in pcc it s kind of across the company where we re innovating in this way steven k schwartz first analysis securities analyst got it and i appreciate that thank you operator and moving on we ll move to rosemarie morbelli with g research rosemarie j morbelli gabelli company analyst good morning every one douglas t dietrich chief executive officer hi rosemarie rosemarie j morbelli gabelli company analyst i was wondering if you could talk about the revenues for the quarter it was below my expectations and i am just wondering how it stood against your own internal projections whether you were positively surprised in some areas and negatively in others matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury and chief financial officer rosemarie as we went through the quarter we generated 5 growth adjusting for foreign exchange it was very much consistent with i think how we were trying to look at the opportunities that laid against us and also consistent with what we were thinking about in terms of profitable growth over the course of the quarter on a year over year basis and also trend line where we were for most of the year in terms of overall growth and i think it lays the groundwork and doug will want to probably provide a little more detail again around the actions and activities we were taking in 2018 capturing some of those this year laying the ground work for continued top line growth in 2019 as we look forward douglas t dietrich chief executive officer hi rosemarie i think i will add to that i don t think we were i think you were saying are we surprised by it and is this something is this a trend that s going to continue what we re looking at right now i think at the end of the year sometimes it s a and matt mentioned 5 and that s a little bit below our kind of full year average of 8 but at the end of the year sometimes what happens is especially in these markets you do see some orders shift around and not exactly sure when that s going to happen i think it happened a little bit in pcc in china we had one individual customer kind of slow down in the last two weeks of the year but i will tell you that they re pulling strong as they get into the beginning of the year that tells me there is a little bit of de stocking going on i think in the construction sometimes in automotive builds we did see a slowdown in metalcasting in china i think that contributed to some of it but again i think if you want to go into the full year and we re seeing a little bit of that persistent here in january but we think going into the full year with what we have in terms of big projects that we put in place started last year that will be coming online the pricing actions the new volume the new products and certainly with the pcc that will be coming on latter half we think that that growth trend continues that said we are seeing some softening markets do i think that 8 again is possible i m not sure right now we think we can continue with our kind of mid single digits growth throughout the year might be a little bit lower than last year given where we are in china and with some of the softest we re seeing in europe but right now we re pretty confident we can continue our growth trend rosemarie j morbelli gabelli company analyst that is very helpful thank you and then looking at the metalcasting yes auto has slowed down in china but on the other hand you are working on substitution and gaining share versus the two parts greensand or whatever it is called i was wondering if you could talk about the success in substitution and whether you could grow faster than the overall market in that particular category douglas t dietrich chief executive officer yeah let me start and i will let jon hastings take it through kind of the specifics we mentioned that yes we think we see continued growth in china we probably averaged 12 to 15 type of growth over the past three years given the base demand it will probably be a little bit lower china is still growing it s just albeit slower in some of our casting products and it s not just all automotive but our penetration strategy has been a success and will continue to be this year offsetting some of that slower base volume growth jon do you want to how we do that and how we put resources to it jonathan j hastings group president performance materials sure rosemarie i ll echo a lot of the comments that doug just made overall the casting industry you can look at it in a couple of different ways automotive certainly has been impacted by changes in the tax policy and the lending practices but the remainder industrial and heavy equipment seems to be a little bit more robust you asked about our blended product strategy that does continue to work what we re seeing is consolidations in the foundry industry we are also seeing new investments in highly automated casting lines that are producing castings that are equivalent to the quality that we see in north america in order to do that those customers require high quality high consistent products that we offer to our customers as you know we tailor our products specifically to the needs of each foundry so we continue to innovate with them and those products continue to be in fairly high demand so as we get into 2019 although we don t expect a double digit growth we do continue to see the mid single digit growth as we continue to penetrate with the blending strategy douglas t dietrich chief executive officer and those blending products i ll just add jon mentioned but from the base clay to the kind of engineered solution that s a different profit profile as well and so though sales may be a little bit lower than last year or lower than last year i do see that that will help our margin expansion that s one of the elements that continues to drive margins higher rosemarie j morbelli gabelli company analyst thank you and if i may ask one last question before getting back on queue i was wondering if you could talk about the growth of the pet business excluding sivomatic douglas t dietrich chief executive officer sure jon do you want to take that one as well jonathan j hastings group president performance materials yeah so certainly you know the sivomatic story but in north america we continue to grow as well what we have found is that now that we have a premium position in both europe and north america we ve got a lot of customers that are asking to expand business with us the reason for that is multiple fold some of it is related to innovation we continue to deploy new products like lightweight litters but now we re expanding into other fragrance products as well so while we continue to work pricing to offset costs our customers are looking at us as a premier supplier in pet care and we continue to have growth in north america rosemarie j morbelli gabelli company analyst so i know you that are selling the pet care both under private labels and under your own name and i should know that but what is the mti name it is sold under jonathan j hastings group president performance materials premium choice there s a wide variety premium choices is one but again you can find those in many different ways we can come back to you with a full list of what we do douglas t dietrich chief executive officer yeah the mti brand is called premium choice but there is because we re private label you ll see kind of our bentonite and packaging throughout a number of stores walmart you ll also see it through tractor supply and petco et cetera so there are a number of outlets where you ll see private label brands there s a good chance that we re probably the one supplying that bentonite and or packaging it but ours is premium choice i hope you if you have a cat i hope you pick up that one rosemarie j morbelli gabelli company analyst thank you and no i no longer have a cat matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury and chief financial officer rosemarie also we should mention that we continue to grow that pet care business in asia in asia outside of sivomatic but asia especially in china but also other countries we continue to penetrate small base right now but same value proposition continues to play over in asia as well rosemarie j morbelli gabelli company analyst okay thank you douglas t dietrich chief executive officer thanks rosemarie operator at this time i would like to turn the call back to ms buckwalter for any closing remarks cindi buckwalter vice president investor relations and

the current cycle of economic expansion has reached 74 months and is now tentatively the longest in japan s postwar history according to the government s monthly economic report for january since the boom cycle corresponds to the second administration of prime minister shinzo abe who returned to the government s helm in december 2012 administration officials are touting the benefits of the extended boom such as an improved job market and corporate earnings as the fruits of the prime minister s trademark abenomics policy and indeed they may be but the generally modest growth over this period also reflects what has not been achieved under abenomics the nation s workforce has increased by 3 75 million during this boom cycle close to the number of jobs created during the asset inflated bubble boom from the late 1980s to the early 1990s with brisk demand backed by strong corporate profits combined with the intensifying manpower shortage in the rapidly graying population the labor market is now the tightest it has been since the mid 1970s there is an average of more than 1 6 job openings for each job seeker listed companies have been posting record profits for several years and the nikkei average on the tokyo stock exchange has more than doubled with the government taking steps to promote inbound tourism as a key growth sector the number of foreign tourists has more than tripled to top 30 million last year on the other hand economic growth has been much more moderate than in past boom cycles average annual gdp growth has come to a mere 1 2 percent lower than the 1 6 percent during the previous longest boom from 2002 to 2008 and a far cry from the 5 3 percent during the bubble or the robust 11 5 percent in the izanagi boom from 1965 to 1970 when strong demand for consumer durables backed by people s rapidly rising income shored up the economy despite the robust corporate earnings and the tight labor market growth in inflation adjusted net wages has stagnated as a result consumer spending grew only 0 4 percent a year on average meanwhile the 2 percent annual inflation target set by the boj and the government in 2013 as a benchmark for busting deflation remains nowhere in sight though the nation is now certainly out of the deflationary spiral of continuous price declines that stifled economic activity
ndongo samba sylla says that this masterfully written synthesis reveals the pitfalls that the dgt has set for african countries at the beginning was the colonial pact the colonies were integrated in monetary and commercial terms with the metropolis which controlled their financial flows and foreign trade they were forbidden to industrialise th eir role was to provide raw materials at preferential conditions to the metropolis and to serve as outlets for its productions the united states of america was founded following a war of independence to put an end to the english colonial pact imitating the british industrial strategy they managed through unprecedented protectionism to industrialise and develop france germany and japan used the same protectionist strategies and became rich industrial nations the former european colonies which had become acp african caribbean and pacific countries which could not afford to escape the forced liberalism of their metropolis remained poor and non industrialised after african independences the european project was to reorganise the former colonial empires on a more competitive basis between the different european countries instead of the british french portuguese etc juxtaposed private domains there would be just a pan european private domain composed of countries formerly under the yoke of european power this desire to establish a concerted colonial pact at european level gave rise to the yaoundé and lomé conventions under which european countries granted the acp countries so called non reciprocal trade preferences the possibility of exporting without customs duties and without quotas or at least on preferential terms however the logic of the pan european private domain has been challenged by the third countries it has harmed namely before the world trade organisation wto since the cotonou agreement 2000 2020 which succeeded the lomé conventions the european union eu anxious to conquer new markets has been represented in the negotiations by the european commission s dg trade dgt and no longer by dg development and cooperation it requires that trade agreements with acp countries be based on reciprocity economic partnership agreements epas henceforth the latter must liberalise their foreign trade reduce or even eliminate tariffs on their imports no longer introduce new export taxes and reduce the level of existing export taxes etc in order to benefit from the eu s trade preferences beyond that these epas provide for the extension of the most favoured nation mfn clause to eu countries as well as negotiations to liberalise areas that developing countries have refused to negotiate at the wto services intellectual property public procurement competition investment etc for the african continent the consequences of the implementation of such asymmetric agreements would probably be an uncompensated drop in states tax revenues a trade diversion to the eu the destruction of agricultural sectors and the annihilation of any industrialisation prospects the result would be a trend towards chronic balance of payments imbalances and thus to install african countries in a vicious external debt dynamic yet the eu recently emulated by the african union au with its rash plan for a continental free trade area afcfta is actively propagating the erroneous idea that trade liberalisation contributes to the economic development of the african continent since the early 2000s the dgt has consistently sought to have acp countries sign and ratify epas while the mobilisation of social movements has delayed the eu project in africa the danger of economic hanging agreements or even economic impoverishment agreements to use the language of epa detractors is still present this is what jacques berthelot explains in a recent book entitled you said free trade the economic partnership agreement between the european union and west africa l harmattan 2018 title translated from french through this masterfully written synthesis the french agro economist reveals the pitfalls that the dgt has set for african countries while tracking omissions errors and misrepresentations in the analyses on behalf of this entity it carefully examines the costs and economic and social consequences of implementing epas and concludes with useful recommendations the epa or the law of the strongest to start the epa negotiations the dgt argued that the discriminatory nature of the non reciprocal trade preferences granted to acp countries was incompatible with wto rules this argument as jacques berthelot shows is a biased interpretation of wto rules that prohibit discrimination when it is based on geographical logic but allow it when it is granted according to the level of development in west africa including mauritania 12 out of 16 countries belong to the ldcs least developed countries under the everything but arms eba decision the latter are supposed to be able to export to the eu everything but arms without customs duties or quotas as cape verde has a special status only nigeria côte d ivoire and ghana should in principle be covered by the epas however by forcing all west african countries to sign and ratify a regional epa that would involve the liberalisation of nearly 80 of tariff lines the eu jacques berthelot emphasises makes selective use of eba and goes against wto rules in order to compensate for the foreseeable loss of customs revenue incurred by west african countries the eu has promised to disburse 6 5 billion every five years until 2035 in reality there are no additional funds specific to epas but a restructuration of existing funds including those granted under the european development fund edf however explains jacques berthelot the cotonou agreement expires in 2020 and it is not known if it will be renewed and with what budget and in any case not until 2035 since the eu budget is only programmed until 2020 not to mention that the united kingdom uk which is leaving the eu contributes 14 5 to the 11th edf which is not an eu budget but is financed by the member states to promote its free trade agenda the dgc has ignored the different views of some eu member states it also repudiated three impact studies it had commissioned itself because their results were an obstacle to its propaganda it underestimated the costs of the west african epa particularly in terms of lost tax revenues just as it has deliberately exaggerated its benefits for african countries while the trade preferences to the benefit of the latter are increasingly being eroded as a result of the many free trade agreements signed by the eu with third countries nothing would prevent the eu from exporting its subsidised agricultural products to west africa in the future the epa a trojan horse for african integration another important lesson from jacques berthelot s book is the risk of commercial disintegration of ecowas which has a common external tariff in place since 2015 the latter can only be viable if all the countries in this bloc have the same position vis à vis the epa and also the afcfta while nigeria refuses to sign the epa which is not of interest to it côte d ivoire and ghana had signed interim epas since the end of 2007 with tariff dismantling expected from september 2018 and december 2021 respectively these commitments to the eu are incompatible with those to ecowas if the situation does not change the other ecowas countries will have to set up customs barriers against them in this context the signing of the afcfta agreement by thirteen west african countries including côte d ivoire and ghana far from promoting african trade integration is likely to make it implode the afcfta agreement provides for a 90 liberalisation of tariff lines however as the interim epas of côte d ivoire and ghana provide for the activation of the most favoured nation clause this implies in principle that the eu should also benefit in turn from the same tariff advantages ghana and côte d ivoire under pressure from subsidiaries of european groups have so far decided to go it alone yet given the importance of the ecowas market for their intra african exports they would be the main losers in the event of west african trade disintegration needless to say with a 90 liberalisation of imports from the eu tax revenue losses will in their case be greater than expected the eu is irresponsible and short sighted by persisting in its free trade fundamentalism the eu is showing according to jacques berthelot irresponsibility and short sightedness faced with the significant population growth of africa a continent that is also facing the challenges of climate change and food sovereignty epas are undoubtedly a recipe for disaster on the one hand by depriving states of tax revenues and exposing fragile agricultural and industrial sectors to competition from subsidised european products they can only aggravate social poverty in west africa according to jacques berthelot an increase in illegal migrants and violent armed movements is to be expected in this context the main function of eu development aid will be to clean up in vain the damage that its own policies have helped to create on the other hand if the eu were farsighted it would have realised that it has no long term interest in the impoverishment of the african continent the population of west africa will exceed the eu s aging population in 2030 this demographic dynamism if accompanied by policies to raise the income level of workers suggests future markets for the eu s exports of high value added goods and services unfortunately epas are the most obvious symbol of the contradictory stance of the eu which in practice continues to deploy neo colonial policies of the impoverishment of the african continent while rhetorically professing its commitment to work for its prosperity what should be done once the diagnosis has been made what should be done jacques berthelot recommends four savvy measures that require political boldness including breaking with the neoliberal ideology that informs integration initiatives in africa first the signatures of these epas extorted by the fraudulent manoeuvres of the european commission should be rendered null and void secondly african countries must postpone the afcfta project a premature and suicidal initiative as it stands in order to focus initially on integration within the framework of the regional economic communities recs third recs must work to become members of the wto in order to have a voice and better defend their interests finally farmers should be guaranteed remunerative and stable prices instead of having them delivered foot and fist tied to the whims of international markets at a time when the ratification of the afcfta agreement and the negotiations on the post cotonou period are underway jacques berthelot s book comes in handy it is viatic for all those who are concerned about trade integration for the economic development of africa did you say free trade the economic partnership agreement european union west africa by jacques

budget reinvents meaning of interim with tax and farm sops tax break for middle class taxpayers handout for small and marginal farmers and repackaged pension scheme for workers jayanta roy chowdhury the narendra modi government on friday broke with over 70 years of parliamentary convention and used an interim budget to sharpen its sickles in an attempt to harvest votes in the general election the budget offered a tax break to 30 million middle class taxpayers cobbled a rs 75 000 crore cash handout for 120 million small and marginal farmers and announced a repackaged pension scheme for unorganised workers advertisement individuals with a taxable income up to rs 5 lakh a year will no longer have to pay taxes the additional tax deductions mean that salaried taxpayers with an income up to rs 9 75 lakh may tumble out of the tax net stand in finance minister piyush goyal offered a direct cash support of rs 6 000 a year to be paid in three instalments to small farmers with a landholding of up to 2 hectares in an effort to quell the growing farmer unrest over depressed rural incomes the government will fork out rs 20 000 crore this financial year for the programme called pradhan mantri kisan samman nidhi the cost in a full year will be rs 75 000 crore goyal announced a monthly pension of rs 3 000 for unorganised workers aged above 60 that will cover migrant labour and household help under the contributory pension scheme workers with a monthly income of less than rs 15 000 will have to contribute a small amount till they turn 60 the government has set aside rs 500 crore for the scheme this year the salaried class has got some relief with the increase in the standard deduction the threshold for tax deduction at source on the interest from fixed deposits with banks and post office deposits has been raised from rs 10 000 to rs 40 000 people with second homes will no longer have to pay tax on a notional rental income the benefit of the rollover of capital gains under section 54 of the income tax act will be increased from investment in one residential house to two residential houses for a taxpayer having capital gains up to rs 2 crore the benefit can be availed only once in a lifetime no previous administration has ever loaded an interim budget with tax and cash lollies exercising the restraint in deference to a convention and preferring instead to articulate intentions and outline the programmes they would implement if voted back into office the modi government thumbed its nose at tradition and decided to put out a document that could turn a post election budget into a tiresome prosaic ritual if it storms back to power minister arun jaitley who gave up the finance portfolio temporarily for treatment in new york said precedents existed although some indirect taxes had been changed in earlier instances few could recall revisions in direct taxes such as the income tax in interim budgets jaitley rejected the artificial distinction between direct and indirect taxes mere crumbs the cash handout to farmers drew sharp criticism from opponents of the bjp and farmers who felt crumbs were being thrown their way congress president rahul gandhi tweeted five years of your incompetence and arrogance has destroyed the lives of our farmers giving them rs 17 a day is an insult to everything they stand and work for the historic rs 6 000 a year for a family of five translates into rs 3 30 per day this is even lower than mnrega or old age pension scheme tweeted yogendra yadav yadav added these schemes are merely to buy votes these last minute tricks don t work this is a jumla airy fairy promise we lose rs 25 000 per hectare every rabi or kharif season because market prices are lower than the government announced support prices and they say they will compensate us by doling out rs 2 000 said raju shetti mp and leader of the swabhimani shetkari sanghatna a farmers movement in western india others pointed out that telangana was paying rs 8 000 a year to all farmers while odisha had a scheme that offered rs 10 000 to small farmers and rs 5 000 to sharecroppers the government has gone beyond what an interim budget should be this is a typical election budget high on populist expenditure and deficit funding and low on how to generate revenues to fund the new schemes being taken up or compensate for the taxes foregone said m govinda rao former member of the prime minister s economic advisory council read also will the budget actually benefit farmers fiscal slippage the big giveaways in the interim budget will raise the fiscal deficit in the financial year ending march 31 to 3 4 per cent slightly higher than the targeted 3 3 per cent the deficit next year has also been capped at 3 4 per cent instead of the promised 3 1 per cent which drew an immediate warning from credit rating agency moody s it doesn t bode well for their medium term fiscal consolidation targets said gene fang associate managing director at moody s sovereign risk group we view this continued slippage as credit negative for the sovereign moody s rates india at baa2 with a stable outlook and has not indicated that it intends to consider a change in the rating the budget has proposed a divestment target of rs 90 000 crore for 2019 20 up from 80 000 crore for this year we expect the reserve bank of india to view the budget as inflationary and flag this as an upside risk to inflation said sonal varma chief india economist at nomura holdings in singapore the central bank will review interest rates on february 7 with the inflation rate at a low 2 19 per cent the rbi was widely expected to cut the policy rate but the fiscal slippage could weigh on the decision the questions piyush goyal s logic for tax proposals small taxpayers especially the middle class salary earners pensioners and senior citizens need certainty in their minds at the beginning of the year about their taxes question aren t the interim proposals adding to the uncertainty since changes cannot be ruled out in the general budget after the polls the prime minister and goyal have virtually announced the election results by forecasting prosperity after the polls and promising to look into the possibility of offering more tax relief in the main budget in july but democracies usually wait till the election commission announces the results arun jaitley s logic from new york jaitley suggested it was inconceivable that jobs were not created when the economy clocked high nominal growth in the past five years then defending the tax proposals in the so called interim budget jaitley said precedents had conclusively shown that urgent steps were required in the larger interests of the economy and they could be taken questions if the economy is doing so well why do you need urgent steps couldn t you have waited till the elections were over besides should new india modi iterated the label on friday be cloning the unethical precedents purportedly set by earlier governments the telegraph read also piyush executes re election campaign with rundown of government achievements

president of investor relations joining me on the call today is our chairman and ceo darren woods as we ll discuss on the call today we are very pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter and with our full year results this was a quarter highlighted by continued value generation from our integrated business model additional growth in liquids production and successful high grading of our downstream portfolio more from the motley fool in addition we made significant progress on investments that will generate long term accretive value for our shareholders after i review the quarterly financial and operating performance darren will provide his perspectives on our business reflecting on 2018 and the year ahead following this darren and i will be happy to take your questions our comments this morning will reference the slides available on the investors section of our website i d also like to draw your attention to the cautionary statement on slide 2 and the supplemental information at the end of this presentation which starting this quarter you ll notice includes a listing of significant nonoperational events that impacted quarterly earnings moving to slide 3 i ll now highlight the developments that influenced fourth quarter performance crude oil prices decreased during the quarter with brent down 7 51 and wti down 10 62 conversely gas realizations were up in the fourth quarter supported by strong lng prices and seasonal demand henry hub was also up 0 74 production in the permian increased another 12 relative to the third quarter and was up 93 from the fourth quarter of last year exploration success continued offshore guyana with the pluma discovery our 10th find so far on the stabroek block the resource estimate in guyana is now greater than 5 billion oil equivalent barrels in mozambique we secured offtake agreements for the rovuma lng project as we progress toward a final investment decision which remains on track industry refining margins weakened across the globe with lower seasonal gasoline demand and higher inventories this was partly offset by stronger distillate margin in north america we successfully leveraged our logistics capacity to capture significant value by moving advantaged crudes from the permian and western canada to our manufacturing facilities we also started up on the third of our six key refinery projects the advanced hydrocracker at our rotterdam refinery this advantaged investment increases our capacity to produce higher value products including ultra low sulfur fuels and group ii premium lubricant base stocks we continue to high grade our downstream portfolio with the divestment of our augusta refinery and related terminals in italy and our germany retail assets while long term fundamentals remain strong in the chemical business margins weakened during the quarter the supply length from recent capacity additions pressured realizations we safely completed a turnaround at our singapore facility and progressed integration of our jurong acquisition with our nearby petrochemical complex i ll now go through a more detailed review of fourth quarter results starting first with the upstream on slide 4 fourth quarter upstream earnings were 3 3 billion a 900 million decrease relative to the third quarter of 2018 the absence of favorable u s tax reform impacts and current quarter asset impairments negatively impacted earnings by 670 million crude realizations decreased by 18 during the quarter with a decline in industry markers and wider north american differentials the estimated unfavorable impact of those wider differentials on upstream earnings relative to the third quarter was 350 million however integration with logistics and manufacturing resulted in more than that value being realized in the downstream having takeaway capacity that exceeds our upstream production allowed us to realize a corresponding estimated benefit again relative to the third quarter of approximately 600 million in the downstream gas realizations increased 18 in the fourth quarter on stronger lng pricing and seasonal gas demand an increase in production driven by continued volume growth in the permian and seasonal gas demand in europe contributed 660 million to fourth quarter earnings favorable foreign exchange effects and other items each positively impacted earnings by 100 million moving to slide 5 and a comparison of fourth quarter upstream production to the third quarter of this year production in the fourth quarter was 4 million oil equivalent barrels per day an increase of more than 200 000 oil equivalent barrels per day if you exclude the impact of entitlements and divestments volumes were up 5 as a result of seasonal gas demand and continued liquids growth the absence of impacts from the downtime event that occurred earlier this year at syncrude and volume growth in the permian resulted in a 3 increase in liquids production in the fourth quarter natural gas production was up 11 primarily due to seasonal gas demand in the netherlands moving to slide 6 and a comparison of fourth quarter upstream earnings with the fourth quarter of 2017 if you exclude the effects of u s tax reform and impairments earnings increased 1 2 billion higher prices increased earnings by 660 million driven by a 2 increase in natural gas realizations partly offset by a decline in crude realizations and again that resulted primarily from wider north american differentials we estimate the unfavorable impact of those wider differentials on the upstream again relative to the fourth quarter of last year to be approximately 750 million the estimated corresponding margin benefit that we captured in the downstream from our fully integrated value chain was 1 2 billion when compared to the fourth quarter of last year liquids growth driven by permian and hebron increased earnings by 180 million favorable foreign exchange effects contributed approximately 80 million while all other impacts increased earnings by 270 million those other items included favorable non u s tax impacts and the absence of unfavorable onetime items from last year and that was partly offset by some higher operating and exploration expenses slide 7 provides a comparison of fourth quarter volumes relative to the same period as last year liquids production increased 7 excluding the impact from entitlements and divestments that growth included a 93 increase in permian production and an additional volume from hebron now while not shown on the page i also wanted to highlight that full year production was 3 8 million barrels per day and if you exclude the effect of entitlement and divestments of approximately 130 000 oil equivalent barrels per day volumes finished the year essentially in line with 2017 levels and the guidance we provided at the march 2018 investor day now moving to slide 8 i ll review downstream fourth quarter financial and operating results starting first with a comparison to the third quarter of this year downstream earnings of 2 7 billion increased by 1 billion with the capture of significant value from our north american integrated operations and portfolio high grading downstream refining margins weakened during the quarter however this was more than offset by the value we captured from north american crude differentials with our integrated logistics network this allowed us to connect barrels to our manufacturing facilities and contributed to a favorable margin impact in the downstream of approximately 500 million we had higher scheduled maintenance in the quarter which decreased earnings by 460 million proceeds from the divestment of germany retail assets and the augusta refinery and fuels terminals contributed 870 million to earnings improvements in refining yield and sales mix supported by the start ups of the beaumont hydrofiner and the antwerp coker partly offset by some related expenses contributed 70 million to earnings all other items included favorable inventory impacts and tax items turning now to slide 9 and a review of current quarter downstream earnings relative to the fourth quarter of last year again if you exclude the effects of u s tax reform and impairments downstream earnings were up almost 1 8 billion margins had a 550 million positive impact on earnings with significant value from wider crude differentials in north america and in fact we estimated a benefit across the integrated downstream value chain of approximately 1 2 billion relative to the same quarter as last year this was partly offset by a lower lubricants margins and lower refining margins in some regions significant reliability improvement was partly offset by higher scheduled maintenance resulting a resulting in a positive contribution of 130 million the divestment of the germany retail assets and the augusta refinery and fuels terminals which was partly offset by the absence of a norway retail divestment that occurred in 2017 contributed 680 million in the fourth quarter improvements in refining yield and sales mix with the start up of new refinery investments and a growing retail network in markets like mexico partly offset by some related expenses resulted in a positive contribution of 200 million all other items reflect favorable inventory impacts in tax turning now to slide 10 and a review of current quarter chemical earnings relative to the third quarter of this year fourth quarter chemical earnings were 737 million lower margins negatively impacted earnings by 110 million as polyolefins margins declined with lengthening supply from new industry capacity additions we had a onetime non u s tax impact that resulted in a positive contribution of 210 million other items included higher expenses from new assets and growth initiatives turning now to slide 11 and a review of current quarter chemical earnings relative to the fourth quarter of last year including the effects of u s tax reform and impairments chemical earnings decreased 190 million from the prior year quarter lower margins resulted in a 350 million decrease again driven by lengthening polyolefins supply with new industry capacity an increase in polyethylene sales from new assets had a positive contribution to earnings of 100 million scheduled turnaround activities in singapore which we completed in the fourth quarter had a negative impact of 90 million the same onetime non u s tax impact resulted in a positive contribution of 210 million while all other items included higher expenses from new assets and growth slide 12 provides a review of sources and uses of cash fourth quarter earnings adjusted for depreciation expense changes in working capital and asset sales gains yielded 8 6 billion in cash flow from operating activities and it s important to know that depreciation in the quarter was higher than the normal trend line through the previously mentioned current quarter asset impairments of approximately 700 million on a before tax basis we experienced a 1 3 billion negative working capital impact in the quarter this was driven by an inventory build for planned maintenance in the downstream and some seasonal tax payments mostly in europe other noncash items of approximately 1 billion included adjustments for gains on the fourth quarter divestments in germany and italy as a reminder although both the germany and augusta divestments occurred in the fourth quarter we actually received the cash proceeds from the germany divestment in the third quarter had those proceeds been received this quarter our cash from operations and asset sales would have fully covered divestments and distributions fourth quarter pp e additions were 6 5 billion driven primarily by increased activity in the permian basin we also reduced debt in the quarter by 2 3 billion i ll now move to slide 13 which summarizes full year 2018 financial results 2018 earnings excluding the impacts from the u s tax reform and impairments were 21 billion up 40 from the prior year driven by higher prices liquids growth and the value from north american integration cash flow from operations and asset sales was 40 billion including 4 billion in proceeds from asset sales now that 4 billion in asset sales was slightly above the previous five year average that we have of asset sales of about 3 3 billion 2018 capex was 26 billion 2 billion above the guidance provided at last year s investor day largely driven by incremental acquisitions during the year and notably related to brazilian acreage in the upstream and the indonesian lubricants company that we acquired in the downstream free cash flow after investments was 20 billion more than enough to cover the 14 billion in dividends paid during the year debt ended the year at 38 billion a 4 5 billion decrease compared to the end of 2017 now let me provide a few observations regarding the first quarter before i hand it over to darren upstream volumes should be largely consistent with fourth quarter levels in the downstream we are seeing significantly weaker industry refining margins with lower seasonal gasoline demand and excess production in addition the curtailments in canada coupled with additional logistics capacity coming online in the permian has led to much narrower crude differentials to start the year while these changes will impact results versus the fourth quarter they again demonstrate the advantage of integration as opportunities open and close across the markets along the value chain we are positioned to capture them scheduled maintenance this year will be like what we experienced in 2018 with the level of activity in the first quarter similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter of 2018 chemical margins are expected to remain under pressure as the market continues to work through supply length from recent capacity additions we expect quarterly corporate and financing charges to be somewhere between 700 million and 900 million and finally we do not expect any significant asset sales in the first quarter at this time i would like to hand it over to darren darren woods chairman and chief executive officer thank you neil and good morning everyone it s great to be on the call today let me just start by providing my perspective on the past year i think as you all know and will recall in march of last year we laid out an investment plan to structurally improve the earnings and cash flow potential of our business while improving our returns across a wide range of price environments as i reflect on 2018 i am extremely pleased with the progress we ve made on those plans we not only delivered on our commitments for the year we identified additional upside the price environment in 2018 was unpredictable which once again demonstrated the value of our integrated business model we saw significant swings in commodity prices compounded by the transportation constraints in the permian basin in western canada our upstream integrated logistics and manufacturing position allowed us to avoid the impact of market dislocations and thus capture the full value of our barrels this reflects a deliberate strategy to leverage the scale and breadth of our integrated business model which certainly paid off in 2018 against the backdrop of a fairly volatile margin and price enviroment we met earnings expectations for the year and generated 40 billion in cash flow from operations and asset sales the highest level since 2014 this in turn enabled us to fund our ongoing investment program reduce our debt and consistent with one of our long standing priorities increase the dividend in 2018 we increased our dividend by 6 marking the 36th consecutive year of increases central to our plans for growing value is the advancement of a portfolio of advantaged investments throughout the year we continued to develop and rigorously test our investments to make sure that our company s competitive advantages were translating directly into project advantages giving us some of industry s lowest cost of supply developments over the past year have reaffirmed our belief in the strength of our investment portfolio which is the best we ve seen since the merger of exxon and mobil in fact as we worked through the year we identified significant upside to our plans which brings me to a critical focus area of 2018 on delivering on the project milestones for the plans that we laid out back in march we remain extremely confident in our ability to deliver on our plans and let me give you a brief overview of the advances that we made in 2018 i ll start with the upstream each of the five growth area growth opportunities we outlined back in march saw significant progress over the year in guyana our track record of exploration success continued with five additional discoveries during the year resulting in an updated resource estimate of more than 5 billion oil equivalent barrels with our success we added another drillship to accelerate the pace of exploration and the pace of drilling we now see the potential for at least five fpsos producing more than 750 000 barrels per day by 2025 another key focus for deepwater development is brazil where we have quickly built an industry leading acreage position since the investor day last year we increased our acreage position to 2 3 million net acres in the permian we continue to expand and accelerate activities we believe we have a unique opportunity here to bring the full strength of exxonmobil through the development of unconventional resources to bring scale bring fundamental science and technology bring large scale efficient development and bring an integrated well to market approach it s one of the reasons we moved xto to houston to integrate their work and skills into the broader capabilities of exxonmobil it s why we believe our approach will deliver the lowest cost supply and give us a significant advantage over the rest of industry as we ve optimized our development with further drilling and delineation we see additional upside well beyond the growth trajectory that we shared previously we ll discuss this in more detail in march when we meet at our investor day we continue to make good progress on projects in our lng portfolio tng and mozambique remain on track for a final investment decision we ve also been working very closely with qp our partner in golden pass to advance that investment and look forward to announcing something here in the very near term in the downstream the widening crude differentials in north america are a good reminder for why it s important to keep our growth plans for the permian integrated with our logistics and manufacturing footprint in the gulf coast we ve been very active in securing additional takeaway capacity for our production in the permian as well as putting plans in place to ensure that our logistics capacity grows in tandem with our production and refining expansions to meet growing demand for higher value fuels and lubricants we are progressing six major refining investments all advantaged versus industry over the past year three of those facilities started up namely the beaumont hydrofiner antwerp delayed coker and the rotterdam advanced hydrocracker these projects significantly enhance the earnings and cash flow capacity of our downstream business and position us well for the upcoming imo spec changes next year the remaining three projects are progressing in line with the plans that we shared in march in our chemical business we outlined plans for 13 new facilities to meet growing demand seven have been brought online the remaining six are on schedule we expect these investments to support a 30 growth in sales by 2025 driven by our proprietary technologies that provide advantaged products and applications we made excellent progress toward this objective in 2018 with sales growth of 6 as we said last march all of our investments leverage some combination of our competitive advantages to deliver industry leading returns technology almost always plays a critical role a great example is our advanced hydrocracker project in rotterdam the project uses a first in the world combination of proprietary process and catalyst technology which convert heavy intermediate streams into group ii base stocks a significant upgrade with this investment rotterdam becomes the only worldscale group ii base stock produced in europe and it supplements our group ii production in the u s and asia allowing us to more effectively serve our global customer base we expect this one project alone to double earnings for the rotterdam site making it one of the most competitive refineries in europe as we speak today the hydrocracker is up and running and producing on spec product in line with our expectations let me shift now to 2019 and some key themes for the year ahead starting in the upstream we expect to sanction a number of key projects including the next two phases of guyana liza 2 and as well as two significant lng projects mozambique and golden pass let me just add here too that we advanced the fid of from the middle of 2020 to late 2019 again reflecting the development plans and the progress that we re making beyond the plans we laid out last year later this year we plan to mobilize the fpso for the first development of phase in guyana putting us on track for an early 2020 start up with the advances we ve made and our permian development plans we expect to accelerate the pace of our investments and increase our production profile consistent with this this week we announced a final investment decision for the beaumont refinery expansion which will further add to our integrated permian advantage we also announced the formation of the wink to webster jv to progress the permian long haul pipeline that will give both baytown and beaumont the industry s most efficient transportation link to the permian we brought three important refinery projects on in the back year of last year back end of last year in 2019 our focus will be on fully leveraging their advantages in addition we re going to continue our push into new growth markets like mexico and indonesia ensuring that we capitalize fully on our brands in the chemical business we re on track for a midyear start up of our beaumont polyethylene expansion further strengthening our position in the gulf coast we also plan to fid two projects at baytown that will produce vistamaxx which is a high growth high performance propylene plastomer and alpha olefins used in packaging oils waxes and other specialty chemicals these projects along with the others we ve discussed will allow us to continue to grow sales of high value high performance products as i step back and reflect on the opportunities we have across all three of our business sectors i remain very excited by the potential to generate significant value for our shareholders as you may have seen yesterday we announced the formation of new upstream and project organizations these new organizations will help facilitate the successful delivery of our investment opportunities the upstream is reorganizing into three companies down from seven the upstream oil and gas company will have five distinct global businesses each business will have full accountability for end to end results from resource development to production to marketing over the entire life of the resource from discovery to abandonment the upstream integrated solutions company will provide functional expertise to bring the full advantage of the company s scale our technology and experience to each global business third company upstream business development will oversee the upstream strategy and activities to upgrade the asset portfolio through exploration acquisitions and divestments this will increase the focus on portfolio optimization and ensure that we continue to aggressively pursue all available value added opportunities including divestments we re also combining the project s organizations from the upstream downstream and chemical into one global projects company which will allow us to more effectively leverage the company s proven project capabilities neil hansen vice president of investor relations and secretary we understand the webcast dropped we apologize for that so we re going to turn it back to darren and let him finish and then we ll take q a darren woods chairman and chief executive officer i ll try to pick up where i understand we dropped off which was turning to 2019 perspectives in the chemical business i was saying that we re on track for a midyear start up of our beaumont polyethylene expansion which is going to further strengthen our position in the gulf coast we re also planning to fid two projects at baytown that will produce vistamaxx which is a high growth high performance propylene plastomer and alpha olefins used in packaging oils waxes and some other specialty chemicals these projects along with the others we discussed will allow us to continue to grow sales of high value high performance products as i step back and reflect on the opportunities we have across all three of our business sectors i m very excited by the potential to generate significant value for our shareholders you may have seen yesterday that we announced the formation of new upstream and project organizations these new organizations will help to facilitate the successful delivery of our investment opportunities the upstream is reorganizing to three companies down from seven the upstream oil and gas company will have five distinct global businesses each business will have full accountability for end to end results from resource development to production to marketing over the life of the resource from discovery to abandonment the upstream integrated solutions company will provide functional expertise to bring the full advantage of the company s scale our technology and experience to each global business the third company upstream business development will oversee the upstream strategy and activities to upgrade the asset portfolio through exploration acquisitions and divestments this will increase the focus on portfolio optimization and ensure that we continue to aggressively pursue all available value added opportunities including divestments we re also combining the project organizations from the upstream downstream and chemical into one global projects company which will allow us to more effectively leverage the company s proven project capabilities across our entire investment portfolio now we already implemented many of the concepts behind the new design about a year to 18 months ago the permian development and the chemical cracker in corpus are two great examples of what came from that rewiring the organization will allow us to sustain the new way of working and make it easier to leverage across all of our businesses and opportunities in addition it will improve the upstream integration with our downstream and chemical businesses this is particularly important given the growth and value opportunities we are capturing with the increased upside particularly in the permian and guyana we expect capex to be 30 billion in 2019 an increase of about 2 billion from the guidance we gave in march before i hand it back to neil let me just offer a few closing thoughts we remain fully committed to growing shareholder value that commitment is the driving force behind the growth plans that we ve shared with you we feel good about the progress we made in 2018 and the delivery on our commitments we remain very confident on our ability to execute our forward plans and are very excited about the additional upsides the management team and i are looking forward to reaffirming the plans we laid out last year and sharing additional detail on the upside when we meet next month at our investor day with that let me hand it back to neil neil hansen vice president of investor relations and secretary ok thank you for your comments darren we ll try again on q a so we ll turn it over now for any questions you might have questions and answers operator thank you mr woods and mr hansen we ll take our first question from doug terreson with evercore isi doug terreson evercore isi analyst good morning guys and congratulations on your results and your progress neil hansen vice president of investor relations and secretary thank you doug good morning doug terreson evercore isi analyst so darren while the returns profile of your investment portfolio looks to be pretty strong i think you highlighted that as the super majors refocused on areas of competitive advantage during the past decade or so that you use divestitures as a fairly productive capital management tool and on this point while you guys have had divestitures too your activity levels have been below peers whether including bp which obviously had an event or not and so you talked about this a minute ago i just want to see if you would elaborate on your comments about divestitures as a portfolio management tool or portfolio optimization tool i think is the way you termed it whether there s a philosophical reason why exxonmobil hasn t been as active as some of the peers and whether divestitures might be more prominent for you guys in the future given the restructuring that you highlighted darren woods chairman and chief executive officer sure thanks doug thanks for the question happy to spend some time talking about that i think we made reference to it last march one of the advantages that we have today is as the prices came off in the back end of 2014 and we leaned into the markets and as we ve talked about loaded up our pipeline of investment opportunity with some very attractive projects that has allowed us to reoptimize and look at the total value of portfolio if you go back in time we ve had a pretty regular divestment program investing about 50 billion worth of assets since 2008 what we can now do in the upstream with this additional project and these investment opportunities we have is increase the focus there so i would expect to see more activity in divestments in the upstream side of the portfolio that s going to be driven really by the opportunities that the market brings we ve got i think a pipeline of assets that we think would make sense to market we re actively doing that and we ll see as we go through the year what opportunities kind of come to fruition i would add though doug that this is a value play we re not trying to hit some schedule associated with it we re really trying to make sure that we can realize the maximum value out of the assets that we have in our portfolio as i mentioned the new organization is going to help us do that doug terreson evercore isi analyst no i m sure thanks a lot darren darren woods chairman and chief executive officer thank you doug neil hansen vice president of investor relations and secretary thanks doug operator next we ll go to phil gresh with jpmorgan phil gresh j p morgan analyst hi good morning darren and thanks for being on the call today i guess the first question would be around you talked about some areas where capital spending is moving higher and your permian rig count has certainly accelerated versus what you talked about in march so without getting too far ahead what you want to talk about at the analyst day maybe you could talk about at least how you re thinking about 2019 are you comfortable with the level that you re running at now or do you see further opportunity darren woods chairman and chief executive officer yes hi phil thanks what i will say if you look at 2018 and as neil mentioned the additional capex we spent there was really the acquisition of a couple in a couple areas brazilian acreage and then we had i think a real nice opportunity in indonesia to supplement our lubricants business and so i think ex the acquisitions that weren t built into the plan we were pretty much in line with where we expected to be on capex as i just said going into 2019 we expect to be around 30 billion and that does reflect the progress and the opportunities that we re seeing in guyana the upside that we ve seen there as well as the permian we just talked a little bit about the permian because i think one of the things we re challenging ourselves with and looking at the unconventional resources is what value what unique value can exxonmobil bring to this resource play and so we have spent the year really making sure that we understand the play that we ve got doing some delineation but at the same time leveraging the full capability of exxonmobil to bring scale and scale development along with technology additional technology and research into the permian so i think what you ll hear in march is a good overview around how exxonmobil is uniquely coming into the unconventional resources to make this a low cost long term successful development play phil gresh j p morgan analyst ok and i guess just my second question would be on chemicals that would be if you think about 2018 that was an area i think you expected to see some earnings growth in 18 and it was bit more challenging so maybe you could just talk a little bit more about what you re seeing both from macro factors but whether maybe there are any company specific factors there as well or if it s all just kind of a macro situation darren woods chairman and chief executive officer yes i think in the chemical business and across all of them frankly one of the points we try to make at the analyst meeting is we don t try to take a position on price for margins and where things are going to be we try to make sure that the investments we re making are robust to the cycles that we see in these businesses and are aligned with one our advantages but two the long term potential for these businesses so if i look at chemical the growth that we see in chemical remained and the foundational elements of that business in industry remained very strong we continue to see demand growth above gdp going out into the future saw that in 2018 4 demand growth so very comfortable with what we see as the macro trends from a demand standpoint in chemicals the challenge that we saw in 2018 i think will carry some into 2019 is the amount of supply that s come on if you look at the demand growth and focus on stream crackers for a minute you probably need about three to four world scale steam crackers every year to keep up with demand in 2018 i think six came on so a lot more supply than what the annual growth would be but the industry will grow out of that and we positioned ourselves to make sure that we capture that long term growth we don t get overly focused on the timing of every project and when they re going to show up those things shift around a bit we ve got more projects the industry projects coming on in 2019 that timing will move around and i think we ll see margins move with the timing of that new supply coming on but again i think the current environment is not a concern for us we ve leveraged all those projects we ve put in place have leveraged our advantages and made sure that we re on the low cost of supply so irrespective of where we re at in the cycle we re going to be advantaged versus the rest of the industry phil gresh j p morgan analyst ok thank you operator we ll take our next question from sam margolin with wolfe research sam margolin wolfe research analyst good morning darren woods chairman and chief executive officer good morning sam margolin wolfe research analyst you touched on this a little bit darren in your perspective section and neil quantified it too with the integration benefit of 1 2 billion but i was hoping to ask you to elaborate a little bit in the context of the pipeline and the refinery fids in the u s that were announced this week you ve got a lot of crude coming on stream in other places and so is the fact that there s a lot of u s kind of value chain investment a function of trying to balance the portfolio and the u s is the easiest place for you to do that given your existing footprint or is there something commercially about the u s and where these supply chains go through that kind of makes you feel like the u s is a place where you really want to be an exporter of finished products and not necessarily incremental crude just a little bit of background on your on the molecules you specifically want to target in the u s versus internationally darren woods chairman and chief executive officer we re happy to do that sam thank you and good morning yes i think as we look at that and the value of integration it is really a function of the markets that you re in and the structure of those markets so let me just give you an example of why we think there s a big opportunity here in the permian it s a very fast growing area it s inland and so you ve got key you need key logistics to move in and out of that and so as we re rapidly growing production in the permian as the industry is rapidly growing production in the permian there are going to be periods of disconnect as the pipeline and logistic systems try to keep up with that rapid production growth our view is we don t want to be exposed to those disconnects and so we have been looking across our integrated chain and one of the advantages that exxonmobil has is we can see across that whole value chain because we participate along the whole value chain and so making sure that as we are developing our plans in the permian at the same time we re developing our plans and our logistic system s developing the plans in the refineries so that we make sure that that stays connected the refinery investments that we re making stands somewhat alone they accommodate our production but they re somewhat alone and disconnected from our physical molecules the opportunity there is just take advantage of the transportation differential between bringing crude in from west texas in the permian versus importing it in from some of the locations so that s the margins and what we expect to get out of the refinery expansion is just really a transportation differential in play and that combined with our advantages make those attractive so when you look at us and hear us talking a lot about the integration it is really with western canada crude and in permian because of the specific nature of those markets and some of the other markets we re in we are close to tidewater we don t have the same kind of market dynamics that value doesn t manifest itself as explicitly sam margolin wolfe research analyst ok thanks so much and then just a quick follow up you mentioned the small step up in capex in 2018 versus your analyst day guidance was a function of some acquisitions some opportunistic acquisitions you had specifically in brazil going forward are you going to try to pair asset sales with opportunistic acquisitions like that or are these adds just a function of returns and there s no sort of cash balancing consideration at work here as well darren woods chairman and chief executive officer yes i would tell you we re not we don t have a formula where we re trying to balance ins and outs it really comes back to maximizing value so if we see an acquisition an opportunity there that we think has some high potential and is accretive to value we re going to pursue that i d also say at the same time we recognize as we bring more attractive opportunities into our portfolio that gives us an opportunity to trade out some of the existing assets and the more we bring in and front end load the pipeline and we prioritize across the highest value investment opportunities by definition some will get moved out as we move those assets and those projects back we have the opportunity to trade on that others that don t have the same pipeline of opportunities that we do will see a higher value sooner and gives us a chance to trade so i would expect to see that ramp up and i don t think we re going to constrain ourselves to try to balance those things out but i d expect to see more divestments coming out of the upstream and i know neil chapman and his team are very focused on that sam margolin wolfe research analyst ok thank you so much darren woods chairman and chief executive officer you re welcome neil hansen vice president of investor relations and secretary thanks sam operator next we ll go to neil mehta with goldman sachs neil mehta goldman sachs analyst good morning and thanks darren for being on the call today the first question i had was just on the base business and can you just talk about outside of the major capital projects when you think about the balance of the existing portfolio how you see declines playing out from here what are you doing to mitigate those declines and talk about some of the larger legacy assets like groningen where we have seen some volume declines and how do you intend to either offset that or do you look to allow that to continue to happen as you try to maximize returns and cash flow darren woods chairman and chief executive officer sure hi neil it s good to hear from you again let me just say too i m happy to be on the call and spend some time talking about our business i m real happy and pleased with how the organization has kind of come together and we ve challenged them to make sure that we re maximizing and leveraging the full capability of the corporation one of the changes driving our upstream reorganization is to make sure that the upstream businesses have the accountability and the ownership to maximize profitability and value for their assets and for their value chain and that philosophy as i mentioned in my comments have already been pushed out into the organization and so what we re seeing in terms of short term day to day operations is i think real aggressiveness at looking for opportunities to grow value i mentioned to you that we ve identified a number of upsides as we went through the year those were bottom up upsides as the organization really focus on where they could find and extract additional value not just from the new projects but also from the base business so i feel good about that and they will make decisions day to day around what s economic in terms of offsetting decline and making sure that we re getting a good return for every dollar that we spend to bring that production back with respect to groningen that s a slightly different dynamic as you know with some of the tremors and the concerns legitimate concerns expressed by the community there we worked fairly closely with the government and made sure that we had a mechanism to kind of address those concerns in a responsible way that agreement that we reached with the government entailed a change in the fiscals take the fiscals for the groningen resource back in line with the rest of the gas business and the netherlands and so i think all of that has been reflected in our go forward plans and very comfortable that what we re doing and the growth that we ve got will more than offset any reduction that we see there neil mehta goldman sachs analyst i appreciate it and the follow up question is just on liza just as we talked about in miami it sounds like you guys are full steam ahead toward that 750 000 barrel a day long term target do you see potential upside to that base case number and then curious how you re thinking about the timing of phase 2 especially given some of the uncertainty from a political perspective down in guyana darren woods chairman and chief executive officer yes we still feel really confident about what we re doing there and advancing liza i think as we ve talked about already with the discoveries that we ve announced we see additional fpsos there and that resource we re still a long way as i mentioned in miami from fully exploring the opportunity set there so as we continue to advance that exploration we ll see how it plays out and we re optimistic that we ll find some additional opportunities there and that will continue to grow that resource with respect to phase 2 liza 2 that continues to be on track with the schedule that we ve put in place and let me just address this the comment that you made around the government and some of the things happening there i think it s important to keep in mind when we go into countries we go in with a mindset that we re going to be there for a lifetime 30 to 40 years you can t have a successful development if you re only talking to a subset or a narrow section of your stakeholder group so we have been engaged with the sitting government with the opposition with communities making sure that the development and what we re doing is understood and the people are aligned on that so the opposition understands the contracts that we have in place i think they understand the value that will that that development will bring to guyana and the people of guyana so i think it s very consistent with how we think about a long term approach to engaging with companies and countries neil mehta goldman sachs analyst thanks darren we appreciate the increased transparency darren woods chairman and chief executive officer sure neil hansen vice president of investor relations and secretary thanks neil operator next we ll go to alastair syme with citi alastair syme citigroup analyst hi thanks for taking my questions my first question just as you look at the lng market you re clearly trying to sanction a lot of projects over the next couple of years so historically exxonmobil have sought to secure most of the offtake before a sanction is that still the way you look at the market and do you have increasing observations about the changing market dynamics darren woods chairman and chief executive officer yes well thanks alastair you re right that has been the historical model i think as you kind of make reference implicit in your question is that market is evolving i m not sure it s going to evolve as quickly as some people are predicting it but we certainly see a change and i would anticipate as we make those investments and bring lng on that we ll evolve along with the market and make sure that we re positioned to maximize the value of those investments and that may mean more portfolio activity in the future but again we re going to pace that in that development consistent with how that market develops alastair syme citigroup analyst ok thank you a quick follow up question just a point of clarification on the capex i think in 2018 you had around about 3 billion of acquisition capital does your 2019 budget incorporate something around a similar level is that how you think about the budget darren woods chairman and chief executive officer no typically when we re putting together our plans if we ve got something a line of sight on something that we think has got a high chance of closing we ll try to reflect some of that if we don t have any of those then it won t show up in the plans so it tends to kind of vary depending on where we re at and the line of sight that we have on the opportunities alastair syme citigroup analyst great thank you for taking my questions darren woods chairman and chief executive officer you re welcome thank you operator next question comes from the line of john herrlin with societe generale john herrlin societe generale analyst yes hi darren with respect to the upstream reorg are all these new entities or groups going to report still to neil or do they report to the committee darren woods chairman and chief executive officer so the new streamlined organization one of the big benefits that we have there is moving from seven upstream companies down to three those three companies and presidents will report to neil chapman john herrlin societe generale analyst ok great then a next one for me is i guess for neil could you address what the impairments were in the u s and internationally upstream neil hansen vice president of investor relations and secretary yes so john as i mentioned there were and you can see the detail in the supplemental information as well we had about 400 million after tax in impairments in 2018 about half of that related to a u s gulf of mexico asset and then the other half related to unconventional activity in north america john herrlin societe generale analyst ok i missed that thank you neil hansen vice president of investor relations and secretary you re welcome operator we ll next move to biraj borkhataria with rbc biraj borkhataria rbc analyst hi thanks for taking my question it was on lng again could you just talk a little bit about the rationale to move forward with the golden pass project and then also how that competes with some of the other options you have particularly mozambique and then a potential qatar expansion if you were to participate there thank you darren woods chairman and chief executive officer sure thanks biraj let me just maybe start with the philosophy of how we look at competing investments if you will or the opportunities within our portfolio i ve said this before in different audiences but our strategy here and the way we make decisions on investment is those investments have to compete versus the whole of industry not just what we have in our portfolio so the emphasis that we put on our different projects is how do they fit in with the industry s projects and the additional capacity that they re going to bring on and make sure that those projects have the advantages needed to be on the lower end of the cost of supply curve so that they will be very competitive versus any other industry projects that come on that s very important because as we just talked about with the chemical business in a high growth while we see a lot of high growth opportunities in lng capacity will come on in big chunks it won t be necessarily coordinated so we ll see i suspect periods of oversupply and so when we see that period we re going to have to make sure that our investments are robust to lower market prices and then as the growth continues and the market tightens up we ll see advantages there as well so the focus is really on making sure our projects are competitive in the landscape of the industry with respect to golden pass i think it s got a lot of strategic value if you think about the gas business in the u s the quantity of gas available to the marketplace the associated gas that comes on with some of the crude development we continue to see from a supply standpoint a very attractive supply gas market in the u s for us then we ve got an opportunity to leverage our existing turn facilities which gives us an advantage and then it also allows us with a supply point here in the atlantic basin and north america for a lot of optimization as we look to supply the global markets and so i think we ve got some unique advantages with the existing facilities we ve got advantages with the industry supply source here in the u s and then we ve got advantages in terms of a global lng business and the ability to optimize across that whole portfolio and including the work that we do with qp and optimization with that integrated portfolio biraj borkhataria rbc analyst can i just ask a very quick follow up in terms of timing you ve got mozambique which maybe fid 2019 and 2020 and then golden pass moving forward would you expect to you re going to do both the developments concurrently or should we expect one to be pushed back a little bit darren woods chairman and chief executive officer yes each of them will be a function of kind of the contract availability and how that plays itself out i ll tell you with the strong growth that we re seeing in the lng market lots of demand that supply is going to chase here and so i think we ll make sure we re going to make sure that those developments occur on a very efficient cost effective way and as i said before with the advantages that we are building into these projects it ll be low cost to the supply and so less worried about what others are doing and making sure that we bring those on in a cost effective manner biraj borkhataria rbc analyst great that s helpful thank you darren woods chairman and chief executive officer you re welcome operator next question comes from the line of doug leggate with bank of america merrill lynch doug leggate bank of america merrill lynch analyst thank you apologies folks i don t know if there was a technical issue on your end as well but i had to dial back in again so sorry about that first of all darren let me also reiterate my thanks for you getting on the call today but i wonder if i could get pre empt you a little bit on the upcoming analyst day your rig count in the permian is about 50 above what you guided last year or at least the target for the end of the year and clearly there is multiple additional growth potential in guyana is your intention on a high level to would that notionally increase the targeted growth or would you intend to do more with less or perhaps accelerate disposals to keep the overall kind of scale of your expectations through 2025 darren woods chairman and chief executive officer yes thanks doug well i think in march we re going to have a really comprehensive conversation about how all this pulls together i ll tell you with what we laid out for the permian last march that was very early into the development of that resource and what i talked about earlier with respect to trying to leverage the capacity and the skills of not only xto but the full exxonmobil advantages has led us to i think a very unique concept for developing the permian resource and so i think and we ll lay that out in march talk about how we re approaching that and the investments that we re making there so that will be kind of a story onto itself we re also with guyana as we continue to see opportunities and leverage what we re already doing there s a lot of efficiencies continuing to roll into production as we have more discoveries and find resources that we can bring on so i think again we re going to we ll update you with that but if we continue to have success in exploration continue to build on that momentum take advantage of the efficiencies and bring on very attractive very low cost of supply as all that kind of comes to fruition our expectation is we d see more earnings and more cash and bring in more returns and at the same time we ve got the opportunity now to kind of flex that portfolio and we ll optimize to make sure that we re not leaving any value on the table we want to bring in npv forward as much as possible but do it in a way that keeps cost in control and stays within the capability of our organization so that s kind of a constant evaluation and testing that we re doing i think the new organization that we re putting in place is going to help us more effectively advance some of these investment opportunities so we ll kind of roll all that together and lay out what the implications are going forward in march doug leggate bank of america merrill lynch analyst i appreciate that my follow up hopefully a quick one is just on the reorganization i realize your disposals this year run i think above the kind of guidance or the list guidance you ve typically given in the past about what you d expect that scale to be should we read the reorganization in somehow accelerate or brings forward the focus a little bit more in other words would you anticipate your disposal program to get even larger as you move forward and i ll leave it there thanks darren woods chairman and chief executive officer yes yes thanks doug i think as we mentioned we ve got the upstream business development group which is really their focus is on what i ll call as the frontend of the pipeline the project s portfolio and optimizing that portfolio that i think is going to bring an additional degree of focus into that space not only from an exploration standpoint but from an acquisition as well as divestment so i would anticipate from an upstream standpoint we will see the pace of divestments accelerate if you step back and look at it in the context of the corporation and you go back in time a lot of the divestments we ve seen came out of the downstream and so the mix will change as we go forward and then the level maybe slightly up or consistent with what we ve done in the past doug leggate bank of america merrill lynch analyst i appreciate you taking my questions guys thank you darren woods chairman and chief executive officer you bet thank you doug operator next question comes from the line of roger read with wells fargo roger read wells fargo analyst good morning and like everyone else welcome to the call darren darren woods chairman and chief executive officer thanks roger roger read wells fargo analyst i guess we could maybe just talk about capex plan this year the 30 billion and you re able to pay off some debt last year but i think if we were to take the capex back to the 30 billion level we d be more of a neutral level in 19 and then if you adjust crude prices to the strip we d probably be looking a little bit of a debt add in 19 i was just curious not so much whether or not you need to borrow a couple billion or pay back a couple of billion but just understanding how you re thinking about capex within the overall cash flow environment and then what that could mean for increased shareholder distributions presumably at this point just on the dividend front darren woods chairman and chief executive officer sure let me kind of maybe just remind reemphasize the priorities that we ve got about capital allocation and how we re approaching that first and foremost if you re looking at the long term value of our corporation particularly on the upstream side which is a depletion business you ve got to have a healthy pipeline of attractive investment opportunities and that has been one of the things that i know over the last several years the management team here has really been challenging themselves with around reloading that pipeline and making sure that we got projects and project opportunities that go way up to the future to bring value in and our intention would be to bring those projects on consistent with our plans irrespective of the price environment and the reason for that is we built those projects and tested those projects to make sure they re robust to a low price environment so if we were to find ourselves in an environment where prices were low that would actually i think benefit those projects in terms of as as activity falls away in the industry you tend to get lower cost construction so that might play in our favor but we would continue on that path and then consistent with that and one of the reasons why we keep a balance sheet the way we do is to allow that to happen and not have to adjust the business up and down with the cycles that makes for a very inefficient capital development it also prevents you from taking advantage of the down cycle and a lot of the things that come positive from a down cycle and so our strategy has always been to make sure that we ve got robust capital structure to support continued investment at capex through the cycle making sure we ve got enough dry powder to take advantage of the down cycle if an opportunity presents itself an acquisition opportunity potentially and at the same time make sure that our cost of leverage remains very competitive and to do all that with investments with our balance sheet continue to fund reliable and growing dividend we feel like that s an important priority for a lot of our shareholders so that s kind of the equation then we get into buybacks and i ll tell you we ve challenged ourselves on the investment front we ve challenged ourselves on our organization and our ability to effectively deliver the advantages that we have as a corporation and to bottom line results i think you ve seen changes there and we re also challenging ourselves around the optimum capital structure and what we want to make sure that we re leveraging the full advantage of that capital structure that s what s going on and i m very optimistic that we ve got a very strong portfolio of investments that are backed up by very strong capacity and capability of the corporation roger read wells fargo analyst ok thanks for that and maybe just as the follow up as we think about maybe more dispositions coming from the upstream sector how should we think about the cash flow that comes from that is that to reinvest in the upstream or do you think as you move forward obviously nothing in q1 probably but as we think about the latter part of 19 and into 20 does the cash flow go to the balance sheet or is it capex supporting or is that maybe what you re thinking about in terms of getting back to more of the historical shareholder returns darren woods chairman and chief executive officer i would say as we progress that divestment program and to the extent we have success finding buyers out there that put a value on it that we think is attractive for a transaction we re not waiting for that in order to fund our capex our investment program is not a function of waiting for cash to come so i would not expect to see as divestments progress see that translate into additional projects in capital investment that is an independent decision again related to some of the things i talked about in terms of the strength of the opportunities we re looking for which then says any addition cash would come in would came to the point i just made around the optimum capital structure and whether we pay that down in debt or whether we move it out as a buyback and as i said we re taking a real hard look at that and making sure that we re striking the right balance there operator all right your next question comes from the line of jason gabelman with cowen jason gabelman cowen and company analyst yes hey guys just a couple of questions firstly on guyana what s going on with the government there i appreciate that you ve already addressed this question a bit but if i could push a little deeper if there is kind of a pause in who s running the government i mean are you one concerned that you may have to ramp down investments there and two is there somewhere else where you would put that money to work in if there is a potential pause or slowdown in the pace that your developing that asset darren woods chairman and chief executive officer yes i frankly given the discussions that we ve had since really coming to guyana with the stakeholders that we ve got across the political spectrum there given the discussions about the advantages this development brings and the recognition of those advantages by a very wide constituency in guyana we really don t have any concerns about the political dynamics that are happening there we understand that that s the nature of governments and countries around the world we basically expect governments to change over time again when you re coming into a country for 30 plus years i think it would be extremely naïve to think that you re only going to have one constituency there for the time frame so again we take a very broad based approach i think all the feedback we ve got the alignment that we have in country supports what we re doing here because they recognize the value that it s going to bring to guyana so real happy about that and as i said i think the phase 2 is on track remains on track we don t see that coming off at this point and obviously we ll see how things develop there but we re not particularly worried about it given the value and the strength of that investment jason gabelman cowen and company analyst that s very clear thanks secondly just on capital spend and i appreciate the 2019 guidance that you provided do you have a view on what 2020 and beyond is going to look like relative to the guidance you gave at the at your last analyst day darren woods chairman and chief executive officer yes jason i think i m going to stick with the guidance we gave for 2019 i think in a month s time we re going to kind of layout the longer term plan again consistent with the 2025 time frame and talk about the upgrades that we re seeing and the opportunities that we re seeing and how we re factoring that into the plan and we ll provide some a better prospective at that time jason gabelman cowen and company analyst all right thanks a lot darren woods chairman and chief executive officer you re welcome operator next we ll go to jason gammel with jefferies jason gammel jefferies analyst thank you very much gentlemen my first question relates to the technology that you have deployed at the hydro cracker in rotterdam it seems to be a pretty significant uplift on margins relative to the old technology i was just curious whether this is something that you will be able to deploy on a wider scale or is there something unique about rotterdam that really kind of restricts it to that location for now darren woods chairman and chief executive officer yes thanks for the question i think so what that development or that project in rotterdam leverages is the catalysis and the technology we have the advantages that we have in catalysis and so that s a unique application based on our understanding and our ability to develop unique value added catalysts opportunities like that exist across the portfolio obviously it may involve different catalysts but we ve talked about our singapore project where we re looking at upgrading heavy residue molecules that would also look to leverage some of this technology and use some of this proprietary catalyst to make that conversion from a very low heavy low value residue into higher value products diesel and loose base stocks so there is broader application obviously it depends on the nature of the molecules that you re trying to upgrade but we feel and that s one of the reasons why we ve challenged ourselves for a long time we weren t investing in the downstream because and i can say this with a lot of intimacy because i was involved it in at the time we weren t going to put in kind of a bog standard industry technology and get industry returns we were going to force ourselves to find technology that allowed us to get above industry returns rotterdam is a great example of that i think singapore will be another great example of that and hopefully we ll be able to share some additional examples as we move forward and find additional applications i m pretty optimistic jason gammel jefferies analyst i look forward to that my second question also relates to the lng portfolio can you discuss whether you were interested in participating in the expansion at qatar lng and if so how would that rank relative to the three other lng opportunities that you have in the portfolio currently darren woods chairman and chief executive officer yes we ve got a very long term presence and partnership in qatar i think we value that there it s a good partnership we ve had a lot of success working with qp i would certainly look to continue to extend that i think we re aligned to how we think about the business and the opportunity and value each other s partnership so yes absolutely interested in continuing to partner with that and to develop resources and opportunities in qatar it is a very low cost supply gas which as you ve heard me talk about is an important element in the lng projects that we re advancing with respect to how that would fit into our portfolio i d come back to the discussion we ve had we are looking at these opportunities not on the basis of what we have in our portfolio but on the basis of what industry has in its portfolio and we re going to advance the opportunities that we think are advantage versus the rest of industry if we can t find an investment that does that even if it looks good in our portfolio we won t pursue it because frankly it s going to have to compete on an industry wide basis and that is the hurdle that we re using we don t want to make decisions based on what we have we want to make decisions based on how competitive it will be in the industry and that applies not only to lng but every other thing that we re doing in this company from an investment standpoint jason gammel jefferies analyst i appreciate your thoughts gentlemen thank you darren woods chairman and chief executive officer you re welcome operator all right we ll next go to paul cheng with barclays paul cheng barclays analyst hi guys good morning darren woods chairman and chief executive officer hi paul neil hansen vice president of investor relations and secretary good morning paul paul cheng barclays analyst first i d just want to say thank you to neil hansen to put in the page identified the large earning item impacting on the quarter that we really appreciate on that for darren a couple of questions then first with your reorganization you talked about how that it may accelerate your asset sales effort how about on the other side of the ledger on the acquisitions side is that going to have any meaningful impact and also if you can comment on what you believe today in the market is the bid ask environment is still too wide apart or you actually think that there s a reasonable expectation on the environment at this point darren woods chairman and chief executive officer ok yes thanks paul i think it s hard to what i would tell you is the reorganization is definitely going to improve the focus that we have on both sides divestments and acquisitions so i would expect to see additional thinking and focus on opportunities on both sides of the ledger there whether that results in anything or any acceleration on the acquisition side is really difficult to tell because frankly it comes to your second question which is the bid ask spread for us to pursue an acquisition it has got to have to bring some unique value to our shareholders we re not going to do a me too deal out there and so i think what we have to look for is something that fits in the portfolio and allows us to leverage something unique to exxonmobil which brings more value than on a stand alone basis and i think that s going to be the key driver i don t think there s anybody s out there looking to discount their business and so it s really got to find a way to bring some value there that doesn t exist otherwise and i think those opportunities are there it s just a function of finding them and seeing where the market goes and how willing sellers are and what their expectations are so i d just say we re going to stay very focused on that and see what opportunities bring us paul cheng barclays analyst the second question then i think digitalization seems to be the best word among some of your peers and some people may even try to quantify that how big is the potential impact of the saving to the business but exxon given your technology that we were actually a little bit surprised that you guys haven t really talked too much about that and then when are you coming up with any quantification that how much it may mean to your business is that something that you can share on that i m sure that you guys all have the expert looking at that darren woods chairman and chief executive officer yes you re right we do i think it is as some of our peers may have talked about a very high potential area a lot of opportunity to bring additional value we ve got an organization dedicated at looking at that i think one of the advantages that we have that organization is not is looking across the entire portfolio there are a lot of synergies when it comes to digital across our manufacturing and production platforms across our operations and chemicals downstream and the upstream and so we think given our size given the fact that we participate all along the value chain the data that we have probably is the best in industry and then our ability to mine and leverage that data to improve operations i would say our capacity continues to grow we re taking a what i would say is a thoughtful methodical approach to it to make sure that we re building structures and data structures and digital tools that allow us to do that in a comprehensive way across the globe and to leverage that value and so it s a very important area i would not expect us to start putting numbers on that and sharing it i think for us it s an advantage it s going to be a competitive advantage it s one we ll keep in house paul cheng barclays analyst i see all right very good thank you darren woods chairman and chief executive officer you re welcome neil hansen vice president of investor relations and secretary i think we have time for one more question operator we ll take our last question from pavel molchanov with raymond james pavel molchanov raymond james analyst thanks for squeezing me in guys just one question from me you ve alluded to the well known regulatory issues at the groningen field but when we look at your total european gas volumes down 12 versus a year ago even if we exclude groningen there would be close to a double digit decline so what explains the continual declines in your north sea gas outside of groningen darren woods chairman and chief executive officer well we divested our norway business last year and so that s going to have a material impact and that s probably what you re seeing there and then on top of that obviously gas demand and gas production is very seasonal depending on weather and temperatures and that s going to play into it as well pavel molchanov raymond james analyst ok wasn t this kind of a cold winter though in europe darren woods chairman and chief executive officer not if you look not if you look at compared to previous no pavel molchanov raymond james analyst ok thank you guys darren woods chairman and chief executive officer you re welcome thank you pavel neil hansen vice president of investor relations and secretary great thank you for your time and thoughtful questions this morning we appreciate you allowing us the opportunity today to highlight our fourth quarter and full year that included strong earnings and cash flow performance supported by continued liquids growth and value capture from our integrated business model look we look forward to seeing everyone on march 6th at our investor day in new york again we appreciate your interest and hope you enjoy the rest of your day thank you duration 81 minutes call

hyperinflation a kaleidoscope of uses and abuses the word hyperinflation is sprinkled throughout the press each day we read that iran is hyperinflating the same is written about zimbabwe and venezuela as well as a potpourri of other countries that are experiencing inflation flare ups while iran came close to a hyperinflation in the fall of 2012 it has never experienced an episode of hyperinflation and while zimbabwe experienced hyperinflation episodes in 2007 2008 and 2017 it is not hyperinflating now at present venezuela is the only country experiencing a hyperinflation it s clear that journalists and those they interview tend to play fast and loose with the word hyperinflation to clean up the hyperinflation landscape we must heed the words of the great eugen von böhm bawerk one of the founders of the austrian school of economics who in 1891 wrote we too must bring into our science a strict order and discipline which we are still far from having by a disorderly and ambiguous terminology we are led into the most palpable mistakes and misunderstandings all these failings are of so frequent occurrence in our science that they almost seem to be characteristic of its style yes nothing cleans up ambiguity and disorder better than clear definitions so just what is the definition of the oft misused word hyperinflation the convention adopted in the scientific literature is to classify an inflation as a hyperinflation if the monthly inflation rate exceeds 50 this definition was adopted in 1956 after phillip cagan published his seminal analysis of hyperinflation which appeared in a book edited by milton friedman studies in the quantity theory of money since i use high frequency data to measure inflation in countries where inflation is elevated i have been able to refine cagan s 50 per month hyperinflation hurdle with improved measurement techniques i now define a hyperinflation as an inflation in which the inflation rate exceeds 50 per month for at least thirty consecutive days after years of research with the help of many assistants i have documented with primary data 58 episodes of hyperinflation those episodes are listed in the hanke krus world hyperinflation table 2013 amended 2017 below hanke krus world hyperinflation table 2013 amended 2017 prof steve h hanke hungary holds down the top spot its peak hyperinflation occurred in july 1946 when prices were doubling every 15 hours zimbabwe s november 2008 hyperinflation peak is second highest but way behind hungary s indeed at their peaks the daily inflation rates were 207 in hungary and 98 in zimbabwe the most memorable hyperinflation was germany s but it only ranks as the fifth highest with a peak daily rate of inflation of 20 9 way lower than the top four rates now let s turn to the world s only current hyperinflation venezuela it ranks as the 23rd most severe today the annual rate of inflation is 120 810 yr while this rate is modest by hyperinflation standards the duration of venezuela s hyperinflation episode as of today is long 27 months only four episodes of hyperinflation have been more long lived so how do we accurately measure hyperinflations well let s take a look at venezuela s case there is only one reliable way to measure the most important price in an economy is the exchange rate between the local currency in this case the bolivar and the world s reserve currency the u s dollar as long as there is an active black market read free market for currency and the data are available changes in the black market exchange rate can be reliably transformed into accurate measurements of countrywide inflation rates the economic principle of purchasing power parity ppp allows for this transformation and the application of ppp to measure elevated inflation rates is rather simple evidence from germany s 1920 1923 hyperinflation episode as reported by jacob frenkel in the july 1976 issue of the scandinavian journal of economics confirms the accuracy of ppp during hyperinflations frenkel plotted the deutschmark u s dollar exchange rate against both the german wholesale price index and the consumer price index cpi the correlations between germany s exchange rate and the two price indices were very close to unity throughout the period with the correlations moving to unity as the inflation rate increased beyond the theory of ppp the intuition of why ppp represents the gold standard for measuring inflation during hyperinflation episodes is clear all items in an economy that is hyperinflating are either priced in a stable foreign currency the u s dollar or a local currency the bolivar if goods are priced in terms of bolivars those prices are determined by referring to the dollar prices of goods and then converting them to local bolivar prices after checking with the spot black market exchange rate indeed when the price level is increasing rapidly and erratically on a day by day hour by hour or even minute by minute basis exchange rate quotations are the only source of information on how fast inflation is actually proceeding that is why ppp holds and why we can use high frequency daily data to calculate venezuela s inflation rate even during episodes of hyperinflation even though we can measure hyperinflation very accurately using ppp no one has ever been able to forecast the magnitude or direction of hyperinflations but that hasn t stopped the international monetary fund imf from producing forecasts for hyperinflation in venezuela even though the imf does not measure venezuela s hyperinflation something that can be reliably done the imf does forecast hyperinflation something that cannot be reliably done indeed forecasts for hyperinflation can t be found in the scientific literature that impossibility hasn t stopped the imf from throwing economic science to the winds yes the imf has regularly been reporting what are in fact absurd inflation forecasts for venezuela these forecasts have been issued under the watchful eye of alejandro werner the head of the imf s western hemisphere department the chart below presents the imf s finger in the wind forecasts read nonsensical folly the imf s 2018 year end inflation projections for venezuelaprof steve h hanke surprisingly the press dutifully reported the imf s forecasts that venezuela s annual inflation rate would hit a whopping 2 500 000 by the end of 2018 in some cases this figure was reported as a forecast which it was by some it was even reported as an actual measurement which it was not in any case the imf s guestimation was a bit off i measured venezuela s annual inflation rate on december 31 2018 and it was 80 000 yr when it comes to hyperinflation and its abuses there is no one more guilty of malfeasance than the imf it repeatedly produces what no one can produce reliable forecasts of hyperinflation by steve h hanke www cato org people hanke html twitter steve_hanke steve h hanke is a professor of applied

america s two tax systems michael swistara follow 7 min read feb 2 2019 7 listen share alexandria ocasio cortez the charismatic new congressmember from new york recently floated the idea of a 70 top marginal tax rate on those earning over 10 million her proposal was met with criticism from the center and the right but was also publicly supported by numerous nobel prize winning economists with some studies even suggesting that 70 was not shooting high enough in much of the discussion that followed news outlets issued explainers clarifying how a marginal tax rate works but few commented on whether america s tax system is even progressive anymore a progressive tax system is one in which the higher up on the income spectrum one gets the higher their percent of tax paid on that income in the united states the first progressive tax was signed into law by abraham lincoln in 1862 by the middle of the 20th century almost all developed nations had their own form of progressive taxation america s top marginal tax rate peaked at 94 during the second world war and remained high until the reagan years when it began to come down to the current rate of 37 on any dollar earned over 500 000 for single filers the idea behind progressive taxation originated in the united kingdom as a means of collecting more tax revenue during the french revolution the economic theory that supports this idea is that of marginal utility that as people earn more money each dollar earned is less valuable give 1 000 to a household making 25 000 a year and it will significantly improve their financial livelihood give the same amount of money to someone making tens of millions a year and they may not even notice the change in their checking account balance marginal utility theory allows for the collection of a greater percent from higher earners before it begins to disincentive work think of this as part of the famous laffer curve theory that higher tax rates will raise revenue until eventually they disincentive labor though the peak of the curve is somewhat disputed the new palgrave dictionary of economics states that the range in academic studies centers around 70 all this extra money raised through tax revenue could fund key government programs like the worker training and infrastructure jobs programs championed by ocasio cortez and others beyond raising additional revenue a progressive tax system helps address income inequality this is both through funding more programs for the lower earners but also it takes more from the top and thus aids in the equity of the tax system economist emmanuel saez notes that pre tax income inequality is also higher in countries with lower top marginal rates which he suggests comes from ceos working harder to maximize their own pay in systems like ours all this is to say that a progressive tax system has many benefits when administered correctly in a world where we want to make filing taxes easier rather than harder we create tax brackets to group income into so as to simplify what rates people pay the u s currently has seven tax brackets as stated above the highest beginning at the 500 001st dollar earned this means that someone earning 6 million is paying the same top rate as someone who earns 1 10thof what they do considering 6 million would still place you below average amongst the 1 in places like new york city this tax system begins to look less progressive as you go up the income scale in fact once you pass 500 000 a year the change in how much of your income goes to taxes actually decreases this is to say that the rate of increase in your tax burden falls ever lower as your income rises this happens at each level in the tranche not just for the highest earners but when we cap the progressive marginal tax system at only 500 000 what we have left is effectively a flat tax rate for those earning over that amount a flat tax system is one in which every dollar earned is taxed at the same amount which as stated is effectively what we have for the absolute richest in our society this is wildly inefficient as the marginal utility of those extra dollars is very low for the ultra wealthy this skewed tax code also shifts more of the tax burden down on to middle and lower class households under america s two income tax systems the ultrarich effectively buy in to a tax system that is less equitable once you start earning over 1 million a year most of that income is being taxed at the same flat rate if we were to expand the number and size of tax brackets to better reflect diamond and saez s recommendations including scaling up to a top rate of 73 the government would collect a projected 72 billion more in tax revenue each year this would increase equity and align our tax system with how it was during some of america s best years of economic growth far from extreme ocasio cortez s proposal is starting to look like a great place to start it s the wealth stupid however even though the structure of income taxes is important and ocasio cortez s plan is far from outlandish a much larger contributor to american inequality is how wealth is taxed and distributed over the last quarter of a century only the richest 10 of american households have seen their net wealth grow while the bottom 50 of households have seen their net wealth shrink in real terms this disparity exacerbates other cleavages of inequality such as the large racial wealth gap between the median white household 171 000 and the median black household 17 600 this growing wealth inequality is largely fueled by the regressive tax mechanism regulating money earned from investment income long term capital gains are taxed at 0 15 and 20 depending on what income bracket you fall into but they never exceed 20 these numbers are substantially lower than tax rates on earned income for the same individuals the 2017 gop tax bill only fueled this redistribution towards the wealthiest individuals by slashing the corporate tax rate permanently doubling the estate tax exemption and lowering the top marginal income tax rate for the very wealthy the lion s share of their annual earnings comes from capital gains for the lower 99 of american households more than three quarters of their annual income comes from salaries and wages whereas for anyone making over 10 million per year their salary accounts for only 15 or less of their income reports from the non partisan tax policy center have shown that wealthy individuals report an effective taxable return on their wealth of less than 2 on their individual income tax returns this means that for every 1 million of wealth those individuals have less than 20 000 is taxable when aggregated across interest dividends and capital gains the tax policy center states as the primary reasons for such low taxable returns the tax system s preference for retirement saving non taxing of unrealized gains and arbitrage allowed by loss offsetting in the tax code often this results in the richest people in the country paying lower effective tax rates on their total income each year than those in the middle class recall warren buffett s secretary most wealthy investors do not realize their capital gains on an annual basis i e liquidating their investments and therefore are not subject to the lower tax rate anyway all of this means that the very wealthy are not only subject to an effective flat tax on their salaried income but more importantly they are able to make most of their income from gains and returns taxed at a much lower rate this is something unattainable for the vast majority of americans because of the up front capital required to adequately invest in stocks or property therefore though the capital gains tax may have been envisioned as a way to spur investment and shore up capital for business ventures it has become a massive windfall for the ultrarich recent reporting from the washington post confirmed that saez along with his uc berkeley colleague gabriel zucman is now working with senator elizabeth warren to develop her proposal for a wealth tax on those worth over 50 million the basic proposal includes a 2 tax on wealth over 50 million rising to 3 on that over 1 billion saez and zucman project that a wealth tax could increase tax revenue some 2 75 trillion over a decade unlike ocasio cortez s proposal to raise rates on flows of money warren s plan would hit an individual s stock of cash this would incentivize the ultra rich to spend their fortunes either on charitable giving or on lavish living expenses if a wealth tax is passed a sizeable cottage industry would arise overnight to aid tax evaders therefore warren s wealth tax relies in part on greater enforcement that includes increasing mandatory audits whether it is by raising taxes on flows of income or on stocks of wealth there is a lot of energy building amongst democrats for progressive tax reform the share of pre tax income going to the top 1 of earners has been rising steadily for over 40 years and america s continual tax cuts for the wealthy have helped fueled that redistribution of wealth away from the middle class and towards the mega rich though it continues to be worth debating what exactly a truly progressive tax system would look like the question of when we need to start has been settled image source

forward looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today those elements can change and we ask that you interpret them in that light we identify the principal risks and uncertainties that affect our performance and our annual report on form 10 k and other sec filings for this call references to adjusted earnings per share adjusted free cash flow and free cash flow conversion and effective tax rate excluding the impact from separation costs related to the two spinoff of our homes and transportation systems businesses as well as pension mark to market adjustment and us tax legislation except where otherwise noted in 2018 with regards to 2019 references to adjusted free cash flow guidance and associated conversion on this call exclude impacts from separation cost payments related to the spinoff this morning we will review our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 share our guidance for the first quarter of 2019 and discuss our full year outlook as always we ll leave time for your questions on the end with that i will turn the call over to chairman and ceo darius adamczyk darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer thank you mark and good morning everyone let s begin on slide two we re extremely pleased with our results in 2018 made progress both from a portfolio and financial perspective continued smart investments in our businesses and our people and took steps to position the company for next 20 years this quarter we successfully completed our second spin off of the year resideo technologies launching our new stock exchange in october we also continue to advance our software spread toward growing our core businesses in attractive end markets and most importantly consistent with what we ve done all year honeywell delivered on its commitments to our shareowners we met or exceeded our financial commitments on all metrics delivering adjusted earnings per share of 1 91 in the fourth quarter driven by 6 organic sales growth and 80 basis points of segment margin expansion we continue to see strength in our long cycle businesses most notably in commercial aerospace defense and warehouse automation where intelligrated business is a global leader furthermore we are aggressively planning and mitigating the impacts of the tariffs dispute in all of our businesses as evidenced by the strong margin expansion we generated this quarter based on what we know of today we do not expect any material impact to our results in 2019 related to tariffs for the full year we achieved 100 free cash flow conversion and a 105 conversion in the fourth quarter we generated over 6 billion of free cash flow for the year excluding spin cost payments up 22 even after spinning nearly 20 of the company in the fourth quarter this was principally driven by profitable growth higher net income and continued efforts to free up working capital all the while funding smart growth investments to 800 million of capex our free cash flow as a percent of sales is the highest it s been in at least 15 years and we expect to continue to grow from here importantly our us pension is funded over 105 and we do not expect any cash contributions in near term the financial health of this company heading into 2019 is as strong as it s ever been and we still have ample resources to deploy lastly we continued a steady cadence of capital deployment of an additional 1 7 billion of honeywell share repurchases in the quarter bringing the full year total to approximately 4 billion as a result and now expect the fully diluted share count to be down at least 3 in 2019 based on our plan to reduce share count by at least 1 from 2018 as we continue to return cash to our shareowners through 2 3 billion in dividends following another double digit dividend increase in 2018 this was a particularly good year for honeywell we have a simpler more focused portfolio after dispense and continue to execute on our initiatives as we look to the future we see strength across several end markets and have significant balance sheet capacity deployed and while we are not planning for recession in 2019 we are taking steps now to ensure we deliver on our commitments in uncertain economic environment let s turn to slide three to review some of the progress from last year as i mentioned we took significant steps through 2018 to transform the business one of my key priorities from the outset was to accelerate organic growth as you ve seen by our results we re making good progress on this front we are encouraged by the fact that nearly 60 of the portfolio grew sales 5 or more organically for the full year of 2018 with several businesses growing above 10 if the spin offs complete we now operate a more focused portfolio in a smaller number of attractive end markets portfolio optimization is central to and will continue to be part of honeywell s operating system we plan to continue to effectively deploying capital by funding high return capex and returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases we have had nine consecutive double digit dividend increases since 2010 and still have a strong and flexible balance sheet with the ability to deploy over 14 billion of cash to m a capex dividends and share repurchases the combination of strong sales growth favorable end market exposure and significant balance sheet capacity positions us well as we head into 2019 we are now on slide four as i mentioned continuous transformation is part of honeywell s operating system on this slide we highlight three key transformation initiatives to establish honeywell as a premier technology company for the future earlier this year we established honeywell connected enterprise or hce which is a strengthened and centralized organization that will serve as a software innovation engine for all of honeywell hce operates with speed and agility of a start up working close to our businesses and our customers across the entire portfolio to build the world s best software solutions rapidly and efficiently on a single platform our transformation to a premier technology company require us to look beyond just spin offs our chief supply chain officer torsten pilz is leading honeywell s efforts to improve our supply chain and optimize our global footprint you see a lot of opportunity here to drive margin expansion and operational efficiency and you ll hear much more about this from torsten at our annual investor conference in may we are making similar enhancements on our capabilities internally with honeywell s digital initiative this requires people process data and technology elements to come together which will offer more effective and efficient decision making throughout honeywell this effort includes a continuation of our progress to centralize erp systems thus far we have eliminated 35 unique systems in 2018 going from 106 to 71 and we are on path to just 10 erp applications by the end of 2020 the result will be consistent processes and centralized data governance of a common it foundation as you can see we have achieved a lot this year and continue to redefine the limits and where honeywell can achieve to be the best position multi industrial company for the future let s turn to slide five to briefly review progress against our key priorities i laid out my key priorities for the company in 2017 since then we ve continued to foster a cultural win honeywell of doing what we say however as we called the say do ratio as you stack the results against our long term commitments you can see we re clearly making progress and in some instances achieving milestones sooner than we thought such as of our organic sales growth and free cash flow conversion we re accomplishing these objectives while making smart investments for future through capex restructuring and research and development our software businesses grew in the mid teens range last year on a path to the 20 long term compound annual growth rate we anticipate we have taken steps to unify and strengthen our software strategy through the honeywell connected enterprise and continue to invest in software development sales and marketing capabilities and build out of the sentience platform in 2018 honeywell ventures made five investments including in soft robotics a developer of automation solutions and soft robotic gripping systems that can grasp and manipulate items the same dexterity of the human hand and in iotium a managed secure network infrastructure platform for an industrial internet of things that primarily serves building technologies and industrial customers we also completed 2 bolt on acquisitions totaling roughly 500 million ortloff engineers is a privately held licensor and industry leading developer of specialized technologies to drive high returns in natural gas processing and sulphur recovery this complements our existing uop offering which allows us to better meet customer needs for high recovery non gas liquids extraction plants globally transnorm now part of safety and productivity solutions is a global leader in high performance conveyor solutions that are used in diverse end markets such as parcel delivery e commerce fulfillment and airports the acquisition strengthens honeywell s warehouse automation portfolio and positions the company to support the growing european e commerce market while broadening honeywell s connected distribution center and aftermarket offerings i ll stop there and turn the call over to greg who will discuss our fourth quarter results and 2019 outlook in more detail gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks darius and good morning everyone let me begin on slide six as darius mentioned we finished 2018 very strong in every financial metric organic sales growth for the fourth quarter was 6 we have been at or above 5 every quarter this year this reflects our continued commitment to customer excellence new product development as well as our realization of benefits from the investments we ve made in our sales organization and new product development process we generated approximately 2 billion of segment profit in the fourth quarter driven principally by higher sales volumes with segment margin expansion of 80 basis points the impact in the spin offs of lower margin businesses net of acquisitions contributed 30 basis points while the core business generated 50 basis points expansion pricing and productivity was strong which enabled us to effectively mitigate the impact of material and labor inflation we also saw continued benefits from previously funded restructuring adjusted eps was 1 91 up 12 versus prior year excluding the spins which exceeded the high end of our guidance range by 0 01 the adjusted eps figure excludes both the impact of an approximate 435 million favorable adjustment to the 4q 17 tax charge and 104 million in spin related separation costs at the outlook call in 2018 we estimated a separation cost for the 2 transactions would be in the range of 800 million to 1 2 billion i m very pleased to report that the total separation cost for both spins came in lower than this estimate at 730 million which demonstrates our ability to effectively execute complex transactions both ahead of schedule and below budget we also recorded 300 million in repositioning charges in the quarter to fund future productivity and stranded cost reductions share buybacks totaled 4 billion in 2018 and drove a 0 06 benefit from lower share count in the quarter you can find a bridge to the fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share in the appendix of this presentation finally working capital improved 0 6 turns year over year our businesses are all focused on improving working capital and we continue to see progress on our initiatives with room to free up more cash for capital deployment now on to slide seven and review our segment results our aerospace business continue to perform extremely well in a robust demand environment capping off a strong year of near double digit organic sales growth in the fourth quarter we generated 17 organic growth in defense and space with double digit growth in both the us and international businesses led by global demand for sensors and guidance systems original equipment shipment volumes and higher spares volumes on us department of defense programs we also saw growth in our space business driven by new satellite program wins and commercial helicopters driven by repair and overhaul demand in commercial oe sales were up 8 organically with increased hts engine demand for gulfstream and textron longitude platforms and higher aviation ship set volumes driven primarily by the certification of the gulfstream g600 aftermarket growth was strong in all businesses including defense driven by increased demand for avionics upgrades both software and hardware navigation products and safety mandates our connected aircraft offerings continue to gain traction driven by godirect cabin tail capture and robust jetwave demand turning to honeywell building technologies organic sales growth was 1 driven by continued demand for commercial fire products in north america europe and our high growth regions building solutions projects growth was also strong particularly for international airports the hps projects backlog is up 15 setting up a strong 2019 as we continue to expand in critical infrastructure markets like airports cities and stadiums these gains were offset by declines in our china air and water business and temporary supply chain challenges within our building management systems business we expect the air and water business to recover in 2019 driven by new product introductions for the mid segment and stronger demand as inventory net levels normalize after a challenging 2018 in december the supply chain issues within building management systems began to stabilize and we expect continued improvement in the first half of 2019 hbt also benefited from one month of single digit organic sales growth from the former homes business driven by strength in both products and adi global distribution as a reminder the results for hbt exclude homes and distribution after october in performance materials and technologies sales were flat on an organic basis sales in uop were up 2 driven by ongoing strength in licensing and engineering sales but were offset by an expected decline in gas processing which was driven by an extremely strong fourth quarter in 2017 process solutions sales were up 1 organically driven primarily by a strong demand in our software maintenance and migration services and field devices this was offset by declines in large project activity and in smart energy and thermal solutions both shorter cycle businesses due to supply chain challenges notably we continue to see solid trends within the automation businesses and process solutions with total orders up double digits and short cycle backlog up over 30 suggesting that oil price volatility in the fourth quarter may have temporarily delayed customer investment decisions advanced materials sales were down 3 on an organic basis as continued strong demand and adoption of our solstice line of low global warming refrigerants which was up 5 was offset by declines in specialty products particularly in our electronic materials business which is in the semiconductor space as you know and tough comps associated to the fourth quarter of 2017 pmt segment margins expanded 200 basis points in the fourth quarter as expected driven by the timing of catalyst shipments within uop commercial excellence and the benefits from previously funded repositioning now turning to the safety and productivity solutions business that continued to perform at a high level with organic sales up 15 driven by broad based strength across all lines of business double digit organic growth in intelligrated continued as orders from major systems and robust backlog conversion fueled by e commerce drove strong results we also saw double digit growth in our sensing business and continued strength in our productivity products business driven by demand for android based mobility offerings and handheld printing devices in total organic growth in our productivity solutions segment was up 23 moving to safety the safety business sales grew 5 organically led by ongoing demand for gas products and strong growth in retail footwear associated with the holiday season finally we continue to see strength in our businesses across high growth regions in china sps grew double digits with robust growth across industrial safety productivity products and siot excluding the ongoing softness in air and water hpt also grew double digits in china for all of honeywell china was up 9 organically for the full year in india our capabilities and strength provided exceptional growth in the fourth quarter greater than 25 over prior year this was driven by our building and process solutions businesses we continue to see positive macroeconomic trends in the middle east which supported growth across all businesses with three segments growing double digits organically compared to the prior quarter now with 2018 in the rearview mirror let s move to slide eight and discuss our 2019 outlook we have a reliable playbook at honeywell and it s not changing for 2019 our focus on smart growth investments breakthrough initiatives and new product development coupled with productivity rigor and the benefits of funded repositioning has positioned as well for continued outperformance for 2019 we anticipate an organic sales growth range of 2 to 5 the low end of which reflects the possibility of some economic slowing but not a recession in 2019 segment margin expansion is expected to be 110 basis points to 140 basis points or 30 basis points to 60 basis points excluding the impact of the spin offs this will drive earnings per share growth of 6 to 10 excluding dilution from the spins in 2018 we expect to generate adjusted free cash flow conversion near 100 consistent with 2018 driven by high quality income growth and continued working capital improvements across the portfolio we re confident in our businesses in the year ahead supported by positive long cycle orders and backlog trends exiting 2018 we have put forth a strong plan with multiple cost levers to pull in the event the recent volatility in the macro environment persists as darius mentioned in his opening we don t expect a significant impact in 2019 related to tariffs we ve worked very hard to mitigate that across the year for 2019 including addressing the potential impact of the still unannounced list 4 which contemplates 25 tariff on all remaining items imported from china we will continue to monitor this throughout the year and react accordingly as we did in 2018 some other items to take note of related to our 2019 plan we are on track to slightly ahead of our plan to eliminate all stranded costs in 2019 related to the spin offs with a little over half the costs remove to date we see the impact of these costs primarily in the net corporate cost line and in the segment margin honeywell building technologies also based on the planned reduction in pension income driven by discount rates and assumed asset returns as well as lower repositioning and other charges driven by the spin indemnity our total net below the line charges are expected to be approximately 80 million in 2019 we will see continued benefits from planned and executed share repurchases our 2019 plan assumes a weighted average share count reduction of about 3 year on year or 730 million shares this is based on the 2 share count reduction we executed from 2018 repurchases and at least 1 additional reduction in 2019 you will find additional details on our 2019 plan inputs in the appendix based on what we can see today we expect to be at the upper end of our sales guidance range for organic growth however given the many uncertainties in the macro signals we re planning cautiously in 2019 overall as it s difficult to predict short cycle revenues particularly in the second half of the year and remember that is still approximately 60 of our business let s turn to page nine we provided a initial assessment of our end markets and anticipated organic growth rates in each for 2019 the green arrows are an indication that we expect market conditions to improve while the gray flat arrows indicate that we expect market conditions to remain relatively similar to last year starting with aerospace we expect organic sales to be up strong mid single digits for the year we continue to see a robust demand environment in both commercial aerospace and defense and in transport we expect continued growth in narrow body production rates we forecast new business jet deliveries to increase 8 to 10 in 2019 supported by several new aircraft models entering into service a decline in young used aircraft inventories and stable used jet prices our long term strategy of securing good positions on the right platforms and building our installed base will serve us well in 2019 particularly with new business jet platforms where we are well positioned from an oe standpoint mid single digit flight hours growth will continue to drive aftermarket demand and we expect further tailwinds from the ads b compliance mandate deadline along with increased demand for connected aircraft solutions across all products the industry dynamics in defense will be positive in the us and internationally driven by budget growth but we are planning conservatively for 2019 given the tough year over year comparisons following 2018 s banner year where we grew 15 organically in the business with the favorable margin rate uplift from the former transportation systems spin you should expect segment margins of approximately 24 for the aero business going forward now on to hbt as a reminder following the spin of our homes portfolio hbt s primary exposure is to non residential construction here we anticipate low single digit organic sales growth after a challenging 2018 driven by better execution in our operations better selling strategies and sales coverage and new product introductions we expect commercial fire will continue to be strong with the expansion of sales coverage and share gain and commercial security to improve with the expansion of our channel partner network the declines we experienced in our china based air and water business should subside through a combination of stronger market demand and new product introductions for the mid segment and mass mid segment globally we see building management solutions growth in both hardware and software driven by high growth regions expansion and our investments in software honeywell building solutions growth will be driven by government investments in smart cities social infrastructure and airport monetization and capacity enhancements particularly in high growth regions we also expect continued adoption of connected building solutions on a global basis you should expect to see margins in the range of about 25 in hbt after the spin off of homes for pmt sales are expected to be up low single digits plus on an organic basis in oil and gas petrochemical market growth should remain steady at about 4 driven by demand for packaging and plastics however given the volatility in oil prices in the second half of 2018 investments in global mega projects slowed and we see the oil price volatility potentially putting some pressure on upstream spending plans in 2019 nevertheless we anticipate similar market dynamics overall to 2018 and the basis for our plan is that oil prices remain in the low to mid 60s per barrel the refining market should continue to be strong as global demand for cleaner transportation fuels remains the us natural gas market which is primarily served by our uop russell business is expected to improve from 2018 uop is expected to deliver a strong year driven by a strong backlog licensing and services growth and improved market demand in gas processing after a tough 2018 process solutions will continue to grow across its short cycle businesses as we saw in 2018 this is supported by short cycle backlog which was up over 30 at the year end finally within advanced materials we expect continued growth from solstice and our fluorine products business and better execution in specialty products lastly in sps sales are expected to be up in the mid single digit range we expect the strong e commerce and warehouse distribution macro trends to continue as our customers seek and implement differentiated warehouse solutions to deal with rising demand our orders in intelligrated in 2018 were up over 30 for the year in the safety business we anticipate growth will be driven by new product introductions within gas detection growth in our core product lines and high risk personal protective equipment and new product launches in general safety in productivity we expect strong growth driven by backlog conversion in intelligrated and our sensing business new mobility product introductions and expanded software offerings we are also seeing growth in our life cycle service offerings in intelligrated which includes maintenance technical support and optimization services that is combined with the aftermarket capabilities we acquired with transnorm now let s move on to slide 10 here you can see the bridge of our 2018 adjusted earnings per share to 2019 the spin impact which we define as the after tax segment profit contribution from the spins in 2018 nine months of transportation systems and 10 months of homes net of the estimated impact of the spin indemnity assuming that it was in place all year for 2018 will be a 0 62 headwind to earnings in 2019 as you can see the majority of our earnings improvement 0 30 to 0 60 per share will again come from operational gains in our businesses driven by profitable growth continued productivity improvements and incremental benefits from previously funded restructuring you can see the remaining impacts from the share count below the line items and tax rate i have already touched on will contribute approximately 0 11 per share now let s move to slide 11 to discuss our first quarter guidance for the first quarter we expect to generate 3 to 5 organic sales growth driven principally by healthy growth in our long cycle businesses with a more cautious tone toward short cycle given the market volatility exiting 2018 with that said we do anticipate that the commercial aftermarket our sensing business and productivity products and commercial fire products will continue to be strong on the short cycle side we expect segment margins will expand 30 basis points to 60 basis points ex the spins consistent with our long term framework and 110 basis points to 140 basis points on a reported basis aided by 80 basis points of margin accretion from the absence of the two spins our expected adjusted earnings per share range of 1 80 to 1 85 represents growth of 6 to 9 expense we have 0 25 of earnings dilution from the spins in the first quarter of 2018 our guide is based on an effective tax rate of 22 and a weighted average share count of 737 million shares for the quarter we feel this will be a very strong start to another successful year for honeywell in 2019 with that i d like to turn the call back to darius who will wrap up on slide 12 darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer thanks greg we accomplished a lot in 2018 and expect great things in 2019 as well we delivered on all our commitments successfully completed spin offs ahead of schedule and under budget while still overdriving on the organic growth margin expansion earnings per share and free cash flow targets that we have established at the end of 2017 there is significant room for continued margin expansion on the path to our long term target of 23 this is aided by over 450 million of repositioned fund in 2018 and in prior years which will drive improvements to our cost structure supply chain and gross margin in 2019 and beyond our balance sheet capacity is strong and this will provide another lever to drive outperformance in any macro environment they are continuing their business transformation through several new initiatives including honeywell digital a unified software business in honeywell connected enterprise and increased focus on our supply chain we are excited about 2019 and expect another great year with that mark let s move on to q a mark macaluso vice president investor relations thanks darius darius and greg are now available to answer your questions if possible please keep your questions to one comment and a quick follow up so we can address all questions marguerite if you could please open up the line for q a questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions we can now take our first question peter arment from baird please go ahead peter arment r w baird analyst yeah thanks good morning darius and greg gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning peter arment r w baird analyst nice way to finish up 2018 darius i guess on aerospace just really the momentum continues to be really impressive with organic growth of 10 in each of the past two quarters maybe you can talk about i guess the sustainability of the confidence around the biz jet volume for you i know you mentioned 8 to 10 for this year and on 2019 aerospace guidance of mid single digit plus is the defense tough comp really the only headwind you re seeing in 2019 maybe just some color there thanks darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer yeah i mean so first of all we are very confident about our aero outlook for 2019 our bookings have been strong january has been strong yeah the comps do get tougher and there s some short cycle and i think as people saw in our outlook for q1 and what i anticipate will be q2 we have every bit of confidence that mid single digit is hopefully the bottom but the fact is we don t know the second half of the year and and that s why the numbers are what they are and potential government shutdowns and budgetary challenges and trade licenses potentially becoming an issue we hope that doesn t happen that just reflect sort of external risk but overall there is absolutely nothing that i m concerned about in terms of the bookings to growth rates to kind of growth we re seeing in that business and it s pervasive across all three segments whether they re transport bga or defense and space so i m very pleased and it s not a place where i m going to be losing a lot of sleep in 2019 peter arment r w baird analyst appreciate the color thanks i ll leave it to one darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer thanks gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks peter operator we can now take our next question from sheila kahyaoglu from jefferies please go ahead sheila kahyaoglu jefferies analyst thank you and good morning darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer good morning sheila gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning sheila sheila kahyaoglu jefferies analyst across your four businesses you either have a deceleration in organic growth or flattening of sales growth just how where are you factoring in some conservatism with a slowdown and how are you capturing that low end of the sales growth guidance of 2 darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer yeah i think i think it s not so much that i am we re capturing any conservatism in any of the businesses i think what we have been our guidance going forward is the fact that more than 50 of our business is short cycle and what s different about this year than i think many years in the past is we have many more unknowns whether it s brexit whether it s trade negotiations specific china us whether it s fed hikes in terms of what happens whether it s government shutdowns or just a lot of geopolitical unknowns more than usual and for us to express a level of confidence around all these unknowns around a little bit wider range than we anticipate i think would be would probably indicate a level of knowledge that we currently don t have now having said that and as you can see in our q1 outlook we re actually front end loaded and if anything we re going to be at the upper half of our revenue growth range in the first half of the year so actually we re provided that all things go as we think they will to the positive side i think that hopefully we ll be raising the bottom of that range as we move further through the year but there s i don t see really any growth issues of any of our businesses and we expect all of them to grow in 2019 sheila kahyaoglu jefferies analyst thank you for the color darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer no problem operator we can now take our next question from john inch from gordon haskett please go ahead john inch gordon haskett analyst thank you good morning everybody gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning john darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer good morning john john inch gordon haskett analyst good morning guys so how did your european businesses do and what s actually baked i guess on the growth rate any color there and what s baked into your guidance for 2019 for europe gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah john europe continued to be strong in the fourth quarter our european businesses were up 6 which capped off a 4 organic growth for the year so i still think we re seeing good strong growth there and it s pretty broad based to be honest sps probably the strongest of the bunch but each of the businesses is growing in the mid single digits or higher in europe at this stage and as we look forward we expect that s probably going to be still low mid single digits low to mid single digits but as darius mentioned clearly there are concerns out there i mean brexit in particular will will have some sort of an answer in the next 60 days as what occurs with that and we ve got a meaningful size business in the uk so definitely back to the concern aspects of macro signals europe is an area where we re waiting to see what s going to happen with brexit in particular and what impact that may have on us john inch gordon haskett analyst but greg that performance the 6 that s pretty good relative to what other companies have been putting up in europe and given sort of the slowing in germany itself is there a mix issue that s benefiting honeywell or new products or what do you think is attributable to why you re doing a general comment gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer well again i would tell you that each yeah each of the businesses is performing well so it s not like one is i mean sps being the strongest of the bunch but each of them is up mid single digits for the year so it s strength across our entire portfolio john inch gordon haskett analyst and then as a follow up last year you guys put up a 3 to 5 core growth target and darius you flagged accelerating core growth as your number one priority now i understand the economics sensitivities around the 2 to 5 this year but i m just trying to think big picture what are you and how are you actually going to tackle driving honeywell toward more of a mid single digit type of accelerating core growth over time is that meaning to go after it like and darius that pie ph the 40 that s not growing at 5 plus or do you kick start building technologies which has been sort of a problem for a little while or more m a i mean what maybe just walk us through a little bit of your own thoughts and maybe horizon too darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer yeah john it s not any one thing it s probably all of those john inch gordon haskett analyst yeah darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer yeah i mean i think it think starts with portfolio and we think that basis upon what we ve done here we ve got a more growth oriented and less cyclical portfolio that s certainly part of it secondly which is our tremendous focus on velocity product development and we re launching a whole new process called z21 which basically is going to reduce our innovation cycle times in half deploying more capital to r d because my strong belief is that part of any growth story there s got to be a strong innovation engine and that s something that we re trying to create continued focus on high growth regions i mean we re winning in places like china and india and even though the back half of the year china was a little bit slower we grew nearly double digit in china this year so that continues to be a success story our focus on commercial excellence sales forces is working where we re getting better productivity out of our sales force better performance it s it s never only one thing we re working all those levers and as you can see in the growth rate that we ve demonstrated this is granted the markets are pretty good but certainly involve the self help that we ve administered over last couple of years there s no way we would be in that range both in 2018 and what we re projecting for 2019 john inch gordon haskett analyst just last india has been a real success story i think you flagged it again would you consider putting more resources or doing m a in india in particular and region wise it s much smaller than china but it does seem to gained a lot of traction for honeywell i m just wondering what you re thinking about it darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer yeah no we ve had a lot of focus on india i mean to give you a perspective for india our growth in india in q4 was 27 john inch gordon haskett analyst yeah darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer so that s tremendous we have a big footprint there not just from a business perspective we have our engineering centers there of over 10 000 people so we feel very comfortable of our presence there the opportunities now to go after the mass mid market segment and that s actually one of our core initiatives for 2019 and beyond it s just not to play in the top tier the mid tier but actually having a greater level of participation in mid market segment so india is definitely one of the economies which we think is going to be a great story for us in 2019 and beyond john inch gordon haskett analyst thanks very much darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer thanks john operator we now take our next question from gautam khanna from cowen company please go ahead gautam khanna cowen company analyst thanks good morning and great results darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer thank you gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning and thank you gautam khanna cowen company analyst two questions first just big picture m a pipeline what can you say about it is it as healthy as it s ever been or anything large that you guys are looking at just any commentary on the nature of the pipeline right now darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer yeah i would say large probably not because i think that we re still very much focused on bolt ons and not the mega deals so i would say that s that is and will continue to be our focus we got a deal done in q4 which was good now transnorm was a deal of size the kind of size we like it was about 0 5 billion capital one ph to do that but to be honest on my commentary that the pipeline continues to be good and we are working on a deal that recently fell through just because although there has been a little bit of a correction in the market as we saw particularly in december that didn t really changed expectations of a lot of the sellers so we continue to struggle valuations and the expectations which there is a very pronounced shift up and it s got to work in our financial model so we continue to be very active the pipeline is good but i also want to tell you that we re realistic because we re cautious buyers and we don t like to overpay so we have to be certain about what we re buying and make sure that generates the right level of returns for our shareowners gautam khanna cowen company analyst appreciated and second question was just if there are any supplier constraints you re seeing on the aerospace side i remember last year you had some aftermarket constraints are you seeing any pinch points emerge darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer yeah no the answer to that is yes and i would say there are some pinch points on the supply chain emerging not just in aerospace those are there and prevalent particularly in areas like casting et cetera but we see similar challenge in smart energy and even in some elements of electronic supply chain so the pinch points on the supply chain are real they re there we re working through those and hope to resolve those frankly speaking our results could have been even better had some of those pinch points not been there gautam khanna cowen company analyst thanks a lot guys darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer sure operator we can now take our next question from julian mitchell from barclays please go ahead julian mitchell barclays analyst hi good morning darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer good morning gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning julian mitchell barclays analyst morning maybe just a first question around sps you grew around 10 plus organically in 2018 your slide nine shows about mid single digit growth this year amid to sort of accelerating market arrow so is that guidance based on anything you re seeing in the short cycle businesses within sps or it s simply about tough comps and the usual macro aspects that you had mentioned earlier gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah thanks julian and i think it s a little bit of i think it s a little bit of both i mean obviously we continue to be very excited about intelligrated and the double digit growth rates that we achieved this year and with a very strong backlog expect that to continue to be strong we did our retail business though not large grew over 20 in 2018 so that s probably going to dampen a bit with some of those comps we still feel very positive about productivity products and sensing and iot with the new product introductions that they have but those and the industrial safety businesses they are short cycle so and when those things change they can change quickly and so i think that s where we re trying to be a bit cautious because we ve seen it we ve seen it happened before in terms of the speed at which the short cycle can turn on us and so it s not a matter of having seen it so far and being concerned about anything with our business specifically but i would just call it a bit more caution with the environment we re in darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer and just to add to that julian i like greg said i mean majority of that business is actually short cycle intelligrated is about the only business that isn t short cycle so based on what we re seeing now and today and our guide for q1 there is no warning signs for us here it where we re positioned is just uncertainty particularly on the second half of the year julian mitchell barclays analyst thanks and then my second question around pmt any more color you d like to provide on how you see the cadence of the large project activity within hps in terms of the scale of any delays and also uop how are you gauging the volatility there at the moment darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer yeah no i like the greater stability what we saw in q4 a little bit was a bit of a pause on the order rates just around the volatility of oil but kind of given the right direction movement we re much more bullish but despite that i just want to quote you a couple of numbers from q4 and why i m bullish on pmt for this year first of all our hps quarter rates were up double digit second of all our uop backlog is up 8 so i m very optimistic around pmt performance for 2019 probably the one segment that was pretty soft was in our advanced materials business the electronics chemicals which electronics has been a bit weaker some of the other companies in that segment announcing and we saw that in our electronics chemicals business so that s probably the only sort of minus that we saw in q4 but overall booked backlog the order rates were good and to be honest especially in hps our global mega projects front log ph and quote are very strong we ve even book a lot of those orders in q4 and our orders growth was up double digit in the quarter so i feel pretty good about pmt for 2019 julian mitchell barclays analyst great thank you gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks julian darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer thank you operator we can now take our next question from steve tusa from jpmorgan please go ahead steve tusa jpmorgan analyst hey guys thanks for fitting me in gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer my pleasure darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer good morning steve tusa jpmorgan analyst just wanted to ask about the not we re not sensitive or anything like that the you mentioned kind of the next phase of the transformation and some of the footprint stuff that you re that you re looking into is that something that you ll be able to kind of quantify more and speak to at this year s investor day or is that going to remain i don t know what you put at the bottom of slide like your consulting with people or something like that about what the number is going to be when we kind of hear more about about that and how big could that opportunity be darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer we re not putting in a middle anymore on the call you wind up grump steve no the so the short answer is yes on investor day we are going to it s obviously going to be a segment of that presentation we re going to give you a lot more detail but i just want to be very clear that the next phase of the transformation is not just the isc transformation that s a very big part of it but we kind of talked a little bit about this deck about kind of the three legs of the stool which are isc transformation honeywell digital and honeywell connected enterprises that s sort of the next phase of the evolution of honeywell and one of those three is a business and the next two are going to be are going for at least the next three to five years so this is going to give us a lot more tailwinds in terms of margins cash generation more efficiency working capital simplifications better planning lower capital intensity a lot of benefits so we re going to provide a lot more color on that in at our investor day steve tusa jpmorgan analyst are you going to give something are you going to give something tangible or will it be kind of like directional arrows i mean sometimes the stuff can it sounds great but ultimately it doesn t like filter down at the bottom line for other companies just curious if you re going to like give something tangible numbers wise gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer so steve i mean oftentimes we get asked about how long of a runway do we have for margin expansion and to me this is continuing to fill the portfolio of things that keeps that runway alive and well and so that s kind of the way i m thinking about all of these things are going to continue to contribute to our ability to drive that margin expansion well beyond 2019 steve tusa jpmorgan analyst okay darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer because as we kind of get deeper and deeper into the 20s which we re very comfortable that we re going to do and you look at our framework that we present in 2017 i talked about 30 basis to 50 best basis point expansion as you see from our performance as well as our guide and the top end of the range it s even greater than that number these are the kinds of things that enable us to kind of keep growing that margin machine is self help and these internal initiatives and the good news is we ve got plenty of opportunities because we ve got a lot of work to do on the supply chain and honeywell digital so i view all of that as not bad news but really a tremendous opportunity to continue to drive margins steve tusa jpmorgan analyst and then one last one i know you guys don t want to give specific segment guidance but maybe can you just talk about who maybe above or below the averages when it comes to margin expansion for 2019 just so people are kind of calibrated sometimes the segments can move around a little bit and people tend to kind of pick what they want to look at as positives or negatives things that s good to kind of baseline people don t need exact numbers but just some directional color around what will be above or below that kind of margin expansion or whether they re all be kind of in the middle there that d be helpful gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah i would expect aero and hbt to probably lead the pack in terms of the rate of expansion in 19 but each of the segments will have a very respectable margin expansion profile but clearly with the rate of growth that we re seeing in aero and leveraging the fixed costs that we have there that s probably got a pretty sizable opportunity and again hbt with a return to growth and some new products we see that is also having a fair amount of opportunity but each of the businesses i think will expand margins in a meaningful way in 19 steve tusa jpmorgan analyst okay great thanks a lot darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer thanks steve operator we can now take our next question jeff sprague from vertical research please go ahead jeff sprague vertical research analyst thank you good morning everyone darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer good morning jeff gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning jeff sprague vertical research analyst hi good morning just a couple of things on maybe some of the longer cycle outlooks and the like first on intelligrated obviously i have great visibility now on 19 on this backlog but do you have visibility on things like front log bidding et cetera do you expect it to be a fairly active order year again in 2019 for intelligrated darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer yeah the short answer is absolutely because not only because of the continued strength of activity in north america which is continues to be robust but now the transnorm and our enhanced capability in europe both from the beachhead that we ve established by acquiring transnorm but also because if you recall we put a lot of investments back in the 17 and 18 timeframe for r d capability we have a metrics based offering that s complete now so we re very capable bidding on warehouses et cetera so we continue to expect another very robust year in our intelligrated business jeff sprague vertical research analyst and then i was also just wondering back to this mega projects question in hps you noted your orders were strong even without some of those kind of hitting the order book we think a lot of those projects kind of being underwritten that maybe 50 or 60 oil price so is it just do you think they re just kind of a human reflex here that the volatility in q4 cause people to just tap the pause button or do you see some legitimate risks to these things kind of sliding out further darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer yeah i think it s just natural reaction when you see that kind of volatility like we saw in q4 that causes people to pause but we re actually seeing a very positive movement here in q1 so i think that some of those decisions will get made and we feel confident that when they do get made we re going to have some positive outcomes for us and even and i was encouraged by our bookings in q4 because despite not having booked some of those gnp ph jobs we still had a very robust orders growth jeff sprague vertical research analyst yeah all right great thank you very much darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer thank you gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks jeff operator we can now take our next question from scott davis from melius research please go ahead scott davis melius research analyst hi good morning guys darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer good morning scott gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer hey morning scott scott davis melius research analyst i so much of the future story of honeywell seems to relate software in some way shape or form and i m little intrigued by hce in general can you help us understand how centralized is the software development effort and whenever i hear about centralized software development i always think about makes me want to cry but or worse but how do you how do you still stay close to the customer and the businesses themselves and still have this type of a centralized effort and ensure that you re actually getting return on the investment darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer yeah so maybe let me just maybe explain that when we say centralized that mean sort of the platform the it stack that we call sentience that s what centralized that all of our connected enterprises use but then the actual analytics to solutions that are provided those are very much vertically oriented and the way we approach this is essentially each of those businesses end customer focused business so whether it s connected aircraft connected plant connected buildings we developed and the mv0 mv1 which was called single pane of glass which has a lot of value drivers solutions for end customers and we typically partner with a few key anchor customers to help us iterate and drive an optimize the solution so we re very close to the end customers as a matter of fact we develop a lot of these solutions with the end customers but we also don t want to drive customization but rather standardization so don t think about this as something that s sits in corporate a kind of a central level is insular and doesn t work with end customers that s not the case what we want to do is have end customer intimacy while driving leverage to the it stack called sentience that s really the core of the spread gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer and maybe if i could just add to that with the leadership from que she is applying that customer go to market approach across all of those connected enterprises such that each one of them individually isn t having to develop those muscles and skill sets independent and while these businesses are still embedded inside of the for four spgs those four spg presidents wouldn t possibly be able to give it the amount of time and attention that que will be able to do as the president of hce so centralized really means focus much more so than corporate darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer yeah that s a very good point because what the gist was yeah the way this was organized before it still has sort of core reporting into the spg presidents in que but we gave just a lot more authority and control to que just because when you re running a 10 billion or 12 billion business and you have something that s a fraction of that it requires a lot of time attention strategy changes agility it s tough to manage that scott davis melius research analyst right no that makes sense and that s helpful and you guys have done a nice job so it s not it just requires i think a little bit of explanation but just a follow on question really just on intelligrated and some of the assets you ve bought around it are you close to being at the point where you can go to market together with some of these products globally and how long will it take i mean just particularly given how regionalized some of the warehouse offerings are darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer yeah the short answer scott is now we are ready as a matter of fact we are quoting globally and as excited as we are about the north american market we anticipate being securing some jobs both in asia this year as well as europe and we re ready we ve invested from an r d perspective the transnorm acquisition is going to further help but you should expect us to get some more momentum here on a global level in 2019 and a lot of those solutions are finished scott davis melius research analyst okay good good luck thanks guys darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer thanks scott gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks scott operator we now take our next question from andrew obin from bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead andrew obin bank of america analyst hey guys good morning darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer good morning andrew gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning andrew obin bank of america analyst just a question on defense just because it was so strong can you give us more visibility into how sustainable some of the developments that you had in 4q and into the first half i would imagine f 35 ramp is sustainable you mentioned space and defense i think you mentioned aftermarket if you could just walk us through a visibility for the next six months thank you gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer well i would tell you so as you mentioned our defense business has been growing mid teens all four quarters of 2018 and as we look out for the next six months the backlog growth there is also very strong it s strong double digits over 20 in defense and space so for the next six months as you mentioned i think our visibility is very good to continued strength in that area andrew obin bank of america analyst and just maybe on china could you just describe more color on specific markets and just your top down view on china s economy and how do you think it will progress through the year just because you have such a big business there and you ve been very knowledgeable darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer yeah it s been as i mentioned it s our china business has been up nearly double digit just shy of that for the year so another solid growth here a bit of a slowing in i would say in q4 but there are some very clear reasons and we understood that slowing so that we kind of take it segment by segment if we think about sps it was terrific it was up double digit growth in china no slowing actually if anything things are accelerating in pmt we had some tough comps we understood that and expected that we had some big both orders and revenue growth so we expected that nothing unusual gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah we ve doubled the business in uop in the last two years so the comps are not small darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer yeah exactly so nothing out of the world of expectation for hbt as you know we ve had some challenges with the air and water segment and frankly some of our distributor partners got a little bit ahead of themselves given the robust growth that we saw in 2017 and that s been a bit of a challenge for us all year but we expect that to grow again in 2019 so we think that s going to be behind us and then with aero we had some take collections challenges which actually limited our shipments because our backlog was actually better than the revenues would indicate so all in all we re not building in a tremendous year in china not kind of the usual honeywell strong double digit growth in china where we think it s going to a little bit slow but all of that is reflected in our guide and we expect to grow in china in 2019 for certain how much that s going to be well we ll see all in all i feel pretty good about how the businesses are positioned andrew obin bank of america analyst and do you guys have a view on the chinese economy bottoms in 19 darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer well i think that s a 1 million it s a bit of 1 million question andrew i think a lot of that depends and we might know better answer ph in next 30 days right i mean i think we re watching carefully what happens on the geopolitical sphere and with the broader economy because as i said we re very prepared from a tariff perspective because that s something we can identify and should be able to do something about what we don t know and where we have some questions which is whether it s going to be the overall economic impact both on the economies of china the us et cetera that s i think at this juncture it s worth being a month into the year that s tough to call and we ll see what happens andrew obin bank of america analyst terrific appreciate it thanks so much darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer thanks andrew gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator next question comes from joe ritchie from goldman sachs please go ahead joseph ritchie goldman sachs analyst thanks good morning guys and thanks for truly fitting me in gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer welcome joseph ritchie goldman sachs analyst thanks lot of impact so obviously look you guys got a lot accomplished in 2018 congratulations darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer thank you joseph ritchie goldman sachs analyst i think one of the areas that we haven t really focused a lot on is that specialty products business and so maybe just a broader strategic question there i think that business is tied to semis electronics how do you think about that business longer term you got you did a lot in 2018 this business seems to be a little bit more cyclical versus the rest of your portfolio so maybe some thoughts around that that to start would be great darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer yeah i mean yeah there is some cyclicality there is also some stability i mean we have our spectra business there which is doing quite well our aclar business which is acyclical our electronic materials business which is more cyclical so it s a bit of a mixed bag probably we re given some of the challenges in the electronics segment probably on the lower end of the curve than we are but i think like anything i mean we re we like a lot of those businesses they perform for us but as always we re and as we pointed out during our speaker notes today we re always assessing everything i think some of the big things that we wanted to do that we didn t think that fit our portfolio within 2018 but everything is always under assessment we ve never done and we always want to kind of add and also subtract potentially so i don t there is no specific update to the to the sp business but like i said we re always assessing and we re going to do what s we ll make adjustments as they fit our portfolio joseph ritchie goldman sachs analyst yeah that s fair darius is it fair to think of that business though ph as being mostly semi capex oriented darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer it s a mixed bag i mean there is really a variety of different businesses and that s why it s kind of tough to talk about sort of any given one trend because you have electronic materials you have some defense spend and you have healthcare in there you have consumer goods so i mean you have a entire variety of end markets that there s exposure in speciality products so it s tough to say what that total blend ends up to but yeah there s sort of eclectic mix of various end markets joseph ritchie goldman sachs analyst okay yeah fair enough and just one quick one greg you mentioned the stranded costs earlier i think the number i had was like roughly around like 340 350 million gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer that s right yeah joseph ritchie goldman sachs analyst so the timing of those costs i mean does it what s remaining into in 2019 first can you quantify what s left in 2019 secondly what we get through those costs through the first half of the year are they going to be kind of linear as the year progresses gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah so we ve taken actions that we ll have eliminated about half of those costs already as we exited 2018 and as you saw in the fourth quarter with the corporate number of being flat to slightly up that reflects the first quarter of not having the ability to allocate about 45 million or 50 million to those two spin businesses that are now gone so that s a little bit of why you saw maybe a heavier number than you might have expected but we expect that to come down over the course of the year from the first to the fourth quarter and we will exit the fourth quarter at a run rate by which all of those costs will be gone so that s you should expect to see a bit of a stair step down and again keep in mind that two thirds is in our net corporate costs about a third of that was sitting in hpt so you re not going to see a 300 million number per se but it s reflective of a step down as we go through the year joseph ritchie goldman sachs analyst got it helpful guys thank you gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks joe darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer thank you operator next question comes from christopher glynn from oppenheimer please go ahead christopher glynn oppenheimer analyst hey thanks also a sincere thanks for squeezing me i certainly don t expect to go before steve but possibly before joe inaudible anyways question on non res a lot of mixed messages people talking about low single digits but yes they appeared talked about very robust commercial projects so just wondering what you re seeing in that space is that a very a vibrant market or is it just kind of gdp limp darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer okay i mean if you look at our hps business which is probably the best indication of kind of the commercial activity up double digit bookings in q4 so actually very very strong that s good we also want to make sure we captured a service that s the opportunity that business is stabilizing i think vimal and the team have put the business on the right path we re seeing good signs and sort of the secret to the growth there is revitalization of the npd pipeline and i see a lot of good things in the various segments whether it s building products whether it s fire whether it s our bms systems so we actually expect a pretty good year and if you take hps as a leading indicator that s also been a pretty good sign in q4 so we re little bit cautious in the outlook but given the stability that we have now and it should be a nice story for us recovery story first in 2019 christopher glynn oppenheimer analyst thank you operator and i would now like to turn the call back to darius darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer thank you our end markets continue to be strong and we ve got simpler more focused portfolio following completion of the spins we continue to execute well as evidence by our sales margin and cash performance and we have a significant balance sheet capacity to deploy we have a strong performance culture our say will continue equal our do and we are focused on continuing to outperform for our customers our shareowners and our employees i continue to be encouraged by what i see in each of our businesses and our people i m excited for what i know will be a strong 2019 thank you for listening operator that concludes today s conference thank you for your participation ladies and gentlemen you may now disconnect duration 70 minutes

zielke who recently had to pay the fee on aug 28 westjet began charging baggage fees in u s dollars for return flights from the u s latin america and the caribbean many passengers started noticing after oct 1 when westjet raised its first checked bag fee from 25 to 30 which amounts to about 40 when charged in u s currency the additional increase has enraged a number of customers who claim it s a cash grab very disappointed with yet another cash grab from a canadian airline westjet now forcing customers departing from mexico to pay usd baggage fees what a joke jperih hey westjet why did i pay 30 cad to fly direct to mexico but to fly directly back to canada i pay 30 usd per bag why is that do you always charge random countries currencies that people don t visit cannabianski in a statement on its website in the service fees section westjet explains that its baggage fees are now based on the country a flight departs from that doesn t make much sense to zielke who got hit with the 30 us fee on a return flight from puerto vallarta mexico where the domestic currency is the much weaker mexican peso what pisses me off the most is i never even stepped foot in the united states she said why am i paying in united states currency travelling to mexico on jan 19 zielke and her husband paid 60 for two checked bags on their return flight to regina last weekend they were charged 60 us for the same bags which worked out to 83 23 more what are they doing with that extra 23 said zielke i just feel like the whole thing is very sketchy an industry standard when zielke returned home she fired off a complaint to westjet the airline wrote in response that in mexico u s currency is the popular and desired method of payment zielke said she never paid in u s dollars when in mexico i would argue it s not the preferred currency she said chris gunderson and wife karen were surprised to have to pay 60 us 83 for two checked bags on their return westjet flight from mazatlan mexico to kelowna b c submitted by chris gunderson when westjet passenger chris gunderson complained about the same 30 us fee the airline replied that it adjusted fee guidelines to meet industry standards westjet also gives this explanation on its website i don t buy it said gunderson he and his wife were floored when they had to pay 60 us 83 for two checked bags on their return flight from mazatlan mexico to kelowna b c on dec 21 it s just gouging on their part said gunderson our guests whose flights originate out of u s mexico or caribbean will be charged in usd as it is their standard currency for international transactions the reason for the change is to align with industry standard westjet cbc news compared bag fee rules for u s and sun destination routes with other major canadian airlines for those routes air transat also charges a 30 us baggage fee for its lowest economy fare on return flights however passengers can avoid the u s charge by prepaying in canadian funds before leaving canada westjet doesn t provide a prepayment option both sunwing and air canada said that for flights originating in canada passengers never pay a different rate for a checked bag on the return flight instead they re charged the canadian equivalent in the departing country s local currency even westjet adheres to this rule but only for passengers flying from europe in those cases the airline charges the equivalent of 30 in british pounds or euros for a checked bag vincent pigeon and wife won hee pigeon got hit with a 31 50 us 43 checked bag fee on their return flight from phoenix to vancouver submitted by vincent pigeon why is flying from the americas different said westjet passenger vincent pigeon he complained to the airline after having to pay 31 50 us 43 to check a bag plus gst on his return flight from phoenix to vancouver on jan 18 that s not a fair rule said pigeon we buy the package here in canada the flight everything s initiated here in canada westjet responds westjet told cbc news that it periodically adjusts its baggage fees based on economics we believe that our fees including the 30 usd charge departing the u s are competitive with the industry overall said spokesperson lauren stewart in an email she said that westjet is sorry to hear that many passengers believe the fee is a cash grab and points out that when flying out of the u s westjet has to pay for local expenses in u s dollars stewart said that the airline charges the 30 us bag fee for flights from other southern countries such as mexico because westjet only accepts four currencies the u s and canadian dollar the british pound and the euro she didn t say why the airline chose to charge the bag fee in u s currency specifically for these countries while each of the passengers in this story complained to westjet only one of them gunderson was reimbursed for the extra 23 he spent to take his two checked bags home the reason he booked his flight before the us dollar bag fee took effect and never should have been charged it he d like to see other passengers also get their money back i don t think any other westjet customer should be charged that said gunderson they should change their policy it s not fair

president emmerson mnangagwa who has been under tremendous pressure to get the country back on track since october last year and has faced strikes by doctors strike threats by civil servants and anti government protests which led to a widely condemned crackdown by security forces says his reform agenda is progressing well most zimbabweans will not agree with him but mnangagwa said my job is to lead the country to where it ought to go not where individuals want i was and am still aware some of our people will be angry it s okay the president said he had been under pressure to enforce price controls but he was not going to do that because the laws of demand and supply must work as a leader i know nobody will be happy with austerity measures because they come with a lot of pain the president said according to newsday inflation which measures the general level in the increase of prices was at 3 5 percent in january last year it dropped to 2 7 in may but rocketed to 20 9 percent in october and 42 1 percent in december american economist steve hanke says it had rocketed to 253 percent last month mnangagwa who maintains his mantra that zimbabwe is open for business but has now added and dialogue said his administration has started repealing toxic laws that hampered foreign direct investment which seems to be the answer to zimbabwe as it is locked out of international financing because of sanctions imposed by the united states since 2003 that is why we have moved quickly to do away with the indigenisation law the move gained us 11 points on the global ease of doing business last year alone it was part of a group of statutes that we were advised by the world bank that they were an impediment to investment they include the public order and security act as well as the access to information and protection of privacy act he said we did not think it was necessary for an investor to bring 500 million into zimbabwe and then we turn around and ask for 49 from them just like that if we fail we must admit it this is because as a country an investor comes brings new technology employs our people builds infrastructure pays taxes and brings new skills if we can get more out of an investor the better he said the president said the zimbabwe investment and development authority which is aimed at reducing bureaucracy to speed up investment would be up and running by april this year his finance minister mthuli ncube also seems to share the same optimism as he says inflation should be down to single digit levels by the end of the month mnangagwa now seems to have the support of the business sector and a source said zimbabwe should be back on track in the next two months the source said that the fiscal discipline spelt out by ncube in october is paying off because zimbabwe has managed to cut expenditure and achieve a surplus on a month to month basis meetings between the government and the private sector are meant to align the corporate sector to keep the cost of production at current levels and in a normal rainy season april would see prices of food stuff coming down the source said indicating that things should start stabilising in april ncube has promised to review perks for civil servants in april indicating that he also believes that things will have stabilised by then the source also said meetings between zimbabwe and south africa should bring back stability in zimbabwe although south african media and private media in zimbabwe have been awash with news that south africa refused to bail out zimbabwe south african president cyril ramaphosa said talks were going on between the two countries finance ministers and he would meet zimbabwe president emmerson mnangagwa once the teams have come up with something the source said south africa s african national council and opposition parties except the democratic alliance supported the zimbabwe bail out the source also said the recent increase in the price of fuel which some say sparked off the anti government protests that saw several people killed when the demonstrations turned violent is now paying off the procurement of fuel put the country in an economic vicious circle but the confusion has been plugged by the decision to increase the price the government is not under pressure to procure fuel because consumption has gone down and pilferage through the borders has been curbed a source said 175 views

with that i d like to turn the call over to ken ken frazier chairman and chief executive officer thank you teri good morning and thank you all for joining the call in 2018 merck distinguished itself through its strong performance across its businesses perhaps most significantly our full year results demonstrate that our strategy to be the premier research intensive biopharmaceutical company is working the investments we ve made in r d over the past several years and our commercial execution have culminated in the highest top and bottom line growth the company has seen in years and we expect our momentum to carry it over into 2019 at its core merck is a science driven organization motivated by a quest to improve human and animal health we ve spent the last several years reinvigorating our labs investing in three new research centers in south san francisco cambridge massachusetts and london and refocusing our efforts on creating truly differentiated medicines that help solve big health problems for now and the future this unwavering commitment to science and innovation enables us to retain the best talent in the industry to drive our strategic priorities and to continuously enhance our pipeline of medically significant treatments and vaccines our clinical and commercial execution in the i o space has further separated keytruda from its competition and our leadership in oncology is further bolstered by the growth prospects for and lenvima gardasil is not only driving meaningful growth for the company after a decade on the market but is also instilling optimism around the world that this vaccine could help prevent and maybe eliminate certain hpv related cancers we are confident in our broad portfolio of market leading products and our diversified high potential pipeline which includes significant innovations in oncology vaccines and other specialty and hospital care along with a robust industry leading animal health business in fact merck has one of the broadest and most promising pipelines we ve had over the past two decades in summary we re excited by our progress our pipeline and our future we are energized by the work that we do and most importantly by our ability to help patients around the world while also creating sustainable long term growth and strong shareholder returns before i turn the call over to rob i m pleased to announce that we will be hosting an investor event on june 20 during which we will provide an update on our strategic progress and outline how merck will continue to deliver innovative science and create value for all of our stakeholders we will be back to you with the details on location and other logistics but we ask that you save the date now i d like to turn it over to rob for more color on our financial and operational performance rob rob davis chief financial officer thanks ken and good morning everyone please note that my comments today will be on a non gaap basis our results in 2018 reflect strong execution across our key growth pillars focused investment in our pipeline and disciplined expense management we achieved meaningful top and bottom line growth and we also executed important business development transactions initiated an expanded capital expenditure program to increase our manufacturing capacity and returned additional value to shareholders through increased dividends and share repurchases we believe our company is well positioned to achieve future growth and as our 2019 guidance shows we expect the recent momentum in our business to continue as we execute on our growth pillars and invest in r d while remaining disciplined in our allocation of resources turning to our fourth quarter results total company revenues were 11 billion an increase of 8 year over year excluding exchange with strong growth in both our human health and animal health businesses human health revenues increased 8 ex exchange to 9 8 billion led by a few products in our oncology vaccines and hospital and specialty businesses in oncology keytruda s sales exceeded 2 1 billion this quarter extending the unprecedented launch of this foundational therapy and solidifying merck as the clear market leader in renal oncology with continued strong future growth prospects global growth was primarily driven by higher use in first line non small cell lung cancer and utilization remains strong across the breadth of our indications including melanoma head and neck bladder and msi high cancers we are seeing strong uptake in squamous nonsmall lung cancer in the u s where a good portion of newly diagnosed patients are now receiving either keytruda as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy following the approval of keynote 407 in october in total in the u s we now have 15 approved indications and are approved in 10 different tumor types overall plus a tumor approval in msi high patients in ex u s markets first line lung is the key driver of growth mostly due to further uptake of our monotherapy indication in pd l1 high expressers following reimbursement approvals around the world in europe we re off to a great start launch in the chemo combo in non squamous patients following approval of keynote 189 last september we are already seeing adoption in select markets such as germany where reimbursement begins upon approval and we will be working through the reimbursement process in other major european markets throughout this year growth in japan remains robust and we are very pleased with the recent approval of five new indications across lung adjuvant melanoma and msi high cancers finally in september we launched keytruda in metastatic melanoma in china which will be an important market for the brand moving forward as we pursue additional indications overall we remain very confident in the long term growth potential for keytruda based on increased utilization and currently approved indications and our expectation of additional approvals worldwide we also remained very encouraged by the progress and potential in both and lenvima in partnership with astrazeneca and respectively growth this quarter was driven by continued uptake in ovarian and breast cancers as well as launches in new markets such as japan and china in the united states across all tumors leads the inhibitor class with over 50 total patient share we re excited by the earlier than expected u s approval of solo 1 and look forward to bringing this treatment to more women with ovarian cancer growth for lenvima reflected strong performance in hepatocellular cancer following recent launches in the u s europe and more recently china performance in japan remains strong with lenvima being used in the vast majority of hepatocellular patients turning to vaccines we have a significant and innovative portfolio our vaccines business reflected strong worldwide demand for gardasil which achieved sales of over seven of over 800 million this quarter health systems worldwide continued to support increased immunization of gardasil with the goal of reducing the incidence of certain hpv related cancers growth this quarter was driven by strong uptake from our recent launch in china as well as increased demand in europe given the move toward more gender neutral vaccination programs sales of gardasil also grew in the u s mostly reflecting the difference in quarterly phasing of public sector purchases last year our hospital and specialty business was led by bridion where growth in the u s reflects continued strong demand bridion sales approached 1 billion for the year and we remain confident in the potential for additional future growth looking now at our animal health business we again saw strong growth this quarter with revenues increasing 11 to 1 billion excluding exchange growth was driven by our broad portfolio of in line and newly launched products with companion animal products growing 16 and livestock sales growing 8 both excluding exchange companion animal growth was driven by sales of vaccines while livestock benefited from increased sales of swine and poultry products animal health segment profits were 387 million in the fourth quarter an increase of 16 excluding exchange compared to the prior year our animal health business continues to perform well and we view it as a key pillar of merck s future growth we continued to invest in new product development and launches and recently announced the acquisition of antelliq which will establish merck as a leader in animal identification and monitoring one of the fastest growing parts of the animal health industry turning to the rest of our p l gross margin was 75 in the quarter the increase of 70 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2017 was largely due to the favorable impacts of product mix this year and manufacturing variances related to the cyber attack that negatively impacted last year this increase was partially offset by other headwinds such as lower prices and catch up amortization of sales milestones primarily related to the earlier than expected approval of solo 1 operating expenses of 4 8 billion increased 1 year over year including a favorable 1 percentage point impact from foreign exchange investments in our oncology and vaccines clinical development portfolios as well as our discovery efforts drove the increase in r d while sg a remained relatively flat our tax rate of 22 5 for the quarter was 720 basis points higher year over year reflecting a true up of our full year tax rate due to our mix of earnings taken together we delivered earnings of 1 04 per share an increase of 11 excluding exchange now let s turn to our outlook for 2019 we remain confident in both our near and long term prospects for revenue growth notwithstanding expected headwinds from price foreign exchange and pressures on our mature and loe products for 2019 we expect full year revenues of 43 2 billion to 44 7 billion which represents 2 to 6 growth driven by strength in our key growth pillars across oncology vaccines hospital and specialty as well as animal health this range assumes an approximately 1 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange using mid january rates we expect our gross margin to be roughly flat year over year as we previously communicated we believe tailwinds including improved product mix will generally be offset by headwinds including lower prices royalty payments fluctuations in fx and the continued amortization of collaboration milestones we expect our operating expenses to increase year over year at a low to mid single digit rate with continued disciplined management of sg a allowing for meaningful further investment in r d to capitalize on our pipeline opportunities we expect our tax rate to be between 18 5 and 19 5 for the full year we project average diluted shares outstanding to be approximately 2 58 billion for 2019 taken together we expect eps to be between 4 57 and 4 72 including an approximately 1 percentage point positive impact from foreign exchange in mid january rates this would represent approximately 5 to 9 bottom line growth before concluding it s worth mentioning that our 2019 eps guidance assumes that our other income and expense line will be roughly 0 in 2019 due to an accounting standard implemented in 2018 we now recognize unrealized gains and losses related to our investments in equity securities and other income and expense based on current market conditions for our investment portfolio we have assumed a negative impact from our equity investments in oie in our guidance we also expect higher net interest expense given our cash and debt balances and given current interest rates market movements create additional volatility as we move through the year and we will continue to give you updates as we move forward in summary we delivered strong performance in 2018 while 2019 continues to be another important investment year for r d we expect operational momentum across our growth pillars combined with disciplined resource allocation to deliver another year of meaningful top and bottom line growth as well as operating leverage longer term we remain confident in our ability to drive strong sales growth and meaningful operating margin expansion our dedication to innovation and continued execution allow us to sustainably deliver for the patients we serve and in turn create significant shareholder value with that i d like to turn the call over to roger roger perlmutter president thanks rob as outlined in our press release the fourth quarter was an especially productive period for merck research laboratories marking the climax of what was an extremely busy year beginning first with keytruda during the fourth quarter we obtained three new indications in the united states first for the first line treatment for patients with metastatic squamous non small cell lung cancer in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or based upon the results of the keynote 407 trial second for the second line treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients who have previously been treated with and third for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with recurrent locally advanced or metastatic merkel cell carcinoma a rare skin cancer separately and based on the results of our keynote 054 study which was conducted with the european organization for the research and treatment of cancer the european commission approved keytruda for the adjuvant treatment of stage 3 melanoma with lymph nodes involved in patients who have undergone successful tumor resection meanwhile in japan we obtained five new keytruda approvals at the end of december including the first approval based on our keynote 042 trial for keytruda monotherapy in patients with non small cell lung cancer whose tumors contain greater than or equal to 1 of malignant cells expressing the pd l1 biomarker data from keynote 042 are also under review in the e u and in the united states for submission of additional data resulting in an extension of the pdufa date by three months to april 11 of this year our other cancer programs also advanced meaningfully in the fourth quarter in collaboration with our colleagues at astrazeneca we gained fda approval for as maintenance treatment for patients with advanced ovarian fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer with experienced complete or partial response for first line platinum based therapy and whose tumors contain deleterious or suspected deleterious germline or somatic mutations in brca1 or brca2 gene this approval is based on data presented last fall at the european society for medical oncology meeting from the solo 1 trial we continue to see very positive results across our oncology portfolio including the success of our keynote 181 trial testing keytruda monotherapy in the second line treatment of advanced or metastatic esophageal or gastroesophageal junction carcinoma with 31 reduction in the risk of death as compared to traditional chemotherapy in patients whose tumors expressed the pd l1 biomarker with a combined proportion score of greater than or equal to 10 this is the first demonstration of an improvement in overall survival in esophageal gastric malignancy through immunotherapy data from this study were presented at the asco gi meeting in january and have been submitted for regulatory review during the fourth quarter we also announced the results of our keynote 426 trial combining keytruda with pfizer s axitinib in the first line treatment of renal cell cancer as compared with treatment data from this study in which improvements in overall survival progression free survival and overall response rate were demonstrated have also been submitted for regulatory review progress has been made in other disease categories as well for example the fda granted priority review with the pdufa date of july 16 for our novel antimicrobial agent mk7655a which combines a new chemical entity relebactam with thus blocking the activity of the bacterially expressed beta that would otherwise inactivate this represents an important advance in the struggle to control antibiotic resistance we re also active on the business development front joining with colleagues at ngm biopharmaceuticals to advance mk 3655 a highly selective phase 2 monoclonal antibody directed against the fgf receptor 1c beta receptor complex for the potential treatment of nonalcoholic our vaccine programs also progressed during the fourth quarter at the end of the quarter for example we announced a collaboration with the instituto butantan on the development of vaccines to protect against dengue virus infection instituto butantan is currently conducting a phase 3 study in brazil with their vaccine candidate while our own related dengue virus vaccine showed promise in earlier phase 1 study finally we commenced a rolling bla submission for v920 our investigational vaccine designed to protect against infection from the zaire strain of ebola virus we continued to provide tens of thousands of doses of this vaccine to the world health organization to assist in the battle to contain an ebola outbreak in the democratic republic of the congo we hope that through the important work of governmental and nongovernmental agencies and in part as a result of our v920 vaccine it will be possible to bring this very serious ebola outbreak under control in the near future now my colleagues and i will take your questions questions and answers teri loxam senior vice president investor relations and global communications thanks roger darla we will i guess start on questions so with that we ll turn it over to questions operator your first question is from seamus fernandez with guggenheim seamus fernandez guggenheim securities analyst thanks very much for the question so my first question is for ken and my second are my second is for frank and roger ken can you just help us understand the core areas of focus for potential m a or business development to bolster the merck pipeline and maybe if you could just kind of give us a general sense of areas where areas of interest and perhaps even the range obviously lots of questions around the current mega cap m a that s occurred in recent days and then for frank and roger can you just maybe each of you kind of characterize the key opportunities near and longer term to sustain or perhaps even accelerate the keytruda opportunity we re seeing amazing growth in that franchise but again we re just trying to get a sense of the key new opportunities whether it be kidney cancer as a core opportunity or perhaps somewhat longer term in the adjuvant setting thanks so much ken frazier chairman and chief executive officer thanks seamus let me start by saying again that business development remains an important priority for us first and foremost we look for those scientific innovations that we believe will enhance our pipeline because we believe that s what s important ultimately to drive long term growth and value for shareholders in that regard we don t try to predetermine what therapeutic areas are best we want to find the best science that matches up to the best opportunities to help people and that s how we go about it and i ll remind you that we were very active last year in bd we did about 60 transactions spanning licensing and technology deals clinical collaboration we did the collaboration with eisai we did the acquisition of viralytics which expands our early immuno oncology pipeline we did the antelliq acquisition so again i think what we want to do given our strong balance sheet is to actively look across the entire spectrum of assets across therapeutic areas to create the strongest portfolio i ll close by saying we continue as we ve said for years to want to focus on the kinds of deals that we can add with a minimum of disruption to our ongoing scientific efforts so we have not really been focusing primarily on the large mega mergers that you referred to teri loxam senior vice president investor relations and global communications and roger why don t you start on the second question around keytruda key opportunities and we can turn over to frank for the commercial portion roger perlmutter president right seamus thanks for the question first of all i think it s important from a context point of view and you know this that we re still at an early point in the development of keytruda so keep in mind that it s just a little over four years since the first indication was obtained in the united states in 2014 and in that sense the indications are still rolling out keytruda as i ve said and as you know is the first truly broad spectrum agent introduced into clinical practice with 15 indications and more coming and many of those indications have not yet been broadened around the world and frank will have a chance to talk about that so there s a great deal of opportunity to do good in helping patients around the world but beyond that we ve continued to work on a strategy in which we first demonstrate activity with monotherapy in different tumor types and the monotherapy studies are essentially complete we have a few more studies coming through but then move forward in combination studies while simultaneously advancing from salvage therapy third line second line to first line adjuvant neoadjuvant and all of those studies are going on and we are expanding into new areas and in addition in combination with other agents both those that have already been introduced into practice axitinib and renal cell carcinoma and in addition our own pipeline so there is just a huge set of opportunities looking forward i think as i mentioned the data that we presented in esophageal gastric cancer in january at asco gi and the renal cell data which will be presented in mid february from the keynote 426 study are special highlights but there are going to be a lot of presentations coming forward there s a lot of new data coming out and we ll have a chance to talk about some of that for example in advance at asco it s early days but a lot of expansion opportunities and frank i think you can talk about that frank clyburn new chief commercial officer seamus good morning and to echo roger s point we have actually a very early stage launch going on and i just wanted to reiterate especially outside the u s for lung cancer we are right now launching keynote 189 and we re just in the early stages of that launch so if you look at our ex u s growth in fact this quarter ex us growth was over 86 and that just shows the early progress that we re making not only with our monotherapy but early on with our combination in lung in addition we have a number of other opportunities you heard us announce the approvals in japan we re very excited about the opportunity that we have in china with our second line melanoma indication and we have a broad program that we are building in china in addition to that we have significant opportunities as you ve heard from roger with regards to our renal cell carcinoma data that we re looking forward to presenting keynote 426 at asco gu we re also excited about triple negative breast cancer we presented our data now for keynote 048 for head and neck cancer with first line chemo combination gastric cancer and others so we re very excited about our current indications and expanding those around the world as well as the significant amount of data readouts that are going to be coming in the future that we think will provide very significant growth not only this year but in the long run teri loxam senior vice president investor relations and global communications great thanks for the questions seamus darla we ll move on to the next one please operator it s from the line of steve scala with cowen steve scala cowen and company analyst thank you a couple of questions ken i was interested in your comment that merck has one of the most broad pipelines in the past two decades i mean this is quite a statement given merck s rich research history what are we missing externally that merck sees internally and will june 20th be the opportunity for us to learn a lot more about the pipeline and secondly merck s pneumococcal vaccine i believe received breakthrough designation in children but not adults is this an issue of timing or did fda deliberately not grant the 15 valid product breakthrough in adults thank you ken frazier chairman and chief executive officer thank you for your questions steve i continue to believe that merck s longer term revenue growth prospects are underappreciated in large part because people don t see the pipeline the way we do so let me try to answer your question so we see tremendous future growth not only in keytruda and lenvima but we have behind it a formidable internal pipeline of assets in oncology over 20 unique mechanisms in the vaccine world we think the gardasil opportunity is really significant going forward but behind that are opportunities in next generation pneumococcal rsv cmv dengue and other areas are the ones that we look forward to as we also look beyond that we just announced positive phase 3 data for zerbaxa our antibiotic for hospital acquired and ventilator acquired pneumonia which we believe could be a very sizable opportunity to go with our leading portfolio of hospital the which we acquired a couple of years ago is now being studied in phase 3 in chronic and in our bio collaboration is just another example of that not to mention great novel assets in hiv and neuroscience so to answer your question i actually look forward to the june opportunity for us to talk about what it is that we see in our pipeline i will say that we are genuinely excited we see the opportunities for us to invest in across a broad area and again we look forward to speaking to you in more detail on june 20 roger perlmutter president right and with this is roger with respect to the breakthrough designation yes we did receive breakthrough designation in pediatrics for the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and the reason was because of the very meaningful clinical data that we obtained demonstrating the balance response across all 15 stereotypes represented in that vaccine we have very strong data in the adult segment as well and it s really a matter of timing with respect to how we interact with the agency just to remind you breakthrough designation provides a mechanism whereby you can have more frequent consultation interaction with the agency on late stage trials and keep in mind that is already in eight phase 3 studies that we ll be reading out this year and next year so there s already a very substantial head of steam on this program teri loxam senior vice president investor relations and global communications great thank you we ll move on to the next question please darla operator it s from andrew baum with citi andrew baum citi analyst many thanks couple of questions please some of the industry lobby has championed net pricing given the announcement last night it s a fine content could you talk to the merck assessment of the proposal particularly problems to go through how you see the risk as well as the potential public service and the spillover in terms of the commercial book of business when and then secondly to roger i know that you recently initiated a trial of olaparib in tissue agnostic setting with hrr mutated treatments who are resistant to refractory standard treatment the question is no 1 is that trial findable given the advanced nature of the patients and no 2 the size of that patient population depending on what biomarker you use could be very substantial could you talk to how large that population may be in a percentage of addressable relapse refractory patients many thanks ken frazier chairman and chief executive officer thank you andrew let me start with your first question about the hhs rebate proposal let me start by saying we share the administration s goal of lowering out of pocket costs for patients that s critical for patients it s critical for our business as you know unfortunately the current pharmaceutical supply chain includes various misaligned incentives that serve to support middlemen while often neglecting patients we are evaluating the specific proposal released by the administration late yesterday and we are hopeful that it will achieve the shared goal of ensuring patients have affordable access to innovative medicines roger perlmutter president and andrew i think you were asking a question i m having a little bit of trouble hearing you here but you re asking a question about a study which was a tissue agnostic study and again this is part of the broader rollout of our analysis because what we found with as i think everyone recognizes is that the rate of activity of is greater than we expected first of all any dna repair a variety of dna repair defects defects in homologous recombination seem to sensitize cells through but even in cell types in which those defects are not recognizable there s evidence accumulating evidence that we re seeing clinical responses so we re beginning to think of of having much broader activity and that s particularly the case when we look at in combination with keytruda and other agents so you can expect to see broader studies of in a variety of different settings both outside of the hormone responsive tumors and as well in combination with other agents i hope that helps teri loxam senior vice president investor relations and global communications great thanks andrew we ll move on to the next question please darla operator your next question is from chris schott from jpmorgan chris schott j p morgan analyst great thanks very much for the questions i guess my first question was just on longer term margin expansion and just expenses in general i guess so when you think about the low to mid single digit opex growth in 2019 is that a reasonable growth rate to think about on a go forward basis for merck or should we think about spending starting to moderate as we look out to 2020 and beyond i know in general there s been a lot of discussion around kind of the magnitude of operating margin expansion so is there any color on that front would be helpful and my second question was just focusing a little bit more on the launch dynamics in first line lung specifically in the us i guess can you just give us a sense of where we are at this point in terms of share of new starts and are there any additional areas for growth within the lung market and i guess where you must focus on from a commercial standpoint as we think about just that indication playing through in the u s thanks very much teri loxam senior vice president investor relations and global communications thanks chris so we ll start with rob rob davis chief financial officer thanks chris and to your question on long term margin expansion so as i said in the prepared remarks we continue to believe we will see meaningful margin expansion operating margin expansion as we go forward but as we ve been talking about given the fact that we have such a wealth of opportunity right now in r d you start with keytruda and look at just what this drug could be and how unprecedented it is we want to make sure we re investing fully behind that as well as with and lenvima those programs are now in full swing not to mention our vaccines program so as we ve indicated we do think you re going to see sales growth continue and with that you re going to see r d grow in the near term faster than sales over the next couple of years as we really get to the bollust of that with r d slowing down to a rate slower than sales thereafter and sg a will continue to be managed very tightly it s nice to see frankly that even despite the fact that we re making meaningful investments in r d in 2019 we re actually going to see operating margin expansion in 19 so that actually is really i think a result of what we ve done from disciplined expense management across the organization to make sure we can put back all of our resources into the important programs in r d but as we ve talked about we do have the long term margin expansion it will be driven mainly by operating expense moderating versus sales we do continue to believe sg a will be managed very tightly and then you ll see r d slow down after we get out of the next couple of years so that s really what will drive it teri loxam senior vice president investor relations and global communications great thanks rob frank we ll have you comment on the first line lung market frank clyburn new chief commercial officer chris we are seeing significant share of newly diagnosed first line non squamous non small cell lung cancer patients that do not have an abnormal egf or igene based off of keynote 189 we ve seen that penetration very rapidly in the majority of the segments in the non squamous non small cell lung cancer setting we do have room for further penetration in particular in the pd l1 patient population in the u s and that s where the team is focused and also we are seeing very rapid uptake with our keynote 407 approval at the end of october and we re penetrating the squamous cell carcinoma patient also very significantly so i think in the u s i would say it s really in the pd l1 negative population where there s opportunity for further growth in the non squamous patients i would highlight outside the u s and just to reiterate that we re very early on in the launch outside the u s in lung cancer in fact most of our growth outside the u s is primarily being driven off of the pd l1 high express patient population in keynote 024 so we re just rolling out our chemo combinations around the world and anticipate significant growth outside the u s in lung teri loxam senior vice president investor relations and global communications great thanks for your questions chris we ll move on to the next caller please operator it s from david risinger with morgan stanley david risinger morgan stanley analyst so i just wanted to go back to the margin opportunities beyond 2019 it seems like merck is increasingly becoming more of a specialty focused company and to that end many specialty biopharma companies can generate higher margins simply because they don t need primary care infrastructure and the other costs associated with a much broader portfolio and so could you discuss opportunities to further streamline merck s cost structure in future years as you continue to pivot the company and then second with respect to the data on february 16 the abstracts are coming out on monday the 11 at 5 p m so will we see the key data in the abstract release or will we really have to wait for the data on the 16th ken frazier chairman and chief executive officer all right dave thanks for the question maybe i ll take the first part and then roger can take the second part so as you look at the profile of the business given the mix of our portfolio you are correct that as we go forward we continue to believe that there is an opportunity to shift as we move to the more specialty focused business to continue to optimize the resources we have on primary care i think the important point though is this isn t a new thing for us in fact when we pointed this out in the past we ve actually been able to grow on an eps basis through the years even when we didn t have sales growth at the same time we were standing up an oncology franchise from scratch and investing meaningfully into r d and so we did that because we have already started really harvesting some of the primary care resources we have in the marketplace primarily through selling forces we ve been reducing selling forces over the last several years to be able to do that and there s opportunity for us to continue to do that going forward that s why we do believe that we haven t we re going to continue to see sg a get better as a percentage of sales despite the fact that we re already at an industry best in class position with the fact that we still have the primary care resources in place although less than they used to be so that is an opportunity that s out there and we re going to be driving it over the next couple of years as we move forward so that is something you should look for as we go forward i think the thing that s important to know is while we re getting the favorable impact from mix obviously given the strong volume growth and margin you get from positive mix we do have the headwinds at the gross margin line that we ve talked about that s going to cause gross margin to be roughly flat so the operating margin expansion we re going to see will come from that sg a leveraging we re talking about as well as the r d i mentioned earlier teri loxam senior vice president investor relations and global communications and roger you want to comment on roger perlmutter president right and david you re referring at february 16 to the renal cell carcinoma data from keynote 426 of course on february 16 is also the pdufa date for the 054 study in adjuvant melanoma but i think you re referring to the 426 data and the complete data of course will be presented then there will be an abstract that appears before hand the abstract has some data and depending on what you view as key there s some material in it we re eager to gain publication also of the complete analysis just as soon as we can so there will be various different parts of the data coming out but the main presentation on the 16th is the part that i would focus on teri loxam senior vice president investor relations and global communications thanks for your questions dave darla we ll move on to the next caller please operator it s from umer raffat with evercore isi umer raffat evercore isi analyst good morning thanks so much for taking my questions first perhaps roger i feel like there s a trial which hasn t come up very much at all on merck conversations which is your stage 3 lung trial keynote 799 and it s my understanding that it s a first line trial within stage 3 which would potentially position keytruda before the current label for infancy however what i noticed was your slide today calls it a second line trial so i just wanted to clarify that a and b on the pneumococcal vaccine side i know there s a couple of pfizer patents which you guys have prosecuted in the past and now appealing and my question is as it stands currently and let s say the appeal doesn t go favorably do you have the freedom to operate roger perlmutter president ok with respect to keynote 799 just to provide a higher altitude context for this from the very beginning our concern with respect to administering keytruda in the setting of radiotherapy has been pneumonitis and we know that from a variety of different studies previously that we had come to associate proximity of radiotherapy with keytruda administration with more inflammation in the lungs so 799 has a safety an important safety component which is the administration of keytruda in combination with chemotherapy plus radiotherapy in different cohorts for the question of whether or not pneumonitis feeds 10 because that s really an important issue these are patients the actual study population is a population that has undergone resection but is not widely disseminated sorry let me get this right the actual population is a population of individuals who have lung cancer that is radio responsive potentially radio responsive and who can receive that in a first line environment because they won t receive prior systemic chemotherapy if that was your question ken frazier chairman and chief executive officer and to your question with respect to v114 let me say that we continue to believe that we will have freedom to operate in that space and recently the ipr ruling from the ppav was in our favor on a number of the patents that we have challenged so we ll see what goes on as we move forward teri loxam senior vice president investor relations and global communications great we ll move on to the next question please operator it s from tim anderson with wolfe research tim anderson wolfe research analyst thank you a couple of questions going back to the very first line of questioning on your pipeline and the perception by investors that at least late stage tends to run on the thin side here you and bristol potentially share a common thread which is all the heavy spending in io has may be crowded out other r d programs so the question i have in this context is something that we asked you maybe about a year ago when is r d spending on keytruda going to peak about a year ago you suggested that wasn t very far off qualitatively but it was never quite clear to me what that meant i know with all the combination programs maybe it doesn t peak anytime soon so that s the first question second question is just on your triple negative breast adjutant trial update on timing of seeing those results and how would you characterize the riskiness of that trial in terms of achieving a positive readout would you say it s low or medium or high risk teri loxam senior vice president investor relations and global communications let s start with rob to talk about the cost first rob davis chief financial officer yes yes good morning tim with r d so if you look at what s driving the bulk of our clinical spend right now it is still keytruda but it s actually now more combination studies than it is monotherapy studies a lot of the monotherapy clinical studies are already starting to peak and come off so really right now what s driving it is the combination studies and then in addition to that importantly the investments in and lenvima will be peaking over the next couple of years too so if you look at total r d it is being driven by those and then obviously our vaccines programs are contributing as well so those are the main group categories and we do think though the bolust of keytruda for latest studies and the broader lenvima studies will peak in the next couple of years so when we ve been talking about that threshold happening it s really those programs that are driving that change where we do think you ll see r d slow down as we move forward obviously though the good news from a long term perspective is roger keeps turning over new positive things so we always have to moderate as we have opportunity to invest but the good news is we have a great pipeline we re investing behind it and we re going to invest you should see a peak in the next couple of years teri loxam senior vice president investor relations and global communications great and roger do you want to address the second question roger perlmutter president right i believe tim that you re referring to the keynote 522 study which is a neo adjuvant study and we did have the opportunity to see early data from the 522 study we had the chance to share those data with the agency and we and they agree that it is important to get additional data with a longer term follow up so that s what we re waiting for for those for that study and once we have those data available we ll have a chance to look at it more carefully and then of course share it with you teri loxam senior vice president investor relations and global communications great thanks for your questions tim we ll move on to the next question operator it s from vamil divan with credit suisse vamil divan credit suisse analyst so one i appreciate the color you gave on the lung cancer side and the commercial uptake there i m just trying to understand the adjuvant melanoma and also the front line renal indications as we need to see the full data on the labels was there anything specific or unique with those two indications that may make the uptake faster or slower than what we ve seen so far in lung cancer and then the second one just going back to the topic of drug pricing if you can just share just what you re assuming in terms of net pricing growth in the u s in 2019 for your guidance and also sort of related to that question in terms of keytruda if you can just sort of share your net pricing assumptions of u s europe and also china would be very helpful teri loxam senior vice president investor relations and global communications so let s start with frank on the adjuvant melanoma rcc and maybe you can just call it broadly on pricing for keytruda before we turn it over to rob for the other part of the question frank clyburn new chief commercial officer well adjuvant melanoma we re actually just starting and got approval in europe for adjuvant melanoma we do think this is a good opportunity for us we have established a very strong foothold in metastatic melanoma so we think this is a good opportunity to expand into adjuvant melanoma as roger mentioned we re waiting on our pdufa date for adjuvant melanoma in the u s and we think we will be competitive there as well with regards to rcc we re excited about the opportunity the study was done across all risk groups and we re looking forward to sharing the data in the next several weeks but we think that this will be a very important opportunity in rcc upon approval as far as keytruda goes with regards to pricing we don t give out specific guidance from a pricing perspective but in the ex u s markets we re seeing very strong reimbursement for keytruda based on a very strong value proposition that we have and we feel as though we re positioned very well from a reimbursement perspective outside the u s and then in the u s we also feel as though we re positioned very well with regards to reimbursement especially because keytruda is reimbursed in part b currently rob davis chief financial officer good morning vamil to your question on the guidance while our guidance range does assume multiple scenarios we don t require any additional pricing in the united states to meet our guidance range teri loxam senior vice president investor relations and global communications right and we re going to try to squeeze in a few more questions i know it s close to the top of the hour next question please carla operator it s from jason gerberry with bank of america jason gerberry bank of america merrill lynch analyst good morning and thanks for taking my question maybe just frank just a follow up on a couple of vamil s questions so in adjuvant melanoma just curious in lung you enjoy a first mover advantage in adjuvant melanoma bristol already has roughly 70 share so just kind of curious how you think you can make inroads if you think the first mover advantage is really that important or if you think you can actually capture share and then my second question just on frontline renal in the u s and may be that you re drawing from your experience that other tumor settings are payers mandating that you they ll only reimburse the specific studied combinations and the reason i ask is i m wondering if there s an advantage at all in terms of how these different tki combinations will be used will physicians ultimately migrate to using different tkis which they re more familiar with and more commonly used or if there s going to be a winner takes all with potentially the study that gets there first with tki thanks frank clyburn new chief commercial officer yes so in all things being equal you would like to be first in most of the indications however we have experienced in several cancer types where we were not first so i ll point you to bladder where we actually launched fifth in the u s and we now have the leading market share in bladder cancer and really it was because of the strong data with keynote 045 and the overall survival benefits so really the oncologists are going to look first and foremost to the data and we feel as though keynote 054 is a very strong data set and we feel as though will be competitive the other thing i would also say is that in the community especially in the u s because of the breadth of our program and because of the use in lung cancer in head and neck and now in gastric and other cancer types we feel as though the community s very familiar with using keytruda they re giving us very strong feedback on the profile of keytruda and we think that s going to help us not only in adjuvant mel but also being second in renal cell carcinoma and then the last one i mentioned on renal cell carcinoma is when we share the data in the next several weeks we feel as though as roger has highlighted with top line having overall survival benefit progression free survival benefit and strong response rate so usually the oncologists will make a choice based on the data they see and we re looking forward to upon approval competing in rcc teri loxam senior vice president investor relations and global communications great let s move on to the next question please operator it s from alex arfaei with bmo capital markets alex arfaei bmo capital markets analyst great thank you and roger could you please provide your thoughts or comments on keytruda lifecycle planning obviously after upcoming loe you ll be more dependent on keytruda i realize we re a few years away but given your valuation on potential size of this product it does become an important investment consideration and then for frank could you please provide your estimates of keytruda sales by indication in both u s and ex u s roger perlmutter president so the first question about keytruda so obviously keytruda has been a winning franchise obviously for us and an important growth driver across all the opportunities that we have both as monotherapy as well as combination but we continue to stress the fact that as we look at we don t see ourselves as just a keytruda story so i ve emphasized before the other pillars of growth including and lenvima in oncology what comes after that are 20 unique mechanisms the vaccines programs that we have compound we continue to think that even when we see an important drug like januvia go off patent that merck will have multiple sources of growth going forward and then of course it s really important to recognize that in addition to our internal pipeline we re continuing to seek to augment that pipeline with value creating innovative external assets in business development so we feel very confident about our ability to drive sustained revenue growth going forward recognizing that a major patent expiration is coming teri loxam senior vice president investor relations and global communications great we will turn it over to frank next frank clyburn new chief commercial officer in the u s and this is very directional data due to the claims data lagging several months behind but approximately 65 to 70 of our users non small cell lung cancer melanoma represents about 10 head and neck is approximately 5 bladder approximately 5 and then we also are seeing good growth in the msi high agnostic indication that represents about 5 of our business and then the all other category or other indications represents about 10 outside the u s it s really hard to get specific breakdowns but the majority of our use right now is in lung cancer teri loxam senior vice president investor relations and global communications great thanks frank so to get to our last question operator it s from geoff meachami with barclays geoff meachami barclays analyst good morning guys thanks for the question frank i want to get a bit more detail about the ous dynamics for keytruda in lung you guys saw good trends in 4q but i wasn t sure if we re already at an inflection point based on the cadence of reimbursement maybe just be helpful to go through how you see the pace of share gains in europe in lung over the balance of the year and then roger at a higher level how are you guys thinking about the balance of therapeutic areas in the pipeline i mean obviously you want to press your advantage in oncology but is expanding other existing categories a strategic priority or is there a capacity for a new therapeutic category thank you teri loxam senior vice president investor relations and global communications let s start with frank frank clyburn new chief commercial officer sure so in europe i ll give an example so right now we have reimbursement in most of the european union for keynote 024 and that s where you re seeing a lot of the growth on our monotherapy indication with 189 we have reimbursement in germany austria netherlands and a couple of other markets but we re very early on in getting an uptake for 189 broadly in europe and i anticipate that will come throughout the year very similar ramp to what we saw back when we launched keynote 024 so think of that the timing you should be thinking about for that ramp in addition to that as mentioned japan we think is a very significant opportunity now with not only the approval of 189 but 407 and also keynote 42 so we think japan provides a very good opportunity outside of the u s and then as mentioned we re in the very early stages in china with just our first launch in second line melanoma so we see also outside the us significant opportunities for growth there roger perlmutter president yeah and this is roger if i might i d say also today the phmp announced that they adopted a positive opinion with respect to 407 in europe so with that of course reimbursement will be required in most markets and will take some time but it s going to advance that still further in terms of the balance of therapeutic areas geoff our interests certainly my interest is in having the greatest possible impact on improving and extending human life wherever we see that and so we re not going to be down to any particular therapeutic area if you look at the kinds of things that we re doing look at the work that s taking place in hiv right now mk 8591 is an extraordinary molecule the phase 2 data in combination with we hope we will have an opportunity to present those data probably sometime around the middle of the year and this is really a remarkable compound in terms of its potency the durability of the treatment effect and it changes the landscape in a lot of ways in terms of how you think about hiv treatment that s a therapeutic area which doesn t get enormous amount of attention externally but which we re putting a lot of effort into just as we re putting a lot of effort into other areas so there s a lot of work going so ken frazier chairman and chief executive officer so let me close by thanking you for joining us we had a strong 2018 we re confident going forward in our execution and our pipeline and our future we believe that we re well positioned to drive sustained revenue growth and we also expect meaningful operating margin expansion over time and that s largely the result of a differentiated pipeline that we believe will actually position merck well going forward so thank you teri loxam senior vice president investor relations and global communications that concludes our call thank you darla thanks everyone operator duration 62 minutes call participants teri loxam senior vice president investor relations and

in recent years there has been a rejection by the venezuela bureaucracy against any form of genuine grassroots organisation thus democratising policies under chavez have been rolled back mohamed elmaazi details the steps that have led to ordinary venezuelans being caught between a rock and a hard place on 28 january us president donald trump announced further sanctions targeting the venezuelan state owned energy company pdvsa oil represents the main source of external revenue for the country and at least 30 per cent of its gdp five days previously opposition leader juan guaidó appointed himself interim president the ap revealed that this was pre arranged following secret talks with trump officials journalists from consortium news an independent investigative and political review journal have also revealed that dc elites have been grooming the far right figure who has repeatedly called on the military to overthrow nicolás maduro s democratically elected government sanction them trump s executive order adds to the already crippling us sanctions targeting the country whose economy has been increasingly under pressure since the collapse in oil prices in 2012 hundreds of thousands of people have emigrated canada the uk and right wing allied governments have all come out in support of us regime change efforts in venezuela the uk government is refusing to return 14 tonnes of venezuelan gold russia blasted the move as cynical and unlawful china said it opposes unilateral sanctions solidarity protests demos and actions against the unfolding coup attempt are occurring on a daily basis in countries around the world major trade unions in the uk and worldwide have denounced these policies ignore their elections many governments in the west are demanding that president maduro immediately triggers a new presidential election this is patently absurd given that he was only sworn in on 10 january following early elections the reason for them being called early was due to pressure from the us controlled organization of american states and the right wing opposition the same opposition that ended up boycotting them former us president jimmy carter referred to venezuela s electoral system as the best in the world and forbes called them a model for the world hardly left wing renegades destroy them the point of these sanctions is to prevent venezuela from recovering and to destroy what s left of its economy according to michel weisbrot economist at the centre for economic policy and research cepr this following graph shows the clear impact previous us sanctions have had on venezuela s oil production since august 2017 weisbrot says the sanctions do actually kill people loss of oil revenue means a loss of dollar revenue which means less live saving medicines available this point was echoed by a former un expert oil venezuela is reported to have the world s largest proven oil reserves trump s national security advisor john bolton told the press on 28 january that we expect that today s measure totals 7 billion in assets blocked today plus over 11 billion in lost export proceeds over the next year bolton a fierce advocate of the 2003 invasion and destruction of iraq another oil rich state called on the military to accept the peaceful democratic and constitutional transfer of power juan guaidó has already started drafting plans to privatise the oil industry and open it up to multinational exploitation no wonder he was immediately anointed by the us an ap report revealed that this event was arranged last year following secret talks with trump officials the early years jorge martin secretary of hands off venezuela has visited venezuela every year for nearly 20 years since the us backed military coup in 2002 which temporarily removed then president hugo chavez from power in 2002 chavez opponents initiated a devastating oil strike as part of a plan to destabilise and overthrow the government according to martin the the whole of the economy was in private hands when chavez was first elected in 1998 he nationalised many industries including steel cement telecoms electricity oil and auxiliary companies and expropriated landed estates half truths exaggerations and outright lies martin told me that in his experience everything you hear are mostly half truths exaggerations and outright lies though there is a very serious economic recession in venezuela which has destroyed over 50 of gdp in the last four or five years this has seen a massive collapse in living standards including a catastrophic drop in the purchasing power of wages this has also resulted in mass migration of hundreds of thousands first it was mainly from the middle and upper class layers more recently also from the working class the former emigrating to the us and europe the latter to other latin american countries overland that the situation has been exaggerated and distorted for many years appears to be confirmed by the un and other independent analysts a 2017 un report on nutrition and food insecurity in latin american countries highlighted a regional increase in food insecurity it recognised that venezuela added 1 3million newly food insecure people to the total but the percentage of the population experiencing undernourishment was still lower than other countries including bolivia guatemala haiti honduras and brazil though the press curiously don t seem as interested in those countries perhaps because they all have regimes more compliant or controlled by western capital the press have also been widely reporting that 93 of the population lack enough money for food 73 of the population averaging a loss of 19 pounds in weight those statistics have been repeated ad nasuem for a number of years now despite originating from a report labelled as incomplete and contradictory by the cepr indeed according to the cepr the very same report later says that 67 5 percent of the population eats three meals a day and only 25 feel deficient in their nutrition meanwhile the un fao report has essentially been ignored for years race and class most of the opposition to maduro is right wing and based on the middle class and upper class layers martin explained and they tend to be more white and of european descent guaidó is no exception meanwhile those who support the revolution come from working class and poor and tend to be more mixed race black and of descent left chavista constituent assembly right national assembly opposition bloc notice a difference pic twitter com m55viuxv2h hᴜıƶᴀʀ huizartony august 4 2017 the bolivarian revolution high oil prices were used to fund social programmes free healthcare was established and 2 5 million houses have been built for people in need in just four years labour laws were strengthened including rules to prevent mass lay offs poverty and extreme poverty were cut by half local direct democracy was promoted and encouraged but the economic situation is undermining many of these gains martin told me before his death chavez talked about a socialist economy and a communal state martin told me revolution interrupted but it wasn t to be in more recent years there has been a push back by the bureaucracy in the state against any form of genuine grassroots organisation for example in the field of agrarian reform there is a clear concerted effort on the part of former and new landowners in an alliance with sections of the state apparatus and the judiciary to return the land to the landowners and evict the peasant communities from it many of which had had land titles granted under chavez social democracy and its discontents the slowdown or even reversal of revolutionary policies under maduro are not responsible for the economic crisis no one could have avoided that martin told me the collapse of oil prices triggered the crisis he said and the international sanctions and isolation and hoarding of food and goods by both capitalists and state linked entities perpetuate it but certainly a democratically planned state owned economy would have been in a much better situation to withstand the blow stop calling this socialism a big part of calling venezuela socialist by the mainstream press is designed to delegitimise the word and concept especially at a time of increased appeal but it is crucial to distinguish keynesianism or social democracy from socialism michael roberts pseudonym a marxist financial analyst who has worked for 30 years in the city of london told me it s not socialist by a marxist definition socialism in the proper sense of a super abundant society with no classes and free time for all is only possible on a world scale and only after decades of transition roberts also explained that what has failed in venezuela is not socialism common ownership of the means of production and a democratic plan but rather the attempt to regulate and control capitalism a form of keynesianism if you want this point was also made by martin in a prescient 2016 article in which he warned of the very real threat of a foreign backed coup d etat and emphasised that attempts to regulate capitalism were failing his prescription was to move forward with the bolivarian revolution and further democratise the economy imperialism must be opposed regardless of martin s criticisms he says the overthrow of this government at the hands of imperialism would be an unmitigated disaster for the workers and the poor there would be wholesale privatisation of state property return of the land to the former owners mass layoffs in the public sector the abolition of all social programmes of the revolution this aggression must be opposed staunchly not only by socialists but by any consistent anti imperialists and

year outlook as always we ll leave time for your questions on the end with that i will turn the call over to chairman and ceo darius adamczyk darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer thank you mark and good morning everyone let s begin on slide two we re extremely pleased with our results in 2018 made progress both from a portfolio and financial perspective continued smart investments in our businesses and our people and took steps to position the company for next 20 years this quarter we successfully completed our second spin off of the year resideo technologies launching our new stock exchange in october we also continue to advance our software spread toward growing our core businesses in attractive end markets and most importantly consistent with what we ve done all year honeywell delivered on its commitments to our shareowners we met or exceeded our financial commitments on all metrics delivering adjusted earnings per share of 1 91 in the fourth quarter driven by 6 organic sales growth and 80 basis points of segment margin expansion we continue to see strength in our long cycle businesses most notably in commercial aerospace defense and warehouse automation where intelligrated business is a global leader furthermore we are aggressively planning and mitigating the impacts of the tariffs dispute in all of our businesses as evidenced by the strong margin expansion we generated this quarter based on what we know of today we do not expect any material impact to our results in 2019 related to tariffs for the full year we achieved 100 free cash flow conversion and a 105 conversion in the fourth quarter we generated over 6 billion of free cash flow for the year excluding spin cost payments up 22 even after spinning nearly 20 of the company in the fourth quarter this was principally driven by profitable growth higher net income and continued efforts to free up working capital all the while funding smart growth investments to 800 million of capex our free cash flow as a percent of sales is the highest it s been in at least 15 years and we expect to continue to grow from here importantly our us pension is funded over 105 and we do not expect any cash contributions in near term the financial health of this company heading into 2019 is as strong as it s ever been and we still have ample resources to deploy lastly we continued a steady cadence of capital deployment of an additional 1 7 billion of honeywell share repurchases in the quarter bringing the full year total to approximately 4 billion as a result and now expect the fully diluted share count to be down at least 3 in 2019 based on our plan to reduce share count by at least 1 from 2018 as we continue to return cash to our shareowners through 2 3 billion in dividends following another double digit dividend increase in 2018 this was a particularly good year for honeywell we have a simpler more focused portfolio after dispense and continue to execute on our initiatives as we look to the future we see strength across several end markets and have significant balance sheet capacity deployed and while we are not planning for recession in 2019 we are taking steps now to ensure we deliver on our commitments in uncertain economic environment let s turn to slide three to review some of the progress from last year as i mentioned we took significant steps through 2018 to transform the business one of my key priorities from the outset was to accelerate organic growth as you ve seen by our results we re making good progress on this front we are encouraged by the fact that nearly 60 of the portfolio grew sales 5 or more organically for the full year of 2018 with several businesses growing above 10 if the spin offs complete we now operate a more focused portfolio in a smaller number of attractive end markets portfolio optimization is central to and will continue to be part of honeywell s operating system we plan to continue to effectively deploying capital by funding high return capex and returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases we have had nine consecutive double digit dividend increases since 2010 and still have a strong and flexible balance sheet with the ability to deploy over 14 billion of cash to m a capex dividends and share repurchases the combination of strong sales growth favorable end market exposure and significant balance sheet capacity positions us well as we head into 2019 we are now on slide four as i mentioned continuous transformation is part of honeywell s operating system on this slide we highlight three key transformation initiatives to establish honeywell as a premier technology company for the future earlier this year we established honeywell connected enterprise or hce which is a strengthened and centralized organization that will serve as a software innovation engine for all of honeywell hce operates with speed and agility of a start up working close to our businesses and our customers across the entire portfolio to build the world s best software solutions rapidly and efficiently on a single platform our transformation to a premier technology company require us to look beyond just spin offs our chief supply chain officer torsten pilz is leading honeywell s efforts to improve our supply chain and optimize our global footprint you see a lot of opportunity here to drive margin expansion and operational efficiency and you ll hear much more about this from torsten at our annual investor conference in may we are making similar enhancements on our capabilities internally with honeywell s digital initiative this requires people process data and technology elements to come together which will offer more effective and efficient decision making throughout honeywell this effort includes a continuation of our progress to centralize erp systems thus far we have eliminated 35 unique systems in 2018 going from 106 to 71 and we are on path to just 10 erp applications by the end of 2020 the result will be consistent processes and centralized data governance of a common it foundation as you can see we have achieved a lot this year and continue to redefine the limits and where honeywell can achieve to be the best position multi industrial company for the future let s turn to slide five to briefly review progress against our key priorities i laid out my key priorities for the company in 2017 since then we ve continued to foster a cultural win honeywell of doing what we say however as we called the say do ratio as you stack the results against our long term commitments you can see we re clearly making progress and in some instances achieving milestones sooner than we thought such as of our organic sales growth and free cash flow conversion we re accomplishing these objectives while making smart investments for future through capex restructuring and research and development our software businesses grew in the mid teens range last year on a path to the 20 long term compound annual growth rate we anticipate we have taken steps to unify and strengthen our software strategy through the honeywell connected enterprise and continue to invest in software development sales and marketing capabilities and build out of the sentience platform in 2018 honeywell ventures made five investments including in soft robotics a developer of automation solutions and soft robotic gripping systems that can grasp and manipulate items the same dexterity of the human hand and in iotium a managed secure network infrastructure platform for an industrial internet of things that primarily serves building technologies and industrial customers we also completed 2 bolt on acquisitions totaling roughly 500 million ortloff engineers is a privately held licensor and industry leading developer of specialized technologies to drive high returns in natural gas processing and sulphur recovery this complements our existing uop offering which allows us to better meet customer needs for high recovery non gas liquids extraction plants globally transnorm now part of safety and productivity solutions is a global leader in high performance conveyor solutions that are used in diverse end markets such as parcel delivery e commerce fulfillment and airports the acquisition strengthens honeywell s warehouse automation portfolio and positions the company to support the growing european e commerce market while broadening honeywell s connected distribution center and aftermarket offerings i ll stop there and turn the call over to greg who will discuss our fourth quarter results and 2019 outlook in more detail gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks darius and good morning everyone let me begin on slide six as darius mentioned we finished 2018 very strong in every financial metric organic sales growth for the fourth quarter was 6 we have been at or above 5 every quarter this year this reflects our continued commitment to customer excellence new product development as well as our realization of benefits from the investments we ve made in our sales organization and new product development process we generated approximately 2 billion of segment profit in the fourth quarter driven principally by higher sales volumes with segment margin expansion of 80 basis points the impact in the spin offs of lower margin businesses net of acquisitions contributed 30 basis points while the core business generated 50 basis points expansion pricing and productivity was strong which enabled us to effectively mitigate the impact of material and labor inflation we also saw continued benefits from previously funded restructuring adjusted eps was 1 91 up 12 versus prior year excluding the spins which exceeded the high end of our guidance range by 0 01 the adjusted eps figure excludes both the impact of an approximate 435 million favorable adjustment to the 4q 17 tax charge and 104 million in spin related separation costs at the outlook call in 2018 we estimated a separation cost for the 2 transactions would be in the range of 800 million to 1 2 billion i m very pleased to report that the total separation cost for both spins came in lower than this estimate at 730 million which demonstrates our ability to effectively execute complex transactions both ahead of schedule and below budget we also recorded 300 million in repositioning charges in the quarter to fund future productivity and stranded cost reductions share buybacks totaled 4 billion in 2018 and drove a 0 06 benefit from lower share count in the quarter you can find a bridge to the fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share in the appendix of this presentation finally working capital improved 0 6 turns year over year our businesses are all focused on improving working capital and we continue to see progress on our initiatives with room to free up more cash for capital deployment now on to slide seven and review our segment results our aerospace business continue to perform extremely well in a robust demand environment capping off a strong year of near double digit organic sales growth in the fourth quarter we generated 17 organic growth in defense and space with double digit growth in both the us and international businesses led by global demand for sensors and guidance systems original equipment shipment volumes and higher spares volumes on us department of defense programs we also saw growth in our space business driven by new satellite program wins and commercial helicopters driven by repair and overhaul demand in commercial oe sales were up 8 organically with increased hts engine demand for gulfstream and textron longitude platforms and higher aviation ship set volumes driven primarily by the certification of the gulfstream g600 aftermarket growth was strong in all businesses including defense driven by increased demand for avionics upgrades both software and hardware navigation products and safety mandates our connected aircraft offerings continue to gain traction driven by godirect cabin tail capture and robust jetwave demand turning to honeywell building technologies organic sales growth was 1 driven by continued demand for commercial fire products in north america europe and our high growth regions building solutions projects growth was also strong particularly for international airports the hps projects backlog is up 15 setting up a strong 2019 as we continue to expand in critical infrastructure markets like airports cities and stadiums these gains were offset by declines in our china air and water business and temporary supply chain challenges within our building management systems business we expect the air and water business to recover in 2019 driven by new product introductions for the mid segment and stronger demand as inventory net levels normalize after a challenging 2018 in december the supply chain issues within building management systems began to stabilize and we expect continued improvement in the first half of 2019 hbt also benefited from one month of single digit organic sales growth from the former homes business driven by strength in both products and adi global distribution as a reminder the results for hbt exclude homes and distribution after october in performance materials and technologies sales were flat on an organic basis sales in uop were up 2 driven by ongoing strength in licensing and engineering sales but were offset by an expected decline in gas processing which was driven by an extremely strong fourth quarter in 2017 process solutions sales were up 1 organically driven primarily by a strong demand in our software maintenance and migration services and field devices this was offset by declines in large project activity and in smart energy and thermal solutions both shorter cycle businesses due to supply chain challenges notably we continue to see solid trends within the automation businesses and process solutions with total orders up double digits and short cycle backlog up over 30 suggesting that oil price volatility in the fourth quarter may have temporarily delayed customer investment decisions advanced materials sales were down 3 on an organic basis as continued strong demand and adoption of our solstice line of low global warming refrigerants which was up 5 was offset by declines in specialty products particularly in our electronic materials business which is in the semiconductor space as you know and tough comps associated to the fourth quarter of 2017 pmt segment margins expanded 200 basis points in the fourth quarter as expected driven by the timing of catalyst shipments within uop commercial excellence and the benefits from previously funded repositioning now turning to the safety and productivity solutions business that continued to perform at a high level with organic sales up 15 driven by broad based strength across all lines of business double digit organic growth in intelligrated continued as orders from major systems and robust backlog conversion fueled by e commerce drove strong results we also saw double digit growth in our sensing business and continued strength in our productivity products business driven by demand for android based mobility offerings and handheld printing devices in total organic growth in our productivity solutions segment was up 23 moving to safety the safety business sales grew 5 organically led by ongoing demand for gas products and strong growth in retail footwear associated with the holiday season finally we continue to see strength in our businesses across high growth regions in china sps grew double digits with robust growth across industrial safety productivity products and siot excluding the ongoing softness in air and water hpt also grew double digits in china for all of honeywell china was up 9 organically for the full year in india our capabilities and strength provided exceptional growth in the fourth quarter greater than 25 over prior year this was driven by our building and process solutions businesses we continue to see positive macroeconomic trends in the middle east which supported growth across all businesses with three segments growing double digits organically compared to the prior quarter now with 2018 in the rearview mirror let s move to slide eight and discuss our 2019 outlook we have a reliable playbook at honeywell and it s not changing for 2019 our focus on smart growth investments breakthrough initiatives and new product development coupled with productivity rigor and the benefits of funded repositioning has positioned as well for continued outperformance for 2019 we anticipate an organic sales growth range of 2 to 5 the low end of which reflects the possibility of some economic slowing but not a recession in 2019 segment margin expansion is expected to be 110 basis points to 140 basis points or 30 basis points to 60 basis points excluding the impact of the spin offs this will drive earnings per share growth of 6 to 10 excluding dilution from the spins in 2018 we expect to generate adjusted free cash flow conversion near 100 consistent with 2018 driven by high quality income growth and continued working capital improvements across the portfolio we re confident in our businesses in the year ahead supported by positive long cycle orders and backlog trends exiting 2018 we have put forth a strong plan with multiple cost levers to pull in the event the recent volatility in the macro environment persists as darius mentioned in his opening we don t expect a significant impact in 2019 related to tariffs we ve worked very hard to mitigate that across the year for 2019 including addressing the potential impact of the still unannounced list 4 which contemplates 25 tariff on all remaining items imported from china we will continue to monitor this throughout the year and react accordingly as we did in 2018 some other items to take note of related to our 2019 plan we are on track to slightly ahead of our plan to eliminate all stranded costs in 2019 related to the spin offs with a little over half the costs remove to date we see the impact of these costs primarily in the net corporate cost line and in the segment margin honeywell building technologies also based on the planned reduction in pension income driven by discount rates and assumed asset returns as well as lower repositioning and other charges driven by the spin indemnity our total net below the line charges are expected to be approximately 80 million in 2019 we will see continued benefits from planned and executed share repurchases our 2019 plan assumes a weighted average share count reduction of about 3 year on year or 730 million shares this is based on the 2 share count reduction we executed from 2018 repurchases and at least 1 additional reduction in 2019 you will find additional details on our 2019 plan inputs in the appendix based on what we can see today we expect to be at the upper end of our sales guidance range for organic growth however given the many uncertainties in the macro signals we re planning cautiously in 2019 overall as it s difficult to predict short cycle revenues particularly in the second half of the year and remember that is still approximately 60 of our business let s turn to page nine we provided a initial assessment of our end markets and anticipated organic growth rates in each for 2019 the green arrows are an indication that we expect market conditions to improve while the gray flat arrows indicate that we expect market conditions to remain relatively similar to last year starting with aerospace we expect organic sales to be up strong mid single digits for the year we continue to see a robust demand environment in both commercial aerospace and defense and in transport we expect continued growth in narrow body production rates we forecast new business jet deliveries to increase 8 to 10 in 2019 supported by several new aircraft models entering into service a decline in young used aircraft inventories and stable used jet prices our long term strategy of securing good positions on the right platforms and building our installed base will serve us well in 2019 particularly with new business jet platforms where we are well positioned from an oe standpoint mid single digit flight hours growth will continue to drive aftermarket demand and we expect further tailwinds from the ads b compliance mandate deadline along with increased demand for connected aircraft solutions across all products the industry dynamics in defense will be positive in the us and internationally driven by budget growth but we are planning conservatively for 2019 given the tough year over year comparisons following 2018 s banner year where we grew 15 organically in the business with the favorable margin rate uplift from the former transportation systems spin you should expect segment margins of approximately 24 for the aero business going forward now on to hbt as a reminder following the spin of our homes portfolio hbt s primary exposure is to non residential construction here we anticipate low single digit organic sales growth after a challenging 2018 driven by better execution in our operations better selling strategies and sales coverage and new product introductions we expect commercial fire will continue to be strong with the expansion of sales coverage and share gain and commercial security to improve with the expansion of our channel partner network the declines we experienced in our china based air and water business should subside through a combination of stronger market demand and new product introductions for the mid segment and mass mid segment globally we see building management solutions growth in both hardware and software driven by high growth regions expansion and our investments in software honeywell building solutions growth will be driven by government investments in smart cities social infrastructure and airport monetization and capacity enhancements particularly in high growth regions we also expect continued adoption of connected building solutions on a global basis you should expect to see margins in the range of about 25 in hbt after the spin off of homes for pmt sales are expected to be up low single digits plus on an organic basis in oil and gas petrochemical market growth should remain steady at about 4 driven by demand for packaging and plastics however given the volatility in oil prices in the second half of 2018 investments in global mega projects slowed and we see the oil price volatility potentially putting some pressure on upstream spending plans in 2019 nevertheless we anticipate similar market dynamics overall to 2018 and the basis for our plan is that oil prices remain in the low to mid 60s per barrel the refining market should continue to be strong as global demand for cleaner transportation fuels remains the us natural gas market which is primarily served by our uop russell business is expected to improve from 2018 uop is expected to deliver a strong year driven by a strong backlog licensing and services growth and improved market demand in gas processing after a tough 2018 process solutions will continue to grow across its short cycle businesses as we saw in 2018 this is supported by short cycle backlog which was up over 30 at the year end finally within advanced materials we expect continued growth from solstice and our fluorine products business and better execution in specialty products lastly in sps sales are expected to be up in the mid single digit range we expect the strong e commerce and warehouse distribution macro trends to continue as our customers seek and implement differentiated warehouse solutions to deal with rising demand our orders in intelligrated in 2018 were up over 30 for the year in the safety business we anticipate growth will be driven by new product introductions within gas detection growth in our core product lines and high risk personal protective equipment and new product launches in general safety in productivity we expect strong growth driven by backlog conversion in intelligrated and our sensing business new mobility product introductions and expanded software offerings we are also seeing growth in our life cycle service offerings in intelligrated which includes maintenance technical support and optimization services that is combined with the aftermarket capabilities we acquired with transnorm now let s move on to slide 10 here you can see the bridge of our 2018 adjusted earnings per share to 2019 the spin impact which we define as the after tax segment profit contribution from the spins in 2018 nine months of transportation systems and 10 months of homes net of the estimated impact of the spin indemnity assuming that it was in place all year for 2018 will be a 0 62 headwind to earnings in 2019 as you can see the majority of our earnings improvement 0 30 to 0 60 per share will again come from operational gains in our businesses driven by profitable growth continued productivity improvements and incremental benefits from previously funded restructuring you can see the remaining impacts from the share count below the line items and tax rate i have already touched on will contribute approximately 0 11 per share now let s move to slide 11 to discuss our first quarter guidance for the first quarter we expect to generate 3 to 5 organic sales growth driven principally by healthy growth in our long cycle businesses with a more cautious tone toward short cycle given the market volatility exiting 2018 with that said we do anticipate that the commercial aftermarket our sensing business and productivity products and commercial fire products will continue to be strong on the short cycle side we expect segment margins will expand 30 basis points to 60 basis points ex the spins consistent with our long term framework and 110 basis points to 140 basis points on a reported basis aided by 80 basis points of margin accretion from the absence of the two spins our expected adjusted earnings per share range of 1 80 to 1 85 represents growth of 6 to 9 expense we have 0 25 of earnings dilution from the spins in the first quarter of 2018 our guide is based on an effective tax rate of 22 and a weighted average share count of 737 million shares for the quarter we feel this will be a very strong start to another successful year for honeywell in 2019 with that i d like to turn the call back to darius who will wrap up on slide 12 darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer thanks greg we accomplished a lot in 2018 and expect great things in 2019 as well we delivered on all our commitments successfully completed spin offs ahead of schedule and under budget while still overdriving on the organic growth margin expansion earnings per share and free cash flow targets that we have established at the end of 2017 there is significant room for continued margin expansion on the path to our long term target of 23 this is aided by over 450 million of repositioned fund in 2018 and in prior years which will drive improvements to our cost structure supply chain and gross margin in 2019 and beyond our balance sheet capacity is strong and this will provide another lever to drive outperformance in any macro environment they are continuing their business transformation through several new initiatives including honeywell digital a unified software business in honeywell connected enterprise and increased focus on our supply chain we are excited about 2019 and expect another great year with that mark let s move on to q a mark macaluso vice president investor relations thanks darius darius and greg are now available to answer your questions if possible please keep your questions to one comment and a quick follow up so we can address all questions marguerite if you could please open up the line for q a questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions we can now take our first question peter arment from baird please go ahead peter arment r w baird analyst yeah thanks good morning darius and greg gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning peter arment r w baird analyst nice way to finish up 2018 darius i guess on aerospace just really the momentum continues to be really impressive with organic growth of 10 in each of the past two quarters maybe you can talk about i guess the sustainability of the confidence around the biz jet volume for you i know you mentioned 8 to 10 for this year and on 2019 aerospace guidance of mid single digit plus is the defense tough comp really the only headwind you re seeing in 2019 maybe just some color there thanks darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer yeah i mean so first of all we are very confident about our aero outlook for 2019 our bookings have been strong january has been strong yeah the comps do get tougher and there s some short cycle and i think as people saw in our outlook for q1 and what i anticipate will be q2 we have every bit of confidence that mid single digit is hopefully the bottom but the fact is we don t know the second half of the year and and that s why the numbers are what they are and potential government shutdowns and budgetary challenges and trade licenses potentially becoming an issue we hope that doesn t happen that just reflect sort of external risk but overall there is absolutely nothing that i m concerned about in terms of the bookings to growth rates to kind of growth we re seeing in that business and it s pervasive across all three segments whether they re transport bga or defense and space so i m very pleased and it s not a place where i m going to be losing a lot of sleep in 2019 peter arment r w baird analyst appreciate the color thanks i ll leave it to one darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer thanks gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks peter operator we can now take our next question from sheila kahyaoglu from jefferies please go ahead sheila kahyaoglu jefferies analyst thank you and good morning darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer good morning sheila gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning sheila sheila kahyaoglu jefferies analyst across your four businesses you either have a deceleration in organic growth or flattening of sales growth just how where are you factoring in some conservatism with a slowdown and how are you capturing that low end of the sales growth guidance of 2 darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer yeah i think i think it s not so much that i am we re capturing any conservatism in any of the businesses i think what we have been our guidance going forward is the fact that more than 50 of our business is short cycle and what s different about this year than i think many years in the past is we have many more unknowns whether it s brexit whether it s trade negotiations specific china us whether it s fed hikes in terms of what happens whether it s government shutdowns or just a lot of geopolitical unknowns more than usual and for us to express a level of confidence around all these unknowns around a little bit wider range than we anticipate i think would be would probably indicate a level of knowledge that we currently don t have now having said that and as you can see in our q1 outlook we re actually front end loaded and if anything we re going to be at the upper half of our revenue growth range in the first half of the year so actually we re provided that all things go as we think they will to the positive side i think that hopefully we ll be raising the bottom of that range as we move further through the year but there s i don t see really any growth issues of any of our businesses and we expect all of them to grow in 2019 sheila kahyaoglu jefferies analyst thank you for the color darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer no problem operator we can now take our next question from john inch from gordon haskett please go ahead john inch gordon haskett analyst thank you good morning everybody gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning john darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer good morning john john inch gordon haskett analyst good morning guys so how did your european businesses do and what s actually baked i guess on the growth rate any color there and what s baked into your guidance for 2019 for europe gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah john europe continued to be strong in the fourth quarter our european businesses were up 6 which capped off a 4 organic growth for the year so i still think we re seeing good strong growth there and it s pretty broad based to be honest sps probably the strongest of the bunch but each of the businesses is growing in the mid single digits or higher in europe at this stage and as we look forward we expect that s probably going to be still low mid single digits low to mid single digits but as darius mentioned clearly there are concerns out there i mean brexit in particular will will have some sort of an answer in the next 60 days as what occurs with that and we ve got a meaningful size business in the uk so definitely back to the concern aspects of macro signals europe is an area where we re waiting to see what s going to happen with brexit in particular and what impact that may have on us john inch gordon haskett analyst but greg that performance the 6 that s pretty good relative to what other companies have been putting up in europe and given sort of the slowing in germany itself is there a mix issue that s benefiting honeywell or new products or what do you think is attributable to why you re doing a general comment gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer well again i would tell you that each yeah each of the businesses is performing well so it s not like one is i mean sps being the strongest of the bunch but each of them is up mid single digits for the year so it s strength across our entire portfolio john inch gordon haskett analyst and then as a follow up last year you guys put up a 3 to 5 core growth target and darius you flagged accelerating core growth as your number one priority now i understand the economics sensitivities around the 2 to 5 this year but i m just trying to think big picture what are you and how are you actually going to tackle driving honeywell toward more of a mid single digit type of accelerating core growth over time is that meaning to go after it like and darius that pie ph the 40 that s not growing at 5 plus or do you kick start building technologies which has been sort of a problem for a little while or more m a i mean what maybe just walk us through a little bit of your own thoughts and maybe horizon too darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer yeah john it s not any one thing it s probably all of those john inch gordon haskett analyst yeah darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer yeah i mean i think it think starts with portfolio and we think that basis upon what we ve done here we ve got a more growth oriented and less cyclical portfolio that s certainly part of it secondly which is our tremendous focus on velocity product development and we re launching a whole new process called z21 which basically is going to reduce our innovation cycle times in half deploying more capital to r d because my strong belief is that part of any growth story there s got to be a strong innovation engine and that s something that we re trying to create continued focus on high growth regions i mean we re winning in places like china and india and even though the back half of the year china was a little bit slower we grew nearly double digit in china this year so that continues to be a success story our focus on commercial excellence sales forces is working where we re getting better productivity out of our sales force better performance it s it s never only one thing we re working all those levers and as you can see in the growth rate that we ve demonstrated this is granted the markets are pretty good but certainly involve the self help that we ve administered over last couple of years there s no way we would be in that range both in 2018 and what we re projecting for 2019 john inch gordon haskett analyst just last india has been a real success story i think you flagged it again would you consider putting more resources or doing m a in india in particular and region wise it s much smaller than china but it does seem to gained a lot of traction for honeywell i m just wondering what you re thinking about it darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer yeah no we ve had a lot of focus on india i mean to give you a perspective for india our growth in india in q4 was 27 john inch gordon haskett analyst yeah darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer so that s tremendous we have a big footprint there not just from a business perspective we have our engineering centers there of over 10 000 people so we feel very comfortable of our presence there the opportunities now to go after the mass mid market segment and that s actually one of our core initiatives for 2019 and beyond it s just not to play in the top tier the mid tier but actually having a greater level of participation in mid market segment so india is definitely one of the economies which we think is going to be a great story for us in 2019 and beyond john inch gordon haskett analyst thanks very much darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer thanks john operator we now take our next question from gautam khanna from cowen company please go ahead gautam khanna cowen company analyst thanks good morning and great results darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer thank you gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning and thank you gautam khanna cowen company analyst two questions first just big picture m a pipeline what can you say about it is it as healthy as it s ever been or anything large that you guys are looking at just any commentary on the nature of the pipeline right now darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer yeah i would say large probably not because i think that we re still very much focused on bolt ons and not the mega deals so i would say that s that is and will continue to be our focus we got a deal done in q4 which was good now transnorm was a deal of size the kind of size we like it was about 0 5 billion capital one ph to do that but to be honest on my commentary that the pipeline continues to be good and we are working on a deal that recently fell through just because although there has been a little bit of a correction in the market as we saw particularly in december that didn t really changed expectations of a lot of the sellers so we continue to struggle valuations and the expectations which there is a very pronounced shift up and it s got to work in our financial model so we continue to be very active the pipeline is good but i also want to tell you that we re realistic because we re cautious buyers and we don t like to overpay so we have to be certain about what we re buying and make sure that generates the right level of returns for our shareowners gautam khanna cowen company analyst appreciated and second question was just if there are any supplier constraints you re seeing on the aerospace side i remember last year you had some aftermarket constraints are you seeing any pinch points emerge darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer yeah no the answer to that is yes and i would say there are some pinch points on the supply chain emerging not just in aerospace those are there and prevalent particularly in areas like casting et cetera but we see similar challenge in smart energy and even in some elements of electronic supply chain so the pinch points on the supply chain are real they re there we re working through those and hope to resolve those frankly speaking our results could have been even better had some of those pinch points not been there gautam khanna cowen company analyst thanks a lot guys darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer sure operator we can now take our next question from julian mitchell from barclays please go ahead julian mitchell barclays analyst hi good morning darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer good morning gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning julian mitchell barclays analyst morning maybe just a first question around sps you grew around 10 plus organically in 2018 your slide nine shows about mid single digit growth this year amid to sort of accelerating market arrow so is that guidance based on anything you re seeing in the short cycle businesses within sps or it s simply about tough comps and the usual macro aspects that you had mentioned earlier gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah thanks julian and i think it s a little bit of i think it s a little bit of both i mean obviously we continue to be very excited about intelligrated and the double digit growth rates that we achieved this year and with a very strong backlog expect that to continue to be strong we did our retail business though not large grew over 20 in 2018 so that s probably going to dampen a bit with some of those comps we still feel very positive about productivity products and sensing and iot with the new product introductions that they have but those and the industrial safety businesses they are short cycle so and when those things change they can change quickly and so i think that s where we re trying to be a bit cautious because we ve seen it we ve seen it happened before in terms of the speed at which the short cycle can turn on us and so it s not a matter of having seen it so far and being concerned about anything with our business specifically but i would just call it a bit more caution with the environment we re in darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer and just to add to that julian i like greg said i mean majority of that business is actually short cycle intelligrated is about the only business that isn t short cycle so based on what we re seeing now and today and our guide for q1 there is no warning signs for us here it where we re positioned is just uncertainty particularly on the second half of the year julian mitchell barclays analyst thanks and then my second question around pmt any more color you d like to provide on how you see the cadence of the large project activity within hps in terms of the scale of any delays and also uop how are you gauging the volatility there at the moment darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer yeah no i like the greater stability what we saw in q4 a little bit was a bit of a pause on the order rates just around the volatility of oil but kind of given the right direction movement we re much more bullish but despite that i just want to quote you a couple of numbers from q4 and why i m bullish on pmt for this year first of all our hps quarter rates were up double digit second of all our uop backlog is up 8 so i m very optimistic around pmt performance for 2019 probably the one segment that was pretty soft was in our advanced materials business the electronics chemicals which electronics has been a bit weaker some of the other companies in that segment announcing and we saw that in our electronics chemicals business so that s probably the only sort of minus that we saw in q4 but overall booked backlog the order rates were good and to be honest especially in hps our global mega projects front log ph and quote are very strong we ve even book a lot of those orders in q4 and our orders growth was up double digit in the quarter so i feel pretty good about pmt for 2019 julian mitchell barclays analyst great thank you gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks julian darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer thank you operator we can now take our next question from steve tusa from jpmorgan please go ahead steve tusa jpmorgan analyst hey guys thanks for fitting me in gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer my pleasure darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer good morning steve tusa jpmorgan analyst just wanted to ask about the not we re not sensitive or anything like that the you mentioned kind of the next phase of the transformation and some of the footprint stuff that you re that you re looking into is that something that you ll be able to kind of quantify more and speak to at this year s investor day or is that going to remain i don t know what you put at the bottom of slide like your consulting with people or something like that about what the number is going to be when we kind of hear more about about that and how big could that opportunity be darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer we re not putting in a middle anymore on the call you wind up grump steve no the so the short answer is yes on investor day we are going to it s obviously going to be a segment of that presentation we re going to give you a lot more detail but i just want to be very clear that the next phase of the transformation is not just the isc transformation that s a very big part of it but we kind of talked a little bit about this deck about kind of the three legs of the stool which are isc transformation honeywell digital and honeywell connected enterprises that s sort of the next phase of the evolution of honeywell and one of those three is a business and the next two are going to be are going for at least the next three to five years so this is going to give us a lot more tailwinds in terms of margins cash generation more efficiency working capital simplifications better planning lower capital intensity a lot of benefits so we re going to provide a lot more color on that in at our investor day steve tusa jpmorgan analyst are you going to give something are you going to give something tangible or will it be kind of like directional arrows i mean sometimes the stuff can it sounds great but ultimately it doesn t like filter down at the bottom line for other companies just curious if you re going to like give something tangible numbers wise gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer so steve i mean oftentimes we get asked about how long of a runway do we have for margin expansion and to me this is continuing to fill the portfolio of things that keeps that runway alive and well and so that s kind of the way i m thinking about all of these things are going to continue to contribute to our ability to drive that margin expansion well beyond 2019 steve tusa jpmorgan analyst okay darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer because as we kind of get deeper and deeper into the 20s which we re very comfortable that we re going to do and you look at our framework that we present in 2017 i talked about 30 basis to 50 best basis point expansion as you see from our performance as well as our guide and the top end of the range it s even greater than that number these are the kinds of things that enable us to kind of keep growing that margin machine is self help and these internal initiatives and the good news is we ve got plenty of opportunities because we ve got a lot of work to do on the supply chain and honeywell digital so i view all of that as not bad news but really a tremendous opportunity to continue to drive margins steve tusa jpmorgan analyst and then one last one i know you guys don t want to give specific segment guidance but maybe can you just talk about who maybe above or below the averages when it comes to margin expansion for 2019 just so people are kind of calibrated sometimes the segments can move around a little bit and people tend to kind of pick what they want to look at as positives or negatives things that s good to kind of baseline people don t need exact numbers but just some directional color around what will be above or below that kind of margin expansion or whether they re all be kind of in the middle there that d be helpful gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah i would expect aero and hbt to probably lead the pack in terms of the rate of expansion in 19 but each of the segments will have a very respectable margin expansion profile but clearly with the rate of growth that we re seeing in aero and leveraging the fixed costs that we have there that s probably got a pretty sizable opportunity and again hbt with a return to growth and some new products we see that is also having a fair amount of opportunity but each of the businesses i think will expand margins in a meaningful way in 19 steve tusa jpmorgan analyst okay great thanks a lot darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer thanks steve operator we can now take our next question jeff sprague from vertical research please go ahead jeff sprague vertical research analyst thank you good morning everyone darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer good morning jeff gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning jeff sprague vertical research analyst hi good morning just a couple of things on maybe some of the longer cycle outlooks and the like first on intelligrated obviously i have great visibility now on 19 on this backlog but do you have visibility on things like front log bidding et cetera do you expect it to be a fairly active order year again in 2019 for intelligrated darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer yeah the short answer is absolutely because not only because of the continued strength of activity in north america which is continues to be robust but now the transnorm and our enhanced capability in europe both from the beachhead that we ve established by acquiring transnorm but also because if you recall we put a lot of investments back in the 17 and 18 timeframe for r d capability we have a metrics based offering that s complete now so we re very capable bidding on warehouses et cetera so we continue to expect another very robust year in our intelligrated business jeff sprague vertical research analyst and then i was also just wondering back to this mega projects question in hps you noted your orders were strong even without some of those kind of hitting the order book we think a lot of those projects kind of being underwritten that maybe 50 or 60 oil price so is it just do you think they re just kind of a human reflex here that the volatility in q4 cause people to just tap the pause button or do you see some legitimate risks to these things kind of sliding out further darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer yeah i think it s just natural reaction when you see that kind of volatility like we saw in q4 that causes people to pause but we re actually seeing a very positive movement here in q1 so i think that some of those decisions will get made and we feel confident that when they do get made we re going to have some positive outcomes for us and even and i was encouraged by our bookings in q4 because despite not having booked some of those gnp ph jobs we still had a very robust orders growth jeff sprague vertical research analyst yeah all right great thank you very much darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer thank you gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks jeff operator we can now take our next question from scott davis from melius research please go ahead scott davis melius research analyst hi good morning guys darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer good morning scott gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer hey morning scott scott davis melius research analyst i so much of the future story of honeywell seems to relate software in some way shape or form and i m little intrigued by hce in general can you help us understand how centralized is the software development effort and whenever i hear about centralized software development i always think about makes me want to cry but or worse but how do you how do you still stay close to the customer and the businesses themselves and still have this type of a centralized effort and ensure that you re actually getting return on the investment darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer yeah so maybe let me just maybe explain that when we say centralized that mean sort of the platform the it stack that we call sentience that s what centralized that all of our connected enterprises use but then the actual analytics to solutions that are provided those are very much vertically oriented and the way we approach this is essentially each of those businesses end customer focused business so whether it s connected aircraft connected plant connected buildings we developed and the mv0 mv1 which was called single pane of glass which has a lot of value drivers solutions for end customers and we typically partner with a few key anchor customers to help us iterate and drive an optimize the solution so we re very close to the end customers as a matter of fact we develop a lot of these solutions with the end customers but we also don t want to drive customization but rather standardization so don t think about this as something that s sits in corporate a kind of a central level is insular and doesn t work with end customers that s not the case what we want to do is have end customer intimacy while driving leverage to the it stack called sentience that s really the core of the spread gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer and maybe if i could just add to that with the leadership from que she is applying that customer go to market approach across all of those connected enterprises such that each one of them individually isn t having to develop those muscles and skill sets independent and while these businesses are still embedded inside of the for four spgs those four spg presidents wouldn t possibly be able to give it the amount of time and attention that que will be able to do as the president of hce so centralized really means focus much more so than corporate darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer yeah that s a very good point because what the gist was yeah the way this was organized before it still has sort of core reporting into the spg presidents in que but we gave just a lot more authority and control to que just because when you re running a 10 billion or 12 billion business and you have something that s a fraction of that it requires a lot of time attention strategy changes agility it s tough to manage that scott davis melius research analyst right no that makes sense and that s helpful and you guys have done a nice job so it s not it just requires i think a little bit of explanation but just a follow on question really just on intelligrated and some of the assets you ve bought around it are you close to being at the point where you can go to market together with some of these products globally and how long will it take i mean just particularly given how regionalized some of the warehouse offerings are darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer yeah the short answer scott is now we are ready as a matter of fact we are quoting globally and as excited as we are about the north american market we anticipate being securing some jobs both in asia this year as well as europe and we re ready we ve invested from an r d perspective the transnorm acquisition is going to further help but you should expect us to get some more momentum here on a global level in 2019 and a lot of those solutions are finished scott davis melius research analyst okay good good luck thanks guys darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer thanks scott gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks scott operator we now take our next question from andrew obin from bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead andrew obin bank of america analyst hey guys good morning darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer good morning andrew gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning andrew obin bank of america analyst just a question on defense just because it was so strong can you give us more visibility into how sustainable some of the developments that you had in 4q and into the first half i would imagine f 35 ramp is sustainable you mentioned space and defense i think you mentioned aftermarket if you could just walk us through a visibility for the next six months thank you gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer well i would tell you so as you mentioned our defense business has been growing mid teens all four quarters of 2018 and as we look out for the next six months the backlog growth there is also very strong it s strong double digits over 20 in defense and space so for the next six months as you mentioned i think our visibility is very good to continued strength in that area andrew obin bank of america analyst and just maybe on china could you just describe more color on specific markets and just your top down view on china s economy and how do you think it will progress through the year just because you have such a big business there and you ve been very knowledgeable darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer yeah it s been as i mentioned it s our china business has been up nearly double digit just shy of that for the year so another solid growth here a bit of a slowing in i would say in q4 but there are some very clear reasons and we understood that slowing so that we kind of take it segment by segment if we think about sps it was terrific it was up double digit growth in china no slowing actually if anything things are accelerating in pmt we had some tough comps we understood that and expected that we had some big both orders and revenue growth so we expected that nothing unusual gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah we ve doubled the business in uop in the last two years so the comps are not small darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer yeah exactly so nothing out of the world of expectation for hbt as you know we ve had some challenges with the air and water segment and frankly some of our distributor partners got a little bit ahead of themselves given the robust growth that we saw in 2017 and that s been a bit of a challenge for us all year but we expect that to grow again in 2019 so we think that s going to be behind us and then with aero we had some take collections challenges which actually limited our shipments because our backlog was actually better than the revenues would indicate so all in all we re not building in a tremendous year in china not kind of the usual honeywell strong double digit growth in china where we think it s going to a little bit slow but all of that is reflected in our guide and we expect to grow in china in 2019 for certain how much that s going to be well we ll see all in all i feel pretty good about how the businesses are positioned andrew obin bank of america analyst and do you guys have a view on the chinese economy bottoms in 19 darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer well i think that s a 1 million it s a bit of 1 million question andrew i think a lot of that depends and we might know better answer ph in next 30 days right i mean i think we re watching carefully what happens on the geopolitical sphere and with the broader economy because as i said we re very prepared from a tariff perspective because that s something we can identify and should be able to do something about what we don t know and where we have some questions which is whether it s going to be the overall economic impact both on the economies of china the us et cetera that s i think at this juncture it s worth being a month into the year that s tough to call and we ll see what happens andrew obin bank of america analyst terrific appreciate it thanks so much darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer thanks andrew gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator next question comes from joe ritchie from goldman sachs please go ahead joseph ritchie goldman sachs analyst thanks good morning guys and thanks for truly fitting me in gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer welcome joseph ritchie goldman sachs analyst thanks lot of impact so obviously look you guys got a lot accomplished in 2018 congratulations darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer thank you joseph ritchie goldman sachs analyst i think one of the areas that we haven t really focused a lot on is that specialty products business and so maybe just a broader strategic question there i think that business is tied to semis electronics how do you think about that business longer term you got you did a lot in 2018 this business seems to be a little bit more cyclical versus the rest of your portfolio so maybe some thoughts around that that to start would be great darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer yeah i mean yeah there is some cyclicality there is also some stability i mean we have our spectra business there which is doing quite well our aclar business which is acyclical our electronic materials business which is more cyclical so it s a bit of a mixed bag probably we re given some of the challenges in the electronics segment probably on the lower end of the curve than we are but i think like anything i mean we re we like a lot of those businesses they perform for us but as always we re and as we pointed out during our speaker notes today we re always assessing everything i think some of the big things that we wanted to do that we didn t think that fit our portfolio within 2018 but everything is always under assessment we ve never done and we always want to kind of add and also subtract potentially so i don t there is no specific update to the to the sp business but like i said we re always assessing and we re going to do what s we ll make adjustments as they fit our portfolio joseph ritchie goldman sachs analyst yeah that s fair darius is it fair to think of that business though ph as being mostly semi capex oriented darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer it s a mixed bag i mean there is really a variety of different businesses and that s why it s kind of tough to talk about sort of any given one trend because you have electronic materials you have some defense spend and you have healthcare in there you have consumer goods so i mean you have a entire variety of end markets that there s exposure in speciality products so it s tough to say what that total blend ends up to but yeah there s sort of eclectic mix of various end markets joseph ritchie goldman sachs analyst okay yeah fair enough and just one quick one greg you mentioned the stranded costs earlier i think the number i had was like roughly around like 340 350 million gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer that s right yeah joseph ritchie goldman sachs analyst so the timing of those costs i mean does it what s remaining into in 2019 first can you quantify what s left in 2019 secondly what we get through those costs through the first half of the year are they going to be kind of linear as the year progresses gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah so we ve taken actions that we ll have eliminated about half of those costs already as we exited 2018 and as you saw in the fourth quarter with the corporate number of being flat to slightly up that reflects the first quarter of not having the ability to allocate about 45 million or 50 million to those two spin businesses that are now gone so that s a little bit of why you saw maybe a heavier number than you might have expected but we expect that to come down over the course of the year from the first to the fourth quarter and we will exit the fourth quarter at a run rate by which all of those costs will be gone so that s you should expect to see a bit of a stair step down and again keep in mind that two thirds is in our net corporate costs about a third of that was sitting in hpt so you re not going to see a 300 million number per se but it s reflective of a step down as we go through the year joseph ritchie goldman sachs analyst got it helpful guys thank you gregory p lewis senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks joe darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer thank you operator next question comes from christopher glynn from oppenheimer please go ahead christopher glynn oppenheimer analyst hey thanks also a sincere thanks for squeezing me i certainly don t expect to go before steve but possibly before joe inaudible anyways question on non res a lot of mixed messages people talking about low single digits but yes they appeared talked about very robust commercial projects so just wondering what you re seeing in that space is that a very a vibrant market or is it just kind of gdp limp darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer okay i mean if you look at our hps business which is probably the best indication of kind of the commercial activity up double digit bookings in q4 so actually very very strong that s good we also want to make sure we captured a service that s the opportunity that business is stabilizing i think vimal and the team have put the business on the right path we re seeing good signs and sort of the secret to the growth there is revitalization of the npd pipeline and i see a lot of good things in the various segments whether it s building products whether it s fire whether it s our bms systems so we actually expect a pretty good year and if you take hps as a leading indicator that s also been a pretty good sign in q4 so we re little bit cautious in the outlook but given the stability that we have now and it should be a nice story for us recovery story first in 2019 christopher glynn oppenheimer analyst thank you operator and i would now like to turn the call back to darius darius adamczyk president and chief executive officer thank you our end markets continue to be strong and we ve got simpler more focused portfolio following completion of the spins we continue to execute well as evidence by our sales margin and cash performance and we have a significant balance sheet capacity to deploy we have a strong performance culture our say will continue equal our do and we are focused on continuing to outperform for our customers our shareowners and our employees i continue to be encouraged by what i see in each of our businesses and our people i m excited for what i know will be a strong 2019 thank you for listening

merck distinguished itself through its strong performance across its businesses perhaps most significantly our full year results demonstrate that our strategy to be the premier research intensive biopharmaceutical company is working the investments we ve made in r d over the past several years and our commercial execution have culminated in the highest top and bottom line growth the company has seen in years and we expect our momentum to carry it over into 2019 at its core merck is a science driven organization motivated by a quest to improve human and animal health we ve spent the last several years reinvigorating our labs investing in three new research centers in south san francisco cambridge massachusetts and london and refocusing our efforts on creating truly differentiated medicines that help solve big health problems for now and the future this unwavering commitment to science and innovation enables us to retain the best talent in the industry to drive our strategic priorities and to continuously enhance our pipeline of medically significant treatments and vaccines our clinical and commercial execution in the i o space has further separated keytruda from its competition and our leadership in oncology is further bolstered by the growth prospects for and lenvima gardasil is not only driving meaningful growth for the company after a decade on the market but is also instilling optimism around the world that this vaccine could help prevent and maybe eliminate certain hpv related cancers we are confident in our broad portfolio of market leading products and our diversified high potential pipeline which includes significant innovations in oncology vaccines and other specialty and hospital care along with a robust industry leading animal health business in fact merck has one of the broadest and most promising pipelines we ve had over the past two decades in summary we re excited by our progress our pipeline and our future we are energized by the work that we do and most importantly by our ability to help patients around the world while also creating sustainable long term growth and strong shareholder returns before i turn the call over to rob i m pleased to announce that we will be hosting an investor event on june 20 during which we will provide an update on our strategic progress and outline how merck will continue to deliver innovative science and create value for all of our stakeholders we will be back to you with the details on location and other logistics but we ask that you save the date now i d like to turn it over to rob for more color on our financial and operational performance rob rob davis chief financial officer thanks ken and good morning everyone please note that my comments today will be on a non gaap basis our results in 2018 reflect strong execution across our key growth pillars focused investment in our pipeline and disciplined expense management we achieved meaningful top and bottom line growth and we also executed important business development transactions initiated an expanded capital expenditure program to increase our manufacturing capacity and returned additional value to shareholders through increased dividends and share repurchases we believe our company is well positioned to achieve future growth and as our 2019 guidance shows we expect the recent momentum in our business to continue as we execute on our growth pillars and invest in r d while remaining disciplined in our allocation of resources turning to our fourth quarter results total company revenues were 11 billion an increase of 8 year over year excluding exchange with strong growth in both our human health and animal health businesses human health revenues increased 8 ex exchange to 9 8 billion led by a few products in our oncology vaccines and hospital and specialty businesses in oncology keytruda s sales exceeded 2 1 billion this quarter extending the unprecedented launch of this foundational therapy and solidifying merck as the clear market leader in renal oncology with continued strong future growth prospects global growth was primarily driven by higher use in first line non small cell lung cancer and utilization remains strong across the breadth of our indications including melanoma head and neck bladder and msi high cancers we are seeing strong uptake in squamous nonsmall lung cancer in the u s where a good portion of newly diagnosed patients are now receiving either keytruda as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy following the approval of keynote 407 in october in total in the u s we now have 15 approved indications and are approved in 10 different tumor types overall plus a tumor approval in msi high patients in ex u s markets first line lung is the key driver of growth mostly due to further uptake of our monotherapy indication in pd l1 high expressers following reimbursement approvals around the world in europe we re off to a great start launch in the chemo combo in non squamous patients following approval of keynote 189 last september we are already seeing adoption in select markets such as germany where reimbursement begins upon approval and we will be working through the reimbursement process in other major european markets throughout this year growth in japan remains robust and we are very pleased with the recent approval of five new indications across lung adjuvant melanoma and msi high cancers finally in september we launched keytruda in metastatic melanoma in china which will be an important market for the brand moving forward as we pursue additional indications overall we remain very confident in the long term growth potential for keytruda based on increased utilization and currently approved indications and our expectation of additional approvals worldwide we also remained very encouraged by the progress and potential in both and lenvima in partnership with astrazeneca and respectively growth this quarter was driven by continued uptake in ovarian and breast cancers as well as launches in new markets such as japan and china in the united states across all tumors leads the inhibitor class with over 50 total patient share we re excited by the earlier than expected u s approval of solo 1 and look forward to bringing this treatment to more women with ovarian cancer growth for lenvima reflected strong performance in hepatocellular cancer following recent launches in the u s europe and more recently china performance in japan remains strong with lenvima being used in the vast majority of hepatocellular patients turning to vaccines we have a significant and innovative portfolio our vaccines business reflected strong worldwide demand for gardasil which achieved sales of over seven of over 800 million this quarter health systems worldwide continued to support increased immunization of gardasil with the goal of reducing the incidence of certain hpv related cancers growth this quarter was driven by strong uptake from our recent launch in china as well as increased demand in europe given the move toward more gender neutral vaccination programs sales of gardasil also grew in the u s mostly reflecting the difference in quarterly phasing of public sector purchases last year our hospital and specialty business was led by bridion where growth in the u s reflects continued strong demand bridion sales approached 1 billion for the year and we remain confident in the potential for additional future growth looking now at our animal health business we again saw strong growth this quarter with revenues increasing 11 to 1 billion excluding exchange growth was driven by our broad portfolio of in line and newly launched products with companion animal products growing 16 and livestock sales growing 8 both excluding exchange companion animal growth was driven by sales of vaccines while livestock benefited from increased sales of swine and poultry products animal health segment profits were 387 million in the fourth quarter an increase of 16 excluding exchange compared to the prior year our animal health business continues to perform well and we view it as a key pillar of merck s future growth we continued to invest in new product development and launches and recently announced the acquisition of antelliq which will establish merck as a leader in animal identification and monitoring one of the fastest growing parts of the animal health industry turning to the rest of our p l gross margin was 75 in the quarter the increase of 70 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2017 was largely due to the favorable impacts of product mix this year and manufacturing variances related to the cyber attack that negatively impacted last year this increase was partially offset by other headwinds such as lower prices and catch up amortization of sales milestones primarily related to the earlier than expected approval of solo 1 operating expenses of 4 8 billion increased 1 year over year including a favorable 1 percentage point impact from foreign exchange investments in our oncology and vaccines clinical development portfolios as well as our discovery efforts drove the increase in r d while sg a remained relatively flat our tax rate of 22 5 for the quarter was 720 basis points higher year over year reflecting a true up of our full year tax rate due to our mix of earnings taken together we delivered earnings of 1 04 per share an increase of 11 excluding exchange now let s turn to our outlook for 2019 we remain confident in both our near and long term prospects for revenue growth notwithstanding expected headwinds from price foreign exchange and pressures on our mature and loe products for 2019 we expect full year revenues of 43 2 billion to 44 7 billion which represents 2 to 6 growth driven by strength in our key growth pillars across oncology vaccines hospital and specialty as well as animal health this range assumes an approximately 1 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange using mid january rates we expect our gross margin to be roughly flat year over year as we previously communicated we believe tailwinds including improved product mix will generally be offset by headwinds including lower prices royalty payments fluctuations in fx and the continued amortization of collaboration milestones we expect our operating expenses to increase year over year at a low to mid single digit rate with continued disciplined management of sg a allowing for meaningful further investment in r d to capitalize on our pipeline opportunities we expect our tax rate to be between 18 5 and 19 5 for the full year we project average diluted shares outstanding to be approximately 2 58 billion for 2019 taken together we expect eps to be between 4 57 and 4 72 including an approximately 1 percentage point positive impact from foreign exchange in mid january rates this would represent approximately 5 to 9 bottom line growth before concluding it s worth mentioning that our 2019 eps guidance assumes that our other income and expense line will be roughly 0 in 2019 due to an accounting standard implemented in 2018 we now recognize unrealized gains and losses related to our investments in equity securities and other income and expense based on current market conditions for our investment portfolio we have assumed a negative impact from our equity investments in oie in our guidance we also expect higher net interest expense given our cash and debt balances and given current interest rates market movements create additional volatility as we move through the year and we will continue to give you updates as we move forward in summary we delivered strong performance in 2018 while 2019 continues to be another important investment year for r d we expect operational momentum across our growth pillars combined with disciplined resource allocation to deliver another year of meaningful top and bottom line growth as well as operating leverage longer term we remain confident in our ability to drive strong sales growth and meaningful operating margin expansion our dedication to innovation and continued execution allow us to sustainably deliver for the patients we serve and in turn create significant shareholder value with that i d like to turn the call over to roger roger perlmutter president thanks rob as outlined in our press release the fourth quarter was an especially productive period for merck research laboratories marking the climax of what was an extremely busy year beginning first with keytruda during the fourth quarter we obtained three new indications in the united states first for the first line treatment for patients with metastatic squamous non small cell lung cancer in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or based upon the results of the keynote 407 trial second for the second line treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients who have previously been treated with and third for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with recurrent locally advanced or metastatic merkel cell carcinoma a rare skin cancer separately and based on the results of our keynote 054 study which was conducted with the european organization for the research and treatment of cancer the european commission approved keytruda for the adjuvant treatment of stage 3 melanoma with lymph nodes involved in patients who have undergone successful tumor resection meanwhile in japan we obtained five new keytruda approvals at the end of december including the first approval based on our keynote 042 trial for keytruda monotherapy in patients with non small cell lung cancer whose tumors contain greater than or equal to 1 of malignant cells expressing the pd l1 biomarker data from keynote 042 are also under review in the e u and in the united states for submission of additional data resulting in an extension of the pdufa date by three months to april 11 of this year our other cancer programs also advanced meaningfully in the fourth quarter in collaboration with our colleagues at astrazeneca we gained fda approval for as maintenance treatment for patients with advanced ovarian fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer with experienced complete or partial response for first line platinum based therapy and whose tumors contain deleterious or suspected deleterious germline or somatic mutations in brca1 or brca2 gene this approval is based on data presented last fall at the european society for medical oncology meeting from the solo 1 trial we continue to see very positive results across our oncology portfolio including the success of our keynote 181 trial testing keytruda monotherapy in the second line treatment of advanced or metastatic esophageal or gastroesophageal junction carcinoma with 31 reduction in the risk of death as compared to traditional chemotherapy in patients whose tumors expressed the pd l1 biomarker with a combined proportion score of greater than or equal to 10 this is the first demonstration of an improvement in overall survival in esophageal gastric malignancy through immunotherapy data from this study were presented at the asco gi meeting in january and have been submitted for regulatory review during the fourth quarter we also announced the results of our keynote 426 trial combining keytruda with pfizer s axitinib in the first line treatment of renal cell cancer as compared with treatment data from this study in which improvements in overall survival progression free survival and overall response rate were demonstrated have also been submitted for regulatory review progress has been made in other disease categories as well for example the fda granted priority review with the pdufa date of july 16 for our novel antimicrobial agent mk7655a which combines a new chemical entity relebactam with thus blocking the activity of the bacterially expressed beta that would otherwise inactivate this represents an important advance in the struggle to control antibiotic resistance we re also active on the business development front joining with colleagues at ngm biopharmaceuticals to advance mk 3655 a highly selective phase 2 monoclonal antibody directed against the fgf receptor 1c beta receptor complex for the potential treatment of nonalcoholic our vaccine programs also progressed during the fourth quarter at the end of the quarter for example we announced a collaboration with the instituto butantan on the development of vaccines to protect against dengue virus infection instituto butantan is currently conducting a phase 3 study in brazil with their vaccine candidate while our own related dengue virus vaccine showed promise in earlier phase 1 study finally we commenced a rolling bla submission for v920 our investigational vaccine designed to protect against infection from the zaire strain of ebola virus we continued to provide tens of thousands of doses of this vaccine to the world health organization to assist in the battle to contain an ebola outbreak in the democratic republic of the congo we hope that through the important work of governmental and nongovernmental agencies and in part as a result of our v920 vaccine it will be possible to bring this very serious ebola outbreak under control in the near future now my colleagues and i will take your questions questions and answers teri loxam senior vice president investor relations and global communications thanks roger darla we will i guess start on questions so with that we ll turn it over to questions operator your first question is from seamus fernandez with guggenheim seamus fernandez guggenheim securities analyst thanks very much for the question so my first question is for ken and my second are my second is for frank and roger ken can you just help us understand the core areas of focus for potential m a or business development to bolster the merck pipeline and maybe if you could just kind of give us a general sense of areas where areas of interest and perhaps even the range obviously lots of questions around the current mega cap m a that s occurred in recent days and then for frank and roger can you just maybe each of you kind of characterize the key opportunities near and longer term to sustain or perhaps even accelerate the keytruda opportunity we re seeing amazing growth in that franchise but again we re just trying to get a sense of the key new opportunities whether it be kidney cancer as a core opportunity or perhaps somewhat longer term in the adjuvant setting thanks so much ken frazier chairman and chief executive officer thanks seamus let me start by saying again that business development remains an important priority for us first and foremost we look for those scientific innovations that we believe will enhance our pipeline because we believe that s what s important ultimately to drive long term growth and value for shareholders in that regard we don t try to predetermine what therapeutic areas are best we want to find the best science that matches up to the best opportunities to help people and that s how we go about it and i ll remind you that we were very active last year in bd we did about 60 transactions spanning licensing and technology deals clinical collaboration we did the collaboration with eisai we did the acquisition of viralytics which expands our early immuno oncology pipeline we did the antelliq acquisition so again i think what we want to do given our strong balance sheet is to actively look across the entire spectrum of assets across therapeutic areas to create the strongest portfolio i ll close by saying we continue as we ve said for years to want to focus on the kinds of deals that we can add with a minimum of disruption to our ongoing scientific efforts so we have not really been focusing primarily on the large mega mergers that you referred to teri loxam senior vice president investor relations and global communications and roger why don t you start on the second question around keytruda key opportunities and we can turn over to frank for the commercial portion roger perlmutter president right seamus thanks for the question first of all i think it s important from a context point of view and you know this that we re still at an early point in the development of keytruda so keep in mind that it s just a little over four years since the first indication was obtained in the united states in 2014 and in that sense the indications are still rolling out keytruda as i ve said and as you know is the first truly broad spectrum agent introduced into clinical practice with 15 indications and more coming and many of those indications have not yet been broadened around the world and frank will have a chance to talk about that so there s a great deal of opportunity to do good in helping patients around the world but beyond that we ve continued to work on a strategy in which we first demonstrate activity with monotherapy in different tumor types and the monotherapy studies are essentially complete we have a few more studies coming through but then move forward in combination studies while simultaneously advancing from salvage therapy third line second line to first line adjuvant neoadjuvant and all of those studies are going on and we are expanding into new areas and in addition in combination with other agents both those that have already been introduced into practice axitinib and renal cell carcinoma and in addition our own pipeline so there is just a huge set of opportunities looking forward i think as i mentioned the data that we presented in esophageal gastric cancer in january at asco gi and the renal cell data which will be presented in mid february from the keynote 426 study are special highlights but there are going to be a lot of presentations coming forward there s a lot of new data coming out and we ll have a chance to talk about some of that for example in advance at asco it s early days but a lot of expansion opportunities and frank i think you can talk about that frank clyburn new chief commercial officer seamus good morning and to echo roger s point we have actually a very early stage launch going on and i just wanted to reiterate especially outside the u s for lung cancer we are right now launching keynote 189 and we re just in the early stages of that launch so if you look at our ex u s growth in fact this quarter ex us growth was over 86 and that just shows the early progress that we re making not only with our monotherapy but early on with our combination in lung in addition we have a number of other opportunities you heard us announce the approvals in japan we re very excited about the opportunity that we have in china with our second line melanoma indication and we have a broad program that we are building in china in addition to that we have significant opportunities as you ve heard from roger with regards to our renal cell carcinoma data that we re looking forward to presenting keynote 426 at asco gu we re also excited about triple negative breast cancer we presented our data now for keynote 048 for head and neck cancer with first line chemo combination gastric cancer and others so we re very excited about our current indications and expanding those around the world as well as the significant amount of data readouts that are going to be coming in the future that we think will provide very significant growth not only this year but in the long run teri loxam senior vice president investor relations and global communications great thanks for the questions seamus darla we ll move on to the next one please operator it s from the line of steve scala with cowen steve scala cowen and company analyst thank you a couple of questions ken i was interested in your comment that merck has one of the most broad pipelines in the past two decades i mean this is quite a statement given merck s rich research history what are we missing externally that merck sees internally and will june 20th be the opportunity for us to learn a lot more about the pipeline and secondly merck s pneumococcal vaccine i believe received breakthrough designation in children but not adults is this an issue of timing or did fda deliberately not grant the 15 valid product breakthrough in adults thank you ken frazier chairman and chief executive officer thank you for your questions steve i continue to believe that merck s longer term revenue growth prospects are underappreciated in large part because people don t see the pipeline the way we do so let me try to answer your question so we see tremendous future growth not only in keytruda and lenvima but we have behind it a formidable internal pipeline of assets in oncology over 20 unique mechanisms in the vaccine world we think the gardasil opportunity is really significant going forward but behind that are opportunities in next generation pneumococcal rsv cmv dengue and other areas are the ones that we look forward to as we also look beyond that we just announced positive phase 3 data for zerbaxa our antibiotic for hospital acquired and ventilator acquired pneumonia which we believe could be a very sizable opportunity to go with our leading portfolio of hospital the which we acquired a couple of years ago is now being studied in phase 3 in chronic and in our bio collaboration is just another example of that not to mention great novel assets in hiv and neuroscience so to answer your question i actually look forward to the june opportunity for us to talk about what it is that we see in our pipeline i will say that we are genuinely excited we see the opportunities for us to invest in across a broad area and again we look forward to speaking to you in more detail on june 20 roger perlmutter president right and with this is roger with respect to the breakthrough designation yes we did receive breakthrough designation in pediatrics for the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and the reason was because of the very meaningful clinical data that we obtained demonstrating the balance response across all 15 stereotypes represented in that vaccine we have very strong data in the adult segment as well and it s really a matter of timing with respect to how we interact with the agency just to remind you breakthrough designation provides a mechanism whereby you can have more frequent consultation interaction with the agency on late stage trials and keep in mind that is already in eight phase 3 studies that we ll be reading out this year and next year so there s already a very substantial head of steam on this program teri loxam senior vice president investor relations and global communications great thank you we ll move on to the next question please darla operator it s from andrew baum with citi andrew baum citi analyst many thanks couple of questions please some of the industry lobby has championed net pricing given the announcement last night it s a fine content could you talk to the merck assessment of the proposal particularly problems to go through how you see the risk as well as the potential public service and the spillover in terms of the commercial book of business when and then secondly to roger i know that you recently initiated a trial of olaparib in tissue agnostic setting with hrr mutated treatments who are resistant to refractory standard treatment the question is no 1 is that trial findable given the advanced nature of the patients and no 2 the size of that patient population depending on what biomarker you use could be very substantial could you talk to how large that population may be in a percentage of addressable relapse refractory patients many thanks ken frazier chairman and chief executive officer thank you andrew let me start with your first question about the hhs rebate proposal let me start by saying we share the administration s goal of lowering out of pocket costs for patients that s critical for patients it s critical for our business as you know unfortunately the current pharmaceutical supply chain includes various misaligned incentives that serve to support middlemen while often neglecting patients we are evaluating the specific proposal released by the administration late yesterday and we are hopeful that it will achieve the shared goal of ensuring patients have affordable access to innovative medicines roger perlmutter president and andrew i think you were asking a question i m having a little bit of trouble hearing you here but you re asking a question about a study which was a tissue agnostic study and again this is part of the broader rollout of our analysis because what we found with as i think everyone recognizes is that the rate of activity of is greater than we expected first of all any dna repair a variety of dna repair defects defects in homologous recombination seem to sensitize cells through but even in cell types in which those defects are not recognizable there s evidence accumulating evidence that we re seeing clinical responses so we re beginning to think of of having much broader activity and that s particularly the case when we look at in combination with keytruda and other agents so you can expect to see broader studies of in a variety of different settings both outside of the hormone responsive tumors and as well in combination with other agents i hope that helps teri loxam senior vice president investor relations and global communications great thanks andrew we ll move on to the next question please darla operator your next question is from chris schott from jpmorgan chris schott j p morgan analyst great thanks very much for the questions i guess my first question was just on longer term margin expansion and just expenses in general i guess so when you think about the low to mid single digit opex growth in 2019 is that a reasonable growth rate to think about on a go forward basis for merck or should we think about spending starting to moderate as we look out to 2020 and beyond i know in general there s been a lot of discussion around kind of the magnitude of operating margin expansion so is there any color on that front would be helpful and my second question was just focusing a little bit more on the launch dynamics in first line lung specifically in the us i guess can you just give us a sense of where we are at this point in terms of share of new starts and are there any additional areas for growth within the lung market and i guess where you must focus on from a commercial standpoint as we think about just that indication playing through in the u s thanks very much teri loxam senior vice president investor relations and global communications thanks chris so we ll start with rob rob davis chief financial officer thanks chris and to your question on long term margin expansion so as i said in the prepared remarks we continue to believe we will see meaningful margin expansion operating margin expansion as we go forward but as we ve been talking about given the fact that we have such a wealth of opportunity right now in r d you start with keytruda and look at just what this drug could be and how unprecedented it is we want to make sure we re investing fully behind that as well as with and lenvima those programs are now in full swing not to mention our vaccines program so as we ve indicated we do think you re going to see sales growth continue and with that you re going to see r d grow in the near term faster than sales over the next couple of years as we really get to the bollust of that with r d slowing down to a rate slower than sales thereafter and sg a will continue to be managed very tightly it s nice to see frankly that even despite the fact that we re making meaningful investments in r d in 2019 we re actually going to see operating margin expansion in 19 so that actually is really i think a result of what we ve done from disciplined expense management across the organization to make sure we can put back all of our resources into the important programs in r d but as we ve talked about we do have the long term margin expansion it will be driven mainly by operating expense moderating versus sales we do continue to believe sg a will be managed very tightly and then you ll see r d slow down after we get out of the next couple of years so that s really what will drive it teri loxam senior vice president investor relations and global communications great thanks rob frank we ll have you comment on the first line lung market frank clyburn new chief commercial officer chris we are seeing significant share of newly diagnosed first line non squamous non small cell lung cancer patients that do not have an abnormal egf or igene based off of keynote 189 we ve seen that penetration very rapidly in the majority of the segments in the non squamous non small cell lung cancer setting we do have room for further penetration in particular in the pd l1 patient population in the u s and that s where the team is focused and also we are seeing very rapid uptake with our keynote 407 approval at the end of october and we re penetrating the squamous cell carcinoma patient also very significantly so i think in the u s i would say it s really in the pd l1 negative population where there s opportunity for further growth in the non squamous patients i would highlight outside the u s and just to reiterate that we re very early on in the launch outside the u s in lung cancer in fact most of our growth outside the u s is primarily being driven off of the pd l1 high express patient population in keynote 024 so we re just rolling out our chemo combinations around the world and anticipate significant growth outside the u s in lung teri loxam senior vice president investor relations and global communications great thanks for your questions chris we ll move on to the next caller please operator it s from david risinger with morgan stanley david risinger morgan stanley analyst so i just wanted to go back to the margin opportunities beyond 2019 it seems like merck is increasingly becoming more of a specialty focused company and to that end many specialty biopharma companies can generate higher margins simply because they don t need primary care infrastructure and the other costs associated with a much broader portfolio and so could you discuss opportunities to further streamline merck s cost structure in future years as you continue to pivot the company and then second with respect to the data on february 16 the abstracts are coming out on monday the 11 at 5 p m so will we see the key data in the abstract release or will we really have to wait for the data on the 16th ken frazier chairman and chief executive officer all right dave thanks for the question maybe i ll take the first part and then roger can take the second part so as you look at the profile of the business given the mix of our portfolio you are correct that as we go forward we continue to believe that there is an opportunity to shift as we move to the more specialty focused business to continue to optimize the resources we have on primary care i think the important point though is this isn t a new thing for us in fact when we pointed this out in the past we ve actually been able to grow on an eps basis through the years even when we didn t have sales growth at the same time we were standing up an oncology franchise from scratch and investing meaningfully into r d and so we did that because we have already started really harvesting some of the primary care resources we have in the marketplace primarily through selling forces we ve been reducing selling forces over the last several years to be able to do that and there s opportunity for us to continue to do that going forward that s why we do believe that we haven t we re going to continue to see sg a get better as a percentage of sales despite the fact that we re already at an industry best in class position with the fact that we still have the primary care resources in place although less than they used to be so that is an opportunity that s out there and we re going to be driving it over the next couple of years as we move forward so that is something you should look for as we go forward i think the thing that s important to know is while we re getting the favorable impact from mix obviously given the strong volume growth and margin you get from positive mix we do have the headwinds at the gross margin line that we ve talked about that s going to cause gross margin to be roughly flat so the operating margin expansion we re going to see will come from that sg a leveraging we re talking about as well as the r d i mentioned earlier teri loxam senior vice president investor relations and global communications and roger you want to comment on roger perlmutter president right and david you re referring at february 16 to the renal cell carcinoma data from keynote 426 of course on february 16 is also the pdufa date for the 054 study in adjuvant melanoma but i think you re referring to the 426 data and the complete data of course will be presented then there will be an abstract that appears before hand the abstract has some data and depending on what you view as key there s some material in it we re eager to gain publication also of the complete analysis just as soon as we can so there will be various different parts of the data coming out but the main presentation on the 16th is the part that i would focus on teri loxam senior vice president investor relations and global communications thanks for your questions dave darla we ll move on to the next caller please operator it s from umer raffat with evercore isi umer raffat evercore isi analyst good morning thanks so much for taking my questions first perhaps roger i feel like there s a trial which hasn t come up very much at all on merck conversations which is your stage 3 lung trial keynote 799 and it s my understanding that it s a first line trial within stage 3 which would potentially position keytruda before the current label for infancy however what i noticed was your slide today calls it a second line trial so i just wanted to clarify that a and b on the pneumococcal vaccine side i know there s a couple of pfizer patents which you guys have prosecuted in the past and now appealing and my question is as it stands currently and let s say the appeal doesn t go favorably do you have the freedom to operate roger perlmutter president ok with respect to keynote 799 just to provide a higher altitude context for this from the very beginning our concern with respect to administering keytruda in the setting of radiotherapy has been pneumonitis and we know that from a variety of different studies previously that we had come to associate proximity of radiotherapy with keytruda administration with more inflammation in the lungs so 799 has a safety an important safety component which is the administration of keytruda in combination with chemotherapy plus radiotherapy in different cohorts for the question of whether or not pneumonitis feeds 10 because that s really an important issue these are patients the actual study population is a population that has undergone resection but is not widely disseminated sorry let me get this right the actual population is a population of individuals who have lung cancer that is radio responsive potentially radio responsive and who can receive that in a first line environment because they won t receive prior systemic chemotherapy if that was your question ken frazier chairman and chief executive officer and to your question with respect to v114 let me say that we continue to believe that we will have freedom to operate in that space and recently the ipr ruling from the ppav was in our favor on a number of the patents that we have challenged so we ll see what goes on as we move forward teri loxam senior vice president investor relations and global communications great we ll move on to the next question please operator it s from tim anderson with wolfe research tim anderson wolfe research analyst thank you a couple of questions going back to the very first line of questioning on your pipeline and the perception by investors that at least late stage tends to run on the thin side here you and bristol potentially share a common thread which is all the heavy spending in io has may be crowded out other r d programs so the question i have in this context is something that we asked you maybe about a year ago when is r d spending on keytruda going to peak about a year ago you suggested that wasn t very far off qualitatively but it was never quite clear to me what that meant i know with all the combination programs maybe it doesn t peak anytime soon so that s the first question second question is just on your triple negative breast adjutant trial update on timing of seeing those results and how would you characterize the riskiness of that trial in terms of achieving a positive readout would you say it s low or medium or high risk teri loxam senior vice president investor relations and global communications let s start with rob to talk about the cost first rob davis chief financial officer yes yes good morning tim with r d so if you look at what s driving the bulk of our clinical spend right now it is still keytruda but it s actually now more combination studies than it is monotherapy studies a lot of the monotherapy clinical studies are already starting to peak and come off so really right now what s driving it is the combination studies and then in addition to that importantly the investments in and lenvima will be peaking over the next couple of years too so if you look at total r d it is being driven by those and then obviously our vaccines programs are contributing as well so those are the main group categories and we do think though the bolust of keytruda for latest studies and the broader lenvima studies will peak in the next couple of years so when we ve been talking about that threshold happening it s really those programs that are driving that change where we do think you ll see r d slow down as we move forward obviously though the good news from a long term perspective is roger keeps turning over new positive things so we always have to moderate as we have opportunity to invest but the good news is we have a great pipeline we re investing behind it and we re going to invest you should see a peak in the next couple of years teri loxam senior vice president investor relations and global communications great and roger do you want to address the second question roger perlmutter president right i believe tim that you re referring to the keynote 522 study which is a neo adjuvant study and we did have the opportunity to see early data from the 522 study we had the chance to share those data with the agency and we and they agree that it is important to get additional data with a longer term follow up so that s what we re waiting for for those for that study and once we have those data available we ll have a chance to look at it more carefully and then of course share it with you teri loxam senior vice president investor relations and global communications great thanks for your questions tim we ll move on to the next question operator it s from vamil divan with credit suisse vamil divan credit suisse analyst so one i appreciate the color you gave on the lung cancer side and the commercial uptake there i m just trying to understand the adjuvant melanoma and also the front line renal indications as we need to see the full data on the labels was there anything specific or unique with those two indications that may make the uptake faster or slower than what we ve seen so far in lung cancer and then the second one just going back to the topic of drug pricing if you can just share just what you re assuming in terms of net pricing growth in the u s in 2019 for your guidance and also sort of related to that question in terms of keytruda if you can just sort of share your net pricing assumptions of u s europe and also china would be very helpful teri loxam senior vice president investor relations and global communications so let s start with frank on the adjuvant melanoma rcc and maybe you can just call it broadly on pricing for keytruda before we turn it over to rob for the other part of the question frank clyburn new chief commercial officer well adjuvant melanoma we re actually just starting and got approval in europe for adjuvant melanoma we do think this is a good opportunity for us we have established a very strong foothold in metastatic melanoma so we think this is a good opportunity to expand into adjuvant melanoma as roger mentioned we re waiting on our pdufa date for adjuvant melanoma in the u s and we think we will be competitive there as well with regards to rcc we re excited about the opportunity the study was done across all risk groups and we re looking forward to sharing the data in the next several weeks but we think that this will be a very important opportunity in rcc upon approval as far as keytruda goes with regards to pricing we don t give out specific guidance from a pricing perspective but in the ex u s markets we re seeing very strong reimbursement for keytruda based on a very strong value proposition that we have and we feel as though we re positioned very well from a reimbursement perspective outside the u s and then in the u s we also feel as though we re positioned very well with regards to reimbursement especially because keytruda is reimbursed in part b currently rob davis chief financial officer good morning vamil to your question on the guidance while our guidance range does assume multiple scenarios we don t require any additional pricing in the united states to meet our guidance range teri loxam senior vice president investor relations and global communications right and we re going to try to squeeze in a few more questions i know it s close to the top of the hour next question please carla operator it s from jason gerberry with bank of america jason gerberry bank of america merrill lynch analyst good morning and thanks for taking my question maybe just frank just a follow up on a couple of vamil s questions so in adjuvant melanoma just curious in lung you enjoy a first mover advantage in adjuvant melanoma bristol already has roughly 70 share so just kind of curious how you think you can make inroads if you think the first mover advantage is really that important or if you think you can actually capture share and then my second question just on frontline renal in the u s and may be that you re drawing from your experience that other tumor settings are payers mandating that you they ll only reimburse the specific studied combinations and the reason i ask is i m wondering if there s an advantage at all in terms of how these different tki combinations will be used will physicians ultimately migrate to using different tkis which they re more familiar with and more commonly used or if there s going to be a winner takes all with potentially the study that gets there first with tki thanks frank clyburn new chief commercial officer yes so in all things being equal you would like to be first in most of the indications however we have experienced in several cancer types where we were not first so i ll point you to bladder where we actually launched fifth in the u s and we now have the leading market share in bladder cancer and really it was because of the strong data with keynote 045 and the overall survival benefits so really the oncologists are going to look first and foremost to the data and we feel as though keynote 054 is a very strong data set and we feel as though will be competitive the other thing i would also say is that in the community especially in the u s because of the breadth of our program and because of the use in lung cancer in head and neck and now in gastric and other cancer types we feel as though the community s very familiar with using keytruda they re giving us very strong feedback on the profile of keytruda and we think that s going to help us not only in adjuvant mel but also being second in renal cell carcinoma and then the last one i mentioned on renal cell carcinoma is when we share the data in the next several weeks we feel as though as roger has highlighted with top line having overall survival benefit progression free survival benefit and strong response rate so usually the oncologists will make a choice based on the data they see and we re looking forward to upon approval competing in rcc teri loxam senior vice president investor relations and global communications great let s move on to the next question please operator it s from alex arfaei with bmo capital markets alex arfaei bmo capital markets analyst great thank you and roger could you please provide your thoughts or comments on keytruda lifecycle planning obviously after upcoming loe you ll be more dependent on keytruda i realize we re a few years away but given your valuation on potential size of this product it does become an important investment consideration and then for frank could you please provide your estimates of keytruda sales by indication in both u s and ex u s roger perlmutter president so the first question about keytruda so obviously keytruda has been a winning franchise obviously for us and an important growth driver across all the opportunities that we have both as monotherapy as well as combination but we continue to stress the fact that as we look at we don t see ourselves as just a keytruda story so i ve emphasized before the other pillars of growth including and lenvima in oncology what comes after that are 20 unique mechanisms the vaccines programs that we have compound we continue to think that even when we see an important drug like januvia go off patent that merck will have multiple sources of growth going forward and then of course it s really important to recognize that in addition to our internal pipeline we re continuing to seek to augment that pipeline with value creating innovative external assets in business development so we feel very confident about our ability to drive sustained revenue growth going forward recognizing that a major patent expiration is coming teri loxam senior vice president investor relations and global communications great we will turn it over to frank next frank clyburn new chief commercial officer in the u s and this is very directional data due to the claims data lagging several months behind but approximately 65 to 70 of our users non small cell lung cancer melanoma represents about 10 head and neck is approximately 5 bladder approximately 5 and then we also are seeing good growth in the msi high agnostic indication that represents about 5 of our business and then the all other category or other indications represents about 10 outside the u s it s really hard to get specific breakdowns but the majority of our use right now is in lung cancer teri loxam senior vice president investor relations and global communications great thanks frank so to get to our last question operator it s from geoff meachami with barclays geoff meachami barclays analyst good morning guys thanks for the question frank i want to get a bit more detail about the ous dynamics for keytruda in lung you guys saw good trends in 4q but i wasn t sure if we re already at an inflection point based on the cadence of reimbursement maybe just be helpful to go through how you see the pace of share gains in europe in lung over the balance of the year and then roger at a higher level how are you guys thinking about the balance of therapeutic areas in the pipeline i mean obviously you want to press your advantage in oncology but is expanding other existing categories a strategic priority or is there a capacity for a new therapeutic category thank you teri loxam senior vice president investor relations and global communications let s start with frank frank clyburn new chief commercial officer sure so in europe i ll give an example so right now we have reimbursement in most of the european union for keynote 024 and that s where you re seeing a lot of the growth on our monotherapy indication with 189 we have reimbursement in germany austria netherlands and a couple of other markets but we re very early on in getting an uptake for 189 broadly in europe and i anticipate that will come throughout the year very similar ramp to what we saw back when we launched keynote 024 so think of that the timing you should be thinking about for that ramp in addition to that as mentioned japan we think is a very significant opportunity now with not only the approval of 189 but 407 and also keynote 42 so we think japan provides a very good opportunity outside of the u s and then as mentioned we re in the very early stages in china with just our first launch in second line melanoma so we see also outside the us significant opportunities for growth there roger perlmutter president yeah and this is roger if i might i d say also today the phmp announced that they adopted a positive opinion with respect to 407 in europe so with that of course reimbursement will be required in most markets and will take some time but it s going to advance that still further in terms of the balance of therapeutic areas geoff our interests certainly my interest is in having the greatest possible impact on improving and extending human life wherever we see that and so we re not going to be down to any particular therapeutic area if you look at the kinds of things that we re doing look at the work that s taking place in hiv right now mk 8591 is an extraordinary molecule the phase 2 data in combination with we hope we will have an opportunity to present those data probably sometime around the middle of the year and this is really a remarkable compound in terms of its potency the durability of the treatment effect and it changes the landscape in a lot of ways in terms of how you think about hiv treatment that s a therapeutic area which doesn t get enormous amount of attention externally but which we re putting a lot of effort into just as we re putting a lot of effort into other areas so there s a lot of work going so ken frazier chairman and chief executive officer so let me close by thanking you for joining us we had a strong 2018 we re confident going forward in our execution and our pipeline and our future we believe that we re well positioned to drive sustained revenue growth and we also expect meaningful operating margin expansion over time and that s largely the result of a differentiated pipeline that we believe will actually position merck well going forward so thank you teri loxam senior vice president investor relations and global communications that concludes our call thank you darla thanks everyone operator duration 62 minutes call participants teri loxam senior vice president investor relations and

56 billion to support poor farmers and reduced the tax burden for the middle class on friday as it looked to rally support from voters with the final budget before a general election heading into polls that must be held by may prime minister narendra modi is facing discontent over depressed farm incomes and doubts over whether his policies are creating enough jobs advertisement and with opinion polls suggesting that the ruling bharatiya janata party bjp could lose its parliamentary majority the government delivered a budget to shore up support in the countryside where two thirds of indians live and among the urban salary earning middle class the interim budget for 2019 2020 offered direct cash support of 6 000 rupees to 120 million poor farmers and allocated more funds for a rural jobs guarantee scheme and rural development like building roads and homes vying with an opposition that has also trumpeted budget straining populist measures to support from poorer voters the government said it would launch a pension scheme for workers in the unorganised sector which employs some 420 million people the budget proposals also reduced the burden for the lower middle class by exempting people earning up to 500 000 rupees from income tax from an earlier cap of 250 000 rupees advertisement still the measures announced on friday were aimed at putting money into pockets quickly this is not just an interim budget this is a vehicle for the developmental transformation of the nation acting finance minister piyush goyal told the lower house of parliament as bjp lawmakers thumped their desks and chanted modi modi advertisement india is solidly back on track and marching towards growth and prosperity said goyal who delivered the budget in place of finance minister arun jaitley who was in the united states for medical treatment india was expected to expand 7 2 percent this fiscal year goyal said keeping its slot as one of the world s fastest growing major economies advertisement but a report in the business standard daily the previous day belied the government bullishness over the economy it said that the government has been withholding an official survey that showed india s unemployment rate at its highest in decades garima kapoor an economist at elara capital investment bank in mumbai said the budget favoured farmers older voters workers in the unorganised sector small and medium sized businesses and middle class families advertisement the budget is clearly farm focused with the elections in mind kapoor said the interim budget for 2019 20 allocated 600 billion rupees for a rural jobs programme and 190 billion for building of roads in the countryside slippage the big giveaways resulted in fiscal slippage for a government that has been seeking to drag down its deficit advertisement the budget would put the fiscal deficit for the year ending on march 31 at 3 4 percent of gross domestic product gdp slightly higher than the targeted 3 3 percent goyal set a deficit target of 3 4 percent for 2019 20 instead of the earlier target of 3 1 percent but he went onto project the deficit would come down to 3 percent in both of the following two years advertisement overall the government presented an expansionary budget and prioritised populism over fiscal prudence analysts at investment bank nomura said in a note calling it an election

scott morrison has dismissed bill shorten s tax plan saying it would lead to a weaker economy credit aap by this logic one of the worst taxes is conveyancing duty which discourages people from moving house and the best is a poll tax everyone pays the same dollar amount each year which being impossible to avoid doesn t change behaviour one thing often not mentioned in economics 101 is that tax on the unimproved value of land such as council rates and inheritance taxes score well but these calculations are based on theory and assumptions the first of their limitations is that they ignore the benefits that flow when the taxes are spent when they re spent on government provision of public goods goods or services that would be undersupplied if their provision was left to the private sector they increase allocative efficiency you shouldn t have to go beyond first year economics to learn that changes in the price of something have two effects an income effect and a substitution effect people who believe an increase in income tax which is a price discourages work and a cut in income tax encourages it are focusing on the substitution effect and ignoring the income effect it s true that a higher rate of income tax should discourage work by reducing the monetary benefit you get from it relative to the benefit you get from not working that is from enjoying more leisure it thus should encourage you to substitute leisure for work that is work less if the prime minister was really on about encouraging more work his tax cuts would be aimed at working mothers by contrast lowering the tax on work should encourage people to substitute work for leisure work more trouble is the income effect works the opposite way increasing income tax reduces your after tax income if you don t want your income to fall you have to do more work not less similarly cutting income tax increases your after tax income encouraging you to work less the fact that the income effect and the substitution effect pull in opposite directions means economic theory can t tell us whether or not tax increases discourage work to answer that question you have seek out empirical evidence from the real world in doing so you ll make up for theory s implicit assumption that money is the only factor motivating people to work if that s what you think you ve got a lot to learn about human nature loading the empirical evidence says changes in the rate of income tax for primary earners the main person a family relies on for income who s usually working full time aren t great it s only secondary earners often women working part time whose hours of work are much influenced by increases or decreases in income tax this is pretty obvious when you think about it the number of hours worked by full time employees is set by their boss whereas part timers have some degree of control over the hours they work certainly they decide whether they want to move from part time to full time let me tell you politicians motive for tax cuts is almost always more political than economic if morrison was really on about encouraging more work his tax cuts would be aimed at working mothers not the highly paid full timers they are aimed at but there s another empirical test of his confident assertion that high rates of tax discourage economic growth and low rates encourage it if that were true it should also be true that countries with high tax rates have low living standards whereas countries with low tax rates have high living standards politicians motive for tax cuts is almost always more political than economic try as they might however economists have never been able to find an inverse correlation between the level of taxes and a country s rate of growth for a start the poor countries have much lower rates of total taxation than the rich ones rich countries have high tax rates so they can enjoy the many benefits of being rich the welfare state good public infrastructure good health care good education and much else the organisation for economic co operation and development regularly publishes figures for their 35 member countries rate of total taxation federal and state as a percentage of gross domestic product its latest figures for 2017 show its rich country members ranging from 46 per cent for france and denmark to 23 per cent for ireland sweden is on 44 per cent germany on 37 5 per cent the average for the whole oecd is 34 per cent with us on about 28 per cent and the united states on 27 per cent but with a much bigger budget deficit
as per our analysis over the past several months that the global economy in 2019 will slow down we are now starting to see clear signs of deceleration at a rate faster than expected alarming data recently caught the eye of investors and was reinforced by poor data releases from china japan and the eurozone china s growth rate is at its lowest rate since the year 1990 now only at 6 4 the eurozone economy began 2019 with activity growing to its lowest pace in more than five years and expected to grow at a rate of 1 8 year on year following a decline in q3 and q4 2018 the imf cut its estimate for global growth this year to 3 5 from 3 7 due to heightened trade tensions and rising interest rates it s irrefutable that global growth is in a synchronized slowdown with inflationary pressures continuing to be almost non existent in most of all major economies the only major economy that s still growing at a healthy pace is the united states but no economy is an island by itself the global economy has peaked in the first quarter of 2018 but the us economy got an extra boost in 2018 from the tax reforms which has delayed signs of slowing down until this year the us economy according to the federal reserve will only grow by 2 3 compared to 3 in 2018 projections point to an even slower growth in 2020 which is likely to be growth below 2 based on our own analysis where is the good news despite a weaker economic outlook there s some good news almost all the major central bankers are acknowledging the fact that the risks to the global economy are increasing and are talking about a continuation or a restart of quantitative easing it seems that the latest market correction or mini bear market that we saw in late 2018 was a wake up call while bear markets are usually the result of an economic recession market crashes can increase recession risks as asset prices melt down this also can drag the global economy into a recession so what we are seeing now contrary to what we were seeing in 2018 are more dovish central bankers let us look at some details 1 the united states after the u s federal reserve embarked on its plans to normalize interest rates by hiking them several times during the past two years the fed is now showing willingness to listen to investors worries about a flattened yield curve and weakening business and consumer sentiment the fed finally woke up and introduced the word â patientâ into the statement and removed all references to rate increases so the door is open for zero rate increases in 2019 powellâ s statement in light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures the committee will be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support these outcomes more importantly it now appears that the fed will consider ending its bond portfolio runoff earlier than previously announced which also is a sign that the fed does not want to derail the economy 2 europe and japan we also heard last week from two major global central banks for both japan and the eurozone that quantitative easing needs to continue because of a poor inflation outlook there s no need or willingness to hike interest rates the eurozone continues to delay its plans to hike rates and most likely this will continue for several years in my opinion 3 china as for the bank of china it is using every tool available to it in terms of quantitative easing to stimulate its faltering economy this is ironic to see that the central bankers of these major economies were so upbeat about global growth last year and being completely wrong this kind of synchronized recognition of risks by central banks and coordinated efforts to stabilize the global economy can have some wonderful results if the decisions are taken at the right time meaning not being too late today is not too late and in my opinion the deteriorating situation that would cause a global recession can be delayed several years in fact if executed properly these international bankers have a good chance of shifting the economy back to growth next year and thus pushing any recession risks until 2022 at least there remains one big hurdle to be overcome which is a trade deal between the united states and china the recent trade war had a big negative impact on the global economy and once this issue is resolved then we can be more confident that recession risks will dissipate i would like to reiterate my views on this point that both the u s and china presidents are aware that they have no choice but to resolve the situation and so i believe we are likely to see a deal sooner rather than later the bottom line is that with all central bankers on board to rekindle growth i m even more confident today that we will not see a global recession before the year 2022 why is inflation so stubbornly low inflation in the united states has remained stubbornly low despite stellar economic growth last year in fact inflation has been consistently lower than the fed target rate even in 2018 we have touched on this subject before the reason behind such low inflation can be attributed largely to both an aging population and lower population growth rate economic growth comes mostly due to population growth as more and more people enter the workforce start generating and spending money for example the baby boom generation contributed to a growing population with increased spending and consumption needs in today s aging global population and decreasing birth rates in the us and more notably in other major economies we do not have this luxury anymore this means that the u s and other developed economies are more fragile today because demographics just do not support them economic growth and a minimum level of inflation are healthy but as population growth declines it has been very difficult to achieve any meaningful inflation we should keep in mind that slowing population growth in europe and japan has resulted in an inflation rate that s non existent and even deflationary countries like germany and japan recently resorted to negative interest rates to boost their respective economies one day in the future the united states may have to do the same by going into negative interest rates too in order to support its economy listen to what the bond markets are saying the bond markets are rarely wrong especially the long term ones and they all indicate that the lack of inflation and continued deflation for some economies will persist let us look at the long term chart trend below is the 10 year us treasury bond yield since 1962 we can notice that we have been so far in a 29 year period of interest rate declines and this trend is not changing even worse for the 10 year german bond yields the 10 year yields of the german bonds have been in straight declines since the 2007 2008 financial crisis and the yields dipped below zero in 2018 following the brexit scare the hunt for yield will continue in my opinion counting on growth alone when it comes to investing is no longer a viable option in an environment where growth is slow inflation is low and interest rate trends continue to decline the hunt for high yield will continue and will become even stronger not all high yields are equal in the current environment high yield stocks and securities that rely less on economic growth are set to outperform asset classes such as quality long term bonds preferred stocks and high yield low growth stocks are the best positioned to outperform another added advantage of securities such as preferred stocks and bonds is lower price volatility source our aim at high dividend opportunities is to achieve high yields of 9 while increasing allocation to more conservative picks that can be defensive during economic slowdowns one strategy to achieve such high yields is by pairing higher yields of 10 that carry a higher volatility with high yields of 7 with much lower price volatility than the s p 500 index such as preferred stocks bonds and baby bonds the overall volatility that we have been able to achieve recently has been similar to the s p 500 index but with up to five times the dividend yields as an example some great preferred stock closed end funds cefs can give you a very juicy yield with a very low price volatility these cefs include flaherty crumrine claymore preferred securities income fund ffc yield of 7 5 we recently recommended ffc to both our investors and followers it has a beta volatility ratio of 0 22 which means that its price is less volatile than the s p 500 index by 88 to read our recent report on ffc click here ffc we recently recommended ffc to both our investors and followers it has a beta volatility ratio of 0 22 which means that its price is less volatile than the s p 500 index by 88 to read our recent report on ffc click here nuveen preferred income securities fund jps yield 7 6 this is another preferred stock cef that we also recently recommended to our investors and followers jps has a beta volatility ratio of 0 22 similar to ffc above this means that its price is less volatile than the s p 500 index by 88 to read report on jps click here this is another preferred stock cef that we also recently recommended to our investors and followers jps has a beta volatility ratio of 0 22 similar to ffc above this means that its price is less volatile than the s p 500 index by 88 to read report on jps click here we are currently publishing a series of articles recommending low volatility individual preferred stocks our most recent recommendations include compass diversified holdings 7 25 series a non cumulative preferred shares codi pa landmark infrastructure partners lp lmrkn enstar group ltd preferred e esgro among others pairing high yield lower volatility stocks and securities such as preferred stocks with very high yielding ones such as the etracs monthly pay 2xleveraged us small cap high dividend etn smhb yield 20 can result in enormous yield with reasonable price volatility for our recent report on smhb click here by using such a strategy our portfolio currently yields north of 10 and still able to sustain a volatility ratio that s very acceptable to many income seekers in fact a large part of our investment community are retirees and near retirement our views and predictions for 2019 with central bankers across major economies putting their weight to rekindle economic growth recession risks will be reduced and pushed back till the year 2022 or later this also will support equity prices and i believe that the s p 500 index while it remains technically challenged should reach well above the 3 000 level in 2019 the year 2019 should be a good year for equities growth stocks will recover some of their recent losses and should see renewed interest however lower economic growth and low inflation means that the hunt for yield will continue high dividend stocks and sectors which have had a stellar performance so far in 2019 will continue to outperform the best strategy for income investors is to remain well diversified into the high yield stocks and sectors while increasing allocation to preferred stocks and bond like stocks we have new recommendations coming soon stay tuned disclosure our investors members of high dividend opportunities get a first look on all of our high dividend picks

chairman and chief executive officer thanks karen and good morning everyone greetings from the epicenter of the polar vortex in the fourth quarter the itw team delivered solid earnings growth and margin expansion fourth quarter eps was in line with the midpoint of our guidance and increased 8 10 excluding currency with operating margin up 70 basis points to 24 and after tax return on invested capital up 320 basis points to over 27 for the full year the itw team delivered high quality earnings growth of 15 record operating income record operating margin and record return on invested capital free cash flow was up 10 and we invested over 600 million in our businesses for growth and productivity in addition we returned more than 3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases throughout 2018 we continue to make significant progress on the execution of our enterprise strategy as evidenced by 110 basis points of margin improvement from our enterprise initiatives over the course of the year we made really good progress on organic growth acceleration in better than half of our operating divisions as we discussed in our investor day back in december our focus now is on getting the other 36 of our divisions that are not yet growing to their potential moving more briskly down that path and it s a major focus for us for the next couple of years there s no doubt that 2018 had its challenges raw material cost inflation tariff uncertainties decelerating auto production and currency headwinds in the back half of the year our ability to power through these challenges and deliver another year of record results as evidence of the performance power of the itw business model and the resilience of our high quality diversified business portfolio as we head into 2019 i m confident that we are well positioned to deliver another year of meaningful progress down the path to itw s full potential and to our 2023 performance goal before i turn the call over to michael let me conclude by recognizing and thanking my itw colleagues around the world for the great job that they continue to do in serving our customers and executing our strategy with excellence michael over to you michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer thanks scott and good morning let s stay on slide 5 and recap a few more highlights for the fourth quarter gaap eps was 1 83 an increase of 8 as we managed through some international end markets softness in two segments the solid execution and delivered earnings per share at the midpoint of our guidance organic revenue was up 1 with solid 4 growth in north america offset by a 2 decline in international markets i ll provide some additional color on what we saw in north america and international markets in a couple of minutes pls was 90 basis points this quarter a little bit above our full year rate of 70 basis points operating margin performance was solid as margins improved 70 basis points with 110 basis points from enterprise initiatives lower price cost margin dilution headwind finally free cash flow increased 18 to 727 million 120 in net income and we repurchased 500 million of our shares in the quarter moving to slide 6 for detail on fourth quarter operating margin we ve expanded operating margin every quarter this year and the fourth quarter was no different in fact we did better than last quarter with 70 basis points of improvement year over year versus 30 basis points in q3 all year our teams have continued to execute well in enterprise initiatives consistently contributing 100 basis points or more of margin improvement every quarter and the impact is broad based in the fourth quarter enterprise initiatives benefits ranged from 80 to 120 basis points across each one of our seven segments as i mentioned price cost margin dilution improved narrowing from 70 basis points in the second quarter to 60 basis points in the third quarter and now 40 basis points in the fourth quarter throughout the year we continue to take decisive pricing actions to offset cost inflation and tariff impact as planned on a dollar basis price more than offset raw material costs this quarter and for the full year all in operating margin expanded by 70 basis points in the fourth quarter to 24 the highest q4 operating margin in itw s history now we ll look at segment performance starting with slide 7 the table on the left provides some additional color on our fourth quarter organic growth rates by segment and by region as i mentioned north america continued its solid growth pattern with 4 this quarter similar to third quarter and first half of the year north america has really been steady and strong all year ending the year up 4 you can see some really good organic growth numbers in north america with for example food equipment welding both up 7 polymers and fluids up 6 for the full year every segment delivered positive organic growth in north america ranging from 2 to 11 international was more of a challenge specifically in two segments with organic growth down 2 in the fourth quarter compared to up 2 in the first half of the year the international market challenges that we re experiencing are not broad based and relate to just two segments automotive oem and specialty excluding those two segments our international growth in q2 would have been four points higher at plus 2 more on that in the next few slides i should just point out that china overall was down slightly at minus 2 with again lower sales in automotive and specialty only the other five segments saw positive demand trends as evidenced by for example test and measurement and electronics up 12 welding up 22 and polymers and fluids up 9 for the full year china was up 3 let s go into the segment details starting with automotive oem organic growth was down 4 this quarter north america being positive 2 was not enough to offset a meaningful reduction in build rates in europe and china for the full year automotive oem organic growth was flat as the auto builds in regions that are relevant to itw all declined if you look at 2018 s full year organic growth compared to builds by region we delivered significant above market growth in two of our key markets north america and china in north america we grew 3 versus builds down 1 and in china organic growth was 3 versus builds down 4 in europe the implementation of mandated new emissions testing procedures in q3 caused significant auto production disruption in the back half of the year we re confident that our below build rate revenue declines in the second half are a function of mix what models passed the new emissions testing procedures and when and not the result of any material share loss our new program wins in europe in 2018 were very strong as is our new program pipeline there we remain confident that our european auto businesses are well positioned to deliver consistent above market growth and that they will get back to doing so over the next several quarters with respect to the european market production issues i referenced a minute ago our auto team on the ground expect that they will work themselves through over the next several quarters and that conditions will begin to normalize in the back half of the year fourth quarter operating margin declined 150 basis points almost entirely due to price cost headwinds as you know pricing actions take longer to implement in the automotive market it is encouraging though that for the full year this segment s operating margin of 22 5 was down only 30 basis points with the benefits of enterprise initiatives essentially offsetting price cost headwinds moving on to slide 8 food equipment had a strong quarter and delivered accelerating organic revenue growth of 5 its highest quarterly growth in four years as overall demand continued to improve across the board north america grew 7 with equipment up 9 and service up 4 foodservice was up 11 and retail i e sales to grocery stores turned positive as we began to lap the difficult comps that we ve talked about on prior calls growth in institutional end markets continues to be very strong and was up double digits with particular strength in the education and lodging categories international markets were solid 2 up 3 with good growth in both equipment and service as expected test and measurement and electronics organic revenue was flat against the tough comp of 9 organic growth in the fourth quarter of 2017 test and measurement was down 1 due to this difficult year over year comparison electronics was up 2 while this quarter had a tough comp full year organic growth was solid at plus 4 and i should point out that fourth quarter operating margin improved by 140 basis points to 24 8 a record for the segment now on to slide 9 welding continued its strong run with 8 organic growth this quarter which is impressive versus a comp of 6 growth last year demand was strong across the board with global equipment up 7 and consumables up 8 the industrial business was up 7 commercial up 8 and oil and gas up 9 by region north america was up 7 and international up 11 polymers and fluids organic growth was 4 with 7 growth in automotive aftermarket which benefited from a new product launch and polymers was up 4 with strong product sales in asia pacific offsetting a 4 decline in fluids which included a significant amount of pls and a tough comp at plus 5 last year turning to slide 10 construction organic sales were down 1 as our north american commercial sales were down 10 primarily due to project timing in our warehouse growing business north america residential was essentially flat with 5 growth in renovation and remodel offset by decline in new construction europe was a bright spot with sales up 6 australia and new zealand sales were down 5 due to a slowing residential construction market there specialty organic sales were down 2 against the tough comp of plus 5 last year this segment also had over 100 basis points of pls in the quarter international organic sales were down 8 with some of the same soft spots that we saw in the third quarter including appliance components and graphics equipment sales were a bright spot up 4 and our hi cone division which we saw at our investor day was up 13 moving on to slide 11 and full year 2018 performance 2018 was a record year for eps operating income operating margin of 24 3 and after tax return of invested capital of 28 2 operating margin was up 60 basis points driven primarily by another year of strong execution of enterprise initiatives contributing 110 basis points free cash flow was up 10 to 2 4 billion with free cash flow conversion of 95 slightly below our target primarily due to the combination of modestly higher capex investments and slightly elevated inventory levels at year end due to higher material costs finally we executed 2 billion in share repurchases and increased the dividend by 28 this year looking back at 2018 we delivered on the annual eps guidance that we provided as we entered the year thus continuing our track record of exceeding our annual guidance for the past six years the consistency and quality of our financial performance as summarized here for 2018 are a testament to the power of itw s proprietary business model our high quality diversified business portfolio and strong execution by the itw team let s now turn to slide 12 in 2019 guidance we are reiterating our full year eps guidance from investor day in december eps of 7 90 to 8 20 with a midpoint of 8 05 which represents 6 growth year over year we now expect organic growth in the range of 1 to 3 compared to a range of 2 to 4 previously this reduction is entirely related to taking a more conservative risk adjusted view with regards to auto builds and semiconductor related demand in 2019 this range also includes pls of about 80 basis points which is unchanged from december we continue to firm up the projects and activities related to enterprise initiatives and are confident that they will deliver 100 basis points of operating margin expansion independent of volume also included in our plan are higher restructuring expense versus 2018 and we have a particularly heavy restructuring agenda in q1 this is driven to a significant degree by actions we are taking to right size our automotive oem and specialty businesses in europe the price cost equation remains pretty dynamic but margin headwinds should continue to moderate as the majority of raw material costs appear to have stabilized and we have strong pricing momentum heading into the year with the vast majority of planned pricing actions already implemented 2019 tariff expectations remain around 60 million which is based on current and announced tariffs including the potential impact of these three growing from 10 to 25 in march we continue to view the overall tariff impact as manageable given the fact that we are largely a produce what we sell company and that we only source approximately 2 of our spend from china given the differentiated nature of our product offerings across the company we expect to be able to offset the impact of any incremental raw material cost inflation and tariff impacts that might arise in 2019 with pricing actions on a dollar for dollar basis at a minimum just as we did in 2018 finally we expect free cash flow conversion at or above 100 of net income share repurchases of 1 5 billion and a tax rate in the range of 24 5 to 25 5 up slightly from 24 5 in 2018 due to the non repeat of discrete items taking a closer look at the first quarter we should point out that we expect that the first half of 2019 will be a little more challenging than what is typical for us in terms of year over year comparisons due to more difficult comps more currency headwind in the first half versus the second half of the year and higher q1 restructuring costs specifically in q1 we have 0 07 of currency headwind at current rates the impact of higher restructuring also 0 07 and 0 05 of tax rate headwind due to a discrete 14 million tax item that we recognized in q1 of last year there s also one last shipping day in q1 which is another approximately 0 02 headwind to eps and one and a half percentage points headwind to organic growth it s important to note that we have an extra shipping day in q3 as a result we expect q1 eps in the range of 1 73 to 1 83 an essentially flat organic growth however coming out of q1 the headwinds i ve just described start to moderate roughly 2 3 or 0 14 of the expected currency headwind this year is in the first half restructuring activities as we discussed are front end loaded this year and price cost margin impact should moderate as we go through the year it s important to note that our full year guidance is based entirely on current demand run rates existing and announced price cost impacts known enterprise initiative benefits and what we believe is a prudently risk adjusted posture with regard to 2019 demand expectations in auto and semiconductor end to end markets we do not have any projections of demand improvement versus current levels in our 2019 guidance however given what i just described and the fact that revenue comps are much easier in the second half of the year year over year revenue and earnings growth comparisons will get increasingly positive as we move through the year on slide 13 we provided an eps range for 2019 versus 2018 organic growth of 1 to 3 at our normal incremental margin of 35 contributes to 0 20 to 0 30 to eps growth benefits from enterprise initiatives add another 0 25 to 0 35 lower share count represents the impact on the 2 billion of share repurchases completed in 2018 and the 1 5 billion planned for 2019 combined they contribute approximately 0 25 a share at current exchange rates we anticipate 0 20 impact from foreign currency and approximately 2 3 of that impact is expected in the first half of the year as we talked about and finally we ve moved a few things into other on this bridge this includes our expectations for higher restructuring this year approximately 0 10 with 0 07 of that in q1 a higher tax rate than 2018 due to the non repeat of discrete items which is a 0 05 headwind partially offset by lower interest expense by savings on the 1 35 billion in bond maturities in march and april these three items and a few other puts and takes combined to reduce eps by 0 10 to 0 20 you ll note that there s no accommodation for potential m a activity specifically the potential divestitures that we talked about at investor day our guidance is all in meaning that the baseline presented here assumes our portfolio as it is today we are making good progress on our potential divestitures and we ll update you on our progress as we go through the year importantly as we said before any eps dilution from divestitures will be completely offset by incremental share repurchases and are therefore eps neutral finally we ve provided our views on organic growth outlook by segment for full year 2019 on slide 14 these are based on current run rates adjusted for seasonality and are obviously influenced by year over year comparisons as we go through the year it is important to note that there s no expectation of demand acceleration embedded in our guidance we see solid growth in welding of 3 to 6 down from 2018 but just as a function of the more difficult 10 comparison year over year food equipment has good momentum and pretty easy comps in the first half and are expected to be up 3 to 5 for the full year construction of 1 to 4 which also includes a number of meaningful new product launches test measurement incorporates a more cautious sales expectation for equipment related to semiconductor manufacturing those sales represent approximately 200 million and are expected to be down double digits in 2019 this creates a drag of two percentage points of organic growth to the test and measurement and electronics segment polymers and fluids and specialty all with low single digit growth expectation and automotive as we mentioned we re being pretty cautious with sales expected to be flat to down 4 despite the fact that third parties such as ihs are expecting positive growths in the auto builds in 2019 lastly a comment about quarterly guidance from day one back in 2013 our strategy has been centered on leveraging itw s powerful and proprietary business model to its full potential and in doing so positions the company to deliver softer growth with best in class margins and returns over the long term in the early stages of implementing our strategy we believe that providing quarterly guidance was constructive given the number and magnitude of the changes and initiatives that we were implementing across the company we have now progressed far enough in executing our strategy but we believe that providing quarterly guidance is no longer value added given the long term performance focus of the company and our core shareholders as a result we re discontinuing this practice as of this quarter we will continue to provide updated five year performance goals and eps and organic growth guidance annually with that karen back to you karen fletcher vice president of investor relations ok thanks michael cheryl let s open up the lines for questions questions and answers operator our first question comes from andy casey from wells fargo securities your line is open andy casey wells fargo securities analyst thanks a lot good morning everybody your guidance is pretty interesting it looks like top line is more or less consistent with the bear case on the stock but the bottom line guide is what you said back in december so a couple of questions on the back end loaded nature of what you just presented first why is price cost negative 50 bps for the year given pricing momentum is carrying over and from the outside it looks like you look at apparent decreases in some of your raw material input costs and then within that do you expect price cost to improve through the year michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer yes so andy price cost was negative 50 basis points from a margin standpoint in 2018 and we are not providing a number for 2019 primarily because it s still a pretty dynamic environment in terms of raw materials as well as potential tariffs that said what you are what you re saying is correct i mean it is reasonable to assume based on what we know today in terms of the price actions we ve taken the expected raw material costs the tariffs including the increase in march from 10 to 25 that may or may not happen it is reasonable to assume that we will continue to make progress on price cost from a margin standpoint in 2019 and certainly we will continue to be positive on a dollar for dollar basis to a degree that s significantly higher actually than what we saw in 2018 so i hope that answers your question andy casey wells fargo securities analyst it does and if i can also follow up on something else michael in your commentary around the first half versus second half q1 midpoint implies about 6 earnings decline year over year but the rest of the year is up around 9 you sound pretty confident that in assuming the current run rates is a majority of that confidence really related to the pull ahead of the seven out of 10 for restructuring in the year into q2 and basically is that a big part of your confidence michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer yes i think what we re pulling forward in the restructuring obviously has a pretty big impact in q1 here of 0 07 some of those benefits will start to show up in the back end of the year many of these projects have a one year payback or better in many cases in addition to the higher restructuring currency it s more of a headwind in q1 the tax rate is a headwind and then we do have one less shipping day as i mentioned in q1 and so scott santi chairman and chief executive officer that we got back in q3 michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer that we got back in q3 that s why the year looks a little different relative to what you re used to from itw but there s some really good reasons behind that and when you pencil it all out you can get comfortable we certainly are comfortable and very confident in our ability to deliver on the guidance that we re providing today andy casey wells fargo securities analyst ok sounds good thank you very much operator our next question comes from jeffrey sprague vertical research your line is open jeffrey sprague vertical research partners analyst thank you good morning everyone i wonder if i can just dig into a couple of segment level detail questions first on automotive and the whole emissions wltp had a log jam in europe your view that it doesn t really sort itself up in the second half is that kind of well grounded in what you re hearing from the oems or is that really kind of just kind of caution on the chaos we ve seen up to this point and it s just kind of a hard to predict how things play out there scott santi chairman and chief executive officer i think it s a little bit of both but more of the latter i want to be careful how i say this but i think the information has in terms of direct customer that s been a little bit up and down just because i think it s a fairly fluid situation but i think our posture from a planning standpoint we believe it s definitely on the conservative side and just to be clear we re saying that things start to mitigate in the back half of normalized but certainly aren t all the way corrected probably we ll begin with some elements of this all the way through the year is our current view jeffrey sprague vertical research partners analyst ok and just on the construction side i m sorry can you elaborate on what drove the commercial weakness in north america and the u s and is there kind of visibility kind of a recovery plan there michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer yes there is so it s a fairly small part of our overall business in north america part of what we do is we provide concrete solutions for warehouse flooring and we had a number of projects that we re scheduled to go in q4 that pushed out to 2019 so it s just primarily a timing issue more than a commentary on what s going on in the commercial construction space jeffrey sprague vertical research partners analyst and maybe one just other really quick follow up do you have some additional restructuring kind of on the shelf for lack of a better term if kind of the macro environment does begin to pick it on as soon as 2019 unfolds scott santi chairman and chief executive officer well i would say we normally operate with a fair degree of contingency planning around our plans whether that s within a particular segment or at the overall company level we certainly have the flexibility to make adjustments as we re talking about here related to auto and specialty in the near term so and that s been sort of normal practice for the company for quite a long time so should things in terms of sort of the external macro environment play out differently than what we re anticipating now and again i think we re taking a pretty conservative posture in terms of our planning approach year then absolutely we would expect to be able to adjust to that and do it in a relatively short order as i said we had a pretty flexible cost structure given how we operate to maybe 20 so we could certainly make those adjustments within a quarter or two jeffrey sprague vertical research partners analyst i appreciate the perspective thank you operator our next question comes from jamie cook credit suisse your line is open jamie cook credit suisse analyst hi good morning first i just wanted to better understand if we think about what your preliminary guide at the analyst meeting the eps is the same as it is today you basically reaffirmed it but your organic growth assumption is a point worse i don t recall if the restructuring number was in there and also fx seems to be more of a headwind so can you just sort of help me understand what s offsetting those headwinds relative to what you guys said at the analyst day and then my second question is just with regards to the organic growth the 2 for this year one would argue in 2018 where the economy was relatively strong you guys put up the same level of organic growth so just comfort level on you can put together or can put up another 2 organic growth in a tougher macro michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer yes so let me start with the first part which is a very fair question in terms of the organic growth guide today being lower than what we guided in december really on the back of being more conservative around automotive builds as well as factoring in the latest view on semiconductor related end markets as we ve gone through these last few months here we ve really firmed up our views in terms of the enterprise savings from enterprise initiatives to specific projects and activities that will deliver 100 basis points of margin improvement as well as other discretionary cost items and so that s really what s driving the majority of our confidence and ability to maintain the eps number in addition to that i would say although i m cautious on this given what we saw in 18 the price cost headwinds are certainly looking more favorable today than at the end of last year and then just to be precise the structure i think that we had in our guidance in december is the same number as today and so that number has not changed i think the second part if i remember correctly was around our ability confidence to deliver 1 to 3 organic growth this year similar to last year and i ll go back to how we modeled this which is basically based on current run rates adjusted for seasonality and if you run that out for the year with the adjustments we made in auto and specialty you get to a range of 1 to 3 organic growth we provided a little more detail on the last slide slide 14 in the deck you can see how it kind of pencils out by segment and again these are based on current run rates risk adjusted on a couple of areas and in our view pretty cautious and conservative view overall jamie cook credit suisse analyst i guess so just given that it s a weaker macro there are certain segments where you are assuming that your market share is above average and that sort of helps the organic growth i mean can you talk about construction little i m just not sure if market share is contributing more i mean relative to just the overall whatever macro michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer yes i think construction there s significant new product launches on the docket for this year i d say in addition to that i wouldn t underestimate the impact of price this year relative to 18 and so if you add all that up these are the numbers that make up the guidance by segment and 1 to 3 in total jamie cook credit suisse analyst ok thank you i ll get back in the queue operator our next question comes from joel tiss bmo please go ahead your line is open joel tiss your line is open and moving along our next question comes from andrew kaplowitz citibank please go ahead andrew kaplowitz citi analyst can you hear me ok michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer yes we got you andrew kaplowitz citi analyst yes scott or mike obviously itw is relatively strong in europe and you did mention that europe would be up a couple of percent instead of down if it weren t for your issues in auto and specialty products so maybe give us a little more color regarding what s going on in europe construction actually looks like strong for you guys given the environment there and so and what s the outlook here as we go through 2019 in europe michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer yes i think the issues on the international side are really isolated to the two segments we talked about i think the other five segments are doing pretty well across the board if you just look at fourth quarter certainly auto specialty were down but we put up some really good numbers in europe construction overall was up 6 welding up 7 food up 3 we ve not seen a big impact from brexit or the u k those markets are pretty stable so we feel pretty confident going into 2019 in terms of modeling our current run rates in that geography scott santi chairman and chief executive officer and just maybe to add i think in terms of i m sorry just another data point is and if you net if you look at our european sales in q3 and q4 net of auto and specialty it was plus 3 in q3 and plus 2 in q4 so we re certainly not which feels pretty stable to us not the 3 to 2 i don t know we re certainly not calling that a trend but sort of down single digit it s pretty solid michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer yes andrew kaplowitz citi analyst ok that s helpful guys and then there a couple of businesses that have been somewhat lethargic over the last couple of quarters they looked like they ticked up a little bit here in the past quarter i look at polymers and fluids and you mentioned that new product intro and auto aftermarket and then within food equipment you mentioned retail refrigeration turning around do these businesses have some sustaining power here going forward in other words are you seeing a little bit more capex from grocery stores for instance in food equipment and does this new product rollout in auto aftermarket does that give you continuing growth in the segment for the next few quarters michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer yes so i d say andy that food equipment certainly feels very good i think the acceleration we have started in second half the strength is broad based on the equipment side service put up a pretty good number here in the retail on the retail side just to be clear we re not seeing a pickup in terms of the capex spend on the grocery side we re really what we re seeing is these are flat to up slightly on a year over year basis as we lapped the more difficult comps but all the benefits that we expected in terms of new product introductions certainly we re seeing those in the second half of the year and we expect those to continue into 2019 so food equipment i d say 3 to 5 feels very good for 2019 polymers and fluids we did benefit from a new product launch in automotive aftermarket i hesitate to say this but we were a beneficiary also of some weather related impact in terms of rain x wiper blades and so that part of the business was up 7 overall that is not a sustainable rate for the full year obviously but i d say also in polymers you re seeing some good progress there in terms of the overall organic growth rate and like i ve mentioned earlier we re seeing the impact of price so certainly some good progress in those two segments and we should expect to continue to see that in 2019 as reflected in the segment outlook we gave you on page 14 andrew kaplowitz citi analyst appreciate it guys operator our next question comes from mig dobre from baird your line is open mig dobre baird analyst yes good morning guys so i want to stick with food equipment here i mean 3 to 5 growth this would probably be the best growth since 14 15 that time range and i wanted to make sure that i understand kind of what the moving pieces are here retail you said feels a little bit better but it s mostly a factor of comps so i m not sure how much you re really expecting this business to grow institutional you mentioned was quite good so maybe you can talk a little bit about the momentum into 2019 i m also wondering just your restaurant business i think that s pretty meaningful as well how that s doing international as well as north america michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer yes mig so the demand we saw really here in q3 q4 was broad based so we ve talked specifically about foodservice which is everything excluding the retail side being up 11 retail turned positive in the low single digits we re not counting on a big pickup in retail in 2019 and it s not that significant portion of our overall business we continue to see a lot of strength on the institutional side up double digits again there are a couple of categories here really around education so k 12 universities as well as lodging and on the restaurant side also double digit growth including which for us is a smaller part of the business on the qsr side international solid up 3 i certainly feel good about the momentum going into 2019 just q4 was best growth rate i think in over four years here so new product introductions are really taking off and we feel we re very pleased with the progress we re making in food equipment mig dobre baird analyst got it that s helpful and then sort of going back to the big picture top line guidance so if you re starting the year flat in q1 and you re guiding on current levels of tam and your comp is getting tougher in q2 by at least 100 basis points should we how about expectations for an organic decline in q2 and then acceleration in the second half on easier comps is that how we should we be thinking about it michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer so mig you should definitely think about it as just given the comps higher growth rates in the back half of the year than in the first half if you just go back and look at 18 i think in 18 we were up 3 organic rounding in the first half we re up 1 in the second half that alone is driving some of the higher growth rates both in terms of organic as well as earnings growth so really the swings you re going to see are really a function of what the comps are on a year over year basis those are the big drivers again there s no demand acceleration assumed here on the contrary if anything we ve dialed it back in certainly in auto as well as semi which we talked about earlier mig dobre baird analyst but there is not something on the products side or i don t know something based on some visibility that you might have that would be able to maybe reassure us that you d be able to cross the tougher comp in q2 versus q1 michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer there s typically every year new products contribute scott santi chairman and chief executive officer and we re not managed for the quarter the quarterly plans we ll give you a q2 update when we get there our expectation is again as michael said we re recent current demand levels and projecting them through the year i m we just go look at q2 well this was a full year and a q1 number i don t recall exactly what q2 organic growth rate is embedded in our plan if we had it and i think mig dobre baird analyst no i appreciate that i was just trying to make sure that we have that s in line with what you guys are thinking that s it scott santi chairman and chief executive officer i think that math is there s nothing funny in the math here this is really straightforward as michael said we are if anything have to dialed back relative to current demand rates in a couple of areas where we think there s some potential risks we re not seeing that it s going to play out that way i think overall that s the smart and prudent approach in terms of our planning and it also highlights the fact that we ve got a lot of earnings growth power from the standpoint of enterprise initiatives and other things going on underneath this not vulnerable to some further erosion in auto if things play out and ultimately we ve got a plan where we believe there s more upside potential than downside that s why we always plan and that s really what we re i think embedded in the approach we re taking in terms of taking the organic growth rate down a percent relative to where we were in december mig dobre baird analyst got it thank you appreciate it operator our next question comes from john inch gordon haskett your line is open george inch gordon haskett analyst thanks good morning everybody michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer good morning george inch gordon haskett analyst michael so wondering if there s kind of an update on the divestitures that you planned for this year and just as kind of corollary to that michael if we were actually to have taken the 2019 divestitures that you ve got out and divested them at beginning of the year kind of pro forma would that have any material impact on the 1 to 3 core growth that you re just betting for 2019 michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer yes so that s a very good question so the impact is these potential divestitures all happen is an improvement in our organic growth rate of about 50 basis points and improvement in our operating margins by 100 basis points so that would assuming that all of those take place this year that s what we would expect to see in 2020 i think that s a fairly optimistic assumption i think we re certainly making good progress and i think a more reasonable planning assumption would be maybe half of them get done this year but none of that is included in the numbers today so certainly you ll see some slightly lower revenues to the effect that if there is eps dilution you ll see higher share repurchases to offset that so that they are eps neutral there s going to be some gains on some of these potential divestitures those are also not included but on pro forma basis it s a meaningful impact and we re making good progress george inch gordon haskett analyst if there some reason you couldn t i mean i know you said half but it s not a bad point right to pick but to some reason if you start to get a cadence going because i m assuming you re not doing them sequentially one after another you ve got kind of books out more than one i mean why couldn t these things hit sooner is it just i guess i don t really understand why because there s not a lot of companies right why we couldn t we get most of this done in 19 michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer i ll pass s that on to the steering committee in charge of the divestiture activities john look we prioritized in terms of the biggest impact of the company we re going to try to get those done for us we re not in a rush here we re going to be very liberate and thoughtful in terms of how we execute of this and maximizing the value for the company and so scott santi chairman and chief executive officer and i ll just quibble a little bit with your perspective in terms of there s a decent amount of work involved in each one in terms of preparing them to separate from itw and all the things we need to do to george inch gordon haskett analyst i look in the ivory tower so i got it scott santi chairman and chief executive officer i don t want to go to that part john but i was just i think we ve got a good cadence we ve got good plans that we are finalizing now in terms of being very deliberate and intentional about how we go back about it but as michael said i think that the reality of it is probably a two year process to move all the way through and of course everything that we can do to make it happen faster we would certainly do that but at this point we also are not that s not the no 1 priority right now so kind of balance with everything else that we are trying to work on and make progress there george inch gordon haskett analyst so just on the polymers business i know michael you called that the auto aftermarket likely not to see that cadence that make sense was there any kind of a pre buy in that business maybe associated with getting ahead of some cost increases or price increases that s also potentially contributing to the 1 to 3 kind of slight deceleration michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer john we did not see that in polymers and fluids and actually in any of our other segments as we went through the fourth quarter here the quarter played out as it usually does on a monthly basis there s really nothing unusual as we mentioned in the quarter including in polymers and fluids george inch gordon haskett analyst the other question i had is oil and gas prices have come down obviously since the december meeting i know we re talking about raw increases but i was wondering about the indirect impact or even direct impact of those hydrocarbon pricings coming down i realize you could buy a lot of metals like in metals derivatives but is there possibly some sort of once we get the impact of this is there some sort of potential net tailwind that kind of begins to accrue to you later this year or something michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer eventually the answer is yes i don t know whether that will be at end of this year or not i mean there certainly is tailwind today on a dollar for dollar basis and as i said earlier while raw material cost increases they re just a carryover from last year still a pretty significant number in 2019 it s less than 2018 and we are certainly significantly ahead on a dollar for dollar basis so to that extent it is providing some tailwind here george inch gordon haskett analyst got it one last one i mean companies used to talk about i think they still do selectively kind of these cost pressures that are embodied by wages if you just focus on the u s what s actually happening to your u s wage cost given what appeared to be tight employment markets i mean are wages going up materially in 19 i don t remember if you call that out much early in 19 versus 18 is that any kind of a factor here scott santi chairman and chief executive officer we have not i think there would be a from the standpoint of aggregate north american wages i am summarizing a lot of individual data points but things are up tens of decimal points maybe relative to sort of planned increases in prior years but nothing that i will consider to be material in terms of the impact on the overall company at this point george inch gordon haskett analyst got it all right thanks guys appreciate it operator and our next question comes from ross gilardi your line is open ross gilardi merrill lynch analyst good morning thanks guys just on auto i think you said that you re assuming flat to negative 4 for 19 can you give us any type of breakdown by region particularly since you were saying that you re not assuming any acceleration in the second half i would just think given like what s going on in china right now to get to flat to negative 4 and just the pressures in that end markets globally that you d have to assume some reacceleration for now to be down more than that michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer yes so there s a lot of uncertainty around the numbers that third parties are providing on a geographic basis i think best i can tell you is when we were together in december the view was that our auto business would be flat on markets that globally would be down 2 to 3 we gave that a further risk adjustment here relative to what we said in december and i can t really give you a view by quarter here as the year plays out i ll give you the actuals when we get through q2 q3 and q4 but i can t really give you a guidance around that scott santi chairman and chief executive officer we got people who study this like ihs out with a projection of plus 2 on builds entirely for the year plus 1 in north america and i think down a couple i think globally they re plus 1 we re at zero to minus 4 they re that it s just one data point but there are people that study this that have i m calling an optimistic view but i think we re back to the comment we re making earlier about making sure that we re appropriately conservative there where there s some uncertainty but we re not i don t think we re on the high side of optimism relative to what most of our these third parties that we look at studying these markets that s going on in 19 we re on the conservative side of them ross gilardi merrill lynch analyst just on the restructuring the 0 07 and i think the 0 10 for the year what is it actually for i mean is it headcount related or is it five year enterprise initiative i think you mentioned where is it again michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer so this is primarily focused on rightsizing our footprint in europe there s two businesses the automotive business as well as the specialty business and beyond that we typically don t comment on specific restructuring projects ross gilardi merrill lynch analyst ok on that michael i mean you had said that clearly there s some pressures guide to what you re describing it earlier but it sounded like if you thought things were normalizing that you re not losing share and it s kind of a timing issue of when the market actually improves so why restructure the european auto business if that s the case michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer well we re just moving faster on some things we still got an acquisition that we did two years ago that is the restructuring i would say is normally normal part of the integration of that business it s a fairly good piece of that we are accelerating some of that given the environment in pause in demand it s a good time to get after some of that there s some things that we ve been that we would ve gotten to anyway it s the easiest way to describe it that i would say we have accelerated into the front end of the year given the pause in the demand these things are in some ways it s better timing if we can get them done when we re not also dealing with some increases and demand that s probably a better characterization of it front end loaded that s what we re doing ross gilardi merrill lynch analyst and just the last one on test and measurement i mean you guys have got 140 basis points of margin expansion with real organic growth in the business in the fourth quarter which is pretty impressive but is that type of a margin expansion sustainable in the 2019 in a flattish environment for that segment michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer i think we said the ways to go in terms of further margin expansion in test and measurement and that s based on what the bottoms up what the team is telling us what you re really seeing is the impact of the enterprise initiatives in test and measurement and i think it s another data point that supports the view that we have and the confidence that we have and the ability to continue to expand margins in 2019 and beyond as we ve talked about in december we believe we have at least another three to four percentage points of margin expansion ahead of us and test and measurement has at least that level of improvement ahead of it in that over the next three to four years ross gilardi merrill lynch analyst ok thank you very much operator our next question comes from joe ritchie goldman sachs your line is open joe ritchie goldman sachs analyst thank you good morning everyone michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer good morning joe ritchie goldman sachs analyst so just on your wltp comments from earlier i just wanted to make sure that i understand it if your platforms are being disproportionately impacted do you have a sense or line of sight on the approval for those platforms getting through the testing requirements and shouldn t that just reverse itself at some point in 2019 scott santi chairman and chief executive officer well it should reverse itself at some point the answer to your question is we don t have a great line of sight because it s a new test and i don t want to speak for the auto oems in europe but what we re hearing is that there s a some uncertainty and some challenges it s not that it can t be done it is a new testing procedure and that the backlog involved in getting all of these all of their models through it has been much more of a challenge than perhaps what s expected i don t know i m not again we re drawing some conclusions over around based on a number of different data points so my answer to your question is absolutely it should sort itself out i think there s still a question how long it takes to do so and that s an element of our let s call it conservatism in terms of our posture around that there is people are still buying cars in europe there s nothing in terms of or consumption data in auto that gives you a whole lot of reason for pause at least to us at this point it s much more about the disruption in the production part relative to the emissions testing regime and i don t really think it s smooth sailing from here let s say in terms of how that all plays out based on what we hear joe ritchie goldman sachs analyst that s fair scott and i guess just a quick follow up on that you guys give us guidance on the whole growth outlook for test measurement and electronics just wondering and i know that you ve got the current run rate but the electronics business i guess we ve been seeing some softness and all and any color on that business specifically and what you are seeing in terms of this perspective will be helpful scott santi chairman and chief executive officer no most of our position in the electronics space is really more i would say mro related so we re not with a couple of exceptions just one in seven we re not sort of upstream in terms of production equipment so that from our standpoint the electronics has been pretty stable but it s but we re able to describe this pretty downstream from the standpoint of where we participate there michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer yes clean room mro items scott santi chairman and chief executive officer mro items non production items operator and our next question comes from ann duignan your line is open ann duignan j p morgan analyst good morning most of my questions have been asked so just philosophic i just wanted to ask about pulling that quarterly guidance i m just curious about timing and what are your thoughts through the fact that with that quarterly guidance the probability is that in the sales side estimates will be more variable and then you re more likely to meet some of these expectations and therefore have greater earnings volatility which actually meant covering the multiple on itself so i m just curious why you chose now to not giving quarterly guidance scott santi chairman and chief executive officer well since we re having this one in six years we thought we would try something different i m just kidding i think ultimately we talked to a lot of our shareholders and there s a fair amount of effort that goes into providing it there is philosophical differences around again what we think the core investor value proposition for itw which is really around strength of competitive advantage in the business model resilience in terms of high quality diversified portfolio all of those things are really oriented toward longer time periods of performance and given all that i think this is we felt like we have as i think michael said in his remarks it was valuable early in the process given talking about the enterprise strategy now and then at this point we ve progressed starting upwards it s not value added anymore and the last thing i would say and this will be a little smirky and i don t intend to be but we listen to your boss jamie dimon who told us that and a lot of companies should be doing this i m just kidding operator and our next question comes from steven fisher ubs your line is open steven fisher ubs analyst thanks good morning i just wanted to follow up on the oil and gas question more from the revenue side of things just wondering to what extent you re seeing any change in momentum in the oil and gas business in the last two three months or so and how that s filtering into your primarily i guess the 3 to 6 growth in your welding business michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer yes our exposure is pretty limited overall to oil and gas it s primarily on the international side in the welding business and we ve just started to see a pickup in oil and gas here in q3 and q4 we gave you the number here and we haven t seen any changes over the last couple of months if that s what you re asking operator and our next question comes from nicole deblase deutsche bank your line is open nicole deblase deutsche bank analyst yes thanks good morning michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer good morning nicole deblase deutsche bank analyst given that some of the i guess some of the commentary around why organic growth is a little bit lower for the full year is semiconductor s electronics i guess i m curious i don t think that that came up in your commentary within t m are you guys actually starting to see a slowdown in semiconductor spend or is that just anticipated to occur throughout 2019 michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer so we did see a slowdown here in q4 not entirely unexpected and again it s in the portion of test and measurement that sells equipment for the upfront manufacturing of in the semiconductor space and we did see a slowdown here in q4 in the past there ve been talks about a pause and then a pick up again in the back end of 2019 and we have taken all that out and basically assumed current run rates based on what we saw in q4 and therefore in our view appropriately risk adjusted for any exposure in semiconductor operator our next question comes from nathan jones from stifel your line is open nathan jones stifel financial corp analyst good morning everyone michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer good morning nathan jones stifel financial corp analyst a couple of follow ups on the welding business there obviously some good organic growth but i know that business does sell a lot of steel so maybe if you could give us some color on what the input is from volumes versus price both in the fourth quarter and what the pricing tailwind to revenue at least is in 2019 michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer yes so nathan we do not break out price versus volume at the enterprise level or by segment including for welding so i m afraid i can t give you that nathan jones stifel financial corp analyst ok no worries just one on the construction business you talked about new product releases on slide for this year can you talk about when you expect those to start hitting the market and any color you could give on the anticipated contribution michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer yes so it s a pretty long list of new products centered around our cordless technology where itw is the market leader they come in throughout the year the various geographies typically the contribution from new products is somewhere in the 1 range in terms of overall revenue growth and we expect it just based on the pipeline to be a little bit higher than that in construction this year operator our next question comes from josh pokrzywinski from morgan stanley your line is open josh pokrzywinski morgan stanley analyst hi good morning michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer good morning josh pokrzywinski morgan stanley analyst just to follow up on michael i get the part of your answer to the last question that you don t really want to break out price at the enterprise level but it seems like some of the confidence in the year comes from maybe a bit more pricey yield and perhaps some commercial initiatives that offset some of that auto commentary is that a fair assessment relative to prior years that you guys just feel like outside of perhaps auto that you re carrying a bit more price than usual and able to kind of hold up at least any downside scenario michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer i don t know if you really thought about it the way you re articulating it i mean but certainly like i said earlier in six out of seven segments so excluding auto there s we ve taken pricing actions to offset raw material cost inflation and tariff impact and so to the extent that we ll probably have a little bit more price coming through in 19 than in 18 and that certainly helps the overall organic growth rate scott santi chairman and chief executive officer but we offset price every year michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer yes we get price every year maybe a little bit more 19 than 18 but it s not a big driver year operator and our next question comes from david raso evercore isi your line is open david raso evercore isi analyst hi good morning i had another question but just wanted to circle back first on the organic sales guide i mean i just wanted to make sure the takeaway is correct the idea of the first quarter being flat the second quarter you do expect it to improve i m just making sure we are all level set just given the idea that it s flat in the first quarter if the first second quarter is not at least one or two it makes the second half obviously a little more of a struggle so i just wanted to make sure we re level set on that so if you can you give us some perspective and then my real question food and welding food and welding are going to be over 55 in dollar terms of your ebit growth i mean inside the organic sales growth in those businesses it s good to see food pick up on a year over year basis in the fourth quarter can you give us any help with not a backlog number an order number just something kind of looking into 19 that give us some perspective of the starting point of growth sort of already booked relative or just given their significance to the overall growth versus 19 scott santi chairman and chief executive officer i ll answer the second and throw it back to michael for the first these are all short cycled businesses are from the standpoint of we get an order today we ship it tomorrow what i can tell you is book to bill in both businesses in q4 was positive so order rates are at or above shipment rates in q4 we don t build these aren t big backlog businesses is my point these are given the way we deliver we get an order today we ship it tomorrow and we don t build backlogs so but from the standpoint of just order rates relative to shipment rates things in q4 in both businesses were pretty solid michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer yes that s where i was going to go with this welding just grew organic 8 on a tough comp they re up 6 in q4 last year food equipment up 5 organic so good momentum in those two businesses in terms of the q1 q2 question without telling you anything new really i mean i think we did say that we have 1 less shipping day in the first quarter which lowers our overall organic growth rate by mathematically a point and a half we do not have that headwind in q2 so i don t know if that helps you in terms of what q2 might look like that s probably the best i can give you david raso evercore isi analyst no i appreciate it just if you do zero 2 then it s 3 5 2 5 it feels a little bit better than zero zero that s all michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer david keep in mind that one and a half percent in q1 mathematically we lose one less day we get that back in q3 david raso evercore isi analyst exactly exactly i just wanted to make sure we weren t starting the second quarter at one or less so it just gets more challenging but no i appreciate it michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer sure karen fletcher vice president of investor relations ok thank you yes thank you so we ve a bit over if you have any other questions or follow up please reach out to me today and thank you for your time this morning operator duration 74 minutes call participants karen fletcher vice president of investor relations scott santi chairman and chief

the safe harbor disclaimer on this slide statements related to future performance by members of our team are subject to these limitations cautionary remarks and conditions now i ll turn the call over to doug doug doug dietrich thanks for the introduction cindi and good morning everyone thanks for taking the time today to join us as i walk you through our results for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2018 and give you my insights on the past year along with our key achievements and then matt will provide more details on our financial results and outlook for the first quarter of 2019 after that i ll conclude with my perspective on 2019 and the most notable trends we re seeing across our businesses to put 2018 in perspective what iâ m most encouraged about is our teamâ s ability to advance our growth strategy and deliver strong financial and operating performance while having to contend with a number of challenging conditions our performance this past year is a testament to our continuous improvement culture and to the mti employees who are the backbone of it alignment of our entire organization behind our culture values and performance objectives has been instrumental in expanding mtiâ s leadership position in many key markets product lines and geographies now let me take you through some of the highlights of the fourth quarter we delivered earnings per share of 1 17 6 increase compared to last year we achieve 5 eps for the full year total sales for the quarter increased 4 marking our sixth consecutive quarter of sales growth provide more detail in my full year remarks on what s driving our growth and our confidence in the trend continuing sales in the minerals businesses grew 3 in the fourth quarter much of this driven by our performance materials segment which grew sales by 6 despite the recent slowdown in the china automotive market metalcasting business drove higher volumes of greensand bonds across asia and north america resulting in a 6 sales growth household and personal care sales increased 50 with the contribution of sivomatic continued solid growth of our pet care products in north america and asia performance in our service businesses was solid as well sales growing 6 driven primarily by higher volumes of refractory products supported by strong steel market conditions total operating income for the quarter was 64 million and we delivered double digit operating margins across all segments cash flows were also strong with the fourth quarter being our highest cash generating quarter of the year key takeaway for the fourth quarter as well as for the year is our ability to tightly manage what was in our control higher raw material energy and logistics costs persisted through the fourth quarter however our pricing actions and operating performance driven by strong productivity improvement and tight expense control allowed us to more than offset these inflationary costs in the fourth quarter as well as for the second half of the year as i mentioned we continue to make progress on our growth initiatives i ll talk about in more details shortly this is the chart that shows our quarterly eps performance for the last several years as i mentioned earlier our eps for the fourth quarter was up 6 compared to 2017 continuing our earnings growth trend this chart shows our full year earnings trend 2018 marked the ninth consecutive year of record earnings for mti reflection of our company s ability to successfully execute on opportunities as well as navigate the challenges faced over the past several years before getting into the specific highlights and how we achieved our top and bottom line results i d like to provide a brief overview of 2018 challenging year but i m proud of what we achieved and the resiliency our team showed foundation business fundamentals and key growth drivers are on solid footing sales increased 8 over the last year to 1 8 billion a record sales level for the company and our earnings per share grew 5 to 4 84 sales in all four of our segments increased during the year we made significant progress in all three facets of our growth strategy geographic expansion new product development and acquisitions from a geographic expansion standpoint asia continued to be a strong growth region for us given the large market opportunities we have there in paper pcc and metalcasting these are the product lines i ve highlighted on previous calls and for good reason they continue to provide attractive near and long term expansion and penetration opportunities to drive growth over the past two years we secured contracts for over 400 000 tons of pcc capacity 165 000 tons of which was secured during the past year our penetration strategy for metalcasting in asia also continues to progress with sales in the region up 7 over last year as i ve mentioned in the past we have significant growth prospects for our metalcasting business in asia i m encouraged with how we ve been able to leverage our deep technical expertise and value proposition to capture new opportunities with foundry customers in the region geographic expansion is occurring throughout asia as well as other regions and across multiple product lines to highlight a few places we saw double digit sales growth in india turkey indonesia and thailand india led the way with sales up 24 driven primarily by metalcasting sales in turkey were up 14 driven by both metalcasting and refractory indonesia s sales grew 21 as a result of increased paper pcc sales and sales in thailand were up 11 driven by both metalcasting and household and personal care second aspect of our growth strategy innovation and new product development has always been a key focus area for mti our actions to drive accelerated new product development are paying off we have a robust pipeline of innovative value added products that continues to be strengthened as we better leverage the voice of our customers emphasize speed of development and utilize standardized processes past year we commercialized 35 new products and increased the speed of development by 21 products have the potential to deliver over 100 million in revenue additionally the amount of revenue we generated in 2018 from our new product pipeline increased 13 over last year we continued to improve the speed of our development and the revenue derived from our new products highlighted many of our new products throughout the year such as the launch of fluoro sorb envirofil and variations of our newyield technology created these specifically to meet the demands of our customers who require environmental sustainable and recycling solutions lastly we also executed on the third part of our growth strategy acquisitions through the addition and successful integration of sivomatic sivomatic met all of our m a criteria and is in excellent strategic fit with our company doubled the size of our pet litter business expanded its global reach brought additional premium products to our portfolio and increased our bentonite mineral reserves around the world sivomatic is performing above our expectations and we see additional opportunities to leverage it and extend our global pet litter reach the company integrated it and largely paid down the acquisition debt in the six months timeframe it is a clear indicator of our financial and operating capability to grow inorganically turning to our operating performance we had a strong year we overcame difficult mining and operating conditions in the first half of 2018 ended the year with a 6 overall productivity improvement which is the ninth consecutive year of achieving 5 or higher we also maintained tight control of our costs holding them flat over 2017 while absorbing the full sivomatic overhead we ve discussed throughout the year number of external dynamics weighted on our business and margins most significant of which was raising raw materials logistics and energy costs we took decisive actions to mitigate each of these including diversifying our raw material sources utilizing our internal logistics capability leveraging our close relationships with suppliers reducing costs and increasing prices initiatives began to take hold in the middle of the year we finished 2018 on an upward trajectory with our performance more than offsetting these inflationary pressures situation during the year played out as we described it would with margins improving in the second half there were other external factors such as tariffs currency fluctuations and rising interest rates all of which our organization successfully navigated our continuous improvement culture is the foundation of mti and its importance to driving performance couldnâ t have been clearer during the last year our employees across the globe demonstrated their deep level of engagement they were instrumental in helping mti solve the challenges we faced through suggestions through reduced costs as well as hosting kaizen events designed to remove waste from our processes all of which helped drive productivity improvements and expense reductions these efforts by our employees across the company underscore how we can successfully leverage our operating platform to mitigate pressures on our performance shifting to our capital deployment activities in 2018 we maintained a strong balance sheet for a disciplined approach to capital allocation free cash flow grew 9 over last year excluding the tax efficient pension contributions we made and we deployed that cash in a balanced manner 76 million of this cash was used to fund high return organic opportunities as well as to maintain and improve the performance and safety of our facilities we used a portion of our cash to acquire sivomatic and also returned 29 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends all in all 2018 was a solid year for mti where we faced some distinct challenges in our operating environment i m proud of what our team accomplished especially on the growth cost reduction and continuous improvement process we laid the foundation for profitable growth and operational improvements heading into 2018 2019 with that let me turn it over to matt who will take you through our financial results and outlook in more detail after matt remarks i ll come back and can conclude with what weâ re currently seeing for 2019 matt matt garth thanks doug and hello everyone i ll our review our fourth quarter and full year results the performance of our four segments and also provide you with our outlook for the first quarter fourth quarter sales grew 4 versus the prior year or 5 after adjusting for foreign exchange our sales growth was driven by higher pricing and higher volumes across several product lines as well as the acquisition of sivomatic gross margin was 25 2 of sales versus 26 5 in the prior year as we continued to face higher raw material freight and energy costs weâ ll detail for you in a few minutes how we are strengthening our margins and advancing on recovering inflationary costs in the fourth quarter we reduced both the absolute and percentage sg a year over year including the addition of sivomatic overhead sg a cost was 10 9 of sales in the quarter a 100 basis point reduction from the prior year as the operating income bridge shows profitable growth and the actions we have taken on price productivity and expenses generated 13 5 million of business performance which more than offset 12 3 million of cost increases in the fourth quarter overall operating income increased 2 versus the prior year to 64 1 million earnings per share grew 6 to 1 17 driven by the solid operating performance as well as a lower tax rate reported earnings per share were 1 22 the difference of 0 05 per share primarily due to a onetime benefit from adjustments related to the u s tax law change letâ s move to the full year for the full year sales grew 8 to 1 8 billion driven by growth across all segments notably metalcasting sales grew 12 on higher volumes of greensand bonds in north america and continued penetration in asia hpc sales grew 47 primarily due to the contribution of sivomatic higher pet care revenue in both north america and asia and increased european fabric care sales refractory segment sales grew 12 driven by higher refractory product volumes in north america and europe as well as higher pricing gross margin for the full year was 25 6 versus 27 9 in the prior year as we ve previously discussed higher raw material freight and energy costs were the primary drivers of the year over year margin decline sg a as a percent of sales was down 90 basis points as we manage expenses tightly throughout the year operating income was 2 lower than the prior year driven by 41 4 million of inflationary cost increases we mostly offset these increases with 37 1 million of business performance which includes necessary pricing actions operating margin was 14 4 in 2018 140 basis points lower than the prior year revenue associated with cost pass through diluted margin by 30 basis points where the net of inflationary costs and higher business performance reduced margin by 110 basis points this margin dilution is reversing as our pricing actions are overcoming costs and we expect margins to improve over the course of 2019 lastly earnings per share for the full year grew 5 to 4 84 which was a record performance for the company now let s take a closer look at how we are recovering inflationary costs as you re aware we see significant increases in raw material freight and energy costs throughout the year the major raw materials that impacted our businesses were lime and paper pcc and magnesium oxide and refractories freight rates and truck and rail availability impacted logistics costs across our businesses and higher energy rates impacted production and mobile equipment fuel costs as shown by the red bars in the chart we experienced significant cost inflation in the first half of the year which accelerated by 9 million in the second half the green bars in the chart show that our business performance lagged the inflationary cost increases in the first half however with improved pricing some of which was contractually lagged productivity and profitable sales growth business performance increased by 17 1 million in the second half and exceeded the higher inflationary costs that we faced looking ahead we are diligently managing what is in our control driving pricing productivity and cost control all of which will help us advance our margins now let s review the performance materials segment in more detail performance materials sales increased 6 in the fourth quarter compared to last year sales improved on 6 higher metalcasting and 50 higher hpc sales due to the contribution of sivomatic and increased pet care sales in north america and asia this growth was partially offset by lower sales in building materials resulting from fewer large projects and a decrease in basic minerals due to prior year bulk chromite sales in the quarter the business absorbed 4 2 million of higher raw material and logistics costs which we more than offset with 5 3 million of higher pricing productivity cost control and the full integration of sivomatic segment operating income increased 4 to 29 2 million and operating margin was 14 1 versus the prior year of 14 4 looking to the first quarter pricing actions will largely mitigate continued logistics and energy inflation also hpc will benefit from continued strength in pet care and fabric care markets while building materials and environmental products will experience typical seasonality in metal casting we re seeing the slowdown in china automotive production which is impacting our customersâ casting production volume however we still expect positive overall growth in our metalcasting business in china driven by further penetration of our value added greensand bond products we ve also seen some casting production shifting from china to southeast asia and europe as a result of global tariff changes and in addition the u s foundry market continues to be stable overall our global metalcasting footprint positions us well to pick up these geographic shifts and volume now for the segment we expect operating income in the first quarter to be similar to that of the fourth quarter turn to specialty minerals segments specialty minerals fourth quarter sales were down 1 year over year at 142 5 million in pcc 2 growth in asia and 3 higher specialty pcc sales partially offset the previously announced paper machine shutdowns in north america processed minerals sales were flat versus the prior year as sales to the automotive industry remained strong while sales to the construction markets in the u s and europe were slower segment operating income was 21 9 million down 1 4 million from last year segment faced inflationary cost increases of 4 1 million driven by higher energy and line costs which we partially offset with 2 8 million in business performance as i mentioned last quarter we absorbed higher lime costs in the fourth quarter and we will recapture with contractual price increases in the first quarter however we are seeing higher lime pricing continuing into 2019 and we will be recapturing these costs on our typical lags basis turning to the first quarter we expect lower volume in north america and continued growth in asia the recent announcement of the closure of the georgia pacific port hudson facility however will impact paper pcc volumes in north america starting in the first quarter of 2019 based on our analysis and customer feedback we do expect the portion of these paper volumes to eventually be absorbed by other producers where we have satellite facilities we will continue with pricing actions to recover higher energy and logistics costs and we expect more moderate growth in our automotive markets typical seasonality will impact construction activity with sales expected to pick up in the spring for the segment we expect operating income to be 1 million lower than the fourth quarter primarily due to the lower volume in north america now let s turn to our refractory segment refractory segment sales increased 9 in the fourth quarter and operating income increased 6 refractory product sales were up 14 on continued strong steel utilization rates and higher pricing this segment faced 19 million in higher raw materials and energy costs over the course of 2018 primarily driven by magnesium oxide and other refractory raw material increases despite these challenges refractory has achieved record operating income for the full year due to a proactive sourcing strategy value added product substitutions for our customers and necessary pricing actions now looking to the first quarter we expect continued strong conditions in north america however we are seeing signs of slowing steel production in turkey and in addition while we expect another strong year for laser measurement and equipment sales we plan to deliver fewer units in the first quarter therefore we expect operating income to be lower by 1 million sequentially let s move to energy services energy services sales were slightly lower in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year and 1 million higher sequentially operating income grew to 2 3 million as offshore market activity has moderately improved and we re participating in larger longer lasting job operating income in the first quarter is expected to be similar to the fourth quarter and we see a healthy pipeline of projects for the first half of 2019 particularly in filtration equipment sales now let s review our liquidity and debt highlights we continued to generate strong cash flow in 2018 and we deployed our cash in a balanced way across internal investments sivomatic acquisition debt repayment and returns to shareholders cash from operations was 204 million in the year this included 15 million of incremental discretionary pension contributions that we made to take advantage of a onetime tax savings opportunity we deployed 76 million of capital expenditures spread across high return projects sustaining our operations for future profitability and environmental health and safety projects to ensure a healthy and safe environment for our employees and other stakeholders we acquired sivomatic for 123 million using both cash on hand and debt we also repaid 80 million of associated debt to end the year with the net leverage ratio of 2 2 times to ebitda finally we returned 29 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends total liquidity for the company remains strong at 413 million comprised of cash and equivalents of 213 million and 200 million available capacity on our revolving credit facility our balance sheet remains strong and we have the liquidity to continue our balanced approach to capital deployment now let me summarize what we expect for the first quarter in performance materials we expect our actions around pricing productivity and cost control to offset logistics and energy inflation specialty minerals we expect continued growth in asia and contractual price adjustments related to lime increases in 2018 weâ ll also take additional pricing actions as inflationary cost increases continue we expect operating income to be 1 million lower sequentially due to a combination of higher lime costs and the volume impact of the port hudson closure for the refractory segment we expect strong conditions in north america and europe to continue we expect operating income to be 1 million lower sequentially due to softness in the turkey steel market and the timing of laser measurement equipment sales for energy services we expect a similar level of offshore activity cold snap in the u s is expected to result in supply chain delays and increased logistics costs and in addition foreign exchange translation is expected to be unfavorable relative to prior periods in total then first quarter earnings per share is expected to be around 1 10 while we are seeing a slower start to the year we expect the growth opportunities we have created to deliver another year of solid earnings growth for mti now i hand it back over to doug for our perspectives on the year ahead doug dietrich thanks matt before moving to q a let me provide some high level themes on the year ahead first and foremost our team is energized focused and prepared to build on the momentum from 2018 we continue to pursue our gross strategy strengthen and deepen the value realized from our operating culture and execute on the opportunities we generated last year global economic backdrop that we faced in 2019 is different from what we experienced in 2018 from a macro perspective we re seeing slowing growth rates in china as well as more modest growth rates in europe however we still expect relatively positive markets in u s across most of our product lines within this backdrop we re confident in our ability to advance a number of key growth drivers that i ve discussed today paper pcc expansion strategy in asia will continue to build momentum with the addition of 300 000 tons of capacity coming on line driving volume growth later this year and into 2020 in addition we have a robust pipeline of satellite targets and new technology opportunities globally and expect to secure additional paper pcc contracts this year in our metalcasting business we anticipate another solid year and expect overall volumes to continue to grow in china primarily through strong penetration of our greensand bonds we see significant opportunities to grow our global pet care platform with increased demand for our products and by leveraging the sivomatic business to expand our market position and weâ ll be accelerating our new product development and commercialization efforts geared toward providing our customers higher value solutions to address the needs thereâ ll be some cost inflation challenges in the year ahead but as we demonstrated last year our strong operating performance along with the necessary pricing actions and cost control measures we ll drive continued margin improvement throughout the year mti is entering 2019 with strong alignment on all fronts we re aligned on our strategy and objectives we re focused on building mti for the long term profitable growth strong earnings and high returns for shareholders we are a company to be counted on in all parts of the economic cycle for a strong operating culture a solid balance sheet and our ability to closely control costs all of this gives us confidence that 2019 will be another year of profitable growth for mti with that letâ s open the call for questions question and answer session and our first question will come from daniel moore with cjs securities q daniel moore doug matt good morning thanks for taking the questions i want to start out i guess kind of the bridge between the two the q1 guide and then doug the more optimistic sort of outlook for the full year as we look into â 19 earnings growth has lagged top line growth for a few quarters that reversed here this quarter but it looks like you q1 few challenges once again so you talked in general terms about continued to operating expansion in the coming year what are the puts and takes that you see and what kind of range of sort of pretax or ebit margin expansion do you think is reasonable to think about for fiscal â 19 doug dietrich yes i think to answer the first part of your question dan first piece of it was look we are seeing a little bit of a slower start to the year got a couple of challenges just recently actually with some of the cold temperatures freezing up some logistics and we re working through that right now we expect that might be a little bit of a cost to us in the quarter but we did see some right out of the gate in the first couple weeks of the year some slower pull from some of the markets we don t see that that s going to continue foreign exchange matt said that over the past several quarters that started to become a little bit more of a drag so we think it s a little bit slower start to the quarter and the guidance we gave but what i m trying to contrast there is we got a lot of things coming at us for the rest of the year the pricing actions that we know will take hold we re building we have some expansions that came on line we see some strong pull from customers in our newest products some of our new commercializations there were new products commercialized late last year that we feel have some good traction moving into the year later this year 300 000 tons of capacity in paper pcc is going to be coming on line so there s a number of kind of forward upward momentum that we started last year that will continue to take hold through the year that we think will offset kind of a slower start and continue to drive those earnings as far as margins we think at a normalized rate this company certainly at 15 can i tell you that that s going to happen this year i think as we see costs continue to go up matt mentioned contractually we re going to lag a little bit that we see they might play it over for the second half of the year and i think will catch up i think as we get to kind of average pricing those normalized margins will get back to 15 so do i see the end of our cost inflation no i haven t seen it yet i think that s going to continue through the first half but should that go over i think we start with our pricing actions operating costs structure we ll get back to that kind of normalized rate of 15 daniel moore very helpful the port hudson with the expected the impact of the closure can you give us a sense for both q1 and full year â 19 either tons and or revenue on a year over year basis doug dietrich sure i think last year that facility or the past couple of years has probably bounced between 70 000 80 000 tons of pcc what we know now is that that s going to start to ramp down this quarter i think probably late february march that will impact the quarter as matt mentioned we do though one of the things that s interesting about this is with operating rates this closure came with operating rates in north american in the low 90s around 90 typically we see a closure like that as you ve seen in the past you see something when the operating rates dip below around 80 so this one is a little different and what we re feeling right now is some pull from customers pcc pull from other customers and that gives us an indication that this paper is probably going to shift around we re not exactly sure of that yet we don t have any indication exactly where but we re getting some customer higher customer pull from pcc and other facilities which leads us to believe that probably some of this will be absorbed elsewhere and most likely where we have some facilities i can t give you the full impact on the year but that s the range it was in terms of total turns for last year daniel moore very helpful understood and then maybe one more and i ll jump back in queue in terms of just looking back to the quarter basic materials are we through now with the tough comps as far as chromite has concerns did we have any revenue in q1 q2 of â 18 and besides chromite was there anything else that sort of contributed to the decline in q4 maybe a little sharper than what was experienced over the last few quarters doug dietrich you characterized it the right way we are done with both chromite impacting us on the revenue and on the operating income line within basic minerals so you won t see that going forward in the quarter it did have a little bit of drag as i spoke to you but on a go forward basis fully out beyond bulk chromite what you have in the other parts of performance materials you do have some drilling fluids that go into the permian basin for the energy markets and you are starting to see with a little bit of a drilling slowdown and some of the rig counts coming down onshore that some of our business may be slowing a bit related to our drilling muds in the energy sector operator and moving on weâ ll go to silke kueck with jp morgan silke kueck i was wondering whether you can identify like what s the magnitude of the price increase was this quarter and how much freight pass through contributed to sales and also what the magnitude of like the sivomatic acquisition was on sales this quarter matt garth when you step through the bridge on the 4 increase you did have that fx headwind against us by about a 1 pure price pass through related to freight and lime was about 1 percentage point and then you had other pricing that we were driving which was about another 2 percentage points the remainder of that is really the net from lower bulk chromite sales and the addition of sivomatic in the quarter doug dietrich total sivomatic sales for the year included in our results of 62 million on an that s only nine months eight months it was so on an annualized rate it s about 4 higher than what we had described when we purchased the company back in april so that gives you a rate that s how were saying sivomatic is really performing well for us that s still growing sales and we ve seen a strong performance out of it for the eight months that it has been part of the company silke kueck secondly what s your total pcc production capacity like how many tons did you make in 2018 doug dietrich capacity or tons weâ re selling around 3 million tons i think in total for the year capacity we generally run pretty high in that capacity weâ re probably 85 90 is typical and we make sure that we have enough room and there for technologies when we deploy them we have enough room for customer growth and expansions and also some of that is just efficient to capital deployments when we build the facility the other half of the carbonator youâ re putting it in so we run about 85 to 90 total capacity i canâ t give you exact capacity number but that s around it silke kueck and lastly so it was yet again like the sg a costs were like managed very well given all the headwinds and given the acquisitions do you think you have the right headcount or do you think you may need more people to grow the business as you expand like bentonite offshore with foundry to metalcasting in china and india and other opportunities doug dietrich yes i mean the question youâ re asking do we have the right headcount i think weâ ve not held back on headcount required to ensure that weâ re efficiently growing sales producing our products innovating et cetera that said we are always looking for opportunities and i donâ t want to call it just in heads just in discretionary expenses we re always looking for ways to leverage our platform that we have in the company through shared services and our resource units we want to make sure that sales deployment as we grow that we are not we don t feel we need to incrementally grow that overhead fixed cost base we put in a system to be able to leverage it and that s what we look to do how that ends up in number of heads no we re always looking at opportunities and making sure that they have the right horsepower and people power to make sure we secure it so i can t really tell you whether we have the right or not but we re in the context we re open to making sure it s the right headcount for what we need to do and execute our strategy silke kueck and the last question for matt if i may will you plan to continue your share program in 2019 just like goal what you want to accomplish in terms of what you want to return to shareholder if you have a free cash flow target in mind for 2019 matt garth yes silke so if you recall in 2018 free cash flow ended up being 128 million but i m going to go ahead and add back the discretionary pension contributions in my view so that gave us about 143 million and overall free cash flow with that i think we detailed for you look we acquired sivomatic we paid down 80 million in debt we returned about 29 million in shareholder value that included 22 million of share repurchases those were done on an opportunistic basis and we ll very much keep the opportunistic stance going forward looking to 2019 we re targeting a higher level of free cash flow generation in that 150 million range and we ll continue to manage that with a very sound balanced approach making sure that our balance sheet approaches our target level of 2 times net leverage against ebitda as well as funding strong investment within the company organically looking for inorganic opportunities and making opportunistic share purchases and returns to shareholders doug dietrich i think silke just to add to that we ve always taken the approach that says internal mti investments in growth are probably the number one focus of the company so our cash to our organic opportunities around the world if that makes sense high returns and also to maintain our facilities we balanced then keeping our balance sheet in the right spot and as we see acquisition opportunities kind of move up and move down come forward or wane we look to opportunistically steer that capital as they wane toward shareholders and share repurchases or the mechanisms we use so we re going to continue with that approach we have we see as we meet regularly to talk about acquisition opportunities i can t give you anything that where we are in those but it s a healthy pipeline of things that we continue to look at and as they move forward and they make sense for the company similar type of acquisition like sivomatic we think that s strategically that s where we see a value to deploy cash outside of that we can move it back to shareholders through share repurchases i hope that helps you frame it up silke kueck yes thanks very much for your thoughts on that operator and next weâ ll go to steve schwartz with first analysis steve schwartz good morning everyone first question just with respect to freight costs i want to make sure i understand clearly when you talk about you mentioned in the prepared remarks higher rail but i m also wondering if the expansion in the growth you re seeing in asia isn t also a part of higher freight costs or is that considered a completely different element within the discussion doug dietrich no it s part of it steve i think the majority of our higher freight costs we ve seen here in north america partially europe we ve seen a real tightness in being able to get trucks and rail freight increases just general across the board and even specific types of trucks so we do use flatbed trucks here in north america and those have been particularly tight in 2018 in china freight costs were a piece of it a little bit different kind of influence there and that was a little bit of tightening of regulations in terms of weights on roads and so as we saw those regulations come through and lower loading levels of trucks that required more trucks and that more expense and that had to be purchased or pushed through on a per ton basis so that same truck fewer tons of the customer and so it did increase our cost there albeit a little bit smaller than what we saw in north america but yes we had to manage through that as well steve schwartz okay but itâ s for the most part those costs are regional so in other words it s not you re not talking about higher freight costs because the growth in the asian business and pursuing that business is causing you to have to shift things farther at higher rates there s nothing like that in this conversation correct doug dietrich we re largely correct we re largely localized meaning we supply customers produce source produce and supply customers largely within the same region so we do ship bentonite around the world we ship other products around the world but we highlighted on a call or two ago that those numbers are relatively small less than 5 of kind of our sales the majority is localized in region steve schwartz okay got it and my second question just with respect to your gross growth in the paper pcc business talk about the additional 300 000 tons coming on just wondering from a gross growth standpoint how much is are programs like fulfill and new yield adding to your growth as compared to the new facilities doug dietrich so let me take it off frame it and then iâ ll let d j talk a little bit more specifically about some of these technologies and the filler contracts that we re building our satellites for building filler tons obviously hitting revenue that s the volume the revenue associated with those tons is different around the world you ll see a lower per ton revenue sometimes in asia region than you will in north america and europe and that s just because the input costs tend to be little bit lower so lime cost in particular so on a revenue basis we sometimes like to talk in tons because that ton generates the same ebitda around the world new yield is a kind of a per ton revenue for fill we ve always mentioned before it s priced a little bit differently it s more technology and technology fees so that it s not necessarily revenue it kind of drops right to the bottom line so fulfill doesn t move the needle on revenue it does move the needle in operating income but iâ ll let d j talk to you about a little bit about what we re building and some of what s happening with newyield and in asia and other parts d j monagle yes thanks for the question steve couple of things so regarding the just details on the 300 000 we ve got the start up in china with the trending paper company now becoming online in the second half coming towards the in the second quarter so half weâ ll be ramping up the facility in indonesia those two make up in their standard pcc they make up the 300 000 tons fulfill will be offered in both of those locations but probably not part of the ramp up we usually get things stabilized before the next level of technology goes in one of the other things that we had mentioned or alluded to during the third quarter call was the discussion of expansions with folks and so we ve also been able to get agreement on somewhere between 25 000 and 50 000 tons that we will be putting in india as expansions and that s just part of us applying the latest technology in helping our customers growing their use of pcc so those will be coming on in the second half as well with regard to the other technologies like newyield and doug had also mentioned envirofil in the past both of those right now just have are being deployed one location each but i will tell you as i look at the pipeline that s going on and we ve got about a dozen or so satellites in the pipeline a couple of them are envirofil a couple of them are you newyield and the majority are still standard pcc majority of that being in asia but we are seeing increased interest in these new technologies in south america primarily brazil and getting some pull in europe as well so that s that s kind of how the public pipeline is looking right now does that steve schwartz that s very helpful just to keep all of these different growth elements in perspective with each other so no i appreciate that doug dietrich steve i will add to that a little bit as d j mentioned certainly we see that opportunity to grow the base filler level but we are seeing a lot more interest in of interest in and itâ s whatâ s heating our new product development pipeline in more environmental sustainable recycling solutions d j mentioned envirofil that is the recycling solution newyield is a recycling solution we ve got other in our environmental products business we talk a lot about environmental solutions like fluoro sorb that s helping with wastewater clean up we ve got some low mission demand for low mission greensand bond products so as of the casting process the emissions are reduced we see some of that pull from customer i d tell you a lot of the 35 products and a lot of what s in the pipeline is geared toward helping those customers with these types of solutions and certainly leveraging our position on that paper mill weâ re there every day 24x7 and helping them to expand where they have issues they are facing issues water recycling and reducing fiber consumption with the higher pcc so just to give you a flavor that s not just in pcc it s kind of across the company where weâ re innovating in this way operator and moving on we will go to rosemarie morbelli with g research rosemarie morbelli i was wondering if you could talk about the revenues for the quarter it was below my expectations and i am just wondering how it stood against your own internal projections whether you were positively surprised in some areas and negatively in others matt garth rosemarie as we went through the quarter we generated 5 growth adjusting for foreign exchange that was very much consistent with i think how we were trying to look at the opportunities that laid against us and also consistent with what we were thinking about in terms of profitable growth over the course of the quarter on a year over year basis also trend line where we were for most of the year in terms of overall growth and i think it lays the groundwork and doug will want to probably provide a little more detail again around the actions and activities we were taken in 2018 capturing some of those this year laying the groundwork for continued topline growth in 2019 as we look forward doug dietrich rosemarie i think i ll add to that i don t think we were i think youâ re saying are we surprised by and is this something is this a trend that s going to continue what we re looking at right now i think at the end of the year sometimes it s a matt mentioned 5 and that s a little bit below our kind of full year average of 8 but at the end of the year sometimes what happens especially in these markets you do see some orders shift around and iâ m not exactly sure when that s going to happen i think it happened a little bit in pcc in china we had one individual customer kind of slow down the last two weeks of the year but i will tell you that they re pulling strong as they get into the beginning of the year that tells me there s a little bit of destocking going on i think in the construction sometimes an automotive builds we did see a slowdown in metalcasting in china i think that contributed to some of it but again i think if you want to go into the full year and we re seeing a little bit of that persistent in here in january but what we think going into the full year with what we have in terms of big projects that we ve put in place started last year that ll be coming on line pricing actions the new volume the new products and certainly with the pcc that ll be coming on later half we think that that growth trend continues that said we are seeing some softening markets do i think that 8 again is possible not sure right now we think we can continue with our kind of mid single digits growth throughout the year might be a little bit lower than last year given where we are in china with some of the softness we re seeing in europe but right now we re pretty confident we can continue our growth trend rosemarie morbelli that is very helpful thank you and then looking at the metalcasting yes auto has slowed down in china but on the other hand you are working on substitution and gaining share versus the two parts greensand or whatever it is called i was wondering if you could talk about the success in substitution and whether you could grow faster than the overall market in that particular category doug dietrich yes let me start and then iâ ll let jon hastings take you through kind of the specifics we mentioned that yes we think we see continued growth in china we ve probably averaged 12 to 15 type of growth over the past three years given the base demand it ll probably be a little bit lower china is still growing it s just albeit slower in some of our casting products and it s not all just automotive but our penetration strategy has been a success and will continue to be this year offsetting some of that slower base volume growth jon do you want to how we do that and how we put resources to it jon hastings sure rosemarie iâ ll echo a lot of the comments that doug just made overall the casting industry you can look at it in a couple of different ways automotive certainly has been impacted by changes in the tax policy and the lending practices but the remainder industrial and heavy equipment seems to be a little bit more robust you asked about our blended product strategy that does continue to work what we re seeing is consolidations in the foundry industry we re also seeing new investments in highly automated casting lines that are producing castings that are equivalent to the quality that we see in north america in order to do that those customers require a high quality high consistency products that we offer to our customers as you know we tailor our products specifically to the needs of each foundry so we continue to innovate with them and those products continue to be in fairly high demand so as we get into 2019 although we don t expect the double digit growth we do continue to see the mid single digit growth as we continue to penetrate with the blending strategy doug dietrich and those blending products i ll just add jon mentioned but from the base clay to that kind of engineered solution that s a different profit profile as well and so though sales may be a little bit lower than last year or lower than last year i do see that that will help our margin expansion that s one of the elements that continues to drive margins higher rosemarie morbelli thank you and if i may ask one last question before getting back on queue i was wondering if you could talk about the growth of the pet business excluding to sivomatic doug dietrich sure jon do you want to take that one as well jon hastings yes so certainly you know the sivomatic story but in north america we continue to grow as well what we have found is that now that we have a premium position in both europe and north america we ve got a lot of customers that are asking to expand business with us the reason for that is multiple fold some of it is related to innovation we continue to deploy new products like lightweight litters but now we re expanding into other fragrance products as well so while we continue to work pricing to offset costs as our customers are looking at us as a premier supplier in pet care and we continue to have growth in north america rosemarie morbelli so i know that you are selling the pet care both under the private labels and under your own name and i should know that but what is the mti name it is sold under jon hastings premium choice there s a wide variety premium choice is one but again you can find those in many different ways we can come back to you with a full list of what we doâ doug dietrich the mti brand is called premium choice but because we re private label you ll see to kind of our bentonite and packaging throughout a number of stores walmart you also see through tractor supply and et cetera et cetera so there s a number of outlets where you ll see private label brands there s a good chance that we re probably the one supplying that bentonite and or packaging it but ours is premium choice i hope you have a cat you pick up that one rosemarie morbelli thank you and no i no longer have a cat jon hastings rosemarie also we should mention that we continue to grow that pet care business in asia in asia outside of sivomatic but asia especially in china but also other countries we continue to penetrate small base right now but same value proposition continues to play over in asia as well rosemarie morbelli okay thank you doug dietrich thanks rosemarie operator at this time i d like to turn the call back to ms buckwalter for any closing remarks cindi buckwalter thank you paula thank you all for joining us today we look forward to speaking with you again very soon and hope you have a good day thank you operator and once again that does conclude today s conference we d like to thank everyone for their participation you may now disconnect
ramkanya left family in mali badodia village many villagers bought goats with what they saved from the money received these have multiplied express gopal verma finance minister piyush goyal on friday unveiled the pradhan mantri kisan samman nidhi promising assured supplemental income to disadvantaged farmers on january 28 rahul gandhi said a congress government would provide minimum income guarantee to the poor sikkim s sdf government has assured universal basic income to its 6 10 lakh people by 2022 in more constrained terms the telangana government s rythu bandhu scheme and odisha s kalia also assure a fixed amount to farmers months to go for what would be a bitterly fought general election basic income which once seemed likely to remain a matter of debate and stay in the pages of an economic survey now appears a real possibility eight winters ago the first ever pilot in india to test the feasibility of a basic income programme was carried out in a west delhi slum prompted by complaints over a clogged pds scheme the participants had rs 1 000 transferred to their accounts per month for 2011 to spend anyhow they liked soon nine villages in madhya pradesh were picked for the madhya pradesh unconditional cash transfers project the 18 month trial the only large scale basic income programme conducted in india in the first recipients were given money in exchange for pds in the second 6 000 people all members of a household got money over and above the schemes the results in both cases the organisers say were positive advertisement sitting outside her two room shanty in west delhi s raghubir nagar slum leelaben says when she was first told she would be given rs 1 000 per month in exchange for her ration she was apprehensive but the quality of the grains at the pds shops was so poor i decided to go ahead says the 67 year old leela a widow was one of the 100 women in the area who voluntarily opted for the delhi cash transfer pilot study organised by the ngo self employed women s association sewa i earn about rs 2 500 per month apart from the wheat from pds shops with the extra rs 1 000 i could buy sugar oil spices i didn t have to stand in queues outside pds shops or government hospitals says the mother of 10 all of whom are married rahul gandhi with chhattisgarh cm bhupesh baghel at the event express photo rahul gandhi with chhattisgarh cm bhupesh baghel at the event express photo also says leela who now stays with one of her sons for the first time i could save some money i got my grandchildren enrolled in tuition classes she beams sewa bharat chairperson renana jhabvala says they approached then deputy chairman of the erstwhile planning commission montek singh ahluwalia sometime in 2009 we told him about a basic income pilot in exchange for pds he liked the idea and said why don t we start from delhi advertisement one of the charges against the universal basic income ubi idea is that people would waste the money jhabvala says their findings were opposite most households spent the money well the pilot study also found that cash transfers did not adversely affect food security and the basic income allowed households to spend more on healthcare the economic survey 2016 17 that first stirred a serious ubi debate in india cited the mp study which was also run by sewa with funding from unicef and in coordination with the state government one of the major findings of the study is a shift from wage labour to own cultivation the study also shows that if the right amount is given as a basic income the positive effect is disproportionately higher than what the monetary value is in other words the emancipatory value of basic income is several times greater than its monetary value the survey said the 40 page chapter in the survey that dealt with the issue was titled universal basic income a conversation with and within the mahatma the discussion centring around whether mahatma gandhi would have endorsed ubi it called it a powerful idea whose time even if not ripe for implementation is ripe for serious discussion it could be to the twenty first century what civil and political rights were to the twentieth what works over the years in the face of poor allocation leakages and corruption in government schemes the idea of a ubi has found resonance with political parties and economists the failure to tackle poverty and unemployment has added more force to the pro ubi argument advertisement theoretically the idea is simple an unconditional regular periodic cash payment to all citizens without any requirement of work with universality and unconditionality as outlined in the economic survey 2016 17 as well but it is these factors itself that complicate the ubi discussion finance minister finance minister piyush goyal on friday unveiled the pradhan mantri kisan samman nidhi promising assured supplemental income to disadvantaged farmers a number of implementation challenges lie ahead especially the risk that ubi would become an add on to rather than a replacement of anti poverty and social programs which would make it fiscally unaffordable the survey had pointed out despite the encouragement to the pilot studies in both delhi and mp jhabvala points out the government response was lukewarm arvind subramanian the former chief economic advisor believes that while all parties clearly like ubi their reluctance comes probably from fiscal costs and challenges gopal krishna agarwal the bjp national spokesperson on economic affairs says the pradhan mantri kisan samman nidhi bears this in mind distinguishing it from the congress promise the bjp has always looked at schemes that are targeted at weaker sections what rahul gandhi is proposing would involve withdrawing several subsidies and that is not conducive in the future too we will not look at universal schemes but those which help uplift the poor the rest are already benefiting from the growing economy he says advertisement praveen chakravarty chairman of the data analytics department of the congress counters that the party has a plan in place to implement rahul s promise ubi as an idea is not new the right likes it for its efficiency and the left for its egalitarianism what rahul gandhi proposed is not ubi but its adaptation we will have a structured way of determining who falls within the minimum income threshold and what that income will be says chakravarty adding that the exact details will be in the congress manifesto explained good in theory but will it work on the ground at one level the idea of ubi is simple an unconditional regular periodic cash payment to all citizens without any requirement of work with universality and unconditionality but it is these factors itself that complicate the ubi discussion ranging from how much to give and to who all to who will pay for it and what to take away but several experts argue that ubi is in fact an affordable option for india if accompanied with smart budgetary and taxation choices certainly a country that grows 7 per cent a year could afford 3 4 per cent increase in government spending says abhijit banerjee the ford foundation international professor of economics at the massachusetts institute of technology ubi is universal we don t decide who gets the money other than maybe based on age or gender also the amount cannot be trivial but whether it is rs 1 500 or 2 000 per month will have to be based on budget priorities and how much revenue we can generate says banerjee who is also the director of the abdul latif jameel poverty action lab that is part of a 12 year study to examine the effects of ubi in kenya the programme aims to evaluate both the short and long term effects of ubi on recipients economic status time use risk taking gender relations and broader outlook on life the results are expected later this year most economists propose scrapping welfare schemes that have run their course ubi is fiscally affordable there are literally thousands of so called welfare schemes across india most of which are a complete waste of money and foster corruption says dr guy standing professorial research associate school of oriental african studies and co president of the basic income earth network bien who was associated with the mp study advertisement standing recommends that parties contemplating a basic income should take note of the lessons from mp contrary to what many presume a universal scheme would be much more efficient and cost much less than a scheme targeted at only half the population he says adding that targeting of a certain section only leads to more corruption more recently subramanian who as then cea proposed ubi in the economic survey 2016 2017 suggested a quasi universal basic rural income qubri scheme to tackle agrarian distress in a paper titled quasi universal basic rural income the way forward subramanian and his co authors suggested transfer of about rs 18 000 annually rs 1 500 per month per household to cover 75 per cent of the rural population at a total fiscal cost of about 1 3 per cent of gdp or about rs 2 64 lakh crore except the demonstrably well off qubri the paper said would bank on the 2011 socio economic caste census secc to identify the rural poor on how they arrived at the rs 1 500 per month figure subramanian says there is no magic number that will appeal to all plus there are trade offs because of budget constraints we looked at various combinations of coverage benefit per household and fiscal costs it seemed that a 75 per cent coverage of rural households with a transfer amounting to about 1 3rd of the current consumption of the poorest could be affordable to qualify as basic it must be a reasonable enough amount and the 1 3rd number higher for the poorest households was reasonable advertisement arguing that qubri would be better than rythu bandhu and kalia he notes that it also includes non farm rural households rythu bandhu and kalia while laudable require onerous identification requirements land titling proof of tenancy etc our proposal aims to simplify it to identify only the relatively small portion who will not be eligible but while a large part of the debate is centered around who gets the money and how much it has also been about who bears its fiscal burden subramanian s qubri paper proposes that the amount be shared between the centre and states for qubri subramanian suggests cutting down farm subsidies and pruning centrally sponsored schemes qubri should not be financed from rbi resources not least because they are one time and cannot finance a permanent qubri entitlement and by the states or centre breaching their existing fiscal commitments the qubri paper says subramanian adds that as per their proposal mnregs and pds would stay as would old age pensions and maternity benefits we have identified other schemes that might be removed such as interest rate subsidies price deficiency and fertiliser subsidies advertisement milan vaishnav director and senior fellow south asia program carnegie endowment for international peace says that instead of scrapping schemes states could be given greater untied funds from the centre scrapping a flagship social scheme like mnregs is a blunt instrument when not all states will face the same requirements he says but vaishnav also points out that a truly universal ubi would mean an income top off to all households which would do nothing to reduce inequality if on the other hand india pursues a quasi ubi which only targets poor households this would have a salutary impact on inequality economist banerjee however says that in the medium run the idea would be to scrap pds and mnregs but not before ubi is up and running for that reason and others the amount paid should probably go up over time both banerjee and vaishnav also dismiss the argument that a guaranteed income will impact labour participation our research suggests that making poor people richer does not make them lazier if anything the opposite says banerjee and if they refuse to clean the sewers manually because they are not so desperate great the government needs to be forced to upgrade these services the concerns advertisement over the years various basic income pilots have been conducted across the us europe asia and africa in 2017 battling high unemployment finland handed out 560 rs 48 835 per month to 2 000 jobless people as a trial without requiring them to work or seek employment last month the government stopped it against opposition saying it wanted to explore alternative welfare measures and without revealing the trial s results brazil has an anti poverty programme called bolsa familia involving a cash grant to families below a certain income level provided they meet conditions such as overseeing their children s school attendance basic income programmes have been piloted in canada finland southern africa kenya alaska has a great scheme in which royalties from oil are deposited in an investment fund and every citizen receives an annual dividend as far as i am aware all these have been successful says standing however jayati ghosh professor of economics at the centre for economic studies and planning school of social sciences at jawaharlal nehru university cites the example of iran where the government is struggling with its targeted subsidy plan because of inflation arguing against ubi she says nobody has clarity on who will get what amount and what happens when prices go up any form of ubi will only be useful when it comes on top of guaranteed universal basic services ubs which includes health education in india we are looking at ubi as a substitute to ubs it is problematic and obscene ghosh also questions subramanian s plan of using the secc to choose beneficiaries the secc says nothing about a person s income also no one has given any information on the schemes that will be scrapped for ubi following the release of the economic survey 2016 17 former planning commission member bhalchandra mungekar wondered whether dismantling the existing schemes would compensate for their present benefits once these are converted into direct cash transfers the mdm offers hot cooked meals to more than 150 million school children the mnregs gives 60 to 70 days employment annually to about 200 million unskilled persons the dismantling of the pds will adversely affect the bottom 50 to 60 per cent of poor consumers he wrote in the indian express sewa s jhabvala also stresses that ubi should not depend on poverty testing for its implementation the core idea of ubi is universality if we get into who is poor and who is not the the idea will crumble she says there are also concerns that the very nature of indian politics could muddy the ubi waters experts argue that ahead of polls parties might want to increase the basic income amount or re introduce certain subsidies on the one side i think it would be great if the political competition focuses on giving away money rather than towards reservations and creating jobs in the railways on the other hand i worry that opening an efficient pipeline would encourage irresponsible promises which will now be more credible which will then cause problems for those who manage to over promise and win says banerjee standing suggests the government should begin on a small scale i would start with low income rural communities perhaps all tribal communities and gradually roll it out further the ubi chapter in economic survey 2016 17 concluded by saying the scheme would have gandhi s approval the mahatma as astute political observer would have anxieties about ubi as being just another add on government programme but on balance he may have given the go ahead to ubi

operator welcome and thank you for joining itw s 2018 fourth quarter earnings call my name is cheryl and i will be your conference operator today please note today s conference is being recorded i will now turn the call over to karen fletcher vice president of investor relations advertisement advertisement you may begin karen fletcher vice president of investor relations thank you cheryl good morning everyone and welcome to itw s fourth quarter 2018 conference call i m joined by our chairman and ceo scott santi along with senior vice president and cfo michael larsen during today s call we will discuss fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial results and we ll update you on our 2019 outlook slide 2 is a reminder that this presentation contains our financial forecast for the first quarter and full year 2019 as well as other forward looking statements identified on this slide we refer you to the company s 2017 form 10 k and subsequently filed form 10 qs for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations also this presentation uses certain non gaap measures and the reconciliation of those measures to the most comparable gaap measures is contained in the press release as a reminder in 2017 we disclosed a 95 million favorable legal settlement and recorded a one time tax charge in the fourth quarter advertisement advertisement more from the motley fool therefore we provided you with two tables on slides 3 and 4 that summarize key financial measures for fourth quarter and full year on a gaap basis as well as on an adjusted basis excluding the legal settlement and tax charge for the rest of this conference call our comments and variances exclude these two items these two one time items from 2017 so with that we can move to slide 5 and i ll now turn the call over to our chairman and ceo scott santi scott santi chairman and chief executive officer advertisement advertisement thanks karen and good morning everyone greetings from the epicenter of the polar vortex in the fourth quarter the itw team delivered solid earnings growth and margin expansion fourth quarter eps was in line with the midpoint of our guidance and increased 8 10 excluding currency with operating margin up 70 basis points to 24 and after tax return on invested capital up 320 basis points to over 27 for the full year the itw team delivered high quality earnings growth of 15 record operating income record operating margin and record return on invested capital free cash flow was up 10 and we invested over 600 million in our businesses for growth and productivity in addition we returned more than 3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases throughout 2018 we continue to make significant progress on the execution of our enterprise strategy as evidenced by 110 basis points of margin improvement from our enterprise initiatives over the course of the year we made really good progress on organic growth acceleration in better than half of our operating divisions as we discussed in our investor day back in december our focus now is on getting the other 36 of our divisions that are not yet growing to their potential moving more briskly down that path and it s a major focus for us for the next couple of years there s no doubt that 2018 had its challenges raw material cost inflation tariff uncertainties decelerating auto production and currency headwinds in the back half of the year our ability to power through these challenges and deliver another year of record results as evidence of the performance power of the itw business model and the resilience of our high quality diversified business portfolio as we head into 2019 i m confident that we are well positioned to deliver another year of meaningful progress down the path to itw s full potential and to our 2023 performance goal before i turn the call over to michael let me conclude by recognizing and thanking my itw colleagues around the world for the great job that they continue to do in serving our customers and executing our strategy with excellence michael over to you advertisement advertisement michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer thanks scott and good morning let s stay on slide 5 and recap a few more highlights for the fourth quarter gaap eps was 1 83 an increase of 8 as we managed through some international end markets softness in two segments the solid execution and delivered earnings per share at the midpoint of our guidance organic revenue was up 1 with solid 4 growth in north america offset by a 2 decline in international markets i ll provide some additional color on what we saw in north america and international markets in a couple of minutes pls was 90 basis points this quarter a little bit above our full year rate of 70 basis points operating margin performance was solid as margins improved 70 basis points with 110 basis points from enterprise initiatives lower price cost margin dilution headwind finally free cash flow increased 18 to 727 million 120 in net income and we repurchased 500 million of our shares in the quarter moving to slide 6 for detail on fourth quarter operating margin we ve expanded operating margin every quarter this year and the fourth quarter was no different in fact we did better than last quarter with 70 basis points of improvement year over year versus 30 basis points in q3 all year our teams have continued to execute well in enterprise initiatives consistently contributing 100 basis points or more of margin improvement every quarter advertisement advertisement and the impact is broad based in the fourth quarter enterprise initiatives benefits ranged from 80 to 120 basis points across each one of our seven segments as i mentioned price cost margin dilution improved narrowing from 70 basis points in the second quarter to 60 basis points in the third quarter and now 40 basis points in the fourth quarter throughout the year we continue to take decisive pricing actions to offset cost inflation and tariff impact as planned on a dollar basis price more than offset raw material costs this quarter and for the full year all in operating margin expanded by 70 basis points in the fourth quarter to 24 the highest q4 operating margin in itw s history now we ll look at segment performance starting with slide 7 the table on the left provides some additional color on our fourth quarter organic growth rates by segment and by region as i mentioned north america continued its solid growth pattern with 4 this quarter similar to third quarter and first half of the year north america has really been steady and strong all year ending the year up 4 you can see some really good organic growth numbers in north america with for example food equipment welding both up 7 polymers and fluids up 6 for the full year every segment delivered positive organic growth in north america ranging from 2 to 11 international was more of a challenge specifically in two segments with organic growth down 2 in the fourth quarter compared to up 2 in the first half of the year the international market challenges that we re experiencing are not broad based and relate to just two segments automotive oem and specialty excluding those two segments our international growth in q2 would have been four points higher at plus 2 more on that in the next few slides advertisement advertisement i should just point out that china overall was down slightly at minus 2 with again lower sales in automotive and specialty only the other five segments saw positive demand trends as evidenced by for example test and measurement and electronics up 12 welding up 22 and polymers and fluids up 9 for the full year china was up 3 let s go into the segment details starting with automotive oem organic growth was down 4 this quarter north america being positive 2 was not enough to offset a meaningful reduction in build rates in europe and china for the full year automotive oem organic growth was flat as the auto builds in regions that are relevant to itw all declined if you look at 2018 s full year organic growth compared to builds by region we delivered significant above market growth in two of our key markets north america and china in north america we grew 3 versus builds down 1 and in china organic growth was 3 versus builds down 4 in europe the implementation of mandated new emissions testing procedures in q3 caused significant auto production disruption in the back half of the year we re confident that our below build rate revenue declines in the second half are a function of mix what models passed the new emissions testing procedures and when and not the result of any material share loss our new program wins in europe in 2018 were very strong as is our new program pipeline there we remain confident that our european auto businesses are well positioned to deliver consistent above market growth and that they will get back to doing so over the next several quarters with respect to the european market production issues i referenced a minute ago our auto team on the ground expect that they will work themselves through over the next several quarters and that conditions will begin to normalize in the back half of the year fourth quarter operating margin declined 150 basis points almost entirely due to price cost headwinds advertisement advertisement as you know pricing actions take longer to implement in the automotive market it is encouraging though that for the full year this segment s operating margin of 22 5 was down only 30 basis points with the benefits of enterprise initiatives essentially offsetting price cost headwinds moving on to slide 8 food equipment had a strong quarter and delivered accelerating organic revenue growth of 5 its highest quarterly growth in four years as overall demand continued to improve across the board north america grew 7 with equipment up 9 and service up 4 foodservice was up 11 and retail i e sales to grocery stores turned positive as we began to lap the difficult comps that we ve talked about on prior calls growth in institutional end markets continues to be very strong and was up double digits with particular strength in the education and lodging categories international markets were solid 2 up 3 with good growth in both equipment and service as expected test and measurement and electronics organic revenue was flat against the tough comp of 9 organic growth in the fourth quarter of 2017 test and measurement was down 1 due to this difficult year over year comparison electronics was up 2 while this quarter had a tough comp full year organic growth was solid at plus 4 and i should point out that fourth quarter operating margin improved by 140 basis points to 24 8 a record for the segment now on to slide 9 welding continued its strong run with 8 organic growth this quarter which is impressive versus a comp of 6 growth last year demand was strong across the board with global equipment up 7 and consumables up 8 advertisement advertisement the industrial business was up 7 commercial up 8 and oil and gas up 9 by region north america was up 7 and international up 11 polymers and fluids organic growth was 4 with 7 growth in automotive aftermarket which benefited from a new product launch and polymers was up 4 with strong product sales in asia pacific offsetting a 4 decline in fluids which included a significant amount of pls and a tough comp at plus 5 last year turning to slide 10 construction organic sales were down 1 as our north american commercial sales were down 10 primarily due to project timing in our warehouse growing business north america residential was essentially flat with 5 growth in renovation and remodel offset by decline in new construction europe was a bright spot with sales up 6 australia and new zealand sales were down 5 due to a slowing residential construction market there specialty organic sales were down 2 against the tough comp of plus 5 last year this segment also had over 100 basis points of pls in the quarter international organic sales were down 8 with some of the same soft spots that we saw in the third quarter including appliance components and graphics equipment sales were a bright spot up 4 and our hi cone division which we saw at our investor day was up 13 moving on to slide 11 and full year 2018 performance 2018 was a record year for eps operating income operating margin of 24 3 and after tax return of invested capital of 28 2 operating margin was up 60 basis points driven primarily by another year of strong execution of enterprise initiatives contributing 110 basis points advertisement advertisement free cash flow was up 10 to 2 4 billion with free cash flow conversion of 95 slightly below our target primarily due to the combination of modestly higher capex investments and slightly elevated inventory levels at year end due to higher material costs finally we executed 2 billion in share repurchases and increased the dividend by 28 this year looking back at 2018 we delivered on the annual eps guidance that we provided as we entered the year thus continuing our track record of exceeding our annual guidance for the past six years the consistency and quality of our financial performance as summarized here for 2018 are a testament to the power of itw s proprietary business model our high quality diversified business portfolio and strong execution by the itw team let s now turn to slide 12 in 2019 guidance we are reiterating our full year eps guidance from investor day in december eps of 7 90 to 8 20 with a midpoint of 8 05 which represents 6 growth year over year we now expect organic growth in the range of 1 to 3 compared to a range of 2 to 4 previously this reduction is entirely related to taking a more conservative risk adjusted view with regards to auto builds and semiconductor related demand in 2019 this range also includes pls of about 80 basis points which is unchanged from december we continue to firm up the projects and activities related to enterprise initiatives and are confident that they will deliver 100 basis points of operating margin expansion independent of volume also included in our plan are higher restructuring expense versus 2018 and we have a particularly heavy restructuring agenda in q1 this is driven to a significant degree by actions we are taking to right size our automotive oem and specialty businesses in europe the price cost equation remains pretty dynamic but margin headwinds should continue to moderate as the majority of raw material costs appear to have stabilized and we have strong pricing momentum heading into the year with the vast majority of planned pricing actions already implemented 2019 tariff expectations remain around 60 million which is based on current and announced tariffs including the potential impact of these three growing from 10 to 25 in march we continue to view the overall tariff impact as manageable given the fact that we are largely a produce what we sell company and that we only source approximately 2 of our spend from china given the differentiated nature of our product offerings across the company we expect to be able to offset the impact of any incremental raw material cost inflation and tariff impacts that might arise in 2019 with pricing actions on a dollar for dollar basis at a minimum just as we did in 2018 finally we expect free cash flow conversion at or above 100 of net income share repurchases of 1 5 billion and a tax rate in the range of 24 5 to 25 5 up slightly from 24 5 in 2018 due to the non repeat of discrete items taking a closer look at the first quarter we should point out that we expect that the first half of 2019 will be a little more challenging than what is typical for us in terms of year over year comparisons due to more difficult comps more currency headwind in the first half versus the second half of the year and higher q1 restructuring costs specifically in q1 we have 0 07 of currency headwind at current rates the impact of higher restructuring also 0 07 and 0 05 of tax rate headwind due to a discrete 14 million tax item that we recognized in q1 of last year there s also one last shipping day in q1 which is another approximately 0 02 headwind to eps and one and a half percentage points headwind to organic growth it s important to note that we have an extra shipping day in q3 as a result we expect q1 eps in the range of 1 73 to 1 83 an essentially flat organic growth however coming out of q1 the headwinds i ve just described start to moderate roughly 2 3 or 0 14 of the expected currency headwind this year is in the first half restructuring activities as we discussed are front end loaded this year and price cost margin impact should moderate as we go through the year it s important to note that our full year guidance is based entirely on current demand run rates existing and announced price cost impacts known enterprise initiative benefits and what we believe is a prudently risk adjusted posture with regard to 2019 demand expectations in auto and semiconductor end to end markets we do not have any projections of demand improvement versus current levels in our 2019 guidance however given what i just described and the fact that revenue comps are much easier in the second half of the year year over year revenue and earnings growth comparisons will get increasingly positive as we move through the year on slide 13 we provided an eps range for 2019 versus 2018 organic growth of 1 to 3 at our normal incremental margin of 35 contributes to 0 20 to 0 30 to eps growth benefits from enterprise initiatives add another 0 25 to 0 35 lower share count represents the impact on the 2 billion of share repurchases completed in 2018 and the 1 5 billion planned for 2019 combined they contribute approximately 0 25 a share at current exchange rates we anticipate 0 20 impact from foreign currency and approximately 2 3 of that impact is expected in the first half of the year as we talked about and finally we ve moved a few things into other on this bridge this includes our expectations for higher restructuring this year approximately 0 10 with 0 07 of that in q1 a higher tax rate than 2018 due to the non repeat of discrete items which is a 0 05 headwind partially offset by lower interest expense by savings on the 1 35 billion in bond maturities in march and april these three items and a few other puts and takes combined to reduce eps by 0 10 to 0 20 you ll note that there s no accommodation for potential m a activity specifically the potential divestitures that we talked about at investor day our guidance is all in meaning that the baseline presented here assumes our portfolio as it is today we are making good progress on our potential divestitures and we ll update you on our progress as we go through the year importantly as we said before any eps dilution from divestitures will be completely offset by incremental share repurchases and are therefore eps neutral finally we ve provided our views on organic growth outlook by segment for full year 2019 on slide 14 these are based on current run rates adjusted for seasonality and are obviously influenced by year over year comparisons as we go through the year it is important to note that there s no expectation of demand acceleration embedded in our guidance we see solid growth in welding of 3 to 6 down from 2018 but just as a function of the more difficult 10 comparison year over year food equipment has good momentum and pretty easy comps in the first half and are expected to be up 3 to 5 for the full year construction of 1 to 4 which also includes a number of meaningful new product launches test measurement incorporates a more cautious sales expectation for equipment related to semiconductor manufacturing those sales represent approximately 200 million and are expected to be down double digits in 2019 this creates a drag of two percentage points of organic growth to the test and measurement and electronics segment polymers and fluids and specialty all with low single digit growth expectation and automotive as we mentioned we re being pretty cautious with sales expected to be flat to down 4 despite the fact that third parties such as ihs are expecting positive growths in the auto builds in 2019 lastly a comment about quarterly guidance from day one back in 2013 our strategy has been centered on leveraging itw s powerful and proprietary business model to its full potential and in doing so positions the company to deliver softer growth with best in class margins and returns over the long term in the early stages of implementing our strategy we believe that providing quarterly guidance was constructive given the number and magnitude of the changes and initiatives that we were implementing across the company we have now progressed far enough in executing our strategy but we believe that providing quarterly guidance is no longer value added given the long term performance focus of the company and our core shareholders as a result we re discontinuing this practice as of this quarter we will continue to provide updated five year performance goals and eps and organic growth guidance annually with that karen back to you karen fletcher vice president of investor relations ok thanks michael cheryl let s open up the lines for questions questions and answers operator our first question comes from andy casey from wells fargo securities your line is open andy casey wells fargo securities analyst thanks a lot good morning everybody your guidance is pretty interesting it looks like top line is more or less consistent with the bear case on the stock but the bottom line guide is what you said back in december so a couple of questions on the back end loaded nature of what you just presented first why is price cost negative 50 bps for the year given pricing momentum is carrying over and from the outside it looks like you look at apparent decreases in some of your raw material input costs and then within that do you expect price cost to improve through the year michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer yes so andy price cost was negative 50 basis points from a margin standpoint in 2018 and we are not providing a number for 2019 primarily because it s still a pretty dynamic environment in terms of raw materials as well as potential tariffs that said what you are what you re saying is correct i mean it is reasonable to assume based on what we know today in terms of the price actions we ve taken the expected raw material costs the tariffs including the increase in march from 10 to 25 that may or may not happen it is reasonable to assume that we will continue to make progress on price cost from a margin standpoint in 2019 and certainly we will continue to be positive on a dollar for dollar basis to a degree that s significantly higher actually than what we saw in 2018 so i hope that answers your question andy casey wells fargo securities analyst it does and if i can also follow up on something else michael in your commentary around the first half versus second half q1 midpoint implies about 6 earnings decline year over year but the rest of the year is up around 9 you sound pretty confident that in assuming the current run rates is a majority of that confidence really related to the pull ahead of the seven out of 10 for restructuring in the year into q2 and basically is that a big part of your confidence michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer yes i think what we re pulling forward in the restructuring obviously has a pretty big impact in q1 here of 0 07 some of those benefits will start to show up in the back end of the year many of these projects have a one year payback or better in many cases in addition to the higher restructuring currency it s more of a headwind in q1 the tax rate is a headwind and then we do have one less shipping day as i mentioned in q1 and so scott santi chairman and chief executive officer that we got back in q3 michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer that we got back in q3 that s why the year looks a little different relative to what you re used to from itw but there s some really good reasons behind that and when you pencil it all out you can get comfortable we certainly are comfortable and very confident in our ability to deliver on the guidance that we re providing today andy casey wells fargo securities analyst ok sounds good thank you very much operator our next question comes from jeffrey sprague vertical research your line is open jeffrey sprague vertical research partners analyst thank you good morning everyone i wonder if i can just dig into a couple of segment level detail questions first on automotive and the whole emissions wltp had a log jam in europe your view that it doesn t really sort itself up in the second half is that kind of well grounded in what you re hearing from the oems or is that really kind of just kind of caution on the chaos we ve seen up to this point and it s just kind of a hard to predict how things play out there scott santi chairman and chief executive officer i think it s a little bit of both but more of the latter i want to be careful how i say this but i think the information has in terms of direct customer that s been a little bit up and down just because i think it s a fairly fluid situation but i think our posture from a planning standpoint we believe it s definitely on the conservative side and just to be clear we re saying that things start to mitigate in the back half of normalized but certainly aren t all the way corrected probably we ll begin with some elements of this all the way through the year is our current view jeffrey sprague vertical research partners analyst ok and just on the construction side i m sorry can you elaborate on what drove the commercial weakness in north america and the u s and is there kind of visibility kind of a recovery plan there michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer yes there is so it s a fairly small part of our overall business in north america part of what we do is we provide concrete solutions for warehouse flooring and we had a number of projects that we re scheduled to go in q4 that pushed out to 2019 so it s just primarily a timing issue more than a commentary on what s going on in the commercial construction space jeffrey sprague vertical research partners analyst and maybe one just other really quick follow up do you have some additional restructuring kind of on the shelf for lack of a better term if kind of the macro environment does begin to pick it on as soon as 2019 unfolds scott santi chairman and chief executive officer well i would say we normally operate with a fair degree of contingency planning around our plans whether that s within a particular segment or at the overall company level we certainly have the flexibility to make adjustments as we re talking about here related to auto and specialty in the near term so and that s been sort of normal practice for the company for quite a long time so should things in terms of sort of the external macro environment play out differently than what we re anticipating now and again i think we re taking a pretty conservative posture in terms of our planning approach year then absolutely we would expect to be able to adjust to that and do it in a relatively short order as i said we had a pretty flexible cost structure given how we operate to maybe 20 so we could certainly make those adjustments within a quarter or two jeffrey sprague vertical research partners analyst i appreciate the perspective thank you operator our next question comes from jamie cook credit suisse your line is open jamie cook credit suisse analyst hi good morning first i just wanted to better understand if we think about what your preliminary guide at the analyst meeting the eps is the same as it is today you basically reaffirmed it but your organic growth assumption is a point worse i don t recall if the restructuring number was in there and also fx seems to be more of a headwind so can you just sort of help me understand what s offsetting those headwinds relative to what you guys said at the analyst day and then my second question is just with regards to the organic growth the 2 for this year one would argue in 2018 where the economy was relatively strong you guys put up the same level of organic growth so just comfort level on you can put together or can put up another 2 organic growth in a tougher macro michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer yes so let me start with the first part which is a very fair question in terms of the organic growth guide today being lower than what we guided in december really on the back of being more conservative around automotive builds as well as factoring in the latest view on semiconductor related end markets as we ve gone through these last few months here we ve really firmed up our views in terms of the enterprise savings from enterprise initiatives to specific projects and activities that will deliver 100 basis points of margin improvement as well as other discretionary cost items and so that s really what s driving the majority of our confidence and ability to maintain the eps number in addition to that i would say although i m cautious on this given what we saw in 18 the price cost headwinds are certainly looking more favorable today than at the end of last year and then just to be precise the structure i think that we had in our guidance in december is the same number as today and so that number has not changed i think the second part if i remember correctly was around our ability confidence to deliver 1 to 3 organic growth this year similar to last year and i ll go back to how we modeled this which is basically based on current run rates adjusted for seasonality and if you run that out for the year with the adjustments we made in auto and specialty you get to a range of 1 to 3 organic growth we provided a little more detail on the last slide slide 14 in the deck you can see how it kind of pencils out by segment and again these are based on current run rates risk adjusted on a couple of areas and in our view pretty cautious and conservative view overall jamie cook credit suisse analyst i guess so just given that it s a weaker macro there are certain segments where you are assuming that your market share is above average and that sort of helps the organic growth i mean can you talk about construction little i m just not sure if market share is contributing more i mean relative to just the overall whatever macro michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer yes i think construction there s significant new product launches on the docket for this year i d say in addition to that i wouldn t underestimate the impact of price this year relative to 18 and so if you add all that up these are the numbers that make up the guidance by segment and 1 to 3 in total jamie cook credit suisse analyst ok thank you i ll get back in the queue operator our next question comes from joel tiss bmo please go ahead your line is open joel tiss your line is open and moving along our next question comes from andrew kaplowitz citibank please go ahead andrew kaplowitz citi analyst can you hear me ok michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer yes we got you andrew kaplowitz citi analyst yes scott or mike obviously itw is relatively strong in europe and you did mention that europe would be up a couple of percent instead of down if it weren t for your issues in auto and specialty products so maybe give us a little more color regarding what s going on in europe construction actually looks like strong for you guys given the environment there and so and what s the outlook here as we go through 2019 in europe michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer yes i think the issues on the international side are really isolated to the two segments we talked about i think the other five segments are doing pretty well across the board if you just look at fourth quarter certainly auto specialty were down but we put up some really good numbers in europe construction overall was up 6 welding up 7 food up 3 we ve not seen a big impact from brexit or the u k those markets are pretty stable so we feel pretty confident going into 2019 in terms of modeling our current run rates in that geography scott santi chairman and chief executive officer and just maybe to add i think in terms of i m sorry just another data point is and if you net if you look at our european sales in q3 and q4 net of auto and specialty it was plus 3 in q3 and plus 2 in q4 so we re certainly not which feels pretty stable to us not the 3 to 2 i don t know we re certainly not calling that a trend but sort of down single digit it s pretty solid michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer yes andrew kaplowitz citi analyst ok that s helpful guys and then there a couple of businesses that have been somewhat lethargic over the last couple of quarters they looked like they ticked up a little bit here in the past quarter i look at polymers and fluids and you mentioned that new product intro and auto aftermarket and then within food equipment you mentioned retail refrigeration turning around do these businesses have some sustaining power here going forward in other words are you seeing a little bit more capex from grocery stores for instance in food equipment and does this new product rollout in auto aftermarket does that give you continuing growth in the segment for the next few quarters michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer yes so i d say andy that food equipment certainly feels very good i think the acceleration we have started in second half the strength is broad based on the equipment side service put up a pretty good number here in the retail on the retail side just to be clear we re not seeing a pickup in terms of the capex spend on the grocery side we re really what we re seeing is these are flat to up slightly on a year over year basis as we lapped the more difficult comps but all the benefits that we expected in terms of new product introductions certainly we re seeing those in the second half of the year and we expect those to continue into 2019 so food equipment i d say 3 to 5 feels very good for 2019 polymers and fluids we did benefit from a new product launch in automotive aftermarket i hesitate to say this but we were a beneficiary also of some weather related impact in terms of rain x wiper blades and so that part of the business was up 7 overall that is not a sustainable rate for the full year obviously but i d say also in polymers you re seeing some good progress there in terms of the overall organic growth rate and like i ve mentioned earlier we re seeing the impact of price so certainly some good progress in those two segments and we should expect to continue to see that in 2019 as reflected in the segment outlook we gave you on page 14 andrew kaplowitz citi analyst appreciate it guys operator our next question comes from mig dobre from baird your line is open mig dobre baird analyst yes good morning guys so i want to stick with food equipment here i mean 3 to 5 growth this would probably be the best growth since 14 15 that time range and i wanted to make sure that i understand kind of what the moving pieces are here retail you said feels a little bit better but it s mostly a factor of comps so i m not sure how much you re really expecting this business to grow institutional you mentioned was quite good so maybe you can talk a little bit about the momentum into 2019 i m also wondering just your restaurant business i think that s pretty meaningful as well how that s doing international as well as north america michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer yes mig so the demand we saw really here in q3 q4 was broad based so we ve talked specifically about foodservice which is everything excluding the retail side being up 11 retail turned positive in the low single digits we re not counting on a big pickup in retail in 2019 and it s not that significant portion of our overall business we continue to see a lot of strength on the institutional side up double digits again there are a couple of categories here really around education so k 12 universities as well as lodging and on the restaurant side also double digit growth including which for us is a smaller part of the business on the qsr side international solid up 3 i certainly feel good about the momentum going into 2019 just q4 was best growth rate i think in over four years here so new product introductions are really taking off and we feel we re very pleased with the progress we re making in food equipment mig dobre baird analyst got it that s helpful and then sort of going back to the big picture top line guidance so if you re starting the year flat in q1 and you re guiding on current levels of tam and your comp is getting tougher in q2 by at least 100 basis points should we how about expectations for an organic decline in q2 and then acceleration in the second half on easier comps is that how we should we be thinking about it michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer so mig you should definitely think about it as just given the comps higher growth rates in the back half of the year than in the first half if you just go back and look at 18 i think in 18 we were up 3 organic rounding in the first half we re up 1 in the second half that alone is driving some of the higher growth rates both in terms of organic as well as earnings growth so really the swings you re going to see are really a function of what the comps are on a year over year basis those are the big drivers again there s no demand acceleration assumed here on the contrary if anything we ve dialed it back in certainly in auto as well as semi which we talked about earlier mig dobre baird analyst but there is not something on the products side or i don t know something based on some visibility that you might have that would be able to maybe reassure us that you d be able to cross the tougher comp in q2 versus q1 michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer there s typically every year new products contribute scott santi chairman and chief executive officer and we re not managed for the quarter the quarterly plans we ll give you a q2 update when we get there our expectation is again as michael said we re recent current demand levels and projecting them through the year i m we just go look at q2 well this was a full year and a q1 number i don t recall exactly what q2 organic growth rate is embedded in our plan if we had it and i think mig dobre baird analyst no i appreciate that i was just trying to make sure that we have that s in line with what you guys are thinking that s it scott santi chairman and chief executive officer i think that math is there s nothing funny in the math here this is really straightforward as michael said we are if anything have to dialed back relative to current demand rates in a couple of areas where we think there s some potential risks we re not seeing that it s going to play out that way i think overall that s the smart and prudent approach in terms of our planning and it also highlights the fact that we ve got a lot of earnings growth power from the standpoint of enterprise initiatives and other things going on underneath this not vulnerable to some further erosion in auto if things play out and ultimately we ve got a plan where we believe there s more upside potential than downside that s why we always plan and that s really what we re i think embedded in the approach we re taking in terms of taking the organic growth rate down a percent relative to where we were in december mig dobre baird analyst got it thank you appreciate it operator our next question comes from john inch gordon haskett your line is open george inch gordon haskett analyst thanks good morning everybody michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer good morning george inch gordon haskett analyst michael so wondering if there s kind of an update on the divestitures that you planned for this year and just as kind of corollary to that michael if we were actually to have taken the 2019 divestitures that you ve got out and divested them at beginning of the year kind of pro forma would that have any material impact on the 1 to 3 core growth that you re just betting for 2019 michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer yes so that s a very good question so the impact is these potential divestitures all happen is an improvement in our organic growth rate of about 50 basis points and improvement in our operating margins by 100 basis points so that would assuming that all of those take place this year that s what we would expect to see in 2020 i think that s a fairly optimistic assumption i think we re certainly making good progress and i think a more reasonable planning assumption would be maybe half of them get done this year but none of that is included in the numbers today so certainly you ll see some slightly lower revenues to the effect that if there is eps dilution you ll see higher share repurchases to offset that so that they are eps neutral there s going to be some gains on some of these potential divestitures those are also not included but on pro forma basis it s a meaningful impact and we re making good progress george inch gordon haskett analyst if there some reason you couldn t i mean i know you said half but it s not a bad point right to pick but to some reason if you start to get a cadence going because i m assuming you re not doing them sequentially one after another you ve got kind of books out more than one i mean why couldn t these things hit sooner is it just i guess i don t really understand why because there s not a lot of companies right why we couldn t we get most of this done in 19 michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer i ll pass s that on to the steering committee in charge of the divestiture activities john look we prioritized in terms of the biggest impact of the company we re going to try to get those done for us we re not in a rush here we re going to be very liberate and thoughtful in terms of how we execute of this and maximizing the value for the company and so scott santi chairman and chief executive officer and i ll just quibble a little bit with your perspective in terms of there s a decent amount of work involved in each one in terms of preparing them to separate from itw and all the things we need to do to george inch gordon haskett analyst i look in the ivory tower so i got it scott santi chairman and chief executive officer i don t want to go to that part john but i was just i think we ve got a good cadence we ve got good plans that we are finalizing now in terms of being very deliberate and intentional about how we go back about it but as michael said i think that the reality of it is probably a two year process to move all the way through and of course everything that we can do to make it happen faster we would certainly do that but at this point we also are not that s not the no 1 priority right now so kind of balance with everything else that we are trying to work on and make progress there george inch gordon haskett analyst so just on the polymers business i know michael you called that the auto aftermarket likely not to see that cadence that make sense was there any kind of a pre buy in that business maybe associated with getting ahead of some cost increases or price increases that s also potentially contributing to the 1 to 3 kind of slight deceleration michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer john we did not see that in polymers and fluids and actually in any of our other segments as we went through the fourth quarter here the quarter played out as it usually does on a monthly basis there s really nothing unusual as we mentioned in the quarter including in polymers and fluids george inch gordon haskett analyst the other question i had is oil and gas prices have come down obviously since the december meeting i know we re talking about raw increases but i was wondering about the indirect impact or even direct impact of those hydrocarbon pricings coming down i realize you could buy a lot of metals like in metals derivatives but is there possibly some sort of once we get the impact of this is there some sort of potential net tailwind that kind of begins to accrue to you later this year or something michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer eventually the answer is yes i don t know whether that will be at end of this year or not i mean there certainly is tailwind today on a dollar for dollar basis and as i said earlier while raw material cost increases they re just a carryover from last year still a pretty significant number in 2019 it s less than 2018 and we are certainly significantly ahead on a dollar for dollar basis so to that extent it is providing some tailwind here george inch gordon haskett analyst got it one last one i mean companies used to talk about i think they still do selectively kind of these cost pressures that are embodied by wages if you just focus on the u s what s actually happening to your u s wage cost given what appeared to be tight employment markets i mean are wages going up materially in 19 i don t remember if you call that out much early in 19 versus 18 is that any kind of a factor here scott santi chairman and chief executive officer we have not i think there would be a from the standpoint of aggregate north american wages i am summarizing a lot of individual data points but things are up tens of decimal points maybe relative to sort of planned increases in prior years but nothing that i will consider to be material in terms of the impact on the overall company at this point george inch gordon haskett analyst got it all right thanks guys appreciate it operator and our next question comes from ross gilardi your line is open ross gilardi merrill lynch analyst good morning thanks guys just on auto i think you said that you re assuming flat to negative 4 for 19 can you give us any type of breakdown by region particularly since you were saying that you re not assuming any acceleration in the second half i would just think given like what s going on in china right now to get to flat to negative 4 and just the pressures in that end markets globally that you d have to assume some reacceleration for now to be down more than that michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer yes so there s a lot of uncertainty around the numbers that third parties are providing on a geographic basis i think best i can tell you is when we were together in december the view was that our auto business would be flat on markets that globally would be down 2 to 3 we gave that a further risk adjustment here relative to what we said in december and i can t really give you a view by quarter here as the year plays out i ll give you the actuals when we get through q2 q3 and q4 but i can t really give you a guidance around that scott santi chairman and chief executive officer we got people who study this like ihs out with a projection of plus 2 on builds entirely for the year plus 1 in north america and i think down a couple i think globally they re plus 1 we re at zero to minus 4 they re that it s just one data point but there are people that study this that have i m calling an optimistic view but i think we re back to the comment we re making earlier about making sure that we re appropriately conservative there where there s some uncertainty but we re not i don t think we re on the high side of optimism relative to what most of our these third parties that we look at studying these markets that s going on in 19 we re on the conservative side of them ross gilardi merrill lynch analyst just on the restructuring the 0 07 and i think the 0 10 for the year what is it actually for i mean is it headcount related or is it five year enterprise initiative i think you mentioned where is it again michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer so this is primarily focused on rightsizing our footprint in europe there s two businesses the automotive business as well as the specialty business and beyond that we typically don t comment on specific restructuring projects ross gilardi merrill lynch analyst ok on that michael i mean you had said that clearly there s some pressures guide to what you re describing it earlier but it sounded like if you thought things were normalizing that you re not losing share and it s kind of a timing issue of when the market actually improves so why restructure the european auto business if that s the case michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer well we re just moving faster on some things we still got an acquisition that we did two years ago that is the restructuring i would say is normally normal part of the integration of that business it s a fairly good piece of that we are accelerating some of that given the environment in pause in demand it s a good time to get after some of that there s some things that we ve been that we would ve gotten to anyway it s the easiest way to describe it that i would say we have accelerated into the front end of the year given the pause in the demand these things are in some ways it s better timing if we can get them done when we re not also dealing with some increases and demand that s probably a better characterization of it front end loaded that s what we re doing ross gilardi merrill lynch analyst and just the last one on test and measurement i mean you guys have got 140 basis points of margin expansion with real organic growth in the business in the fourth quarter which is pretty impressive but is that type of a margin expansion sustainable in the 2019 in a flattish environment for that segment michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer i think we said the ways to go in terms of further margin expansion in test and measurement and that s based on what the bottoms up what the team is telling us what you re really seeing is the impact of the enterprise initiatives in test and measurement and i think it s another data point that supports the view that we have and the confidence that we have and the ability to continue to expand margins in 2019 and beyond as we ve talked about in december we believe we have at least another three to four percentage points of margin expansion ahead of us and test and measurement has at least that level of improvement ahead of it in that over the next three to four years ross gilardi merrill lynch analyst ok thank you very much operator our next question comes from joe ritchie goldman sachs your line is open joe ritchie goldman sachs analyst thank you good morning everyone michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer good morning joe ritchie goldman sachs analyst so just on your wltp comments from earlier i just wanted to make sure that i understand it if your platforms are being disproportionately impacted do you have a sense or line of sight on the approval for those platforms getting through the testing requirements and shouldn t that just reverse itself at some point in 2019 scott santi chairman and chief executive officer well it should reverse itself at some point the answer to your question is we don t have a great line of sight because it s a new test and i don t want to speak for the auto oems in europe but what we re hearing is that there s a some uncertainty and some challenges it s not that it can t be done it is a new testing procedure and that the backlog involved in getting all of these all of their models through it has been much more of a challenge than perhaps what s expected i don t know i m not again we re drawing some conclusions over around based on a number of different data points so my answer to your question is absolutely it should sort itself out i think there s still a question how long it takes to do so and that s an element of our let s call it conservatism in terms of our posture around that there is people are still buying cars in europe there s nothing in terms of or consumption data in auto that gives you a whole lot of reason for pause at least to us at this point it s much more about the disruption in the production part relative to the emissions testing regime and i don t really think it s smooth sailing from here let s say in terms of how that all plays out based on what we hear joe ritchie goldman sachs analyst that s fair scott and i guess just a quick follow up on that you guys give us guidance on the whole growth outlook for test measurement and electronics just wondering and i know that you ve got the current run rate but the electronics business i guess we ve been seeing some softness and all and any color on that business specifically and what you are seeing in terms of this perspective will be helpful scott santi chairman and chief executive officer no most of our position in the electronics space is really more i would say mro related so we re not with a couple of exceptions just one in seven we re not sort of upstream in terms of production equipment so that from our standpoint the electronics has been pretty stable but it s but we re able to describe this pretty downstream from the standpoint of where we participate there michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer yes clean room mro items scott santi chairman and chief executive officer mro items non production items operator and our next question comes from ann duignan your line is open ann duignan j p morgan analyst good morning most of my questions have been asked so just philosophic i just wanted to ask about pulling that quarterly guidance i m just curious about timing and what are your thoughts through the fact that with that quarterly guidance the probability is that in the sales side estimates will be more variable and then you re more likely to meet some of these expectations and therefore have greater earnings volatility which actually meant covering the multiple on itself so i m just curious why you chose now to not giving quarterly guidance scott santi chairman and chief executive officer well since we re having this one in six years we thought we would try something different i m just kidding i think ultimately we talked to a lot of our shareholders and there s a fair amount of effort that goes into providing it there is philosophical differences around again what we think the core investor value proposition for itw which is really around strength of competitive advantage in the business model resilience in terms of high quality diversified portfolio all of those things are really oriented toward longer time periods of performance and given all that i think this is we felt like we have as i think michael said in his remarks it was valuable early in the process given talking about the enterprise strategy now and then at this point we ve progressed starting upwards it s not value added anymore and the last thing i would say and this will be a little smirky and i don t intend to be but we listen to your boss jamie dimon who told us that and a lot of companies should be doing this i m just kidding operator and our next question comes from steven fisher ubs your line is open steven fisher ubs analyst thanks good morning i just wanted to follow up on the oil and gas question more from the revenue side of things just wondering to what extent you re seeing any change in momentum in the oil and gas business in the last two three months or so and how that s filtering into your primarily i guess the 3 to 6 growth in your welding business michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer yes our exposure is pretty limited overall to oil and gas it s primarily on the international side in the welding business and we ve just started to see a pickup in oil and gas here in q3 and q4 we gave you the number here and we haven t seen any changes over the last couple of months if that s what you re asking operator and our next question comes from nicole deblase deutsche bank your line is open nicole deblase deutsche bank analyst yes thanks good morning michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer good morning nicole deblase deutsche bank analyst given that some of the i guess some of the commentary around why organic growth is a little bit lower for the full year is semiconductor s electronics i guess i m curious i don t think that that came up in your commentary within t m are you guys actually starting to see a slowdown in semiconductor spend or is that just anticipated to occur throughout 2019 michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer so we did see a slowdown here in q4 not entirely unexpected and again it s in the portion of test and measurement that sells equipment for the upfront manufacturing of in the semiconductor space and we did see a slowdown here in q4 in the past there ve been talks about a pause and then a pick up again in the back end of 2019 and we have taken all that out and basically assumed current run rates based on what we saw in q4 and therefore in our view appropriately risk adjusted for any exposure in semiconductor operator our next question comes from nathan jones from stifel your line is open nathan jones stifel financial corp analyst good morning everyone michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer good morning nathan jones stifel financial corp analyst a couple of follow ups on the welding business there obviously some good organic growth but i know that business does sell a lot of steel so maybe if you could give us some color on what the input is from volumes versus price both in the fourth quarter and what the pricing tailwind to revenue at least is in 2019 michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer yes so nathan we do not break out price versus volume at the enterprise level or by segment including for welding so i m afraid i can t give you that nathan jones stifel financial corp analyst ok no worries just one on the construction business you talked about new product releases on slide for this year can you talk about when you expect those to start hitting the market and any color you could give on the anticipated contribution michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer yes so it s a pretty long list of new products centered around our cordless technology where itw is the market leader they come in throughout the year the various geographies typically the contribution from new products is somewhere in the 1 range in terms of overall revenue growth and we expect it just based on the pipeline to be a little bit higher than that in construction this year operator our next question comes from josh pokrzywinski from morgan stanley your line is open josh pokrzywinski morgan stanley analyst hi good morning michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer good morning josh pokrzywinski morgan stanley analyst just to follow up on michael i get the part of your answer to the last question that you don t really want to break out price at the enterprise level but it seems like some of the confidence in the year comes from maybe a bit more pricey yield and perhaps some commercial initiatives that offset some of that auto commentary is that a fair assessment relative to prior years that you guys just feel like outside of perhaps auto that you re carrying a bit more price than usual and able to kind of hold up at least any downside scenario michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer i don t know if you really thought about it the way you re articulating it i mean but certainly like i said earlier in six out of seven segments so excluding auto there s we ve taken pricing actions to offset raw material cost inflation and tariff impact and so to the extent that we ll probably have a little bit more price coming through in 19 than in 18 and that certainly helps the overall organic growth rate scott santi chairman and chief executive officer but we offset price every year michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer yes we get price every year maybe a little bit more 19 than 18 but it s not a big driver year operator and our next question comes from david raso evercore isi your line is open david raso evercore isi analyst hi good morning i had another question but just wanted to circle back first on the organic sales guide i mean i just wanted to make sure the takeaway is correct the idea of the first quarter being flat the second quarter you do expect it to improve i m just making sure we are all level set just given the idea that it s flat in the first quarter if the first second quarter is not at least one or two it makes the second half obviously a little more of a struggle so i just wanted to make sure we re level set on that so if you can you give us some perspective and then my real question food and welding food and welding are going to be over 55 in dollar terms of your ebit growth i mean inside the organic sales growth in those businesses it s good to see food pick up on a year over year basis in the fourth quarter can you give us any help with not a backlog number an order number just something kind of looking into 19 that give us some perspective of the starting point of growth sort of already booked relative or just given their significance to the overall growth versus 19 scott santi chairman and chief executive officer i ll answer the second and throw it back to michael for the first these are all short cycled businesses are from the standpoint of we get an order today we ship it tomorrow what i can tell you is book to bill in both businesses in q4 was positive so order rates are at or above shipment rates in q4 we don t build these aren t big backlog businesses is my point these are given the way we deliver we get an order today we ship it tomorrow and we don t build backlogs so but from the standpoint of just order rates relative to shipment rates things in q4 in both businesses were pretty solid michael larsen senior vice president chief financial officer yes that s where i was going to go with this welding just grew organic 8 on a tough comp they re up 6 in q4 last year food equipment up 5 organic so good momentum in those two businesses in terms of the q1 q2 question without telling you anything new really i mean i think we did say that we have 1 less shipping day in the first quarter which lowers our overall organic growth rate by mathematically a point and a half we do not have that headwind in q2 so i don t know if that helps you in terms of what q2 might

on friday morning donald trump tweeted jobs jobs jobs and who could blame him a couple of hours earlier the labor department reported that payrolls had increased by three hundred and four thousand in january which was about a hundred and thirty thousand more jobs than economists on wall street had been predicting the job gains were widely spread across the economy with the construction health care retail and leisure and hospitality sectors showing particular strength the report also showed that wages are still rising at an annual rate of more than three per cent while consumer price inflation is falling because of cheaper energy prices that means that inflation adjusted wages are rising as well which is key as i ve said many times before it is unwise to read too much into one month s job figures they are drawn from a sample survey carried out by the government and have a pretty large statistical margin of error attached to them they sometimes get revised substantially in subsequent months furthermore they can be distorted by temporary factors such as freak weather conditions after friday s report came out a number of analysts suggested that milder weather than usual during the first few weeks of january could have accounted for as many as a hundred thousand extra hires maybe that was the case but even taking all these cautionary notes into account the jobs report was surprisingly strong it comes at a time that economic growth in china and europe is slowing the u s stock market has recently been through a shaky period some prominent economists such as lawrence summers the former treasury secretary have warned about a possible recession and just this week the federal reserve has pressed the pause button on its policy of raising interest rates despite all this employers are still hiring at a healthy rate as they have been doing for many months now in an analysis of friday s report jared bernstein a senior fellow at the center on budget and policy priorities pointed out that in the past three months job growth has averaged two hundred and forty one thousand a month and in the past year it has averaged two hundred and thirty four thousand a month with all this hiring going on and vacancies plentiful many people who had retired or dropped out of the labor force have returned to it in the past twelve months the labor force has risen by more than 2 1 million but even with more people looking for work job growth has been strong enough to keep the unemployment rate at or below four per cent and employers have been forced to raise wages in order to retain their own employees and find new ones in other words american workers are finally enjoying economic conditions that favor them over employers this is drawing people back into the labor force and producing higher wages indeed bernstein suggested that recent wage growth has probably been strong enough to tilt the over all split between wages and profits in the direction of workers which would reverse long standing trends in summing up the lessons of the jobs figures bernstein wrote first in an economy with too little worker bargaining power and too much inequality the benefits of closing in on full employment are powerful and equalizing and second chair powell and the fomc were smart to put interest rate hikes on hold there s non inflationary room to run in this job market that there is but how much room the fed s decision to call a time out on raising interest rates was predicated on the assumption that the economy is likely to slow down in the coming months which would keep inflationary pressures at bay perhaps this will happen but the boffo payrolls figure for january was accompanied by another strong report for industrial production a separate indicator consumer sentiment did fall sharply last month most analysts attributed that to the government shutdown now that the shutdown has ended consumer sentiment will probably pick up again the shutdown didn t significantly affect the jobs report federal workers who were furloughed were counted as employed friday s strong numbers are a reminder that the american economy isn t a zippy speedboat that can stop and start at short notice it s a vast supertanker that tends to plow ahead once it has built up some momentum bringing it shuddering to a halt requires something dramatic such as the bursting of an asset price bubble a big financial crisis of the sort we saw in 2008 or sharply higher interest rates right now none of those things is in place on the other hand the trump g o p tax stimulus is running down and the trade war with china is affecting manufacturing adversely ian shepherdson a chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics thinks that these factors could cause g d p growth to fall from about three per cent in 2018 to closer to two per cent in 2019 but i don t think it is going to slow down enough to get the fed off the hook when it comes to the labor market he said the fact is wage growth is accelerating in the past twelve months it has risen from 2 6 per cent to 3 3 per cent according to shepherdson s calculations with low unemployment continuing and workers realizing they have more bargaining power than they have had in a long time wage inflation will continue to rise he predicted the big question he added is how the fed will react when this happens
by trevor hunnicutt new york reuters while the u s federal reserve s indication it is done raising interest rates for now has fueled stock gains investors worry the u s central bank s pledge is a double edged sword and implicit confirmation of the markets lingering anxiety about growth fed chairman jerome powell said on wednesday that u s economic growth is solid and expected to continue but in a sharp reversal of their stance just six weeks ago powell said the fed has the luxury of patience in deciding whether to raise rates again the fed s soothing message sent the s p 500 up 1 6 percent on wednesday and extended into thursday helping the benchmark index post its biggest january percentage gain since 1987 but investors acknowledge that the fed s strongest signal yet that policymakers may have reached the end of its latest series of interest rate increases could reflect slower economic growth both the stock and bond markets applauded the fed for its more dovish tone said michael arone chief investment strategist at state street global advisors if you take a step back and evaluate why they re doing it it s because they re concerned so why shouldn t investors be concerned the u s bond market never fully bought into the enthusiastic tenor to risk markets including equities year to date given signs of cracks in the consumer and peaking corporate profit growth u s 10 year government bond prices are trading around the elevated levels they commanded during last month s stock sell off with yields at 2 63 percent today compared with 2 69 percent on dec 31 u s based bond funds pulled in 16 7 billion in january according to early estimates from the research service lipper investors took 944 million out of domestic stock funds over the same period the bond market always gets it before the stock market said chuck self chief investment officer at isectors llc stocks sure footedness this year may end up like 2018 s hot january rally only to peter out and end in the negative three and 5 year yields are poised to dip below the 2 4 percent effective fed funds rate for the first time since 2006 before the global financial crisis noted crescat capital llc analyst otavio costa on twitter powell said there were conflicting signals about the economy many of them negative including sharply slower growth in china and europe britain s chaotic exit from the european union u s china trade negotiations effects of the u s partial government shutdown and rougher markets the fed acknowledged that some market gauges of inflation have fallen in recent months a trend more typical of growth slowdowns rather than an economy on fire the international monetary fund predicted the global economy will grow at 3 5 percent in 2019 down 0 2 percentage point from last october s forecasts citing weakness in europe and some emerging markets it puts u s growth at 2 5 percent this year and 1 8 percent in 2020 in both cases likely slower than 2018 s figures which have not been finalized due to the government shutdown graphic fed s powell vs s p 500 we re not favoring the u s market but we re happy to own treasuries said schroders plc portfolio manager angus sippe he said he does not see a recession on the horizon and gives the fed an a plus on its management of the economy but he would rather take risk in emerging markets and wait for more evidence of u s corporate earnings growth financial research service refinitiv expects 14 9 percent earnings growth for the final quarter of 2018 but just 5 1 percent for all of 2019 leaving less margin for error if consumer and business fear translates into lower spending and investment still oil producers are working to stabilize prices china is aggressively stimulating its economy and as bank of america corp analysts said in a research note on thursday the fed has shown that its commitment to supporting markets is alive and well those factors mean market pessimists are getting it wrong according to michael jones chairman at riverfront investment group llc some investors appear to be positioning for the worst futures contracts tied to fed rates imply the fed s next move will be a cut markets are pricing in a higher probability of two cuts by next january than of a single rate hike reporting by trevor hunnicutt editing by jennifer ablan and lisa shumaker

mobile mini s fourth quarter 2018 conference call i am erik olsson mobile mini s ceo and with me are kelly williams our president and coo and van welch our executive vice president and cfo let me begin by saying that 2018 was an exceptional year for mobile mini a year in which we exceeded achieved or made significant progress on each goal specified in our evergreen model as a result our full year consolidated rental revenues grew 12 and adjusted ebitda for the year increased 18 to 217 2 million with a margin of 36 6 an expansion of 200 basis points as compared to full year 2017 in addition our flow through approached 60 we had a healthy improvement in return on capital employed we increased our dividends by 10 per share and we delevered from to 4 2 times down from 5 0 times at december 31 2017 so overall an impressive 2018 capped off by a very strong fourth quarter looking back the fourth quarter of 2017 was an inflection point for our the storage solutions business and even more so for our tank pump solutions segment 10 stocks we like better than mobile mini when investing geniuses david and tom gardner have a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has quadrupled the market david and tom just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now and mobile mini wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of january 31 2019 throughout 2018 we continued to build on that momentum and really separated ourselves from the pack as the premium provider for both segments of our business especially for large national customers who value our nationwide presence and connectivity tools that we provide as a result q4 18 tank pump rental revenues were up a strong 16 1 year over year north american storage solutions were up a solid 10 3 year over year and the u k actually grew 2 year over year in local currency in the quarter despite of brexit uncertainties we made great strides with our margin expansion focus in the fourth quarter of 2018 storage solutions reached 40 4 adjusted ebitda margin and tank pump reached 35 adjusted ebitda margin up 90 and 410 basis points respectively year over year it should be noted that we performed at this high level while at the same time finalizing the divestiture and disposal of more than 26 000 units under our solstice program and exited 13 yards we encourage you to review the full quarterly deck providing more detailed results which has been posted to our website as usual for more information on our fourth quarter i would now like to turn over the call to kelly to discuss our fourth quarter operational results and he will be followed by van who will discuss our financial results i will then conclude the prepared remarks with our current view of markets and provide some commentary on our 2019 expectations after which we will open up the call to questions kelly williams president and chief operating officer thank you erik and good morning everyone i m kelly williams mobile mini s president and chief operating officer as erik stated all of our business segments performed well in the fourth quarter on the tank pump solutions side average oec fleet on rent increased 17 1 fleet on rent grew throughout the quarter as new landed fleet was immediately placed on rent throughout the quarter we expect average fleet on rent to continue to ramp up in the first quarter of 2019 to meet overall demand rates for tank pump solutions firmed up in the second half of the year beginning in april of 2018 we have achieved year over year rate increases for new equipment placed on rent averaging mid single digit growth we continue to drive increased rate with spot contracts for smaller and midsized customers where there is greater opportunity for rate expansion downstream revenues which comprise the majority of our tank pump solutions business increased 19 in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year quarter we had meaningful revenue related to five new contracts we entered into in late 2017 and expect to achieve our run rate in the first half of 2019 we do believe there s potential to expand our share of business with this group of customers as we establish ourselves further and demonstrate the value we bring to their operations increased demand in the upstream business drove healthy growth in both units on rent and rate as we continue to optimize the business in the upstream with limited further investment in north america storage solutions our national account sales force continues to progress driving our competitive advantage of a dense u s footprint as a result of the strong performance from the sales team along with the excellent execution from our field employees our seasonal business units on rent was up nearly 15 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 and 38 up compared to 2016 the increased seasonal business contributed to overall consolidated average unit on rent growth of 2 7 for the storage business we also continue to achieve healthy rate increases in our storage solutions business north american rental rates excluding our seasonal business were up 3 4 year over year with rates on newly placed units up 3 8 in local currency u k rental revenue was up 2 year over year in q4 reflecting a 1 increase in rate as well as a slight increase in units on rent while brexit continues to contribute to economic uncertainty in the u k we have not seen a material negative effect on our business and our pipeline looks stable in the fourth quarter of 2018 we completed the asset divestiture that we first announced in our second quarter conference call our strengthened fleet management processes promote a more efficient use of our capital resources to improve our return on capital in addition we are driving annualized operational cost savings of approximately 5 million to 7 million our unavailable fleet calculated on an oec basis at the end of the year dropped to 10 8 for our storage solutions business compared to approximately 15 at the end of the year 2017 unavailable fleet for our tank pump business dropped to 12 3 at the end of the year 2018 compared to unavailable fleet of approximately 14 last year the 2017 numbers have been adjusted to exclude the divested fleet our storage solutions business average unit utilization increased to 85 2 from 75 7 in the prior year and we achieved tank pump average oec utilization of 76 compared to 73 in the prior year quarter our nps and ces scores remained world class in the fourth quarter at 85 and 9 3 respectively earning customer loyalty is a critical part of our strategy as a company and we strive to separate ourselves from the competition by asking ourselves how we can be easy to do business with and how we can meet the needs of our customers one way that mobile mini differentiates itself from other rental companies is our customer facing technological solutions our customer portal mm connect provides our customers real time access to track their units on rent order new units request services review account history and make payments by the end of 2018 more than 18 000 individual registered users had access to mm connect this compares to 5 600 customers in 2017 we now have over 70 of our national accounts registered on mm connect further our tank pump sales force continues to utilize envirotrack a gps and smart device enabled solution to gain an audience with potential new customers envirotrack allows our tank pump solutions customers to manage both their equipment on rent as well as their waste streams through the life cycle of the rental period in addition we believe that when customers utilize envirotrack we become more embedded in the customers processes which promotes long lasting relationships and we are more likely to gain ancillary revenue in 2018 the revenue captured through envirotrack more than doubled we will continue to roll out enhancements to these customer facing technological tools in 2019 with a continued focus on mobility lastly as we head into 2019 our storage solutions pending orders in north america are significantly up compared to this time in the prior year and our business is positioned to capitalize on the growing demand from all of its end markets i will now hand the call over to van to discuss the financial results of the fourth quarter van welch executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you kelly and good morning everyone beginning with revenue we had a solid 9 8 total rental revenue increase compared to q4 2017 in our tank pump business we marked the fourth quarter of sequential rental revenue growth and recorded the highest quarterly rental revenue since we acquired the business in late 2014 with year over year organic growth of 16 1 storage solution rental revenues were up 8 3 year over year driven by increases in both units owned rent and rates as well as favorable mix and increased trucking revenues rental revenue grew 10 3 for north american storage solutions with increases in units on rent in both our seasonal business and our underlying core business national account revenues continue to drive these revenues and represent approximately 43 of our north american storage solutions revenue for the fourth quarter and 36 for the full year in the u k rental revenues are up 2 year over year in local currency with increases in both rate and units on rent while the slower construction activity and uncertainty surrounding brexit is dampening growth in our u k segment our business has remained stable turning to profitability our adjusted ebitda was 63 3 million for the quarter and our margin was 39 3 for q4 with the leverage of our infrastructure and gained operating efficiencies the increased revenues are resulting in expanded margins storage solutions adjusted ebitda of 52 3 million increased 10 7 from the prior year and the margin was up 90 basis points to 40 4 the adjusted ebitda growth and margin expansion was primarily driven by our north american business adjusted ebitda for our storage solutions in north america increased 12 7 and the margin expanded 110 basis points tank pump solutions adjusted ebitda of 11 million was up 30 7 compared to prior year with a 410 basis point increase in margin from 30 9 in q4 17 to 35 in q4 18 the growth is due to increased business across both our downstream and upstream markets rental selling and general expenses as a percentage of total revenues were down 50 basis points compared to the prior year quarter overall these costs were up approximately 8 7 primarily due to costs related to higher rental activity including salary and transportation costs additionally variable compensation and share based compensation expense increased due to improved year over year performance as a percentage of revenue rental selling and general expenses were down to 59 1 from 59 6 in q4 17 we expect our adjusted ebitda margin to continue to expand in 2019 and we expect adjusted ebitda flow through for the full year to achieve our evergreen model target of 60 our adjusted effective tax rate for q4 was 28 while our full year adjusted effective rate is 25 5 the higher effective tax rate in the back half of the year was primarily due to the impact of a new minimum tax in the united states related to our u k operations and partially offset by other discrete items we expect an effective tax rate of 25 to 27 for 2019 we had approximately 150 million in federal nols at december 31 2018 and are not a u s federal cash tax payer as a result we do not expect to pay meaningful u s federal cash taxes until at least 2022 free cash flow was 24 9 million in q4 2018 up 6 7 million from q4 2017 the increase was comprised of a healthy year over year increase of 4 1 million in cash from operating activities and a 2 6 million decrease in net capital expenditures the charts on slide 16 highlight our capex spend in total for the full year 2018 we had 87 2 million in net capital expenditures during the fourth quarter we had net fleet capital expenditures of 16 8 million of which 10 8 million was for north american storage solutions and 5 4 million related to tank pump solutions due to the dampened economy in the u k we made very limited capital expenditures in our u k storage solutions business capex purchases are made to fill specific growth demand and opportunities and with the expectation that the fleet will be placed on rent in the very near term at optimized rates within north america storage solutions purchases have occurred in geographic areas of high demand as well as to buy and modify our high demand glo units the tank pump solutions fleet was purchased to meet customer demand largely related to the new msa ramp we anticipate that total net capital expenditures for the full year 2019 will be approximately 75 million to 80 million a decrease compared to full year 2018 our expenditures will be focused on north american storage solutions and downstream tank pump solutions to meet anticipated growth most of our capital expenditure is entirely within management discretion should demand differ from what we anticipate we will increase or decrease our capital expenditures accordingly as you can see on slide 17 our leverage ratio decreased to 4 2 times in the quarter down meaningfully from five times at december 31 2017 this decrease in our leverage ratio is largely due to increased adjusted ebitda as well as decreased debt during 2018 we paid down nearly 41 million on our line of credit and increased abl availability to more than 400 million we continue to balance our long term leverage goals with the current demand environment and anticipate that our leverage ratio will be around 3 5 times to 3 7 times by the end of 2019 so overall the very good fourth quarter results reflect the execution of our strategies in both segments and our positioning of the company to benefit from the continuation and expansion of the positive trends in our customer end segments with that i will return the call to erik thank you very much erik olsson chief executive officer thank you van i d like to now discuss our economic outlook the economic environment for our u s end markets which represents 86 of our business continued to be positive for the fourth quarter based on available forecasts and our assessment based on current business trends we expect that the majority if not all of our end markets will continue to drive healthy demand for our products construction which represents approximately 36 of our consolidated rental revenue is forecasted to continue to grow economic indicators related to our industrial and commercial customers which comprise approximately 25 of rental revenue are also favorable with positive trends in both production and capacity utilization we believe the oil and gas cycle will remain favorable to us with high level of activity downstream and upstream where rig count now stands at 1 075 retail and consumer service customers comprise approximately 25 of our rental revenue and setting the short term impact of the government shutdown aside consumer confidence remains at historic highs we do the vast majority of our retail business with stand alone retailers as opposed to mall retailers where most of the retail pain have been felt overall real u s gdp remains strong with forecasted growth in 2019 of approximately 2 5 additionally unemployment is forecasted to continue to decline in 2019 now global trade tariffs and additional federal reserve tightening could pose potential headwinds to the business environment but we have yet to see any impact of that the u k market overall is impacted by the continued brexit uncertainty but our u k storage units on rent as of december 31 2018 was actually up slightly year over year so against this economic backdrop mobile mini enters 2019 a financially stronger and more efficient company than ever before so in 2019 we expect our rental revenue increase to exceed our evergreen model we will accomplish this growth by continued focus on our national sales augmented by growth at the local and regional level we re poised to deliver additional enhancements to the technological tools valued by our national customers especially in the area of mobility specific to the tank pump side of our business we will continue to grow revenues by leveraging envirotrack which our customers use to manage both their equipment on rent as well as their waste streams through the life cycle of the rental period technology is a real market differentiator enabling us to develop strong long term relationships with customers helping them to be more productive and thus drive market share we will also continue to explore partnering with other rental companies to provide supplementary product offerings mainly to construction sites in the early phase of a project customers have a need for some basic products at the site in addition to the storage containers like sensing generators toilets etc and arranging these comprehensive additional rental services for our customers through rerents from other suppliers as a one stop shop provider increases customer loyalty while generating additional rental revenue for us with no additional capex we also expect to increase our return on capital employed as we leverage our existing infrastructure and fleet management to expand our flow through and grow our adjusted ebitda margin as a result of the increase in revenues and expanded flow through in 2019 we expect to generate healthy levels of free cash flow which we will deploy to best bring value to our shareholders we ve announced that in the first quarter of 2019 we will increase our dividends to shareholders by 10 this marks the fifth year that we have increased dividends since we began paying them in 2014 in addition we expect to use cash to meaningfully delever and as always we re open to potential acquisitions of varying sizes as a method to create value gain market share and to expand to new or underserved markets in conclusion i would like to congratulate and thank all the mobile mini employees who execute their jobs with dedication and excellence on a daily basis job well done with that i will turn the call over to the operator for instructions on the q a thank you very much questions and answers operator our first question comes from the line of scott schneeberger from oppenheimer co please proceed with your question scott schneeberger oppenheimer co inc analyst thanks very much good afternoon good morning i guess first question could you speak to the i guess it would be cost drivers of what prevented you from achieving the 60 flow through guidance for 2018 and then what gives you the confidence that you ll be able to do it now in 2019 thanks van welch executive vice president and chief financial officer yes scott this is van i think from a cost standpoint in q4 we had a bit higher variable compensation cost in q4 primarily driven by the strong performance in tank pump solutions not just for the q4 but for the whole year we had increased cost around some of which were volume driven around trucking salaries related to that we also had increased stock based comp although that s not going to be a matter of ebitda or adjusted ebitda again associated with strong performance so looking forward and we ve looked at it quite hard i think from an operational standpoint we can get back to that 60 flow through with continuing to increase price we ve talked about the optimization associated with the yards and how we re going to reduce the yard cost going forward to the tune of about five to seven in 2019 that s certainly going to add to our ability to increase flow through as well erik olsson chief executive officer yes so scott to be fair i think we got pretty close in the mid to high 50s here for the year and in addition to the costs van mentioned there i d also like to point out two operational items that impacted the quarter as well one was the solstice project which disposing of 26 000 units basically affecting all our yards and so it s obviously a distraction or a cost driver in itself and secondly i think you may recall that on the third quarter we talked about our seasonal business being a little bit later than usual that there were a lot of customers still hadn t placed their complete orders so we had a huge flood of both orders and deliveries obviously in q4 of seasonal units to which in the end ended up being a record year again for us so i d say those things were also impacting our performance van welch executive vice president and chief financial officer and scott this is van again as erik mentioned that push into q4 that created driver overtime as well it also created across our expense that we had to do in q4 also with that increased seasonal getting on the revenue side but with that increased seasonal we saw increased revenues around trucking and our margins in trucking were better actually year over year but from a total company standpoint those margins are dilutive to the rental space so all of that when you take that combined that contributed to the slightness that we had in the flow through scott schneeberger oppenheimer co inc analyst all right thanks guys yes i mean it s 55 is not bad it s just it was short of the guidance by 10 so that s meaningful and then and so obviously there is some concern for that in the coming year and van you highlighted a kind of price increases and optimization be it the 5 million to 7 million i presume is on track those are some other things i guess maybe the strategy on seasonal rentals i mean yes you have a lot more trucking which is lower revenues which is lower margin and then you had all this overtime how will you be able to manage seasonal next year so you don t have that negative or that lesser margin contribution and then just because also the seasonal rental itself clearly from the numbers total rental rate growth was 1 8 in fourth quarter 3 4 excluding seasonal so it obviously came through this year at a lower price point could you talk to price in seasonal as well and just strategic view of what you re going to do with seasonal next year thanks kelly williams president and chief operating officer yes sure scott this is kelly i ll kind of jump in here and give you a little bit of an overview of both seasonal and pricing associated so we had a really big mix shift with a couple of our largest contract price customers increasing their seasonal volume and as erik mentioned it actually came a little bit later than normal in terms of the calendar year so we saw volume up substantially to prior year and even though the pricing is discounted slightly to those typical retail customers without on the seasonal business without contract pricing the volume was significant and really short period or window for us to respond in so we ended up cross hiring or outsourcing a lot of those rentals not only through a partnership agreement that we touched on in terms of managed services but also in transportation so though it s overall it s dilutive to our margins it drives tremendous ebitda and there s no required capital spend and so it s a strategic decision that we made in a couple of our largest customers we certainly continue to create loyalty with them and we continue to look down this path of cross hiring and partnering up where we can continue to drive and optimize the business without increasing capital and i think you see that in the improvement in the return on capital employed scott schneeberger oppenheimer co inc analyst ok thanks kelly i ll switch it up just one more to sneak in i ve taken some time over in tank pump pricing trends what were you seeing in the fourth quarter and what s the visibility how far out into 19 can you see and what are you seeing thanks kelly williams president and chief operating officer yes scott this is kelly again it s certainly significantly better as i stated in the opening since april we ve seen year over year rate increases on new equipment on a sequential basis and i believe we got into the mid single digits on new maybe 5 or 6 year over year on new equipment going out and we re positive on the composite and i would tell you that on the small and midsized non contract customers we continue to see very strong improvement in pricing and we ve even been able to go in on some of these blue chip contract customers and drive some incremental improvements in pricing and trucking but it s really in that spot market where we ve been able to take advantage of that and again even though the upstream is better and we ve seen some improvements there it s really around this downstream where we ve continued to drive improvements in price and it s really been across the board so i think we feel very confident in 2019 on the tank pump side regarding pricing scott schneeberger oppenheimer co inc analyst yes thanks a lot i ll turn it over operator our next question comes from the line of andrew wittmann with robert w baird please proceed with your question andrew wittmann robert w baird co analyst great thank you and good morning i guess i wanted to start with the commentary that you had about in storage that the pending units were up significantly i d like to understand a little bit more about that maybe what the drivers of that are maybe by end markets and the rates that you believe that you ll be having associated with that as those go into service here presumably in the first quarter kelly williams president and chief operating officer yes andrew how are you doing this is kelly so i think if you look at the pending orders and really how we are able to articulate our pipeline our pending orders are significantly up and i think we were able to better forecast 2018 based on kind of understanding what the run rate or pipeline looks like over a four or five month period and i will tell you it s still in the remodel side from a retail standpoint we certainly see that rolling into 2019 and a lot of that is driven through our national account business which we ve really taken advantage of the footprint that we ve got in centralizing that decision making and we do from a pricing standpoint i know that question was asked our national account pricing is a couple of points lower than our overall pricing but we continue to move and make sure that we manage both volume and price and i think as you saw in the report we had new units on rent going up 3 8 outside of seasonal so i think we re doing a really good job of managing that and we re certainly conscious of the mix between the national account business and the spot or the retail business but i think overall we ve done a really nice job with that and i would just tell you that a lot of that is driving that those pending orders in 2019 which looks strong again on what was a record year for us in 2018 so very confident here in the first half of 2019 for sure andrew wittmann robert w baird co analyst ok well that s interesting and seems consistent with kind of what you ve been saying as a key driver i guess maybe just because of its relative importance a little bit more detail on the construction as an end market the last couple of quarters at least if we just use your pie chart against the revenues the construction end market has been kind of flat to down ish your commentary was pretty positive maybe a little bit more detail on that end market too kelly would be helpful for everyone kelly williams president and chief operating officer yes so i would tell you that if you just go by dodge and what s important to us is project starts because we ve got an opportunity to go out in the early phase and that s where we would win we have the opportunity there to build a relationship and i would even tell you that allows us to walk into the managed services concept as well where we ve been able to create loyalty with our customers with that mid 80s net promoter score and we can leverage driving other sources of revenue but when you look at dodge in terms of project starts and overall valuation it s still in the 1 5 to 2 up to prior year and that was very similar to 17 to 18 so i would say if you when we look at that gdp plus three i think you re still from a construction standpoint we would feel confident that if construction starts are up one to two that we could grab 3 4 5 and that s what we re seeing and slightly better than that on the pending orders erik olsson chief executive officer yes andrew just to add to that that even though the percentage in the pie chart is flat to maybe down on construction we re still growing the construction segment it s just that the other segment is growing growing even faster andrew wittmann robert w baird co analyst got it ok i guess my next question is just a little bit more detailed on the disposition and yard closure plan it sounds like the all of that has been instituted now and i guess the question specifically would be can you quantify for us the benefit that that was for 4q if any as well as or maybe the exit run rate would also be helpful so that we can gauge how much of a benefit that will be on a year over year basis as we put our models together for 19 van welch executive vice president and chief financial officer andrew this is van i mean we re done i mean project solstice we met the deadline or the schedule for the end of the year and we re complete we did about 26 000 units as erik mentioned i think in his prepared remarks that we were able to dispose of we did generate we have generated some savings in the latter half of the year around closures of yards as well as reduced r m and headcount it s to the tune of about 2 million if you looked at it for the last half of the year most of that coming in q4 andrew wittmann robert w baird co analyst got it and just given that five to seven range do you have any more visibility now that it s all been implemented at what you think that will be on an annualized basis at the low end or the top end van welch executive vice president and chief financial officer i think it s going to be i mean i think i would say it s probably more on the top end and we ll certainly update you on that as we go forward andrew wittmann robert w baird co analyst that would be helpful and then my last question at least for now is regarding overall labor inflation it sounds like there s some driver overtime and maybe some agency where you had to outsource a little bit from your prior comments was there any fundamental just i mean it s a tight labor market it s like the worst kept secret everybody knows that i guess my question is what levels of wage inflation are you seeing on the ground in your business and maybe even for context could you talk about how much of what percentage of revenue that labor represents that we can kind of get our arms around that erik olsson chief executive officer yes percent of labor i don t know that we have that right here but we ll help you with that i mean we don t see anything dramatic in terms of salary inflation obviously on our driver side we obviously try to be market based we are adjusting to local markets all the time but at the end of the day i don t think we ve seen anything truly dramatic there i think here is one reason where our variable comp is helping us our drivers also included in that program and i think that provides a certain or it does provide stickiness and loyalty and i m pleased to say that we have today we have more drivers than we ve ever had in the company s history even though we would like to have some more but we re up significantly during the course of 2018 van welch executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i think just to add on to what erik said andrew in terms of the increase year over year it s mostly due to numbers of drivers rather than wage although the numbers have gone up slightly we also we paid a little bit more overtime associated around those drivers than what we did year over year based on that concentration of the seasonal activity that happened in q4 andrew wittmann robert w baird co analyst all right great thanks guys for your comments have a good day van welch executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator our next question comes from the line of marc riddick with sidoti please proceed with your question marc riddick sidoti company llc analyst hey good morning gentlemen a quick question i wanted to go back to the commentary around the services the service offerings that you re looking at and being more of a partner and being that one stop provider i was wondering if you could touch a little bit on maybe some areas that might make sense in bringing in house as far as maybe potential acquisitions if there are some sort of natural types of services that would be maybe an easier fit to execute on and then i have a follow up after that erik olsson chief executive officer i mean we are very very disciplined and stringent in the types of product that we actually spend capex dollars on we re steel centric long lived assets low technology component low r m needs and high margins and if we look at that there are very few other product lines that fit into that those characteristics so we think this is a great little business for us to have and use rerents for as being a service provider we are able to mark up the rerents significantly and we don t have to touch these products they go from the third party vendor directly to the customers and we just intercept the invoice in between the two kelly williams president and chief operating officer marc i would just add this is kelly that it s erik made mention of it being a one stop shop i think that we really found there was an opportunity to increase the current customer wallet share and expand revenues it was revenue for the customer it was a new market segment we think it s a differentiation advantage for us but it still drives us toward renting more containers when it s all said and done and so a lot of that is again back to the net promoter score the loyalty that we ve got seeing that we re early on in the job site from the customer they just feel it s easier for us to go ahead and manage some of these smaller dollar ancillary type streams for them that are a little bit more challenging especially as they enter a new city so it s really a testament to our ability with the at the national account level and at the local level to build these relationships where they would just as soon us take over and manage that process so it s a service offering more than it is us considering another product marc riddick sidoti company llc analyst ok and that s great and that leads into kind of where i was going with this and it seems as though that this is something that is targeted or perhaps be most receptive from national accounts and i was wondering if you can maybe talk a little bit even if it s anecdotal as to sort of how you came to see these opportunities and general target market is this something that you re looking at national accounts being the vast majority of what you re going after here or if you could share a little bit more on that kelly williams president and chief operating officer it is yes sure it is today i think that s where it originated and i think it s mainly centered around the construction customer where again we started to we have relationships obviously with other suppliers and not just in our own space but also in when you start to talk a little bit about fencing and portable toilets that type of thing where we have these relationships that we were asked to do early on and i think we found that it was a real opportunity and we partnered with a couple of customers we test pilot it we put a really solid marketing plan out there and i think we certainly see the opportunity and going back to the general rental days with erik and i this was something that was very coveted in the industrial market where it was just it s very tedious they are low cost items and they would prefer if you have that relationship with the customer for you to manage that entire process and i think we just carried some of those thoughts around managed services to the construction site here and again based on the fact we ve got such tremendous loyalty scores with our customers it s kind of been a seamless transition marc riddick sidoti company llc analyst ok great then one last thing for me i just want to circle back a little bit just sort of follow up on sort of what we might see going forward as far as how these things kind of play out when you re looking at the seasonal business given what you learned from this past seasonal i know you kind of start this process with your retail consumer customers it seems like over the summer and if what you learned this past season might have some impact on either the timing or the depth to which the planning for upcoming seasons going forward might be altered or do you think that the late orders were kind of maybe one time in nature and you don t foresee a change in sort of how you go into the season with those customers thank you kelly williams president and chief operating officer well yes we certainly prepare believe it or not with seasonal as early as april and may even though we know that that doesn t really get launched into august or september but what ended up happening here is that as you think about how we view the retail business with the big box retailers those particular customers have been stable continuing to grow and really have taken advantage of the market share from the some of the other strip mall type retailers that have struggled and i think everybody s familiar with who those are we fortunately had some great relationships with these customers and they saw a really nice boost in q4 but even for them it came late and so i d like to think that we could get out in front of it but i think this was more a one time scenario but we certainly always look to prepare and plan as early as possible and i think we ve done a better job like i ve made mention in the prepared remarks we re up almost 40 in our seasonal volume from 2016 so this again is a real testament to the national account managers and our ability to establish relationships and drive purchasing decision on a centralized level marc riddick sidoti company llc analyst ok great thank you very much kelly williams president and chief operating officer thanks operator our next question comes from the line of sam england with berenberg please proceed with your question sam england berenberg capital markets analyst hi guys just a quick couple for me just looking over the last couple of years you ve seen the dso sort of ticking up a bit i just wondered if there s anything behind that or whether that s predominantly down to sort of shift toward national customers van welch executive vice president and chief financial officer yes sam i think as we ve grown the national accounts we re still working those invoice administrative procedures with that national account business that s been a bit of a drag on dso i m still looking at that taking care of itself in the in early ish 2019 it s a bit higher than where we want it to be and i think once we get those resolved that would be that will help now if you go back several years to before we acquired tank pump the tank pump payment terms are a bit higher than the than what we would expect in the storage solutions side so with that growth the dso has gone up a bit more but we ve got we certainly have a have a path for improvement on that dso calculation sam england berenberg capital markets analyst great thanks and then the next one just looking at the evergreen model i noticed you re really getting within sort of touching distance of some of the metrics within that do you think if you sort of go past any of the targets that you ve got you would look to revise that model or do you expect it will just stay sort of where it is as a sort of three cycle target in the longer term erik olsson chief executive officer i mean i think we some of those targets i think is truly evergreen like leverage or return on capital or above cost of capital etc but i think as we approach our 40 ebitda margin and we re getting close i think once we hit that we would reevaluate and possibly set the higher target there sam england berenberg capital markets analyst ok great and then last one just around these agreements with other equipment rental businesses do they work in sort of a reciprocal way if they re renting equipment to someone and the customer is looking for your type of units will they put you in touch with the end customer i e is there a sort of potential revenue benefit for you in the longer term of sort of your partners referring business to you kelly williams president and chief operating officer they do when they re outside of the competitive landscape of portable storage absolutely those are relationships and partnerships that work both ways for us we certainly look to take advantage of that sam england berenberg capital markets analyst ok that s all for me thanks very much kelly williams president and chief operating officer thank you operator ladies and gentlemen we have reached the end of the question and answer session and i would like to turn the call back to erik olsson for closing remarks erik olsson chief executive officer thank you very much operator and thank you very much everyone for participating on this call we had a great fourth quarter and we are very optimistic about 2019 here and we look forward to reporting on our q1 results in at the end of april thank you very much

put the tough questions on the table regarding intellectual property rights forced technology transfer industrial policy and non tariff barriers however the meeting ended with very positive statements from both sides see us china trade a deal in sight look out for xi trump meeting s 1 february for more details the us trade representative robert lighthizer and treasury secretary stephen mnuchin are now set to go to beijing in mid february for talks and trump has said that the last difficult questions will be resolved by trump and xi at a meeting in the near future the tone in an oval office meeting between trump and the us and china trade teams was cordial trump described a letter from xi jinping which was read out as beautiful trump said there had been tremendous progress and it will be the biggest deal ever made robert lighthizer emphasized enforcement enforcement enforcement in his comment at the meeting but also pointed to progress in the talks fox news published a video on 31 january adding to the positive picture this week china is fast tracking a new foreign investment law that among other things will ban the transfer of technology and improve protection of intellectual property rights see xinhua 29 january and reuters 30 january comment we are getting more confident that we are closer to a deal and that the probability of a deal in march has increased the intense efforts put into the talks at the highest level including from trump and xi suggest that both sides are very keen to get the work done it will give china more breathing space in tackling its debt challenges and trump can present himself as the great deal maker to the american population going into the 2020 election campaign with a package that will benefit key voters in swing states at the meeting in the oval office trump emphasised several times the large amount of soybeans that china will now buy and how it would benefit the farmers us taking a tough stance on huawei how far will it go while the prospect of an end to the trade war has improved the tech war is nowhere near an end this week the us raised the stakes by filing charges against huawei and formally requesting extradition of huawei s cfo meng wengzhou from canada the prosecution against huawei concern two areas 1 committing bank fraud by violating us sanctions against iran and 2 stealing trade secrets from an american rival t mobile us inc in a case that goes back to 2014 see bloomberg28 january huawei has denied the allegations of bank fraud and stated that the dispute with t mobile us inc was settled in 2017 see geekwire 17 may 2017 for more on the settlement the us indictment revealed that the fbi interviewed the huawei founder ren zhengfei in 2007 about the company s dealings with iran according to the indictment ren zhengfei identified as individual 1 falsely stated to the fbi that huawei had not dealt directly with any iranian company it suggests even ren could be charged as well see washington post 29 january the us charges also concern a claim that huawei offered bonuses to employees who stole confidential information from other firms a spokesman for china s ministry of industry and information technology said that the us had no proof to back up the charges and called them unfair and immoral china s foreign ministry said in a statement that beijing would resolutely protect the interests of chinese companies comment trade deal or not it is clear the tech war will rage on some us politicians have argued for a ban of selling microchips to huawei which could cause severe disruption for huawei in the short term however a step like that would in our view quickly back fire and possibly trigger a consumer boycott of us goods in china for more on huawei and the tech war see this article in foreign affairs is huawei a pawn in the trade war 30 january chinese pmi data weak but rays of light hint at bottom soon both the private and official version of pmi manufacturing was released this week the pmi is one of our favourite gauges of the state of the chinese business cycle the official version surprised a bit to the upside whereas the private version declined sharply some may say this is a sign that the official data are unreliable however it is actually the case that the official version has dropped much more in previous months and the private version is simply catching up with this weakness see top chart on page 1 on a positive note the export orders in both sets of pmi point to stabilisation bottom and the same picture emerges when looking at metal prices which are normally a good real time indicator for chinese activity china consumes 50 of global metals china announced further stimulus for consumers this week offering subsidies on cars and home appliances see reuters 29 january there were no details though and it is unclear how significant it is we still await an announcement on further tax cuts comment we still look for a bottom in the

and welcome to mobile mini s fourth quarter 2018 conference call i am erik olsson mobile mini s ceo and with me are kelly williams our president and coo and van welch our executive vice president and cfo let me begin by saying that 2018 was an exceptional year for mobile mini a year in which we exceeded achieved or made significant progress on each goal specified in our evergreen model as a result our full year consolidated rental revenues grew 12 and adjusted ebitda for the year increased 18 to 217 2 million with a margin of 36 6 an expansion of 200 basis points as compared to full year 2017 in addition our flow through approached 60 we had a healthy improvement in return on capital employed we increased our dividends by 10 per share and we delevered from to 4 2 times down from 5 0 times at december 31 2017 so overall an impressive 2018 capped off by a very strong fourth quarter looking back the fourth quarter of 2017 was an inflection point for our the storage solutions business and even more so for our tank pump solutions segment more from the motley fool throughout 2018 we continued to build on that momentum and really separated ourselves from the pack as the premium provider for both segments of our business especially for large national customers who value our nationwide presence and connectivity tools that we provide as a result q4 18 tank pump rental revenues were up a strong 16 1 year over year north american storage solutions were up a solid 10 3 year over year and the u k actually grew 2 year over year in local currency in the quarter despite of brexit uncertainties we made great strides with our margin expansion focus in the fourth quarter of 2018 storage solutions reached 40 4 adjusted ebitda margin and tank pump reached 35 adjusted ebitda margin up 90 and 410 basis points respectively year over year it should be noted that we performed at this high level while at the same time finalizing the divestiture and disposal of more than 26 000 units under our solstice program and exited 13 yards we encourage you to review the full quarterly deck providing more detailed results which has been posted to our website as usual for more information on our fourth quarter i would now like to turn over the call to kelly to discuss our fourth quarter operational results and he will be followed by van who will discuss our financial results i will then conclude the prepared remarks with our current view of markets and provide some commentary on our 2019 expectations after which we will open up the call to questions kelly williams president and chief operating officer thank you erik and good morning everyone i m kelly williams mobile mini s president and chief operating officer as erik stated all of our business segments performed well in the fourth quarter on the tank pump solutions side average oec fleet on rent increased 17 1 fleet on rent grew throughout the quarter as new landed fleet was immediately placed on rent throughout the quarter we expect average fleet on rent to continue to ramp up in the first quarter of 2019 to meet overall demand rates for tank pump solutions firmed up in the second half of the year beginning in april of 2018 we have achieved year over year rate increases for new equipment placed on rent averaging mid single digit growth we continue to drive increased rate with spot contracts for smaller and midsized customers where there is greater opportunity for rate expansion downstream revenues which comprise the majority of our tank pump solutions business increased 19 in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year quarter we had meaningful revenue related to five new contracts we entered into in late 2017 and expect to achieve our run rate in the first half of 2019 we do believe there s potential to expand our share of business with this group of customers as we establish ourselves further and demonstrate the value we bring to their operations increased demand in the upstream business drove healthy growth in both units on rent and rate as we continue to optimize the business in the upstream with limited further investment in north america storage solutions our national account sales force continues to progress driving our competitive advantage of a dense u s footprint as a result of the strong performance from the sales team along with the excellent execution from our field employees our seasonal business units on rent was up nearly 15 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 and 38 up compared to 2016 the increased seasonal business contributed to overall consolidated average unit on rent growth of 2 7 for the storage business we also continue to achieve healthy rate increases in our storage solutions business north american rental rates excluding our seasonal business were up 3 4 year over year with rates on newly placed units up 3 8 in local currency u k rental revenue was up 2 year over year in q4 reflecting a 1 increase in rate as well as a slight increase in units on rent while brexit continues to contribute to economic uncertainty in the u k we have not seen a material negative effect on our business and our pipeline looks stable in the fourth quarter of 2018 we completed the asset divestiture that we first announced in our second quarter conference call our strengthened fleet management processes promote a more efficient use of our capital resources to improve our return on capital in addition we are driving annualized operational cost savings of approximately 5 million to 7 million our unavailable fleet calculated on an oec basis at the end of the year dropped to 10 8 for our storage solutions business compared to approximately 15 at the end of the year 2017 unavailable fleet for our tank pump business dropped to 12 3 at the end of the year 2018 compared to unavailable fleet of approximately 14 last year the 2017 numbers have been adjusted to exclude the divested fleet our storage solutions business average unit utilization increased to 85 2 from 75 7 in the prior year and we achieved tank pump average oec utilization of 76 compared to 73 in the prior year quarter our nps and ces scores remained world class in the fourth quarter at 85 and 9 3 respectively earning customer loyalty is a critical part of our strategy as a company and we strive to separate ourselves from the competition by asking ourselves how we can be easy to do business with and how we can meet the needs of our customers one way that mobile mini differentiates itself from other rental companies is our customer facing technological solutions our customer portal mm connect provides our customers real time access to track their units on rent order new units request services review account history and make payments by the end of 2018 more than 18 000 individual registered users had access to mm connect this compares to 5 600 customers in 2017 we now have over 70 of our national accounts registered on mm connect further our tank pump sales force continues to utilize envirotrack a gps and smart device enabled solution to gain an audience with potential new customers envirotrack allows our tank pump solutions customers to manage both their equipment on rent as well as their waste streams through the life cycle of the rental period in addition we believe that when customers utilize envirotrack we become more embedded in the customers processes which promotes long lasting relationships and we are more likely to gain ancillary revenue in 2018 the revenue captured through envirotrack more than doubled we will continue to roll out enhancements to these customer facing technological tools in 2019 with a continued focus on mobility lastly as we head into 2019 our storage solutions pending orders in north america are significantly up compared to this time in the prior year and our business is positioned to capitalize on the growing demand from all of its end markets i will now hand the call over to van to discuss the financial results of the fourth quarter van welch executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you kelly and good morning everyone beginning with revenue we had a solid 9 8 total rental revenue increase compared to q4 2017 in our tank pump business we marked the fourth quarter of sequential rental revenue growth and recorded the highest quarterly rental revenue since we acquired the business in late 2014 with year over year organic growth of 16 1 storage solution rental revenues were up 8 3 year over year driven by increases in both units owned rent and rates as well as favorable mix and increased trucking revenues rental revenue grew 10 3 for north american storage solutions with increases in units on rent in both our seasonal business and our underlying core business national account revenues continue to drive these revenues and represent approximately 43 of our north american storage solutions revenue for the fourth quarter and 36 for the full year in the u k rental revenues are up 2 year over year in local currency with increases in both rate and units on rent while the slower construction activity and uncertainty surrounding brexit is dampening growth in our u k segment our business has remained stable turning to profitability our adjusted ebitda was 63 3 million for the quarter and our margin was 39 3 for q4 with the leverage of our infrastructure and gained operating efficiencies the increased revenues are resulting in expanded margins storage solutions adjusted ebitda of 52 3 million increased 10 7 from the prior year and the margin was up 90 basis points to 40 4 the adjusted ebitda growth and margin expansion was primarily driven by our north american business adjusted ebitda for our storage solutions in north america increased 12 7 and the margin expanded 110 basis points tank pump solutions adjusted ebitda of 11 million was up 30 7 compared to prior year with a 410 basis point increase in margin from 30 9 in q4 17 to 35 in q4 18 the growth is due to increased business across both our downstream and upstream markets rental selling and general expenses as a percentage of total revenues were down 50 basis points compared to the prior year quarter overall these costs were up approximately 8 7 primarily due to costs related to higher rental activity including salary and transportation costs additionally variable compensation and share based compensation expense increased due to improved year over year performance as a percentage of revenue rental selling and general expenses were down to 59 1 from 59 6 in q4 17 we expect our adjusted ebitda margin to continue to expand in 2019 and we expect adjusted ebitda flow through for the full year to achieve our evergreen model target of 60 our adjusted effective tax rate for q4 was 28 while our full year adjusted effective rate is 25 5 the higher effective tax rate in the back half of the year was primarily due to the impact of a new minimum tax in the united states related to our u k operations and partially offset by other discrete items we expect an effective tax rate of 25 to 27 for 2019 we had approximately 150 million in federal nols at december 31 2018 and are not a u s federal cash tax payer as a result we do not expect to pay meaningful u s federal cash taxes until at least 2022 free cash flow was 24 9 million in q4 2018 up 6 7 million from q4 2017 the increase was comprised of a healthy year over year increase of 4 1 million in cash from operating activities and a 2 6 million decrease in net capital expenditures the charts on slide 16 highlight our capex spend in total for the full year 2018 we had 87 2 million in net capital expenditures during the fourth quarter we had net fleet capital expenditures of 16 8 million of which 10 8 million was for north american storage solutions and 5 4 million related to tank pump solutions due to the dampened economy in the u k we made very limited capital expenditures in our u k storage solutions business capex purchases are made to fill specific growth demand and opportunities and with the expectation that the fleet will be placed on rent in the very near term at optimized rates within north america storage solutions purchases have occurred in geographic areas of high demand as well as to buy and modify our high demand glo units the tank pump solutions fleet was purchased to meet customer demand largely related to the new msa ramp we anticipate that total net capital expenditures for the full year 2019 will be approximately 75 million to 80 million a decrease compared to full year 2018 our expenditures will be focused on north american storage solutions and downstream tank pump solutions to meet anticipated growth most of our capital expenditure is entirely within management discretion should demand differ from what we anticipate we will increase or decrease our capital expenditures accordingly as you can see on slide 17 our leverage ratio decreased to 4 2 times in the quarter down meaningfully from five times at december 31 2017 this decrease in our leverage ratio is largely due to increased adjusted ebitda as well as decreased debt during 2018 we paid down nearly 41 million on our line of credit and increased abl availability to more than 400 million we continue to balance our long term leverage goals with the current demand environment and anticipate that our leverage ratio will be around 3 5 times to 3 7 times by the end of 2019 so overall the very good fourth quarter results reflect the execution of our strategies in both segments and our positioning of the company to benefit from the continuation and expansion of the positive trends in our customer end segments with that i will return the call to erik thank you very much erik olsson chief executive officer thank you van i d like to now discuss our economic outlook the economic environment for our u s end markets which represents 86 of our business continued to be positive for the fourth quarter based on available forecasts and our assessment based on current business trends we expect that the majority if not all of our end markets will continue to drive healthy demand for our products construction which represents approximately 36 of our consolidated rental revenue is forecasted to continue to grow economic indicators related to our industrial and commercial customers which comprise approximately 25 of rental revenue are also favorable with positive trends in both production and capacity utilization we believe the oil and gas cycle will remain favorable to us with high level of activity downstream and upstream where rig count now stands at 1 075 retail and consumer service customers comprise approximately 25 of our rental revenue and setting the short term impact of the government shutdown aside consumer confidence remains at historic highs we do the vast majority of our retail business with stand alone retailers as opposed to mall retailers where most of the retail pain have been felt overall real u s gdp remains strong with forecasted growth in 2019 of approximately 2 5 additionally unemployment is forecasted to continue to decline in 2019 now global trade tariffs and additional federal reserve tightening could pose potential headwinds to the business environment but we have yet to see any impact of that the u k market overall is impacted by the continued brexit uncertainty but our u k storage units on rent as of december 31 2018 was actually up slightly year over year so against this economic backdrop mobile mini enters 2019 a financially stronger and more efficient company than ever before so in 2019 we expect our rental revenue increase to exceed our evergreen model we will accomplish this growth by continued focus on our national sales augmented by growth at the local and regional level we re poised to deliver additional enhancements to the technological tools valued by our national customers especially in the area of mobility specific to the tank pump side of our business we will continue to grow revenues by leveraging envirotrack which our customers use to manage both their equipment on rent as well as their waste streams through the life cycle of the rental period technology is a real market differentiator enabling us to develop strong long term relationships with customers helping them to be more productive and thus drive market share we will also continue to explore partnering with other rental companies to provide supplementary product offerings mainly to construction sites in the early phase of a project customers have a need for some basic products at the site in addition to the storage containers like sensing generators toilets etc and arranging these comprehensive additional rental services for our customers through rerents from other suppliers as a one stop shop provider increases customer loyalty while generating additional rental revenue for us with no additional capex we also expect to increase our return on capital employed as we leverage our existing infrastructure and fleet management to expand our flow through and grow our adjusted ebitda margin as a result of the increase in revenues and expanded flow through in 2019 we expect to generate healthy levels of free cash flow which we will deploy to best bring value to our shareholders we ve announced that in the first quarter of 2019 we will increase our dividends to shareholders by 10 this marks the fifth year that we have increased dividends since we began paying them in 2014 in addition we expect to use cash to meaningfully delever and as always we re open to potential acquisitions of varying sizes as a method to create value gain market share and to expand to new or underserved markets in conclusion i would like to congratulate and thank all the mobile mini employees who execute their jobs with dedication and excellence on a daily basis job well done with that i will turn the call over to the operator for instructions on the q a thank you very much questions and answers operator our first question comes from the line of scott schneeberger from oppenheimer co please proceed with your question scott schneeberger oppenheimer co inc analyst thanks very much good afternoon good morning i guess first question could you speak to the i guess it would be cost drivers of what prevented you from achieving the 60 flow through guidance for 2018 and then what gives you the confidence that you ll be able to do it now in 2019 thanks van welch executive vice president and chief financial officer yes scott this is van i think from a cost standpoint in q4 we had a bit higher variable compensation cost in q4 primarily driven by the strong performance in tank pump solutions not just for the q4 but for the whole year we had increased cost around some of which were volume driven around trucking salaries related to that we also had increased stock based comp although that s not going to be a matter of ebitda or adjusted ebitda again associated with strong performance so looking forward and we ve looked at it quite hard i think from an operational standpoint we can get back to that 60 flow through with continuing to increase price we ve talked about the optimization associated with the yards and how we re going to reduce the yard cost going forward to the tune of about five to seven in 2019 that s certainly going to add to our ability to increase flow through as well erik olsson chief executive officer yes so scott to be fair i think we got pretty close in the mid to high 50s here for the year and in addition to the costs van mentioned there i d also like to point out two operational items that impacted the quarter as well one was the solstice project which disposing of 26 000 units basically affecting all our yards and so it s obviously a distraction or a cost driver in itself and secondly i think you may recall that on the third quarter we talked about our seasonal business being a little bit later than usual that there were a lot of customers still hadn t placed their complete orders so we had a huge flood of both orders and deliveries obviously in q4 of seasonal units to which in the end ended up being a record year again for us so i d say those things were also impacting our performance van welch executive vice president and chief financial officer and scott this is van again as erik mentioned that push into q4 that created driver overtime as well it also created across our expense that we had to do in q4 also with that increased seasonal getting on the revenue side but with that increased seasonal we saw increased revenues around trucking and our margins in trucking were better actually year over year but from a total company standpoint those margins are dilutive to the rental space so all of that when you take that combined that contributed to the slightness that we had in the flow through scott schneeberger oppenheimer co inc analyst all right thanks guys yes i mean it s 55 is not bad it s just it was short of the guidance by 10 so that s meaningful and then and so obviously there is some concern for that in the coming year and van you highlighted a kind of price increases and optimization be it the 5 million to 7 million i presume is on track those are some other things i guess maybe the strategy on seasonal rentals i mean yes you have a lot more trucking which is lower revenues which is lower margin and then you had all this overtime how will you be able to manage seasonal next year so you don t have that negative or that lesser margin contribution and then just because also the seasonal rental itself clearly from the numbers total rental rate growth was 1 8 in fourth quarter 3 4 excluding seasonal so it obviously came through this year at a lower price point could you talk to price in seasonal as well and just strategic view of what you re going to do with seasonal next year thanks kelly williams president and chief operating officer yes sure scott this is kelly i ll kind of jump in here and give you a little bit of an overview of both seasonal and pricing associated so we had a really big mix shift with a couple of our largest contract price customers increasing their seasonal volume and as erik mentioned it actually came a little bit later than normal in terms of the calendar year so we saw volume up substantially to prior year and even though the pricing is discounted slightly to those typical retail customers without on the seasonal business without contract pricing the volume was significant and really short period or window for us to respond in so we ended up cross hiring or outsourcing a lot of those rentals not only through a partnership agreement that we touched on in terms of managed services but also in transportation so though it s overall it s dilutive to our margins it drives tremendous ebitda and there s no required capital spend and so it s a strategic decision that we made in a couple of our largest customers we certainly continue to create loyalty with them and we continue to look down this path of cross hiring and partnering up where we can continue to drive and optimize the business without increasing capital and i think you see that in the improvement in the return on capital employed scott schneeberger oppenheimer co inc analyst ok thanks kelly i ll switch it up just one more to sneak in i ve taken some time over in tank pump pricing trends what were you seeing in the fourth quarter and what s the visibility how far out into 19 can you see and what are you seeing thanks kelly williams president and chief operating officer yes scott this is kelly again it s certainly significantly better as i stated in the opening since april we ve seen year over year rate increases on new equipment on a sequential basis and i believe we got into the mid single digits on new maybe 5 or 6 year over year on new equipment going out and we re positive on the composite and i would tell you that on the small and midsized non contract customers we continue to see very strong improvement in pricing and we ve even been able to go in on some of these blue chip contract customers and drive some incremental improvements in pricing and trucking but it s really in that spot market where we ve been able to take advantage of that and again even though the upstream is better and we ve seen some improvements there it s really around this downstream where we ve continued to drive improvements in price and it s really been across the board so i think we feel very confident in 2019 on the tank pump side regarding pricing scott schneeberger oppenheimer co inc analyst yes thanks a lot i ll turn it over operator our next question comes from the line of andrew wittmann with robert w baird please proceed with your question andrew wittmann robert w baird co analyst great thank you and good morning i guess i wanted to start with the commentary that you had about in storage that the pending units were up significantly i d like to understand a little bit more about that maybe what the drivers of that are maybe by end markets and the rates that you believe that you ll be having associated with that as those go into service here presumably in the first quarter kelly williams president and chief operating officer yes andrew how are you doing this is kelly so i think if you look at the pending orders and really how we are able to articulate our pipeline our pending orders are significantly up and i think we were able to better forecast 2018 based on kind of understanding what the run rate or pipeline looks like over a four or five month period and i will tell you it s still in the remodel side from a retail standpoint we certainly see that rolling into 2019 and a lot of that is driven through our national account business which we ve really taken advantage of the footprint that we ve got in centralizing that decision making and we do from a pricing standpoint i know that question was asked our national account pricing is a couple of points lower than our overall pricing but we continue to move and make sure that we manage both volume and price and i think as you saw in the report we had new units on rent going up 3 8 outside of seasonal so i think we re doing a really good job of managing that and we re certainly conscious of the mix between the national account business and the spot or the retail business but i think overall we ve done a really nice job with that and i would just tell you that a lot of that is driving that those pending orders in 2019 which looks strong again on what was a record year for us in 2018 so very confident here in the first half of 2019 for sure andrew wittmann robert w baird co analyst ok well that s interesting and seems consistent with kind of what you ve been saying as a key driver i guess maybe just because of its relative importance a little bit more detail on the construction as an end market the last couple of quarters at least if we just use your pie chart against the revenues the construction end market has been kind of flat to down ish your commentary was pretty positive maybe a little bit more detail on that end market too kelly would be helpful for everyone kelly williams president and chief operating officer yes so i would tell you that if you just go by dodge and what s important to us is project starts because we ve got an opportunity to go out in the early phase and that s where we would win we have the opportunity there to build a relationship and i would even tell you that allows us to walk into the managed services concept as well where we ve been able to create loyalty with our customers with that mid 80s net promoter score and we can leverage driving other sources of revenue but when you look at dodge in terms of project starts and overall valuation it s still in the 1 5 to 2 up to prior year and that was very similar to 17 to 18 so i would say if you when we look at that gdp plus three i think you re still from a construction standpoint we would feel confident that if construction starts are up one to two that we could grab 3 4 5 and that s what we re seeing and slightly better than that on the pending orders erik olsson chief executive officer yes andrew just to add to that that even though the percentage in the pie chart is flat to maybe down on construction we re still growing the construction segment it s just that the other segment is growing growing even faster andrew wittmann robert w baird co analyst got it ok i guess my next question is just a little bit more detailed on the disposition and yard closure plan it sounds like the all of that has been instituted now and i guess the question specifically would be can you quantify for us the benefit that that was for 4q if any as well as or maybe the exit run rate would also be helpful so that we can gauge how much of a benefit that will be on a year over year basis as we put our models together for 19 van welch executive vice president and chief financial officer andrew this is van i mean we re done i mean project solstice we met the deadline or the schedule for the end of the year and we re complete we did about 26 000 units as erik mentioned i think in his prepared remarks that we were able to dispose of we did generate we have generated some savings in the latter half of the year around closures of yards as well as reduced r m and headcount it s to the tune of about 2 million if you looked at it for the last half of the year most of that coming in q4 andrew wittmann robert w baird co analyst got it and just given that five to seven range do you have any more visibility now that it s all been implemented at what you think that will be on an annualized basis at the low end or the top end van welch executive vice president and chief financial officer i think it s going to be i mean i think i would say it s probably more on the top end and we ll certainly update you on that as we go forward andrew wittmann robert w baird co analyst that would be helpful and then my last question at least for now is regarding overall labor inflation it sounds like there s some driver overtime and maybe some agency where you had to outsource a little bit from your prior comments was there any fundamental just i mean it s a tight labor market it s like the worst kept secret everybody knows that i guess my question is what levels of wage inflation are you seeing on the ground in your business and maybe even for context could you talk about how much of what percentage of revenue that labor represents that we can kind of get our arms around that erik olsson chief executive officer yes percent of labor i don t know that we have that right here but we ll help you with that i mean we don t see anything dramatic in terms of salary inflation obviously on our driver side we obviously try to be market based we are adjusting to local markets all the time but at the end of the day i don t think we ve seen anything truly dramatic there i think here is one reason where our variable comp is helping us our drivers also included in that program and i think that provides a certain or it does provide stickiness and loyalty and i m pleased to say that we have today we have more drivers than we ve ever had in the company s history even though we would like to have some more but we re up significantly during the course of 2018 van welch executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i think just to add on to what erik said andrew in terms of the increase year over year it s mostly due to numbers of drivers rather than wage although the numbers have gone up slightly we also we paid a little bit more overtime associated around those drivers than what we did year over year based on that concentration of the seasonal activity that happened in q4 andrew wittmann robert w baird co analyst all right great thanks guys for your comments have a good day van welch executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator our next question comes from the line of marc riddick with sidoti please proceed with your question marc riddick sidoti company llc analyst hey good morning gentlemen a quick question i wanted to go back to the commentary around the services the service offerings that you re looking at and being more of a partner and being that one stop provider i was wondering if you could touch a little bit on maybe some areas that might make sense in bringing in house as far as maybe potential acquisitions if there are some sort of natural types of services that would be maybe an easier fit to execute on and then i have a follow up after that erik olsson chief executive officer i mean we are very very disciplined and stringent in the types of product that we actually spend capex dollars on we re steel centric long lived assets low technology component low r m needs and high margins and if we look at that there are very few other product lines that fit into that those characteristics so we think this is a great little business for us to have and use rerents for as being a service provider we are able to mark up the rerents significantly and we don t have to touch these products they go from the third party vendor directly to the customers and we just intercept the invoice in between the two kelly williams president and chief operating officer marc i would just add this is kelly that it s erik made mention of it being a one stop shop i think that we really found there was an opportunity to increase the current customer wallet share and expand revenues it was revenue for the customer it was a new market segment we think it s a differentiation advantage for us but it still drives us toward renting more containers when it s all said and done and so a lot of that is again back to the net promoter score the loyalty that we ve got seeing that we re early on in the job site from the customer they just feel it s easier for us to go ahead and manage some of these smaller dollar ancillary type streams for them that are a little bit more challenging especially as they enter a new city so it s really a testament to our ability with the at the national account level and at the local level to build these relationships where they would just as soon us take over and manage that process so it s a service offering more than it is us considering another product marc riddick sidoti company llc analyst ok and that s great and that leads into kind of where i was going with this and it seems as though that this is something that is targeted or perhaps be most receptive from national accounts and i was wondering if you can maybe talk a little bit even if it s anecdotal as to sort of how you came to see these opportunities and general target market is this something that you re looking at national accounts being the vast majority of what you re going after here or if you could share a little bit more on that kelly williams president and chief operating officer it is yes sure it is today i think that s where it originated and i think it s mainly centered around the construction customer where again we started to we have relationships obviously with other suppliers and not just in our own space but also in when you start to talk a little bit about fencing and portable toilets that type of thing where we have these relationships that we were asked to do early on and i think we found that it was a real opportunity and we partnered with a couple of customers we test pilot it we put a really solid marketing plan out there and i think we certainly see the opportunity and going back to the general rental days with erik and i this was something that was very coveted in the industrial market where it was just it s very tedious they are low cost items and they would prefer if you have that relationship with the customer for you to manage that entire process and i think we just carried some of those thoughts around managed services to the construction site here and again based on the fact we ve got such tremendous loyalty scores with our customers it s kind of been a seamless transition marc riddick sidoti company llc analyst ok great then one last thing for me i just want to circle back a little bit just sort of follow up on sort of what we might see going forward as far as how these things kind of play out when you re looking at the seasonal business given what you learned from this past seasonal i know you kind of start this process with your retail consumer customers it seems like over the summer and if what you learned this past season might have some impact on either the timing or the depth to which the planning for upcoming seasons going forward might be altered or do you think that the late orders were kind of maybe one time in nature and you don t foresee a change in sort of how you go into the season with those customers thank you kelly williams president and chief operating officer well yes we certainly prepare believe it or not with seasonal as early as april and may even though we know that that doesn t really get launched into august or september but what ended up happening here is that as you think about how we view the retail business with the big box retailers those particular customers have been stable continuing to grow and really have taken advantage of the market share from the some of the other strip mall type retailers that have struggled and i think everybody s familiar with who those are we fortunately had some great relationships with these customers and they saw a really nice boost in q4 but even for them it came late and so i d like to think that we could get out in front of it but i think this was more a one time scenario but we certainly always look to prepare and plan as early as possible and i think we ve done a better job like i ve made mention in the prepared remarks we re up almost 40 in our seasonal volume from 2016 so this again is a real testament to the national account managers and our ability to establish relationships and drive purchasing decision on a centralized level marc riddick sidoti company llc analyst ok great thank you very much kelly williams president and chief operating officer thanks operator our next question comes from the line of sam england with berenberg please proceed with your question sam england berenberg capital markets analyst hi guys just a quick couple for me just looking over the last couple of years you ve seen the dso sort of ticking up a bit i just wondered if there s anything behind that or whether that s predominantly down to sort of shift toward national customers van welch executive vice president and chief financial officer yes sam i think as we ve grown the national accounts we re still working those invoice administrative procedures with that national account business that s been a bit of a drag on dso i m still looking at that taking care of itself in the in early ish 2019 it s a bit higher than where we want it to be and i think once we get those resolved that would be that will help now if you go back several years to before we acquired tank pump the tank pump payment terms are a bit higher than the than what we would expect in the storage solutions side so with that growth the dso has gone up a bit more but we ve got we certainly have a have a path for improvement on that dso calculation sam england berenberg capital markets analyst great thanks and then the next one just looking at the evergreen model i noticed you re really getting within sort of touching distance of some of the metrics within that do you think if you sort of go past any of the targets that you ve got you would look to revise that model or do you expect it will just stay sort of where it is as a sort of three cycle target in the longer term erik olsson chief executive officer i mean i think we some of those targets i think is truly evergreen like leverage or return on capital or above cost of capital etc but i think as we approach our 40 ebitda margin and we re getting close i think once we hit that we would reevaluate and possibly set the higher target there sam england berenberg capital markets analyst ok great and then last one just around these agreements with other equipment rental businesses do they work in sort of a reciprocal way if they re renting equipment to someone and the customer is looking for your type of units will they put you in touch with the end customer i e is there a sort of potential revenue benefit for you in the longer term of sort of your partners referring business to you kelly williams president and chief operating officer they do when they re outside of the competitive landscape of portable storage absolutely those are relationships and partnerships that work both ways for us we certainly look to take advantage of that sam england berenberg capital markets analyst ok that s all for me thanks very much kelly williams president and chief operating officer thank you operator ladies and gentlemen we have reached the end of the question and answer session and i would like to turn the call back to erik olsson for closing remarks erik olsson chief executive officer thank you very much operator and thank you very much everyone for participating on this call we had a great fourth quarter and we are very optimistic about 2019 here and we look forward to reporting on our q1 results in at the end of april thank you very much operator duration 49 minutes call participants erik olsson chief executive

bullish trends the market tends to trade above the long term moving average and below it during bearish trends in other words at least for me it is the overall trend of the market which determines a bull or bear market currently that trend is still rising but such will not always be the case and we may be in the process of the trend change now fed in 2008 when the fed launched into their accommodative policy emergency strategy to bail out the financial markets the fed s balance sheet was only about 915 billion the fed funds rate was at 4 2 if the market fell into a recession tomorrow the fed would be starting with roughly a 4 trillion dollar balance sheet with interest rates 2 lower than they were in 2009 in other words the ability of the fed to bail out the markets today is much more limited than it was in 2008 valuations one of the most important issues overhanging the market is simply that of valuations as goldman sachs pointed out recently the market is pushing the 89 percentile or higher in 6 out of 7 valuation metrics so just how big of a correction would be required to revert valuations back to long term means michael lebowitz recently did some analysis for ria pro since 1877 there are 1654 monthly measurements of cyclically adjusted price to earnings cape 10 of these 82 only about 5 have been the same or greater than current cape levels 30 5 other than a few instances over the last two years and two others which occurred in 1929 the rest occurred during the late 1990 s tech boom the graph below charts the percentage of time the market has traded at various ranges of cape levels given that valuations are at 30 5x earnings and that profit growth tracks closely with economic growth a reversion in valuations would entail a decline in asset prices from current levels to somewhere between 1350 and 1650 on the s p see table below from the recent market highs such would entail a 54 to 44 decline respectively to learn how to use the table below to create your own s p 500 forecast give ria pro a 14 day free trial run this also corresponds with the currently elevated price to revenue levels which are currently higher than at any point in previous market history given that the longer term norm for the s p 500 price sales ratio is roughly 1 0 a retreat back towards those levels as was seen in 2000 and 2008 each required a price decline of 50 or more economy i discuss with chris our economic output composite indicator eoci to see this more clearly we can look at our own ria economic output composite index eoci which is an extremely broad indicator of the u s economy it is comprised of we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us chicago fed national activity index an index comprised of 85 subcomponents chicago purchasing managers index ism composite index composite of the manufacturing and non manufacturing surveys richmond fed manufacturing survey new york empire manufacturing survey philadelphia fed manufacturing survey dallas fed manufacturing survey markit composite manufacturing survey pmi composite survey economic confidence survey nfib small business index leading economic index lei all of these surveys both soft and hard data are blended into one composite index which when compared to u s economic activity has provided a good indication of turning points in economic activity read more economic growth is slowing and as i penned just recently see article for composite index makeup the domestic economy has already shown early signs of a more significant slowdown given that corporate profits are a function of economic activity it should not be surprising that the rate of change of the s p 500 is closely tied to annual changes in the economic output composite index pension funds an april 2016 moody s analysis pegged the total 75 year unfunded liability for all state and local pension plans at 3 5 trillion that s the amount not covered by current fund assets future expected contributions and investment returns at assumed rates ranging from 3 7 to 4 1 another calculation from the american enterprise institute comes up with 5 2 trillion presuming that long term bond yields average 2 6 with employee contribution requirements extremely low averaging about 15 of payroll the need to stretch for higher rates of return have put pensions in a precarious position and increases the underfunded status of pensions with pension funds already wrestling with largely underfunded liabilities the shifting demographics are further complicating funding problems leverage as i discussed previously what is immediately recognizable is that reversions of negative free cash balances have led to serious implications for the stock market with negative free cash balances still at historically high levels a full mean reverting event would coincide with a potentially disastrous decline in asset prices as investors are forced to liquidate holdings to meet margin calls asset ownership of course the key ingredient is ownership high valuations bullish sentiment and leverage are completely meaningless if there is no ownership of the underlying equities the two charts below show both household and corporate levels of equity ownership relative to previous points in history as can be clearly seen leverage fuels both halves of the full market cycle on the way up increases in leverage provide the capital necessary for accelerated share buybacks and increased speculation in the markets leverage like gasoline is inert until a catalyst is applied it is the unwinding of that leverage that accelerates the liquidation of assets in the markets causes prices to plunge faster and further than most can possibly imagine momentum the chart below shows the real price of the s p 500 index versus its long term bollinger bands valuations relative strength and its deviation above the 3 year moving average the red vertical lines show where the peaks in these measures were historically located what causes the next correction is always unknown until after the fact however there are ample warnings that suggest the current cycle may be closer to its inevitable conclusion than many currently believe there are many factors that can and will contribute to the eventual correction which will feed on the unwinding of excessive exuberance valuations leverage and deviations from long term averages the biggest risk to investors currently is the magnitude of the next retracement as shown below the range of potential reversions runs from 36 to more than 54 that can t happen you say it s happened twice before in the last 20 years and with less debt less leverage and better funded pension plans i leave you with a final thought stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau i do not feel there will be soon if ever a 50 or 60 point break from present levels such as they have predicted i expect to see the stock market a good deal higher within a few months dr irving fisher economist at yale university 1929

this article is more than 5 years old shealah craighead in 2017 former wisconsin governor scott walker gave away 4 billion in precious taxpayer dollars to the multi billion dollar taiwanese electronics manufacturer foxconn in exchange for little more than a handshake commitment to create 13 000 good wisconsin jobs making subcomponents for apple and other electronics producers in the business world these kinds of handshake deals are unheard of big transactions require enforceable contracts but when it comes to our taxpayer dollars giving away large amounts to private companies in exchange for vague commitments has become the norm wisconsin taxpayers were told to trust foxconn to give them a solid return on their investment in the form of desperately needed manufacturing jobs at the time of this unprecedented tax giveaway community leaders spoke out against the deal citing a lack of transparency and the high cost to taxpayers neighboring communities in illinois even called on wisconsin to reconsider the deal which allowed foxconn to duck environmental regulations flash forward surprise surprise foxconn announced this week that it is scaling back its plan to hire a middle skilled manufacturing workforce in wisconsin after talks with president donald trump the company reversed course again saying it will move forward with the construction of the wisconsin facility but did not clarify what type of jobs and how many will be housed at the facility foxconn reneging on its initial agreement dealt a major blow to wisconsin s communities and economy but it is ultimately unsurprising news our cities and states spend tens of billions of taxpayer dollars every year on subsidies to private sector companies with few standards in place as is the case with foxconn public money ends up in the pockets of global corporations who are not held accountable to any kind of written enforceable commitments and it s usually the fiscal conservatives like mr walker who slash public spending on things like schools and healthcare while giving away billions in tax breaks to some of the largest corporations in the world a manufacturing revival like the one foxconn promised for wisconsin is much needed in this country but it s not enough for governments to tie tax credits and incentives to vague unenforceable commitments instead we need cities and states to secure written commitments that bind companies to equitable hiring practices high road standards on job quality the creation of apprenticeship and training programs and environmental regulations these agreements promote long term economic growth and provide cities and states with a mechanism to hold companies accountable fortunately other states and cities in the u s have learned how to act more like responsible business owners than mr walker for example a 5 year old california tax credit program that i sit on the governing committee of awards tax credits to businesses that commit to creating good full time jobs in california with diversity and training the commitments companies make are in writing and the tax credits are subject to recapture should the company not follow through on its promises on the local level los angeles has taken the lead in adopting innovative policies to ensure public spending yields real environmental and economic benefits for communities in 2017 byd a chinese based manufacturer and the world s leading producer of electric buses signed a legally enforceable community benefits agreement with a coalition of labor and community groups including the organization i run in los angeles county as part of the agreement byd agreed to support the creation of a training program and hire a more diverse workforce they now have a 450 000 square foot bus manufacturing facility that employs 750 unionized workers the difference between the foxconn deal and the one with byd is that the community benefits agreement byd signed allows los angeles to hold the company accountable to its promises the state of california and companies like byd are stepping up to create good jobs and invest in america s most marginalized communities while others like foxconn and wisconsin award huge public benefits to private companies without including a mechanism to ensure that commitments to jobs and opportunities are followed through on if we want the government to act more like a responsibly run business then our elected leaders need to represent the best interests of the taxpayers when they are negotiating and enforcing economic development deals without accountability deals like the one with foxconn amount to nothing more than corporate welfare
what does the state of the union look like now that the government shutdown is over as president trump prepares to deliver his annual address to the nation there are a number of public policy priorities that urgently need attention the most important of course is to simply keep the government open and not allow the shutdown to resume when the current short term funding expires february 15 if the government isn t functioning policymakers can t make progress on real life issues that have real life consequences the most pressing priorities facing our nation are the reforms and legislation necessary to ensure that our economy continues to grow and our citizens prosper more than anything we need to preserve protect and enhance our economic expansion here are five top issues that need to be addressed in trump s speech and acted on in congress tax reform landmark tax reform that took effect a year ago has created more jobs put more take home pay in workers pockets helped businesses grow and is increasing our nation s competitiveness in the global economy but the work isn t done among other steps the treasury department should continue its efforts to get guidance out as quickly as possible so taxpayers know how to implement the changes made by tax reform the biggest tax priority for retailers is to fix two tax code typos that have left billions of dollars in potential investment stranded the biggest tax priority for retailers is to fix two tax code typos that have left billions of dollars in potential investment stranded first is a mistake that has required remodeling work at retail stores and restaurants to be depreciated over nearly four decades rather than written off in the first year as meant by congress the immediate write off was intended to unleash a wave of projects worth billions of dollars creating jobs for construction workers boosting orders for materials helping the real estate industry revitalizing troubled shopping malls and struggling downtowns and creating long term employment for countless workers instead even routine remodeling done each year has stalled and countless opportunities for expansion have been lost congress also needs to fix a mistake that has blocked the ability of companies losing money to carry back those losses to years when they had a profit and thereby receive a significant tax refund that could keep them afloat during challenging times this is particularly important for retail companies that have had trouble keeping up with the transformation of the industry and unless the error is corrected soon some of those companies could be gone trade china s abuses of international trade law need to be addressed but the tariffs that have been applied to a wide range of everyday products are driving up costs and reducing opportunities for american consumers workers and businesses far more than they are punishing china in effect we are raising taxes on all americans to teach the chinese government a lesson sure china will feel an impact from tariffs but we shouldn t overlook the fact that many americans will feel the pain more acutely than chinese leaders if these tariffs remain in place for a long time or if the products subject to tariffs are widened we will certainly find ourselves in a painful trade war that will erode much of the prosperity created by tax reform a less harmful approach must be found and found soon in addition this will be the year to conclude action on the new united states mexico canada agreement which takes many important steps to modernize the trading relationships within north america the north american free trade agreement has brought billions of dollars in benefits and millions of jobs to americans and we must encourage congress to approve the new agreement without resorting to extreme steps like withdrawal from the existing nafta before a new agreement is in place immigration a path forward on real immigration reform might allow the current economic expansion to continue the recent government shutdown drama has shown that americans are bitterly divided over questions of immigration and border security a deal on the long term fate of dreamers expanding the number of visas for high tech workers to meet demand and taking steps to allow enough low skilled workers to come to the united states to fill important jobs in agriculture and food production are just a few of the issues that need to be tackled while we don t have a clear consensus on what immigration reform and border security should look like we should be able to agree that these issues need to be solved in a bipartisan fashion there is a good deal to be achieved for both sides if they want it with unemployment close to a 50 year low and new jobs being created every day no one can reasonably argue that legal immigrants would take jobs from americans in fact the opposite might be true a path forward on real immigration reform might allow the current economic expansion and strong job creation to continue for many months or years longer infrastructure there is no issue better suited for finding compromise in a divided government than infrastructure reform unlike issues that inspire partisan rancor there is widespread bipartisan consensus that our transportation and logistics infrastructure is woefully out of date and in disrepair retailers are among the nation s largest shippers and depend on highways and bridges to move merchandise whether it s truckloads of goods to stock store shelves or an online purchase headed to a customer s home unfortunately many are reluctant to make the tough choices on the massive funding required trump last year proposed using 200 billion in federal money to leverage a total 1 5 trillion when combined with state local and private investment whether done through that approach or alternatives this job will only get more expensive the longer it is delayed we hope lawmakers from both sides of the aisle can find room to agree privacy retailers are spending to improve shopping and deliver better customer service but the new privacy rules in california and europe threaten to upend these investments consumer privacy is one of retailers top priorities and in a world of big data it takes on more importance each year but last year s general data protection regulation in europe and the california consumer privacy act set to go into effect next year are both burdensome measures setting challenging precedents that seriously limit retailers ability to deliver the level of customer service consumers have come to expect retailers are collectively spending billions of dollars to improve shopping and deliver better customer service both online and in stores but the new privacy rules in california and europe threaten to upend these investments california and europe got important things wrong in their approaches to privacy regulation congress has an opportunity to do better and create a sensible framework for protecting consumers information in the way they expect it to be protected but without unintended consequences that add friction and delay to every retail customer s shopping experience all of these are priorities but none can be resolved until our biggest priority a government that remains open to do the business of the people regardless of the partisan political squabbles in washington is accomplished

unchanged in danish kroner and increased by 5 in local currency international operations grew by 7 while north america operations sales increased by 3 both measured in local currencies sales growth was mainly driven by the glp 1 franchise with victoza and ozempic combined growth of 18 and accounting for a 78 share of growth in local currencies within research and development several achievements can be highlighted in november we completed the pioneer program for oral semaglutide following the successful completion of the remaining two phase 3a trials pioneer 6 and 9 within biopharmaceuticals we have completed two phase 2 trials explore four with concizumab and the extended real3 trial with somapacitan furthermore we have initiated a phase 2 trial or a once weekly insulin lai287 and a phase 1 trial with laisema a once weekly combination of lai287 and semaglutide turning to financials operating profit declined by 3 sorry 4 in danish kroner and increased by 3 in local currencies in 2018 operating profit was negatively impacted by severance costs related to the layoffs in the second half of 2018 and the expensed priority review vouch before the filing of oral semaglutide adjusted for this operating profit increased by 6 in local currencies the diluted earnings per share increased by 4 to 15 kroner and 93 euro at the annual general meeting the board of directors will propose a final dividend for 2018 of 5 kroner and 15 euro per share in addition to the three kroner per share paid in interim dividend in august 2018 totalling an expected dividend for 2018 of 8 kroner and 15 euro moreover the board of directors intends to initiate a new share repurchase program of up to 15 billion danish kroner which will be executed during the coming 12 months for 2019 outlook sales growth is expected to be 2 to 5 measured in local currencies with an expected positive currency impact of two percentage points the expected sales growth includes a negative impact of approximately 2 billion danish kroner from the change in the funding of the medicare part d coverage gap in the u s operating profit growth is expected to be 2 to 6 measured in local currencies with an expected positive currency impact of 4 percentage points finally the board of directors has adjusted the long term financial target for operating profit after tax to net operating assets from 125 to 80 to reflect the changed accounting principles for handling of leases as well as the expected tangible and intangible investment level in addition the cash to earnings target of 90 is adjusted to 85 also to reflect the investment level the long term financial targets for operating profit growth remains unchanged please turn to slide 5 in 2018 the overall growth was broadly unchanged in danish kroner and increased by 5 in local currencies the sales growth was mainly driven by the diabetes care and obesity segment where the diabetes franchise grew by 4 and accounted for 73 share growth the glp 1 segment was the primarily growth driver where victoza sales increased by 9 and ozempic realized 1 8 billion danish kroner in sales the total insulin sales were broadly unchanged reflecting 5 insulin sales growth in international operations driven by solid tresiba and xultophy volume growth this is offset by the u s insulin sales decline of 9 mainly driven by lower realized prices in the u s basal insulin segments within obesity saxenda grew by 60 measured in local currencies and accounted for 30 share growth biopharmaceutical sales in local currencies were broadly unchanged driven by continued solid execution of the strategic priorities please turn to slide 6 in 2018 sales grew by 5 measured in local currencies international operation s sales increased by 7 where all regions apart from region japan and korea contributed to growth sales in north america operations increased by 3 in local currencies driven by glp 1 sales increasing 19 and saxenda sales increasing 39 for global insulin franchise sales were broadly unchanged in local currencies driven by north america operations declining by 7 partly countered by 5 sales growth in international operations with solid performance within the basal and fast acting insulin segment the decline in north america was primarily driven by lower realized prices in the basal insulin segment partly countered by solid uptake of tresiba and xultophy the glp 1 sales growth of 18 was primarily driven by north america operations and the continued solid market volume growth of the glp 1 class glp 1 sales in international operations increased by 14 mainly driven by region europe with the expanded cv label for victoza and initial contribution from the launch of ozempic as well as inclusion of victoza on the national drug reimbursement list in region china saxenda continues to be a solid growth driver increasing sales by 60 in local currencies in 2018 saxenda sales in the u s increased by 40 driven by a volume market share increase of 7 percentage points to 27 of the branded anti obesity market saxenda has now been launched in 41 countries supporting saxenda sales growth in international operations where sales reached 1 2 billion danish kroner please turn to slide 7 ozempic has now been launched in 11 markets in the u s and canada and nine european countries in the u s novo nordisk is retaining the market leadership with a combined new to brand market share of around 48 the number of new to brand prescriptions for ozempic surpassed victoza in december and the ozempic market share is now 26 the formula records for ozempic is now around 80 combined in canada ozempic continues to increase new to brand prescription market share the latest new to brand prescription market share for victoza and ozempic combined was above 81 with ozempic now having achieved more than 50 ozempic has now been launched in nine markets in europe and by the end of november ozempic had gained around 10 total volume market share in the launch european countries combined the roll out of ozempic continues in 2019 please turn to next slide in the u s glp 1 sales increased by 19 in local currencies in 2018 supported by both victoza with an updated cv label and the ozempic launch the u s glp 1 market continues to expand growing 27 in q4 2018 we are pleased with the ozempic launch which by the end of december 2018 achieved a total glp 1 volume market share of around 8 in the u s novo nordisk has thereby stabilized its total glp 1 volume market share at around 43 please turn to next slide tresiba has gained around 15 market share since the launch in 2016 thereby gaining around five percentage points market share each year in a very competitive basal insulin segment the market uptake has been supported by the updated u s tresiba label including a 40 reduction in severe hypoglycemia compared to insulin glargine u100 by the end of december novo nordisk s combined volume market share for levemir tresiba and xultophy was 36 in the u s basal insulin market please turn to next slide in 2018 obesity sales increased 60 and accounted for 30 share growth the total sales growth was driven by strong volume uptake in both north america operations and international operations novo nordisk is the global value market leader with 45 market share of the anti obesity market in north america saxenda sales increased by 39 in 2018 and novo nordisk increased its value market share to 66 in international operations saxenda sales more than doubled driven by the continued roll out of saxenda in region europe region aameo and region latin america reflecting a solid volume uptake of saxenda which is now launched in 39 countries outside of north america efforts are still needed to expand the obesity segment this is why we invest in progressing our innovative obesity pipeline as well as patient support and educator programs please turn to slide 11 in 2018 biopharmaceutical sales were broadly unchanged measured in local currencies mainly driven by the novoseven sales increasing 11 partly countered by norditropin and novoeight growing 7 and 26 respectively in 2017 novo nordisk implemented a new biopharm strategy with the purpose of returning biopharm growth we have since then launched refixia in 12 countries and we expect the approval of n8 gp in the u s and in europe in the first half of 2019 we have furthermore secured label updates for novoseven for surgical use and increased global focus on acquired haemophila treatment we have progressed our pipeline for both concizumab and xomapacitan furthermore in 2018 two complimentary assets have been added to the biopharm business the in licensing of epidestiny s assets within sickle cell disease called as well as the acquisition of the north american rights for the first fda approved oral diagnosis product for adult growth hormone deficiency macrilen the biopharm business is a key priority to us and we are on track with executing on our biopharm business strategy with this over to mads for an update on r d mads krogsgaard thomsen chief science officer thank you lars please turn to slide 12 with the completion in november of the two final pioneer trials pioneer 6 and 9 the phase 3a program for oral semaglutide has now concluded successfully across all pioneer trials oral semaglutide has demonstrated statistically significant reductions of hemoglobin a1c ranging from 1 to 1 8 at trial completion for the 14 milligram dose these glycemic improvements led to between 52 and 80 of all patients achieving the ada target of an hba1c below 7 in terms of body weight oral semaglutide has demonstrated statistically significant reductions of two kilogram to five kilogram at the 14 milligram dose consequently between 25 and pecernt of patients experienced a weight loss greater than 5 throughout the pioneer trials oral semaglutide has proven to be statistically significantly better regarding both hba1c and weight reduction at trial completion when compared to the leading sglt2 and dpp 4 inhibitors as well as the leading injectable glp 1 analogues liraglutide and dulaglutide in the japanese population oral semaglutide has demonstrated a safe and well tolerated profile consistent with that of the existing glp 1 analogues in the market please turn to slide 13 pioneer 6 investigated the cardiovascular safety of oral semaglutide 14 milligrams compared to placebo both added to standard of care in a trial that enrolled approximately 3 200 adults with type 2 diabetes at high risk of cardiovascular disease pioneer 6 accrued around 140 major adverse cardiovascular events so called mace within a median treatment period of 16 months the primary endpoint was mace defined as the first occurrence of cardiovascular death non fatal myocardial infarction on non fatal stroke the hazard ratio was 0 79 in favor of oral semaglutide compared to placebo implying a 21 albeit non significant reduction in mace the 21 reduction in mace was derived from a statistically significant 51 reduction in cardiovascular death one non fatal myocardial infarction and non fatal stroke did not differ significantly between the groups in addition pioneer 6 showed a statistically significant reduction of 49 in all cause mortality for the oral semaglutide arm furthermore when looking across the two cardiovascular outcome trials performed for semaglutide the observed mace reduction of approximately 25 was found to be driven by all three mace components cardiovascular deaths myocardial infarction and stroke the safety and efficacy profile of oral semaglutide in pioneer 6 was consistent with the profile established in previous pioneer trials pioneer 6 was the last of the 10 phase 3a pioneer trials and oral semaglutide is now almost ready for nda submission novo nordisk has notified the fda that we will ask for a priority review for oral semaglutide based on the priority review voucher acquired in 2018 the use of the priority review voucher shortens the expected fda review period to six months we now expect to file the nda for oral semaglutide with the fda by the end of this quarter and in the eu and japan in the second and third quarters of this year respectively please turn to the next slide in november we initiated the phase 2 program for lai287 the once weekly acylated insulin the first trial is the multinational double blinded active controlled trial with around 350 insulin naive people with type 2 diabetes the main objective is to assess the safety and efficacy profile of lai287 versus once daily glargine u100 in early january of this year we initiated a phase 1 trial for laisema which is the name of the once weekly fixed ratio combination of lai287 and semaglutide the main objective of this trial is to investigate the single dose pharmacokinetics of laisema in a fixed ratio compared to lai287 and semaglutide given separately to people with type 2 diabetes in november we announced the research collaboration with embark biotech focusing on the discovery of novel treatments for obesity the aim of the collaboration is to develop novel drug candidate that help people with obesity to lose weight by increasing the energy expenditure embark biotech will receive research support while novo nordisk has an option to license exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize any discovered drug candidates in december we announced a collaboration and exclusive option agreement with staten biotechnology to develop novel therapeutics for the treatment of cardiovascular disease associated with hypertriglyceridemia novo nordisk will provide research and development funding and support for staten to develop its lead asset stt 505 novo nordisk will according to the agreement have the right to acquire staten biotechnology at a predefined milestone in november we successfully completed the main phase of the phase 2 trial explorer 4 with concizumab the trial evaluated efficacy and safety of the prophylactic administration of subcutaneous concizumab in hemophilia a and b patients both with inhibitors in explorer 4 proof of concept for concizumab was achieved by showing reduced annual bleeding rate on daily subcutaneous concizumab prophylaxis compared with on demand novoseven treatment the results from both explorer 4 and 5 also confirmed the correlation between increased levels of concizumab decreased levels of circulating tfpi and increased clotting potential as evidenced by of thrombin generation potential in most of the patients in both trials concizumab was safe and well tolerated and there were no issues with breakthrough bleed based on these phase 2 results concizumab is now approaching phase 3 readiness and we plan to initiate the phase 3 program in haemophila during the second half of 2019 pending further regulatory dialog furthermore we completed the pediatric phase 2 extension of the real3 trial with a long acting growth hormone somapacitan the endpoint for the real3 extension was to evaluate the effect of different dose regimens for once weekly somapacitan after one full year of treatment compared to daily norditropin the trial confirmed a dose dependent increase in growth velocity and the observed safety profile of somapacitan was similar to that of norditropin novo nordisk is now preparing for the phase 3 program in growth hormone deficient children as well as for a phase 2 trial in children born small for gestational age in addition we are preparing for a regulatory submission of somapacitan for the adult growth hormone deficiency indication in the second half of this year lastly in november we discontinued subcutaneous n8 gp due to detection of anti drug antibodies that were considered to be related to the subcutaneous route of administration in this particular trial please turn to the next slide as mentioned earlier we expect to submit the nda for oral semaglutide to the fda around the end of the first quarter and subsequently to receive expected feedback from the agency toward the end of the third quarter with the utilization of a priority review voucher during q2 and 3 respectively oral semaglutide is furthermore expected to be submitted to the eu and japanese regulators within diabetes we expect to conclude the phase 3b head to head trial comparing tresiba to insulin glargine 300 also known as toujeo in the second quarter of this year within hemophilia we expect the fda and the eu to provide feedback on our n8 gp submission in the first two quarters of this year lastly we expect to initiate the phase 3 program with concizumab in the second half of 2019 with this over to karsten for an update on the financials karsten munk knudsen chief financial officer thank you mads please turn to slide 16 in 2018 sales were broadly unchanged in danish kroner and increased by 5 in local currencies the gross margin was 84 2 measured in danish kroner which is in line with 2017 the unchanged gross margin reflects a negative currency impact of 0 2 percentage point and lower realized prices in the u s offset by improved productivity and a positive contribution from product mix sales and distribution cost increased by 4 in danish kroner and by 7 in local currencies reflecting higher promotional activities globally for victoza saxenda well as launch activities for ozempic r d costs increased by 6 in danish kroner and 8 in local currencies reflecting higher costs in both research and development the increased costs are impacted by the expense priority review voucher for the oral semaglutide filing and severance costs administration cost increased by 3 in danish kroner and 7 in local currencies impacted by severance costs operating profit decreased by 4 in danish kroner and increased by 3 in local currencies operating profit was impacted by severance costs and the expense priority review voucher adjusting for this operating profit increased by 6 in local currencies net financial items showed a gain of around 0 4 billion danish kroner compared with the loss of 0 3 billion in 2017 primarily driven by foreign exchange hedging gains mainly due to the u s dollar on average having traded lower in 2018 compared to 2017 partly countered by losses from non hedged currencies diluted earnings per share increased by 4 to 15 kroner and 93 euro please turn to slide 17 for 2019 sales growth is expected to be in the range of 2 to 5 measured in local currencies this reflects expectations for continued growth of the glp 1 segment and roll out of ozempic as well as global penetration of saxenda this guidance also reflects the intensifying global competition within diabetes and biopharmaceuticals as well as continued pricing pressure especially in the u s where the funding of the medicare part d coverage gap has an expected impact of approximately 2 billion danish kroner reported sales growth is expected to be around 2 percentage points higher than in local currencies operating profit growth measured in local currencies is expected to be in the range of 2 to 6 the outlook reflects the sales growth outlook and the negative impact from the coverage gap in the u s as well as a positive impact from the priority review voucher that was expensed in the fourth quarter of 2018 reported operating profit is expected to be around 4 percentage points higher than in local currencies financial items is expected to be a loss of approximately 2 4 billion danish kroner reflecting losses associated with foreign exchange hedging contracts mainly related to the u s dollar the effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 20 to 22 and capital expenditure is expected to be around 9 billion danish kroner in 2019 for 2019 we expect the free cash flow to be around 29 billion to 34 billion danish kroner furthermore based on the updated accounting principles for leases are for 16 and the expected investment level the long term financial targets for operating profit after tax to net operating assets has been adjusted from 125 to 80 the target for cash to earnings has been adjusted from 90 to 85 reflecting the investment level the target for operating profit growth remains unchanged please turn to the next slide during the coming 12 months we will execute a new 12 months share repurchase program for 2019 of up to 15 billion danish kroner the proposed total dividend for 2018 increases 4 to 8 15 kroner which includes the interim dividend of three kroner paid in august 2018 the total payout ratio of 50 6 is in line with our peer group pay out ratio this concludes the update on financials now back to you lars lars fruergaard jorgensen chief executive officer thank you karsten please turn to slide 19 2018 was a year of change and significant progress for novo nordisk we delivered on our targets for sales and operating profits and have successfully launched ozempic in several countries the results from the broad pioneer phase 3a program for oral semaglutide are very encouraging for people with type 2 diabetes and we re now prepared for the regulatory submission operator we re now ready to take the first question questions and answers operator thank you and your first request is from the line of peter verdult from citi please go ahead peter verdult citi analyst yes good afternoon peter verdult with citi two questions first for mads on the pipeline second for lars on u s pricing and reimbursement mads just on weekly insulin and the laisema combo just how are you thinking in terms of clinical differentiation over the daily preparations and also just given the fact that currently the endos love the data around insulin glp 1 combos but the broader adoption has been hampered by primary care reluctance to use combination biologics in the treatment of diabetes and the restrictive label so i m just wanting to get your thoughts there and then for lars just given ongoing hhs efforts to remove the safe harbor provisions around rebates has the privilege of novo considering second brand in your business increased could you also provide maybe a little perspective on the government s renewed focus on insulin pricing and fda efforts to accelerate generic insulin just interested in your updated thoughts there thank you mads krogsgaard thomsen chief science officer ok peter first of all a small correction when it comes to the restricted label having to have failed glp 1 or insulin therapy as you know that is a u s thing we don t have it in most other territories and in the countries including several european countries like france and others very strong growth is seen for xultophy in those markets where we actually decide to have it as one of the preferred products so we actually do expect quite a lot from xultophy going forward and i do think sales doubled this year compared to last year when that is said laisema is in reality a once weekly version where you get the best of semaglutide with all the benefits inherited from the ozempic label hopefully and then of course lai287 without seeing any direct you can say disadvantages in terms of variability and peak to trough values and so on but when that is said the phase 2 trials with laisema are up against what is today still the most used insulin molecule named glargine u100 so the purpose of the phase 2 program for laisema is to have a competitive once weekly convenient offering with a profile benefit risk wise equal to that at least insulin glargine u100 and laisema is then seen as an intensification product where the patients in the future were to be on oral sema injectable glp 1 or even for that matter injectable insulin lars fruergaard jorgensen chief executive officer thank you mads yes peter on u s pricing clearly a lot of moving parts and a lot of political interest what came out last night in the u s in terms of moving away from a rebate from the being allowed us even to the pbms we actually applaud the administration for bringing this forward it s been discussed for a long period of time the current system where rebates are not shared with the patients is a chanting environment for us to operate in and you can see what has happened recently is that political pressure has increased in actually understanding how does the market work so we welcome this proposal as you know we gave last year 68 in rebates 113 billion in danish kroner this is put into the supply chain in terms of rebates and we think from a decisive point of view from patient point of view the allocation of those rebates can be done in a better way providing more value for the patients without being say a negative for novo nordisk we have looked at when you say new branch or second branch if you think about launching in the we looked at that we do not believe it s the best way forward so the chance outlook for rebates i think is the more viable way to go forward we are collaborating on the requests we have received for more transparency around how we conduct business how that will play out it ll probably take a long time at least some of the requests are quite comprehensive when we talk about changes in how rebates are handled in the u s it s not something we see will have an impact on how business is conducted in 2019 maybe not even in 20 because there are a number of contracts being made between us and our customers and again from pbms to insurance companies etc so it s a relative comprehensive set of legal commitments and change flow of money that has to be unwinded in terms of generic insulins and scott gottlieb s comments i think as we look at the market now it s a market that s already highly competitive on price so we actually feel that we re already operating in an environment where there s tough price competition so i m not sure that that in itself is going to significantly change that outlook thank you peter next question operator your next question is from the line of sachin jain bank of america please go ahead sachin jain bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi sachin jain bank of america couple of questions on oral ema if i may i wanted you to comment on oral sema timelines roughly where you think you will flee to the market with promotion just remembering back to ozempic you re roughly three months i think to launch with five to six months before promotion how should we think about oral sema in comparison to that and then second question on oral sema pricing i m not asking for prices i know that s off the table but just some variables as you think about it consensus seems to gravitate to roughly 10 to 12 per day based on recent commentary that you would price for quick access i want you to comment on two variables related to that a the timeframe you think about when when you think about the pricing decision historically you ve been happy to price and build for long term for example when you launch victoza and then second the impact of the existing glp business if you were to price that level and then any other key variables that you think play into that pricing decision thank you operator sachin thank you for that quite detailed question on all time line i think what what we can share with you is obviously that now we re using the priority voucher we have guided that we expect to submit by the turn of the coming quarter and that we re looking at a six month review period that indicates also when we would be able to have a proper pool as you know when you launch you have no access is blocked day one so we need to do a contracting with our customers and that is something that takes time in the u s market we re not going to guide in terms of when we expect that to be completed or when we expect to be in the market we think that s something we like to keep the close to us in terms of pricing it s a bit the same we have consistently for the last few quarters said that we do not want to openly discuss the pricing we think this is information of a competitive nature and it s not really serving our investors well to be open on that and it s the classical elements that we have mentioned before if there is a clinical differentiation of the product the competitive situation and the cost of goods sold for that so those are the elements that we would be factoring in and we of course are forming our own view on what that is but we d like to keep that close to us for the time being and hopefully you are understanding of that thank you sachin and sachin jain bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok thank you operator your next question is from the line of florent cespedes societe generale please go ahead florent cespedes societe generale analyst good afternoon gentlemen florent cespedes from societe generale three quick questions first financial related questions could you share with us the level of non recurring costs the absolute numbers which impacted q4 and the full year and the fuller question on this side is how do you see operating profit margin for this year because as you start from a lower base it s fair to assume margin expansion for 2019 or with the earlier launch of oral sema is it fair to assume higher launch costs second question a quick one regarding ozempic cardiovascular safety discussions you have with the fda when should we have the final decision from the fda regarding that and the labeling of ozempic with the update of this cardiovascular safety trial and the last but not least regarding growth hormone the q4 was quite dynamic so could you share with us how do you see the trend going forward is there a new environment is there any reasons to believe that we should see a little bit strong growth going forward for this franchise thank you lars fruergaard jorgensen chief executive officer thank you florent i think you know that ended up to maybe three or four questions so we ll try to answer them a bit consolidated so karsten first on non recurring cost in q4 and full year and margins then mads on ozempic cv karsten munk knudsen chief financial officer yes so non recurring in terms of restructuring costs then for the full year 18 cost was around 900 million kroner and for the fourth quarter then since we communicated 600 at the third quarter the new roughly 300 million in the third in the fourth quarter sorry the priority review voucher is around 800 million danish kroner of cost hitting the fourth quarter as to margin in 19 when you look at our guidance range then top line 2 to 5 and operating profit 2 to 6 both in local currencies not necessarily a huge margin play there and too remember that given the operating margin and where we are then it is not part of our strategy to use margin leverage to drive profitability we have a top line focus to drive profitability and then perhaps a final note on 19 margins is that the coverage gap impact in the u s of 2 billion dkk is of course a hit that goes all the way straight through the p l when you do your modeling lars fruergaard jorgensen chief executive officer thank you karsten and mads what of ozempic cv mads krogsgaard thomsen chief science officer yes as you can recall from the investor event we held at the ada meeting last june we did talk with the agency that cardiovascular outcome trials that could be needed to support the sustain 6 program were fully worthy of fda consideration assuming that they were on the same molecule of course regardless of route of administration and it is on this premise that we believe that the pioneer 6 really strengthens the case for semaglutide cardio protective properties such that we would seek to get a cardiovascular ndas that have a 10 month regulatory process lars fruergaard jorgensen chief executive officer thank you mads and thank you florent for those questions we take next question operator thank you our next question is from the line of martin parkhoi of danske bank please go ahead martin parkhoi danske bank analyst yes martin parkhoi danske bank first a question which i think is related to karsten at your capital markets day in 2017 you gave some indicative levels for the capex for 19 20 where you shared that should be at the level of 16 and now you guided 2 billion higher by 2019 is that an external event in 19 or will we also see such a level in 2020 and is this related to the clayton facility running above budget or what relates to this changed capex level compared to just less than one and a half years ago and then secondly to mads if you look at the timeline you still expect to start initiate the oral sema i recall in q2 and you have the decision by fda on oral sema in q3 why do we not wait start the oral sema program until you know have more clarity on the potential of getting a cv label on ozempic and maybe even on oral sema lars fruergaard jorgensen chief executive officer so thank you martin and karsten first on capex karsten munk knudsen chief financial officer yes so in 2018 we spent 9 5 billion on capex which was spot on our guidance and our guidance for 19 is 9 billion it is correct as you state that if you go back and directionally compare to the cmd slides then it s had a higher level but things are changing over time and we are spending more on capex in 19 than what we anticipated the main driver is of course our api investment in north carolina that is our biggest capex project these days where we are roughly 50 done but apart from that we have a number of upgrades and capacity expansion projects in manufacturing for instance in device assembly so you should see this as facing off of investments and you should expect our level of capex to go down after s 19 so 20 and onwards lars fruergaard jorgensen chief executive officer thank you karsten mads on timing mads krogsgaard thomsen chief science officer yes well first of all of course we ve taken a deep look at this whole trial based on all the existing evidence also from the pioneer 6 and that means in terms of the powering of the study the need for the amount of patient and hence also the cost of the study that of course has been the subject of discussion based on the reassuring data from pioneer 6 that s one thing another thing i d like to mention is that it is the study we planned and it s also a study that supports our ambition to have a renal label update with the kidney claims for first ozempic and delayed oral semaglutide in that the agency has accepted that we also bridge primary endpoints from for instance the flow study which is the diabetic neuropathy study that we are contemplating on doing with ozempic and bring that over to confirmatory secondary endpoints that were to be included in the sole trial for the oral semaglutide such that we can criss cross from oral sema to ozempic when it comes to cv data and we can criss cross back again from ozempic to oral when it comes to renal data that s the thinking behind some of these conclusions martin parkhoi danske bank analyst can i just follow up and ask just remind me when you expect to file oral sema late this quarter will you file for a cd indication actually or cd label based on pioneer 6 and maybe with support for sustain 6 mads krogsgaard thomsen chief science officer it is our intention to leverage the very strong and robust data that together emerged from the combination of sustain 6 and pioneer 6 in the best of all ways and that in principle goes for both products ozempic and oral martin parkhoi danske bank analyst thank you lars fruergaard jorgensen chief executive officer thank you mads thank you martin next question please operator your next question is from the line of kerry holford of bnp paribas please go ahead kerry holford exane bnp paribas analyst yes kerry holford from exane a couple of questions please first the oral question that you talked about that increasing again this year in the u s i wonder if you can just talk a little bit more about the key drivers of that in regards to insulin is that the key driver still or are we seeing more of that increase now impacting glp 1 and i wonder if you could compare the position of each of those franchises from that perspective and then secondly with regard to restructuring can we assume that program is now complete as of the end of 18 any further actions or charges likely to come through this year essentially i guess the question is are you now comfortable with your cost base in the current environment lars fruergaard jorgensen chief executive officer karsten will you comment a bit on that karsten munk knudsen chief financial officer yes yes so first of all as you see in our annual report which we published on our website this morning the u s rebate percentage is going up from 64 to 68 between 17 and 18 the main drivers in that respect is delivery of rebating and as we ve been counting on before it s basically in the basal insulin space where we ve been paying a higher rebate to remain on formularies so that s the main driver in terms of the growth from that we don t have anything new to add on the competitive situation in any of the segments we have very solid formulary coverage for our products going into 19 and now for ozempic we are around 80 unrestricted access in the u s markets so we feel comfortable on that as for restructuring cost we took the 900 million in charges in 2018 and we have not anything in our guidance for 2019 but of course we are reallocating our resources and our cost base on an ongoing matter but we do not foresee any major restructuring charges in 2019 lars fruergaard jorgensen chief executive officer thank you karsten thank you kerry next question please operator your next question is from the line of michael novod of nordea markets please go ahead michael novod nordea markets analyst yes hello it s michael from nordea two questions one to obesity which continues to surprise on the upside we also see that there s some sort of say a reacceleration or further acceleration in the u s maybe you could talk about some of the key drivers behind this and also perhaps put it into context to what you expect in terms of say better access better uptake with the sema where we re going to see the phase 3 data i don t know 12 15 months from now and then secondly to the launch cost for oral sema i know that you won t comment on the exact timing in the market just want to get some clarity around how your thinking is about cost levels for the launch if that is fully incorporated into the guidance at the current time for 2019 thanks lars fruergaard jorgensen chief executive officer thank you michael and camilla some comments on obesity camilla sylvest executive vice president and head of commercial space and corporate affairs yes so generally we are tracking in line with the expectations on obesity we are of course growing very significantly we also now are close to 50 value market share on a global level on volume market share level we are still in the range of 4 to 5 so it means there s still significantly untapped potential and we are continuing our efforts in terms of supporting the market in terms of education of obesity as a disease and also in terms of our activities to try to ensure reimbursement in different countries for obesity and that is a process that will take time but we are continuing along this road and that s basically the things that are going to drive this so we do see in international operations this year we should expect the number of new launches that can continue some of these growth rates and we also see generally across the board global level and good growth rate when it comes to the actual market growth this is still not very strong and actually has been going down slightly recently but that doesn t go for novo nordisk so we keep gaining share and we re very confident about the growth in this area lars fruergaard jorgensen chief executive officer thank you camilla and comments from mads mads krogsgaard thomsen chief science officer yes you also mentioned semaglutide michael and i think the three drivers of sema that will help camilla and the team create stronger penetration and a larger market that deserves to be there is the durability of drug treatment as you know they keep on losing weight the semaglutide patients also in diabetes throughout a full year and it s also the magnitude of the weight loss that helps and then finally if you actually improve patient outcomes and that s why we re doing the select study so all the things camilla s team are doing now is also paving the road for something that is hopefully going to be the future anchor drug in obesity lars fruergaard jorgensen chief executive officer thank you camilla and mads and on launch costs michael i think if you look at the past few years here we have been in constant prelaunch launch mode across the world so we cannot it s not really meaningful to go in and talk on cost on a specific launch but we do expect to have an ratio in the vicinity of 25 to 26 in 2019 so that does work we can guide on that for now thank you michael and next question please operator next question is from the line of richard vosser of j p morgan please go ahead richard vosser j p morgan analyst hi thanks for taking my question couple of product ones so just looking at tresiba in the fourth quarter in the u s looked as though there may be some destocking or maybe some rebates in there just could you talk about the trends you re seeing in tresiba in the u s second question just victoza china obviously on the end overall very strong growth in q3 less growth in q4 just how should we think about the future picture for victoza in china in the u s and then just one final a couple of questions around oral sema just thinking about the access that you ve got so far on ozempic you mentioned 80 access and i think when you first launched you had 50 access are these the sort of levels of access that you re looking to achieve for oral sema and then sort of linked to that you mentioned on the clayton facility that you re 50 through the spend i presume you re starting up the facility production soonish though but sort of when would you start to start that up and when would we see an impact from incremental depreciation from the start up thanks very much lars fruergaard jorgensen chief executive officer ok that was quite a number of questions richard so we ll try to keep track of this so on tresiba no particular fluctuation there when you look at it quite constant uptake overall and as i mentioned 15 market share growth over the past three years 5 a year so we actually see that as being quite stable from a u s point of view mike any comments from you on victoza in china mike doustdar executive vice president and head of international operations no i can say victoza china was it almost doubled and it appeared against our own expectations from quarter to quarter your see these deviations sometimes and it has to do with the lifting of the hospital and the speed of those compared to what the plan is but i m happy to say that now we have full coverage actually with the reimbursement in china after the national drug list took place at the beginning of the year then we have gone to various different regions and the hospitals and we have the coverage that we had anticipated so i don t foresee the q4 to be any indications of what happens later on lars fruergaard jorgensen chief executive officer and very shortly on ozempic that s right we are at 80 that s actually a relative high access rate compared to our product so we re not necessarily looking at going to that on oral sema to be successful and very quickly on the clayton facility we are ramping up construction then comes the validation qualification of it which takes quite some time so gradually we ll be phasing in the factory from 2020 and in the coming period there so thank you richard and let s remind each other to stick to two questions going forward next question please operator your next question is from the line of michael leuchten from ubs please go ahead michael leuchten ubs analyst thank you very much two questions please one for mike and one for karsten i think so on the international operations in the fourth quarter it looks like we had quite a few sort of distortions in terms of timings of shipments and it seems a little bit more pronounced than maybe we ve seen in the past just wondering if there s any sort of trend to this why we all of a sudden see that in q4 and if that s the case are we going to see all that coming back in q1 or is that a more balanced in 2019 any color would be helpful and then a question on the gross margin if we sort of adjust for rebate adjustments in 2018 pricing pressure you mentioned the gross to net in the insulin space your gross margin did phenomenally well obviously particularly on mix but is there anything else that made 2018 a year that made the gross margins particularly strong that wouldn t repeat as we look into 2019 and maybe 2020 or is the mix effect likely going to be as strong going forward lars fruergaard jorgensen chief executive officer thank you michael mike first on q4 timing anything that s mentioned mike doustdar executive vice president and head of international operations so all the timing that has been announced has been actually in the emerging market in aameo and latam which it is quite usual actually to have timings of the shipments primarily actually it has been a few countries just a handful of countries in aameo interesting enough i think if you take a look at the q4 results of the other regions so the more regular regions europe and china japan they all did better in q4 than the previous year s in terms of growth rates so that should give you a good indication that we don t foresee a major full year effect of that as we go forward lars fruergaard jorgensen chief executive officer thank you mike and karsten for the gross margin anything special about 2018 karsten munk knudsen chief financial officer so i would say what was special for 2018 was that in manufacturing we really hit it on all cylinders and that s not something that we can plan with for every year it s like winning all cylinders in international operations it happens in few years but most often you win some you lose some so i think overall manufacturing had a fantastic year in 18 i think i m more balanced at this point in terms of our productivity gains in terms of 19 still favorable productivity and some positive mix from the glp 1 franchise do bear in mind again that the doughnut hole impact hits straight through so of course a negative impact on that account and then come 2020 and onwards and we re not guiding on that specifically albeit from a low base but oral sema in italy will be at a lower gross margin which is naturally in a ramp up phase of a product lars fruergaard jorgensen chief executive officer thank you karsten and thank you michael so we have time to we have one last question operator and your final question is from the line of carsten madsen of seb please go ahead carsten madsen seb analyst thank you very much carsten from seb so then we ll follow up on karsten s last comment here on the gross margin for oral sema because i can see on clinical trials for that the new trial with lower doses have been completed essentially it seems like that trial would have the potential for you to cut your cost for oral sema into half with the new formulation i was wondering if you could share some details on what was the outcome of the trial and what would be your next step thank you lars fruergaard jorgensen chief executive officer that actually sounded like a question to me i suppose karsten carsten madsen seb analyst oh yes karsten munk knudsen chief financial officer yes and i always at least pretend as if i know some details about r d but on this particular occasion i will disappoint you because unfortunately the trial has completed the in live phase but as i think you are aware carsten after the in live phase even for a small trial work to be done before you actually can lock the database do the analysis and so on so this is something that we for sure at the q1 road show will be able to update you on the two different kinds of clinical activities that are ongoing in the oral glp 1 space in phase 1 carsten madsen seb analyst oh ok ok could you maybe then just say do you expect this trial to be the final trial for a new formulation and what is the regulatory strategy going forward is this something you can quickly update and get into the market if it s a successful trial mads krogsgaard thomsen chief science officer ok so carsten it all depends but if you have a known ingredient such as semaglutide in the snack formulation and what you ve done is changed the composition and or the way you create the tablet then as long as you can match the clinical profile with your new tablet in a way that is bioequivalent to that of the existing generation product i e the one we re going to launch as soon as possible then you can in principle do one confirmatory trial where you after a period of for instance six months show that it is indeed clinically equivalent and as safe as the existing generation of product and that would then be clearly at a reduced cost of goods sold but let s talk more about it when we have some data lars fruergaard jorgensen chief executive officer thank you mads thank you carsten this concludes our conference call thank you all for participating we look forward to meet many of you over the coming days in the meantime if you have any question please reach out to our investor relations officers thank you very much have a good day operator duration 60 minutes call participants lars fruergaard jorgensen chief

currency international operations grew by 7 while north america operations sales increased by 3 both measured in local currencies sales growth was mainly driven by the glp 1 franchise with victoza and ozempic combined growth of 18 and accounting for a 78 share of growth in local currencies within research and development several achievements can be highlighted in november we completed the pioneer program for oral semaglutide following the successful completion of the remaining two phase 3a trials pioneer 6 and 9 within biopharmaceuticals we have completed two phase 2 trials explore four with concizumab and the extended real3 trial with somapacitan furthermore we have initiated a phase 2 trial or a once weekly insulin lai287 and a phase 1 trial with laisema a once weekly combination of lai287 and semaglutide turning to financials operating profit declined by 3 sorry 4 in danish kroner and increased by 3 in local currencies in 2018 operating profit was negatively impacted by severance costs related to the layoffs in the second half of 2018 and the expensed priority review vouch before the filing of oral semaglutide adjusted for this operating profit increased by 6 in local currencies the diluted earnings per share increased by 4 to 15 kroner and 93 euro at the annual general meeting the board of directors will propose a final dividend for 2018 of 5 kroner and 15 euro per share in addition to the three kroner per share paid in interim dividend in august 2018 totalling an expected dividend for 2018 of 8 kroner and 15 euro moreover the board of directors intends to initiate a new share repurchase program of up to 15 billion danish kroner which will be executed during the coming 12 months for 2019 outlook sales growth is expected to be 2 to 5 measured in local currencies with an expected positive currency impact of two percentage points the expected sales growth includes a negative impact of approximately 2 billion danish kroner from the change in the funding of the medicare part d coverage gap in the u s operating profit growth is expected to be 2 to 6 measured in local currencies with an expected positive currency impact of 4 percentage points finally the board of directors has adjusted the long term financial target for operating profit after tax to net operating assets from 125 to 80 to reflect the changed accounting principles for handling of leases as well as the expected tangible and intangible investment level in addition the cash to earnings target of 90 is adjusted to 85 also to reflect the investment level the long term financial targets for operating profit growth remains unchanged please turn to slide 5 in 2018 the overall growth was broadly unchanged in danish kroner and increased by 5 in local currencies the sales growth was mainly driven by the diabetes care and obesity segment where the diabetes franchise grew by 4 and accounted for 73 share growth the glp 1 segment was the primarily growth driver where victoza sales increased by 9 and ozempic realized 1 8 billion danish kroner in sales the total insulin sales were broadly unchanged reflecting 5 insulin sales growth in international operations driven by solid tresiba and xultophy volume growth this is offset by the u s insulin sales decline of 9 mainly driven by lower realized prices in the u s basal insulin segments within obesity saxenda grew by 60 measured in local currencies and accounted for 30 share growth biopharmaceutical sales in local currencies were broadly unchanged driven by continued solid execution of the strategic priorities please turn to slide 6 in 2018 sales grew by 5 measured in local currencies international operation s sales increased by 7 where all regions apart from region japan and korea contributed to growth sales in north america operations increased by 3 in local currencies driven by glp 1 sales increasing 19 and saxenda sales increasing 39 for global insulin franchise sales were broadly unchanged in local currencies driven by north america operations declining by 7 partly countered by 5 sales growth in international operations with solid performance within the basal and fast acting insulin segment the decline in north america was primarily driven by lower realized prices in the basal insulin segment partly countered by solid uptake of tresiba and xultophy the glp 1 sales growth of 18 was primarily driven by north america operations and the continued solid market volume growth of the glp 1 class glp 1 sales in international operations increased by 14 mainly driven by region europe with the expanded cv label for victoza and initial contribution from the launch of ozempic as well as inclusion of victoza on the national drug reimbursement list in region china saxenda continues to be a solid growth driver increasing sales by 60 in local currencies in 2018 saxenda sales in the u s increased by 40 driven by a volume market share increase of 7 percentage points to 27 of the branded anti obesity market saxenda has now been launched in 41 countries supporting saxenda sales growth in international operations where sales reached 1 2 billion danish kroner please turn to slide 7 ozempic has now been launched in 11 markets in the u s and canada and nine european countries in the u s novo nordisk is retaining the market leadership with a combined new to brand market share of around 48 the number of new to brand prescriptions for ozempic surpassed victoza in december and the ozempic market share is now 26 the formula records for ozempic is now around 80 combined in canada ozempic continues to increase new to brand prescription market share the latest new to brand prescription market share for victoza and ozempic combined was above 81 with ozempic now having achieved more than 50 ozempic has now been launched in nine markets in europe and by the end of november ozempic had gained around 10 total volume market share in the launch european countries combined the roll out of ozempic continues in 2019 please turn to next slide in the u s glp 1 sales increased by 19 in local currencies in 2018 supported by both victoza with an updated cv label and the ozempic launch the u s glp 1 market continues to expand growing 27 in q4 2018 we are pleased with the ozempic launch which by the end of december 2018 achieved a total glp 1 volume market share of around 8 in the u s novo nordisk has thereby stabilized its total glp 1 volume market share at around 43 please turn to next slide tresiba has gained around 15 market share since the launch in 2016 thereby gaining around five percentage points market share each year in a very competitive basal insulin segment the market uptake has been supported by the updated u s tresiba label including a 40 reduction in severe hypoglycemia compared to insulin glargine u100 by the end of december novo nordisk s combined volume market share for levemir tresiba and xultophy was 36 in the u s basal insulin market please turn to next slide in 2018 obesity sales increased 60 and accounted for 30 share growth the total sales growth was driven by strong volume uptake in both north america operations and international operations novo nordisk is the global value market leader with 45 market share of the anti obesity market in north america saxenda sales increased by 39 in 2018 and novo nordisk increased its value market share to 66 in international operations saxenda sales more than doubled driven by the continued roll out of saxenda in region europe region aameo and region latin america reflecting a solid volume uptake of saxenda which is now launched in 39 countries outside of north america efforts are still needed to expand the obesity segment this is why we invest in progressing our innovative obesity pipeline as well as patient support and educator programs please turn to slide 11 in 2018 biopharmaceutical sales were broadly unchanged measured in local currencies mainly driven by the novoseven sales increasing 11 partly countered by norditropin and novoeight growing 7 and 26 respectively in 2017 novo nordisk implemented a new biopharm strategy with the purpose of returning biopharm growth we have since then launched refixia in 12 countries and we expect the approval of n8 gp in the u s and in europe in the first half of 2019 we have furthermore secured label updates for novoseven for surgical use and increased global focus on acquired haemophila treatment we have progressed our pipeline for both concizumab and xomapacitan furthermore in 2018 two complimentary assets have been added to the biopharm business the in licensing of epidestiny s assets within sickle cell disease called as well as the acquisition of the north american rights for the first fda approved oral diagnosis product for adult growth hormone deficiency macrilen the biopharm business is a key priority to us and we are on track with executing on our biopharm business strategy with this over to mads for an update on r d mads krogsgaard thomsen chief science officer thank you lars please turn to slide 12 with the completion in november of the two final pioneer trials pioneer 6 and 9 the phase 3a program for oral semaglutide has now concluded successfully across all pioneer trials oral semaglutide has demonstrated statistically significant reductions of hemoglobin a1c ranging from 1 to 1 8 at trial completion for the 14 milligram dose these glycemic improvements led to between 52 and 80 of all patients achieving the ada target of an hba1c below 7 in terms of body weight oral semaglutide has demonstrated statistically significant reductions of two kilogram to five kilogram at the 14 milligram dose consequently between 25 and pecernt of patients experienced a weight loss greater than 5 throughout the pioneer trials oral semaglutide has proven to be statistically significantly better regarding both hba1c and weight reduction at trial completion when compared to the leading sglt2 and dpp 4 inhibitors as well as the leading injectable glp 1 analogues liraglutide and dulaglutide in the japanese population oral semaglutide has demonstrated a safe and well tolerated profile consistent with that of the existing glp 1 analogues in the market please turn to slide 13 pioneer 6 investigated the cardiovascular safety of oral semaglutide 14 milligrams compared to placebo both added to standard of care in a trial that enrolled approximately 3 200 adults with type 2 diabetes at high risk of cardiovascular disease pioneer 6 accrued around 140 major adverse cardiovascular events so called mace within a median treatment period of 16 months the primary endpoint was mace defined as the first occurrence of cardiovascular death non fatal myocardial infarction on non fatal stroke the hazard ratio was 0 79 in favor of oral semaglutide compared to placebo implying a 21 albeit non significant reduction in mace the 21 reduction in mace was derived from a statistically significant 51 reduction in cardiovascular death one non fatal myocardial infarction and non fatal stroke did not differ significantly between the groups in addition pioneer 6 showed a statistically significant reduction of 49 in all cause mortality for the oral semaglutide arm furthermore when looking across the two cardiovascular outcome trials performed for semaglutide the observed mace reduction of approximately 25 was found to be driven by all three mace components cardiovascular deaths myocardial infarction and stroke the safety and efficacy profile of oral semaglutide in pioneer 6 was consistent with the profile established in previous pioneer trials pioneer 6 was the last of the 10 phase 3a pioneer trials and oral semaglutide is now almost ready for nda submission novo nordisk has notified the fda that we will ask for a priority review for oral semaglutide based on the priority review voucher acquired in 2018 the use of the priority review voucher shortens the expected fda review period to six months we now expect to file the nda for oral semaglutide with the fda by the end of this quarter and in the eu and japan in the second and third quarters of this year respectively please turn to the next slide in november we initiated the phase 2 program for lai287 the once weekly acylated insulin the first trial is the multinational double blinded active controlled trial with around 350 insulin naive people with type 2 diabetes the main objective is to assess the safety and efficacy profile of lai287 versus once daily glargine u100 in early january of this year we initiated a phase 1 trial for laisema which is the name of the once weekly fixed ratio combination of lai287 and semaglutide the main objective of this trial is to investigate the single dose pharmacokinetics of laisema in a fixed ratio compared to lai287 and semaglutide given separately to people with type 2 diabetes in november we announced the research collaboration with embark biotech focusing on the discovery of novel treatments for obesity the aim of the collaboration is to develop novel drug candidate that help people with obesity to lose weight by increasing the energy expenditure embark biotech will receive research support while novo nordisk has an option to license exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize any discovered drug candidates in december we announced a collaboration and exclusive option agreement with staten biotechnology to develop novel therapeutics for the treatment of cardiovascular disease associated with hypertriglyceridemia novo nordisk will provide research and development funding and support for staten to develop its lead asset stt 505 novo nordisk will according to the agreement have the right to acquire staten biotechnology at a predefined milestone in november we successfully completed the main phase of the phase 2 trial explorer 4 with concizumab the trial evaluated efficacy and safety of the prophylactic administration of subcutaneous concizumab in hemophilia a and b patients both with inhibitors in explorer 4 proof of concept for concizumab was achieved by showing reduced annual bleeding rate on daily subcutaneous concizumab prophylaxis compared with on demand novoseven treatment the results from both explorer 4 and 5 also confirmed the correlation between increased levels of concizumab decreased levels of circulating tfpi and increased clotting potential as evidenced by of thrombin generation potential in most of the patients in both trials concizumab was safe and well tolerated and there were no issues with breakthrough bleed based on these phase 2 results concizumab is now approaching phase 3 readiness and we plan to initiate the phase 3 program in haemophila during the second half of 2019 pending further regulatory dialog furthermore we completed the pediatric phase 2 extension of the real3 trial with a long acting growth hormone somapacitan the endpoint for the real3 extension was to evaluate the effect of different dose regimens for once weekly somapacitan after one full year of treatment compared to daily norditropin the trial confirmed a dose dependent increase in growth velocity and the observed safety profile of somapacitan was similar to that of norditropin novo nordisk is now preparing for the phase 3 program in growth hormone deficient children as well as for a phase 2 trial in children born small for gestational age in addition we are preparing for a regulatory submission of somapacitan for the adult growth hormone deficiency indication in the second half of this year lastly in november we discontinued subcutaneous n8 gp due to detection of anti drug antibodies that were considered to be related to the subcutaneous route of administration in this particular trial please turn to the next slide as mentioned earlier we expect to submit the nda for oral semaglutide to the fda around the end of the first quarter and subsequently to receive expected feedback from the agency toward the end of the third quarter with the utilization of a priority review voucher during q2 and 3 respectively oral semaglutide is furthermore expected to be submitted to the eu and japanese regulators within diabetes we expect to conclude the phase 3b head to head trial comparing tresiba to insulin glargine 300 also known as toujeo in the second quarter of this year within hemophilia we expect the fda and the eu to provide feedback on our n8 gp submission in the first two quarters of this year lastly we expect to initiate the phase 3 program with concizumab in the second half of 2019 with this over to karsten for an update on the financials karsten munk knudsen chief financial officer thank you mads please turn to slide 16 in 2018 sales were broadly unchanged in danish kroner and increased by 5 in local currencies the gross margin was 84 2 measured in danish kroner which is in line with 2017 the unchanged gross margin reflects a negative currency impact of 0 2 percentage point and lower realized prices in the u s offset by improved productivity and a positive contribution from product mix sales and distribution cost increased by 4 in danish kroner and by 7 in local currencies reflecting higher promotional activities globally for victoza saxenda well as launch activities for ozempic r d costs increased by 6 in danish kroner and 8 in local currencies reflecting higher costs in both research and development the increased costs are impacted by the expense priority review voucher for the oral semaglutide filing and severance costs administration cost increased by 3 in danish kroner and 7 in local currencies impacted by severance costs operating profit decreased by 4 in danish kroner and increased by 3 in local currencies operating profit was impacted by severance costs and the expense priority review voucher adjusting for this operating profit increased by 6 in local currencies net financial items showed a gain of around 0 4 billion danish kroner compared with the loss of 0 3 billion in 2017 primarily driven by foreign exchange hedging gains mainly due to the u s dollar on average having traded lower in 2018 compared to 2017 partly countered by losses from non hedged currencies diluted earnings per share increased by 4 to 15 kroner and 93 euro please turn to slide 17 for 2019 sales growth is expected to be in the range of 2 to 5 measured in local currencies this reflects expectations for continued growth of the glp 1 segment and roll out of ozempic as well as global penetration of saxenda this guidance also reflects the intensifying global competition within diabetes and biopharmaceuticals as well as continued pricing pressure especially in the u s where the funding of the medicare part d coverage gap has an expected impact of approximately 2 billion danish kroner reported sales growth is expected to be around 2 percentage points higher than in local currencies operating profit growth measured in local currencies is expected to be in the range of 2 to 6 the outlook reflects the sales growth outlook and the negative impact from the coverage gap in the u s as well as a positive impact from the priority review voucher that was expensed in the fourth quarter of 2018 reported operating profit is expected to be around 4 percentage points higher than in local currencies financial items is expected to be a loss of approximately 2 4 billion danish kroner reflecting losses associated with foreign exchange hedging contracts mainly related to the u s dollar the effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 20 to 22 and capital expenditure is expected to be around 9 billion danish kroner in 2019 for 2019 we expect the free cash flow to be around 29 billion to 34 billion danish kroner furthermore based on the updated accounting principles for leases are for 16 and the expected investment level the long term financial targets for operating profit after tax to net operating assets has been adjusted from 125 to 80 the target for cash to earnings has been adjusted from 90 to 85 reflecting the investment level the target for operating profit growth remains unchanged please turn to the next slide during the coming 12 months we will execute a new 12 months share repurchase program for 2019 of up to 15 billion danish kroner the proposed total dividend for 2018 increases 4 to 8 15 kroner which includes the interim dividend of three kroner paid in august 2018 the total payout ratio of 50 6 is in line with our peer group pay out ratio this concludes the update on financials now back to you lars lars fruergaard jorgensen chief executive officer thank you karsten please turn to slide 19 2018 was a year of change and significant progress for novo nordisk we delivered on our targets for sales and operating profits and have successfully launched ozempic in several countries the results from the broad pioneer phase 3a program for oral semaglutide are very encouraging for people with type 2 diabetes and we re now prepared for the regulatory submission operator we re now ready to take the first question questions and answers operator thank you and your first request is from the line of peter verdult from citi please go ahead peter verdult citi analyst yes good afternoon peter verdult with citi two questions first for mads on the pipeline second for lars on u s pricing and reimbursement mads just on weekly insulin and the laisema combo just how are you thinking in terms of clinical differentiation over the daily preparations and also just given the fact that currently the endos love the data around insulin glp 1 combos but the broader adoption has been hampered by primary care reluctance to use combination biologics in the treatment of diabetes and the restrictive label so i m just wanting to get your thoughts there and then for lars just given ongoing hhs efforts to remove the safe harbor provisions around rebates has the privilege of novo considering second brand in your business increased could you also provide maybe a little perspective on the government s renewed focus on insulin pricing and fda efforts to accelerate generic insulin just interested in your updated thoughts there thank you mads krogsgaard thomsen chief science officer ok peter first of all a small correction when it comes to the restricted label having to have failed glp 1 or insulin therapy as you know that is a u s thing we don t have it in most other territories and in the countries including several european countries like france and others very strong growth is seen for xultophy in those markets where we actually decide to have it as one of the preferred products so we actually do expect quite a lot from xultophy going forward and i do think sales doubled this year compared to last year when that is said laisema is in reality a once weekly version where you get the best of semaglutide with all the benefits inherited from the ozempic label hopefully and then of course lai287 without seeing any direct you can say disadvantages in terms of variability and peak to trough values and so on but when that is said the phase 2 trials with laisema are up against what is today still the most used insulin molecule named glargine u100 so the purpose of the phase 2 program for laisema is to have a competitive once weekly convenient offering with a profile benefit risk wise equal to that at least insulin glargine u100 and laisema is then seen as an intensification product where the patients in the future were to be on oral sema injectable glp 1 or even for that matter injectable insulin lars fruergaard jorgensen chief executive officer thank you mads yes peter on u s pricing clearly a lot of moving parts and a lot of political interest what came out last night in the u s in terms of moving away from a rebate from the being allowed us even to the pbms we actually applaud the administration for bringing this forward it s been discussed for a long period of time the current system where rebates are not shared with the patients is a chanting environment for us to operate in and you can see what has happened recently is that political pressure has increased in actually understanding how does the market work so we welcome this proposal as you know we gave last year 68 in rebates 113 billion in danish kroner this is put into the supply chain in terms of rebates and we think from a decisive point of view from patient point of view the allocation of those rebates can be done in a better way providing more value for the patients without being say a negative for novo nordisk we have looked at when you say new branch or second branch if you think about launching in the we looked at that we do not believe it s the best way forward so the chance outlook for rebates i think is the more viable way to go forward we are collaborating on the requests we have received for more transparency around how we conduct business how that will play out it ll probably take a long time at least some of the requests are quite comprehensive when we talk about changes in how rebates are handled in the u s it s not something we see will have an impact on how business is conducted in 2019 maybe not even in 20 because there are a number of contracts being made between us and our customers and again from pbms to insurance companies etc so it s a relative comprehensive set of legal commitments and change flow of money that has to be unwinded in terms of generic insulins and scott gottlieb s comments i think as we look at the market now it s a market that s already highly competitive on price so we actually feel that we re already operating in an environment where there s tough price competition so i m not sure that that in itself is going to significantly change that outlook thank you peter next question operator your next question is from the line of sachin jain bank of america please go ahead sachin jain bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi sachin jain bank of america couple of questions on oral ema if i may i wanted you to comment on oral sema timelines roughly where you think you will flee to the market with promotion just remembering back to ozempic you re roughly three months i think to launch with five to six months before promotion how should we think about oral sema in comparison to that and then second question on oral sema pricing i m not asking for prices i know that s off the table but just some variables as you think about it consensus seems to gravitate to roughly 10 to 12 per day based on recent commentary that you would price for quick access i want you to comment on two variables related to that a the timeframe you think about when when you think about the pricing decision historically you ve been happy to price and build for long term for example when you launch victoza and then second the impact of the existing glp business if you were to price that level and then any other key variables that you think play into that pricing decision thank you operator sachin thank you for that quite detailed question on all time line i think what what we can share with you is obviously that now we re using the priority voucher we have guided that we expect to submit by the turn of the coming quarter and that we re looking at a six month review period that indicates also when we would be able to have a proper pool as you know when you launch you have no access is blocked day one so we need to do a contracting with our customers and that is something that takes time in the u s market we re not going to guide in terms of when we expect that to be completed or when we expect to be in the market we think that s something we like to keep the close to us in terms of pricing it s a bit the same we have consistently for the last few quarters said that we do not want to openly discuss the pricing we think this is information of a competitive nature and it s not really serving our investors well to be open on that and it s the classical elements that we have mentioned before if there is a clinical differentiation of the product the competitive situation and the cost of goods sold for that so those are the elements that we would be factoring in and we of course are forming our own view on what that is but we d like to keep that close to us for the time being and hopefully you are understanding of that thank you sachin and sachin jain bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok thank you operator your next question is from the line of florent cespedes societe generale please go ahead florent cespedes societe generale analyst good afternoon gentlemen florent cespedes from societe generale three quick questions first financial related questions could you share with us the level of non recurring costs the absolute numbers which impacted q4 and the full year and the fuller question on this side is how do you see operating profit margin for this year because as you start from a lower base it s fair to assume margin expansion for 2019 or with the earlier launch of oral sema is it fair to assume higher launch costs second question a quick one regarding ozempic cardiovascular safety discussions you have with the fda when should we have the final decision from the fda regarding that and the labeling of ozempic with the update of this cardiovascular safety trial and the last but not least regarding growth hormone the q4 was quite dynamic so could you share with us how do you see the trend going forward is there a new environment is there any reasons to believe that we should see a little bit strong growth going forward for this franchise thank you lars fruergaard jorgensen chief executive officer thank you florent i think you know that ended up to maybe three or four questions so we ll try to answer them a bit consolidated so karsten first on non recurring cost in q4 and full year and margins then mads on ozempic cv karsten munk knudsen chief financial officer yes so non recurring in terms of restructuring costs then for the full year 18 cost was around 900 million kroner and for the fourth quarter then since we communicated 600 at the third quarter the new roughly 300 million in the third in the fourth quarter sorry the priority review voucher is around 800 million danish kroner of cost hitting the fourth quarter as to margin in 19 when you look at our guidance range then top line 2 to 5 and operating profit 2 to 6 both in local currencies not necessarily a huge margin play there and too remember that given the operating margin and where we are then it is not part of our strategy to use margin leverage to drive profitability we have a top line focus to drive profitability and then perhaps a final note on 19 margins is that the coverage gap impact in the u s of 2 billion dkk is of course a hit that goes all the way straight through the p l when you do your modeling lars fruergaard jorgensen chief executive officer thank you karsten and mads what of ozempic cv mads krogsgaard thomsen chief science officer yes as you can recall from the investor event we held at the ada meeting last june we did talk with the agency that cardiovascular outcome trials that could be needed to support the sustain 6 program were fully worthy of fda consideration assuming that they were on the same molecule of course regardless of route of administration and it is on this premise that we believe that the pioneer 6 really strengthens the case for semaglutide cardio protective properties such that we would seek to get a cardiovascular ndas that have a 10 month regulatory process lars fruergaard jorgensen chief executive officer thank you mads and thank you florent for those questions we take next question operator thank you our next question is from the line of martin parkhoi of danske bank please go ahead martin parkhoi danske bank analyst yes martin parkhoi danske bank first a question which i think is related to karsten at your capital markets day in 2017 you gave some indicative levels for the capex for 19 20 where you shared that should be at the level of 16 and now you guided 2 billion higher by 2019 is that an external event in 19 or will we also see such a level in 2020 and is this related to the clayton facility running above budget or what relates to this changed capex level compared to just less than one and a half years ago and then secondly to mads if you look at the timeline you still expect to start initiate the oral sema i recall in q2 and you have the decision by fda on oral sema in q3 why do we not wait start the oral sema program until you know have more clarity on the potential of getting a cv label on ozempic and maybe even on oral sema lars fruergaard jorgensen chief executive officer so thank you martin and karsten first on capex karsten munk knudsen chief financial officer yes so in 2018 we spent 9 5 billion on capex which was spot on our guidance and our guidance for 19 is 9 billion it is correct as you state that if you go back and directionally compare to the cmd slides then it s had a higher level but things are changing over time and we are spending more on capex in 19 than what we anticipated the main driver is of course our api investment in north carolina that is our biggest capex project these days where we are roughly 50 done but apart from that we have a number of upgrades and capacity expansion projects in manufacturing for instance in device assembly so you should see this as facing off of investments and you should expect our level of capex to go down after s 19 so 20 and onwards lars fruergaard jorgensen chief executive officer thank you karsten mads on timing mads krogsgaard thomsen chief science officer yes well first of all of course we ve taken a deep look at this whole trial based on all the existing evidence also from the pioneer 6 and that means in terms of the powering of the study the need for the amount of patient and hence also the cost of the study that of course has been the subject of discussion based on the reassuring data from pioneer 6 that s one thing another thing i d like to mention is that it is the study we planned and it s also a study that supports our ambition to have a renal label update with the kidney claims for first ozempic and delayed oral semaglutide in that the agency has accepted that we also bridge primary endpoints from for instance the flow study which is the diabetic neuropathy study that we are contemplating on doing with ozempic and bring that over to confirmatory secondary endpoints that were to be included in the sole trial for the oral semaglutide such that we can criss cross from oral sema to ozempic when it comes to cv data and we can criss cross back again from ozempic to oral when it comes to renal data that s the thinking behind some of these conclusions martin parkhoi danske bank analyst can i just follow up and ask just remind me when you expect to file oral sema late this quarter will you file for a cd indication actually or cd label based on pioneer 6 and maybe with support for sustain 6 mads krogsgaard thomsen chief science officer it is our intention to leverage the very strong and robust data that together emerged from the combination of sustain 6 and pioneer 6 in the best of all ways and that in principle goes for both products ozempic and oral martin parkhoi danske bank analyst thank you lars fruergaard jorgensen chief executive officer thank you mads thank you martin next question please operator your next question is from the line of kerry holford of bnp paribas please go ahead kerry holford exane bnp paribas analyst yes kerry holford from exane a couple of questions please first the oral question that you talked about that increasing again this year in the u s i wonder if you can just talk a little bit more about the key drivers of that in regards to insulin is that the key driver still or are we seeing more of that increase now impacting glp 1 and i wonder if you could compare the position of each of those franchises from that perspective and then secondly with regard to restructuring can we assume that program is now complete as of the end of 18 any further actions or charges likely to come through this year essentially i guess the question is are you now comfortable with your cost base in the current environment lars fruergaard jorgensen chief executive officer karsten will you comment a bit on that karsten munk knudsen chief financial officer yes yes so first of all as you see in our annual report which we published on our website this morning the u s rebate percentage is going up from 64 to 68 between 17 and 18 the main drivers in that respect is delivery of rebating and as we ve been counting on before it s basically in the basal insulin space where we ve been paying a higher rebate to remain on formularies so that s the main driver in terms of the growth from that we don t have anything new to add on the competitive situation in any of the segments we have very solid formulary coverage for our products going into 19 and now for ozempic we are around 80 unrestricted access in the u s markets so we feel comfortable on that as for restructuring cost we took the 900 million in charges in 2018 and we have not anything in our guidance for 2019 but of course we are reallocating our resources and our cost base on an ongoing matter but we do not foresee any major restructuring charges in 2019 lars fruergaard jorgensen chief executive officer thank you karsten thank you kerry next question please operator your next question is from the line of michael novod of nordea markets please go ahead michael novod nordea markets analyst yes hello it s michael from nordea two questions one to obesity which continues to surprise on the upside we also see that there s some sort of say a reacceleration or further acceleration in the u s maybe you could talk about some of the key drivers behind this and also perhaps put it into context to what you expect in terms of say better access better uptake with the sema where we re going to see the phase 3 data i don t know 12 15 months from now and then secondly to the launch cost for oral sema i know that you won t comment on the exact timing in the market just want to get some clarity around how your thinking is about cost levels for the launch if that is fully incorporated into the guidance at the current time for 2019 thanks lars fruergaard jorgensen chief executive officer thank you michael and camilla some comments on obesity camilla sylvest executive vice president and head of commercial space and corporate affairs yes so generally we are tracking in line with the expectations on obesity we are of course growing very significantly we also now are close to 50 value market share on a global level on volume market share level we are still in the range of 4 to 5 so it means there s still significantly untapped potential and we are continuing our efforts in terms of supporting the market in terms of education of obesity as a disease and also in terms of our activities to try to ensure reimbursement in different countries for obesity and that is a process that will take time but we are continuing along this road and that s basically the things that are going to drive this so we do see in international operations this year we should expect the number of new launches that can continue some of these growth rates and we also see generally across the board global level and good growth rate when it comes to the actual market growth this is still not very strong and actually has been going down slightly recently but that doesn t go for novo nordisk so we keep gaining share and we re very confident about the growth in this area lars fruergaard jorgensen chief executive officer thank you camilla and comments from mads mads krogsgaard thomsen chief science officer yes you also mentioned semaglutide michael and i think the three drivers of sema that will help camilla and the team create stronger penetration and a larger market that deserves to be there is the durability of drug treatment as you know they keep on losing weight the semaglutide patients also in diabetes throughout a full year and it s also the magnitude of the weight loss that helps and then finally if you actually improve patient outcomes and that s why we re doing the select study so all the things camilla s team are doing now is also paving the road for something that is hopefully going to be the future anchor drug in obesity lars fruergaard jorgensen chief executive officer thank you camilla and mads and on launch costs michael i think if you look at the past few years here we have been in constant prelaunch launch mode across the world so we cannot it s not really meaningful to go in and talk on cost on a specific launch but we do expect to have an ratio in the vicinity of 25 to 26 in 2019 so that does work we can guide on that for now thank you michael and next question please operator next question is from the line of richard vosser of j p morgan please go ahead richard vosser j p morgan analyst hi thanks for taking my question couple of product ones so just looking at tresiba in the fourth quarter in the u s looked as though there may be some destocking or maybe some rebates in there just could you talk about the trends you re seeing in tresiba in the u s second question just victoza china obviously on the end overall very strong growth in q3 less growth in q4 just how should we think about the future picture for victoza in china in the u s and then just one final a couple of questions around oral sema just thinking about the access that you ve got so far on ozempic you mentioned 80 access and i think when you first launched you had 50 access are these the sort of levels of access that you re looking to achieve for oral sema and then sort of linked to that you mentioned on the clayton facility that you re 50 through the spend i presume you re starting up the facility production soonish though but sort of when would you start to start that up and when would we see an impact from incremental depreciation from the start up thanks very much lars fruergaard jorgensen chief executive officer ok that was quite a number of questions richard so we ll try to keep track of this so on tresiba no particular fluctuation there when you look at it quite constant uptake overall and as i mentioned 15 market share growth over the past three years 5 a year so we actually see that as being quite stable from a u s point of view mike any comments from you on victoza in china mike doustdar executive vice president and head of international operations no i can say victoza china was it almost doubled and it appeared against our own expectations from quarter to quarter your see these deviations sometimes and it has to do with the lifting of the hospital and the speed of those compared to what the plan is but i m happy to say that now we have full coverage actually with the reimbursement in china after the national drug list took place at the beginning of the year then we have gone to various different regions and the hospitals and we have the coverage that we had anticipated so i don t foresee the q4 to be any indications of what happens later on lars fruergaard jorgensen chief executive officer and very shortly on ozempic that s right we are at 80 that s actually a relative high access rate compared to our product so we re not necessarily looking at going to that on oral sema to be successful and very quickly on the clayton facility we are ramping up construction then comes the validation qualification of it which takes quite some time so gradually we ll be phasing in the factory from 2020 and in the coming period there so thank you richard and let s remind each other to stick to two questions going forward next question please operator your next question is from the line of michael leuchten from ubs please go ahead michael leuchten ubs analyst thank you very much two questions please one for mike and one for karsten i think so on the international operations in the fourth quarter it looks like we had quite a few sort of distortions in terms of timings of shipments and it seems a little bit more pronounced than maybe we ve seen in the past just wondering if there s any sort of trend to this why we all of a sudden see that in q4 and if that s the case are we going to see all that coming back in q1 or is that a more balanced in 2019 any color would be helpful and then a question on the gross margin if we sort of adjust for rebate adjustments in 2018 pricing pressure you mentioned the gross to net in the insulin space your gross margin did phenomenally well obviously particularly on mix but is there anything else that made 2018 a year that made the gross margins particularly strong that wouldn t repeat as we look into 2019 and maybe 2020 or is the mix effect likely going to be as strong going forward lars fruergaard jorgensen chief executive officer thank you michael mike first on q4 timing anything that s mentioned mike doustdar executive vice president and head of international operations so all the timing that has been announced has been actually in the emerging market in aameo and latam which it is quite usual actually to have timings of the shipments primarily actually it has been a few countries just a handful of countries in aameo interesting enough i think if you take a look at the q4 results of the other regions so the more regular regions europe and china japan they all did better in q4 than the previous year s in terms of growth rates so that should give you a good indication that we don t foresee a major full year effect of that as we go forward lars fruergaard jorgensen chief executive officer thank you mike and karsten for the gross margin anything special about 2018 karsten munk knudsen chief financial officer so i would say what was special for 2018 was that in manufacturing we really hit it on all cylinders and that s not something that we can plan with for every year it s like winning all cylinders in international operations it happens in few years but most often you win some you lose some so i think overall manufacturing had a fantastic year in 18 i think i m more balanced at this point in terms of our productivity gains in terms of 19 still favorable productivity and some positive mix from the glp 1 franchise do bear in mind again that the doughnut hole impact hits straight through so of course a negative impact on that account and then come 2020 and onwards and we re not guiding on that specifically albeit from a low base but oral sema in italy will be at a lower gross margin which is naturally in a ramp up phase of a product lars fruergaard jorgensen chief executive officer thank you karsten and thank you michael so we have time to we have one last question operator and your final question is from the line of carsten madsen of seb please go ahead carsten madsen seb analyst thank you very much carsten from seb so then we ll follow up on karsten s last comment here on the gross margin for oral sema because i can see on clinical trials for that the new trial with lower doses have been completed essentially it seems like that trial would have the potential for you to cut your cost for oral sema into half with the new formulation i was wondering if you could share some details on what was the outcome of the trial and what would be your next step thank you lars fruergaard jorgensen chief executive officer that actually sounded like a question to me i suppose karsten carsten madsen seb analyst oh yes karsten munk knudsen chief financial officer yes and i always at least pretend as if i know some details about r d but on this particular occasion i will disappoint you because unfortunately the trial has completed the in live phase but as i think you are aware carsten after the in live phase even for a small trial work to be done before you actually can lock the database do the analysis and so on so this is something that we for sure at the q1 road show will be able to update you on the two different kinds of clinical activities that are ongoing in the oral glp 1 space in phase 1 carsten madsen seb analyst oh ok ok could you maybe then just say do you expect this trial to be the final trial for a new formulation and what is the regulatory strategy going forward is this something you can quickly update and get into the market if it s a successful trial mads krogsgaard thomsen chief science officer ok so carsten it all depends but if you have a known ingredient such as semaglutide in the snack formulation and what you ve done is changed the composition and or the way you create the tablet then as long as you can match the clinical profile with your new tablet in a way that is bioequivalent to that of the existing generation product i e the one we re going to launch as soon as possible then you can in principle do one confirmatory trial where you after a period of for instance six months show that it is indeed clinically equivalent and as safe as the existing generation of product and that would then be clearly at a reduced cost of goods sold but let s talk more about it when we have some data lars fruergaard jorgensen chief executive officer thank you mads thank you carsten this concludes our conference call thank you all for participating we look forward to meet many of you over the coming days in the meantime if you have any question please reach out to our investor relations officers thank you very much have a good day operator duration 60 minutes call participants lars fruergaard jorgensen chief

the fallout from the us china trade war and other uncertainties continue to weigh on investor sentiment for emerging markets but we don t think the trade spat or some other issues which we perceive to be short term in nature should cloud investors long term view of the asset class we continue to see evidence of some positive emerging market fundamentals that supports our medium to long term optimism we would also note that while 2018 was no doubt a disappointing year for many investors the prior two years saw very strong returns that outpaced developed markets overall here are three considerations we think investors are missing when it comes to emerging markets crisis level valuations aren t reflecting continued underlying resilience in emerging markets geopolitical tensions between the united states and china have contributed to a decline in emerging market stocks driving valuations to near crisis levels however for us that brings attractive potential opportunities as we don t see most emerging market economies in crisis situations we think the pullback we ve seen in emerging market equities in recent months presents some attractive medium to long term opportunities while economic growth overall was perhaps not as strong as had been expected at the start of the year in 2018 emerging markets still outpaced developed markets this trend is expected to continue in 2019 with the international monetary fund imf forecasting 2019 gross domestic product gdp growth in emerging markets at 4 5 versus 2 in developed markets in addition many investors often overlook the fact that emerging markets debt to gdp levels are relatively low when compared with developed countries see chart below we believe this solid growth outlook and the other positive fundamental factors we see in emerging markets indicate equities have the potential to rebound should some of the recent market uncertainly subside the corporate environment looks supportive despite weaker currencies in emerging markets corporate earnings growth in us dollar terms was positive in 2018 and looks sustainable to us so we think cheaper valuations could attract long term value oriented investors toward companies that are currently trading at a discount against this brighter backdrop we ve seen an improvement in corporate governance with better transparency between company s stakeholders and decision makers we think this creates a supportive environment for shareholders whether that s in technology companies or niche small capitalisation consumer businesses in emerging markets consumerism and technology are the engine of emerging market growth while we saw some headwinds for emerging markets last year in our view they obscured the bigger picture some emerging market companies are now world leaders in the areas of financials technology and in the production of many consumer goods in fact patent applications in emerging markets have overtaken that of japan and the united states and show no sign of abating we think this reflects the growing innovations we ve seen coming out of emerging market companies from mobile payment and lending systems to driverless cars and healthcare services emerging markets in many cases have been able to adopt new technologies at a fast rate because there are no legacy systems that need to be replaced or integrated first we are confident technology will remain a primary driver in emerging markets whether manifested through world leading semiconductor manufacturing e commerce or other areas despite some recent corrections we ve seen in some technology orientated emerging market companies we still believe many of them have sustainable earnings potential consumerism in emerging markets should help drive growth in many regions growing middle class populations and increasing affluence the premiumisation of the market continues to spur demand for high end products available in emerging markets in our view companies with superior products should see sustainable growth in the years to come chetan sehgal is from franklin templeton emerging markets equity

data released yesterday showed the us economy added a staggering 300 000 jobs last month providing some reassurance that the government shutdown did little damage to the wider economy but the news failed to move investors but the first trading day in february came after a blockbuster month of january in which wall street saw its best start to the year in 30 years that s a tough act to follow which helps explain a little bit of the sluggishness in the futures market this morning as market participants question just how much longer this hot run can last said briefing com analyst patrick o hare noting the s p 500 was up 15 per cent from its december 24 low wall street opened mixed with the dow adding 0 3 per cent in the first minute of trading while both the broader s p 500 and tech heavy nasdaq composite both moving lower european markets were also lacking strong trends in afternoon trading with both london and paris showing modest gains while frankfurt dipped yesterday the market had a somewhat unstoppable feeling to it which is perhaps an early indication based on a contrarian viewpoint that the rally is about to stop added o hare earlier this week the federal reserve fuelled a rally on wall street by signalling a slowdown in its pace of american interest rate hikes this year china us trade talks this week ended with no deal but with both sides sounding notes of optimism and setting up more high level meetings later this month temporarily soothing concerns of an all out trade war yesterday s non farm payrolls figures were being watched for signals about the state of the world s number one economy with the fed having already warned of a global slowdown this is another really strong jobs report with non farm payrolls rising 304 000 in january and suggests that the us economy is in great shape with businesses desperate for workers said james knightley chief international economist at dutch bank ing he added it suggests that the us economy hasn t been adversely impacted by the government shutdown in any meaningful way however growth in pay held steady just above inflation and the jobless rate ticked up to 4 0 per cent as the government was hit by a five week shutdown separately official data showed friday that eurozone inflation is moving further away from the european central bank s target of 2 0 percent indicating that the ecb would be less likely to raise interest rates this year in foreign exchange activity the european single currency rose against the dollar the shanghai stock market jumped yesterday to close up 1 3 percent as traders welcomed news that authorities had relaxed certain rules to make investing easier
yves here i have to confess to being not keen about various green new deal proposals they feed the idea that we can largely preserve our lifestyles and still make a big enough reduction in greenhouse gas output soon enough to ward off catastrophic outcomes there are in my mind three fallacies here 1 the fastest and most effective way to reduce greenhouse gas output is radical conservation the urgency of the challenge means this approach needs to be top of the list every year more of status quo or not much different is more greenhouse gases pumped into the atmosphere no one is proposing that we even take measures of the sort imposed in the oil crisis like lowering speed limits and requiring businesses to set their thermostats to 67 in the winter and 77 in the summer if we were serious we d have to be willing to bankrupt the airlines by forcing 90 reductions in flight levels and outlaw private jets 2 building green infrastructure has an energy cost and those costs are seldom incorporated like the greenhouse gas cost of mining and delivering materials for production of various inputs they are also not factoring in that some of the materials that are important in current green technologies don t exist in sufficient quantity to satisfy anticipated needs jack lifton has written extensively about lithium and some materials are costly in environmental terms see for example critical minerals scarcity could threaten renewable energy future stanford we may face a huge shortage of essential raw materials stiffling green energy if governments don t step up their game zme science 3 while green new deal approaches would be valuable in conjunction with radical conservation they aren t sufficient on their own if nothing else because they will take too long to be implemented when time is of the essence and they have a tendency to perpetuate the idea that there will be no or little sacrifice needed in cutting carbon output levels people accepted rationing and other forms of sacrifice at times of war i d take the green new deal people a lot more seriously if they firmly opposed us military activity as a source of greenhouse gases and also opposed non esssential energy costly technology planned obsolescence schemes like 5g by marshall auerback is a market analyst and commentator produced by economy for all a project of the independent media institute even though the issue of environmental sustainability has finally broken beyond the policy think tanks and is now reaching critical mass with the public as a whole there is still profound disagreement as to how one tethers environmental sustainability to economic growth in a manner where the costs are borne equitably or asan early thinker on these questions briankohler onceframed it the means by which the solutions gain political legitimacy rest on how society will make decisions about sustainability and who will pay the price of those decisions will it be those who have the deepest pockets or will it be those who can get the best press there s no question that deep pockets will be needed given the scale of the task at hand multi trillion dollar levels of spending in fact will be necessary if we want to follow what the science is telling us needs to be done the increasingly dire warningsfrom the intergovernmental panel on climate change a group that if anything has consistently underplayed the scale of the threat and countless other scientific findings haveintroduced a new sense of realism in terms of the policy response required democrats in particular are embracing proposals that would require running the entire american economy on renewable electricity within a few decades although they have yet to coalesce around a single policy proposal the most comprehensive is this one which calls for the federal government to spend around 10 percent of gdp per year close to 2 trillion in order to directly build a green infrastructure that will guaranteethat in 20 years the united states will be virtually greenhouse gas free an ambitious plan predicated on fdr s original new deal it calls for a full employment program not unlike the job guarantee program that will purportedly create about 25 million new jobs via a revived manufacturing sector assuming that most of the manufacturing is done in the united states not abroad it also calls for the establishment of an interstate renewable electricity system modeled after the interstate highway system that would replace all of the coal oil and natural gas that currently generate electricity as the u s transitions to a fossil fuel free economy the scale of government involvement marks a decided break from the market driven proposals that have hitherto characterized most earlier green proposals most controversially it advocates a 50 percent cut in defense spending to fund these future expenditures which is almost certainly politically impossible given the scale of existing militarization in the u s economy today along with the pentagon s iron grip over policy making on the other hand if the problem is as dire as much of the science suggests the policies must match the rhetoric if that seems like an insurmountable challenge it is worth recalling that during world war ii a much less technologically advanced society managed to survive quite nicely while allocating about one third of national output for the war effort if the political class is serious about a green new deal they must also be honest about the scale of the challenges and the question of a just transition for those most affected by the resultant displacement and disruption former california governor jerry brown for one has likened the threat to fighting the nazis in world war ii perhaps this document most readily associated with the green party won t be the finished product offered up by our political class but its very detail highlights the scale of the challenges that match governor brown s analogy if we re going to transition to a post fossil fuels economy among the questions raised are the following it envisions more than a 40 fold increase in renewables within a decade but the united states no longer has any significant capacity to produce solar panels or wind turbines and only has an insignificant capacity for batteries notwithstanding tesla s ambitious plans that means in the first years all the increase will be supplied by china korea taiwan and other overseas producers unless production is re domiciled which will take time a problem given the urgency of the threat seymour melman and other advocates of what came to be known as economic conversion proposed a similar concept for potentially moving workers and engineers from military factories to civilian work the idea is to set up what melman called alternative use committees in each facility which would draw up plans for a two year transition to other lines of work in the case of the green new deal this should entail plans to facilitate fossil fuel industry workers shifting to specific new renewable energy factories such as for wind turbines or in new industrial machinery factories from a practical standpoint it would make sense to offer parallel incentives to the fossil fuel investor class rather than have them drag their heels why not entice them into a profitable line of business absent this alternative use the source of the demand will be met by the far east and the green new deal will become a job creation program for asia not the united states as well as creating huge unemployment we will therefore face a very difficult trade off between heavy protectionism at much higher prices to stimulate investment in productive capacity in the united states or much larger trade deficits the viability of making this green transition is questionable if it doesn t also include a degree of nuclear power geothermal or fossil fuel plant alternatives at least for a time as the environmentalists jesse jenkins and samuel thernstrom argued in a recent new york times op ed the green new deal will be no deal if all it buys us is solar and wind power so called firm low carbon technologiessuch as nuclear carbon capture or reliable but often overlooked renewables like geothermal or hydro dams with large reservoirs makes them a critical complement to weather dependent wind and solar as well as resources like batteries or strategies like demand flexibility which permits consumers to reduce their electricity use in periods when supplies are strained that are best suited to fast bursts of use a related problem is that over the past decade the oil and gas industry has accounted for a disproportionately large percentage of economic business investment and middle class jobs precisely the kinds of highly paid highly skilled jobs that are rapidly being shipped overseas as u s manufacturing is increasingly eviscerated and consider what share of u s military spending concerns the price and supply of oil these jobs are located in the american heartland which given the realities of the electoral college the democrats will have to win back if they are to have any chance of securing power and implementing their proposals how exactly is the plan going to offset this huge loss especially if much of the demand for renewables leaks out to overseas producers the increase in oil and gas production has led to a dramatic improvement in the trade balance whose deficit would have grown much larger had it not been for the improvement in energy additionally the low cost of energy over the past decade has led to an improvement in u s competitiveness in a number of industries it has also created a significant consumer stimulus by allowing households to reallocate spending on heating cooling and transportation to other consumer purchases relative low energy costs are a major consideration in german and european companies relocating production to the united states this is a comparative advantage that should not be disposed of without offsetting benefits speaking of cheap power it is also worth recalling that in the original new deal many political leaders pushed for rural electrification to decentralize power take it away from the utility holding companies and distribute it to rural areas they did just that and today the united states has the most diffused ownership of any electric grid on the planet there are some 900 rural co ops in the united states by decentralizing the economic and political power that comes along with electrification they also assured low cost electricity for generations the green new deal risks doing the opposite if the main incentives to encourage transition are carbon taxes see the french yellow vest protests or trading carbon credits which amounts to a privatization of the atmosphere related to this the potential increase in the cost of electricity and transportation will disproportionately impact lower and middle income americans who do not live in the few urban areas with decent public transportation absent significant increases in this area it will take more than a decade for alternative transportation networks to develop to serve this large population in those places where alternative transportation is economically feasible otherwise the green new deal risks raising both energy costs and existing forms of transport ironically as jon rynn a fellow at the cuny institute for urban systems notesin his book manufacturing green prosperity the power to rebuild the american middle class suburban sprawl came about by virtue of hundreds of billions of dollars of federal government spending via eisenhower s federal aid highway act of 1956 and the g i billthat provided loans to millions of returning soldiers to buy homes and make builders like fred trump rich the build out of suburban water and road infrastructure an infrastructure bill therefore cannot simply modernize existing structures but can and must help to reverse these trends by featuring more public transport and more public housing in densely populated areas above all else labor must not simply be treated as a rounding error in this process as brian kohlerput it if environmentalists and politicians aiming for a sustainable economy fail to understand the jobs issue you will create a confrontation that you cannot win you will force us into an alliance with our employers and you we society and the environment will all be the losers likewise with business leaders kohler continues if you continue to treat us as commodities instead of human beings if you continue to shed jobs at every opportunity using the excuses of globalization automation downsizing mergers and contracting out if you continue to poison our bodies and then fight our attempts to obtain even workers compensation in return you will have to forgive us for being somewhat skeptical when you promise to save our jobs although the term green new deal has great historic resonance it is a bit of a misnomer fdr proposed aggressive fiscal stimulus to address the problem of existing excess capacity labor and capital created by the great depression the new deal involved very little displacement of existing technologies by contrast much of the green new deal is about displacement of existing technologies which threatens existing jobs and livelihoods as kohler eloquently points out thus the choice cannot be framed in a manner that forces workers to choose between saving the environment vs safeguarding their economic livelihood kohler is right workers will vote for jobs every time we cannot simply dismiss these protesters as retrograde deplorables recall that we are looking at a technologically disruptive program that will substantially alter historic patterns of industry output employment and the consumption patterns of households and firms the government therefore be it democratic or republican cannot afford to play small ball here a characteristically timid knee jerk reaction of both parties afflicted by years of deficit hysteria and the corresponding desire to shrink the state nor can it rely on the market as the optimal means of organizing allocation the new york times columnist thomas friedman s nonsensical notions to let father greed as he puts it solve the problem to the contrary similarly economist paul krugmanwants to provide positive incentives like tax credits or not too onerous regulations but those market centered ideas are too late or as rynn argues the government doing something should not mean that the government does something to help the marketto do something after all we didn t subcontract world war ii to the market fdr understood and had the requisite political will and courage when he ushered in his new deal and shaped the democrats political legacy for generations likewise in the spirit of jfk s famous moon speech the united states must choose to recognize and embrace the challenges of the green new deal not because they are easy but because they are hard because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills kennedy was frank enough to admit that attaining the moon landing was hard and a comparable degree of honesty is required from today s leaders the goals are not simply ones of relief and recovery as was the case in the original new deal but a wholesale transformation of the u s economy and a reconfiguration of the government s role in a manner not unlike what occurred during world war ii this will require a permanently larger government role in the economy for many years not simply as a regulator umpire or redistributor but as a builder certainly it would mark a significant break from the market fundamentalism that has grown to dominate the existing policy framework of the past 40 years but if the crisis is as great as the science suggests then the actions must match that degree of urgency both in terms of scale and equity the critics might well say it s pie in the sky at times however leaders need to be aspirational rather than reasonable to get anything remotely close to what is required reasonable after all is what got us obamacare rather than medicare for all we need to do better this time it might be our last chance
