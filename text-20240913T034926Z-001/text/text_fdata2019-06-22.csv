is pakistan as it is currently structured an economically viable state is it a state that can sustain itself without huge amounts of foreign assistance in other words can pakistan live off its own money or does it survive on other people s money the economic crisis that the country is facing is not new in fact it is cyclical and every few years pakistan finds itself in a similar crisis but every new cycle brings pakistan closer to the point of an economic meltdown the current economic crisis is in many ways far worse than earlier crises that the country has faced not only is this financial it is systemic and structural band aid solutions might delay the inevitable but won t address the fundamental problems that bog the economy if anything the bailouts being given will only pull pakistan out of the immediate crisis but then create the conditions for the next upcoming crises which will be even more difficult to handle this is in part because the sweeping reforms that need to accompany the bailouts will either be done half heartedly or else partially and extremely reluctantly not with the purpose of reform but to ward off the immediate crisis against this backdrop when the de facto finance minister who has been imported and imposed upon the government allegedly by the imf and the pakistani deep state says that unless the country addresses the imbalances in the economy it is heading for a default and will be left with no escape route it is a sign that things are actually even worse than what they appear to be if the latest pakistani budget is anything to go by the economy seems to be entering a long dark tunnel with no light coming in from the other side the numbers in the budget are so far fetched that no one is really taking them seriously what is worse even if pakistan actually manages to achieve the numbers it has given in the budget 2019 20 it doesn t really pull the country out of the economic morass in which it finds itself the reason is simple the financials of pakistan are totally out of sync with the fundamentals of economic management their sums don t match and the way they are making their national accounts books match smack more of voodoo economics than anything else if the latest pakistani budget is anything to go by the economy seems to be entering a long dark tunnel with no light coming in from the other side the numbers in the budget are so far fetched that no one is really taking them seriously according to the 2019 20 budget the federal government proposes to collect taxes of pkr 5 55 trillion this is an increase of pkr 1 450 trillion approximately 35 over the revised tax collection of pkr 4 150 trillion in the outgoing fiscal year the revised tax number is also inflated and is not expected to cross pkr 3 95 trillion when the financial year closes on 30 june the revised tax collection is pkr 285 billion less than the budgeted tax collection for fy 2018 19 and the expected number is pkr 485 billion less than budgeted number the real kicker is that even the inflated revised tax collection number for fy 2018 19 is almost the same as the revised number for the fy 2017 18 pg 3 in other words the total tax collection was virtually static in the outgoing year and yet there is the projection of a nearly 35 increase 40 if the expected or if you will the actual number of pkr 3 95 trillion is considered in tax collections in the budget for 2019 20 in 2018 19 given the gdp growth of 3 3 according to independent economists even this gdp growth of 3 3 has been jacked up by almost 1 by showing an increase in electricity generation distribution and gas distribution sector growing by an unbelievable 40 and an inflation of around 7 tax collections should have risen by around 10 11 at the very least but this didn t happen in the next fiscal with growth expected to contract further to 2 4 and inflation expected to be around 11 13 the tax collections could increase by around 15 in the natural course but to expect them to increase by 35 or 40 if the actual number is taken into account is utterly unrealistic the only possible justification for fixing such an over ambitious tax revenue target is a world bank report which has calculated that pakistan can raise substantial tax revenues by improving compliance removing exemptions and broadening and expanding the tax base although the world bank has agreed to fund the revenue mobilisation project the last time such a project was funded by the world bank produced less than satisfactory results given that pakistan s population is growing at 2 4 every year if the gdp growth in the outgoing and the coming year is going to be more or less the same it means that there is virtually no growth in incomes add to this rising inflation independent economists calculate that because of rising taxes weakening of the pakistani rupee and a massive spike in utility prices inflation will be at least a few percentage points higher than the 11 13 estimated by the pakistan government it means that poverty levels will rise as will unemployment the above is the best case scenario in which the government is able to achieve the targets it has set for itself in the budget given that pakistan s population is growing at 2 4 every year if the gdp growth in the outgoing and the coming year is going to be more or less the same it means that there is virtually no growth in incomes even if pakistan pulls off the impossible and meets the revenue target of pkr 5 55 trillion it doesn t take the country out of the woods the reason is that its fiscal math is totally out of sync the net revenue receipts that the federal government estimates is only pkr 3 46 trillion but just debt servicing pkr 2 89 trillion and defence expenditure pkr 1 15 trillion are pkr 500 billion more than the grossly over optimistic estimate of revenue that the government of pakistan hopes to collect in other words everything else that the government does is on borrowed money in fact the net revenue is only 50 of the pkr 7 02 trillion total federal expenditure that the government will incur according to the government s own calculations the total fiscal deficit in 2019 20 will be 7 2 of gdp almost the same as the fiscal deficit number given for the outgoing financial year but the thing is that given the inflated revenue numbers for 2018 19 it is expected that the fiscal deficit will be closer to 8 next year it could be 9 or even more depending on how much the revenue shortfall is already economists are claiming that the pkr 423 billion of provincial surpluses that the federal government is expecting are unlikely and this alone means that the fiscal deficit will breach the 8 mark and if there are cost escalations in defence spending or if interest rates rise further and the rupee weakens more by some estimates the rupee could fall to 180 to a dollar by december and may even breach the 200 mark then debt servicing will shoot up further and make an even bigger hole in the budget even if the pessimists are proven wrong and everything works according to plan pakistan s total public debt will continue to gallop out of control since the ouster of the military dictator gen pervez musharraf pakistan s debt has almost doubled every five years and given the trajectory of borrowings done by the imran khan government in the last 10 months pakistan s debt could double again by the time the current dispensation completes its term clearly this is an unsustainable proposition and pakistan is staring at a sovereign default economists have been warning of the country being caught in a debt trap situation for some years but it is now that the imminence of the crisis has hit home after the usual bluff bluster and bravado which has become the hallmark of pakistan in general and the imran khan led dispensation in particular pakistan has been forced to approach the imf for a bailout before approaching the imf however imran khan went hat in hand to friendly countries hoping that this would help pakistan avoid the tough conditions that the imf was expected to impose before agreeing to a bailout but within a few months pakistan had run through the over usd 9 billion that it borrowed from saudi arabia uae and china the last resort left was the imf after the usual bluff bluster and bravado which has become the hallmark of pakistan in general and the imran khan led dispensation in particular pakistan has been forced to approach the imf for a bailout much of the budget seems to be aimed at only getting the imf package which in turn will open to doors to other multilateral funding and also the access to international financial markets but the unrealistic numbers in the budget suggest that pakistan will in all likelihood live up to its infamy as a one tranche nation in the last 60 years pakistan has gone to the imf 21 times the latest imf programme that pakistan is entering will be the 22nd time out of all these programmes the only time pakistan successfully completed an imf programme was the 2013 one and even that after the fund allowed more than a dozen waivers on non observance of performance criteria on the basis of which the programme had been approved what this means is that pakistan has never carried out the structural reforms that the imf had recommended as a result on an average every 3 4 years pakistan has had to go hat in hand to the imf over the years two things have happened one the us romance with pakistan has ended and the soft terms concessions bailouts and waivers that came by so easily in the past are no longer available two the imf has also smartened up to pakistan s shenanigans and has insisted on front loading the conditionalities instead of spacing them out pakistan invariably used to take the imf for a royal ride by taking the money and then reneging on the conditionalities the imf therefore has forced pakistan to take prior actions before it even approves the extended fund facility arrangement for now pakistan is banking upon its time tested modus operandi of tiding over the immediate crisis by giving in to whatever is demanded of it and then waiting and hoping that things take a turn for the better so that they no longer need to deliver on the commitments they have made the way the pakistanis see it their geography for alms strategy has never failed them in the past in the region they are located something or the other always happens that opens the floodgates of funds for them who knows perhaps the americans will once again rediscover pakistan s utility as a mercenary state maybe the chinese will become more expansive in pouring in funds what s to rule out the saudis or uae opening their coffers in exchange for some pakistani troops deploying in the middle east to fight the dirty wars being fought there and if all else fails pakistan can always leverage itself as a country too dangerous to fail but if nothing works and no one is ready to throw good money after bad in pakistan then it will be exceedingly difficult to prevent an economic meltdown the views expressed above belong to the author s orf research

nothing new under the sun avoiding earth xit part 3 the momentum for change what has been is what will be what has been done will be done again there is nothing new under the sun this was not the uttering of someone depressed and disillusioned with life but someone who had every material educational and personal advantage someone who had explored all life had to offer and ruled over the longest peaceful period of his nation s history famed internationally for his wisdom and someone who made a point of fully examining wealth relationships family madness and folly of course even with historical evidence his statement comes down to a matter of belief nothing was new to him in the context of his era but something impending will be new to all human experience maybe even once and for all time that might leave no historical evidence of our existence something the most powerful people with every similar advantage feel powerless to alter but every day our bodies replace their cells a child is born adding a new individual personality that can and does make a difference to those in contact with it and someone s perspective is altered by circumstance or information we seek improvements in almost everything updates refinements the potential for change far from being negative is vast we are hard wired for change and new things arrive for us on a daily basis in technological and scientific advancements despite great advancements in cancer research and new methods of detection and treatment percentages of likelihood have increased from 33 to 50 climate change

motive the quote above could sound somewhat demoralising yet if it is true it also it presupposes the solution must already exist it could be right under our noses so what and who are we to believe most of the global monetary economic system is built on trust and belief that transactions will be honoured by both parties and fulfilled through automated sequences no one need worry about and if that does not work that some legal system will enforce those agreements to be honoured that people will be forced to respect the law of possession of course all of these necessary parties and methods and laws law makers and enforcers can be replaced overnight but this again relies on belief and motivation our 21st century has seen more than its fair share of this already so everyone is aware how much belief and motivation out there has diminished resulting in siege mentality for many it could be said that there has never been such a mass momentum for change since wwii and why authors of the green new deal want climate change placed on a war footing nobel prize laureate joseph stiglitz recently published in the guardian climate change is our third world war since combatting climate deterioration must apparently depend upon large hand outs of money from philanthropic corporate moguls he bypasses the last decade s greatest civil world war that has already eclipsed all of wwii s atrocities in both scope and depravity that of neoliberal capitalist s not capitalism s dispossession and marginalisation of the 99 but people in general are not stupid they rightly disbelieve there is the political and commercial will new economic model nem and scientific conservation networks conference and webinar every connotation and the smallest initiatives that can and do make inroads to address capitalism s negativity yet hardly scratch its surface every economic case is being made to appeal to the greatest contributors to global warming to alter their course a course they are currently expanding all calls for economic and political reform are regularly dismissed or co opted for marketing purposes in a short article it is impossible to present the whole range and scope of momentum or present statistics simply for the reader to choose whether they believe them or not but after five years of research and discussion regarding positive changes people are making in virtually every country in the world everyday people are still unaware of those that have even altered their local and national political structures or achieved nation wide justice for themselves and other countries should they also fall foul of economic legal and political injustices so what does this movement consist of necessity has long been the mother of re invention anti capitalist pro humanities activist networks and self governing political movements have formed revolutionary communities ngos anti poverty aid agencies and refugee crisis organisations have never been busier everyday people plugging the gap of diminishing or overwhelmed statutory services charitable and non profit initiatives and cooperatives are expanding the commons and other sharing networks alternative complementary and crypto currencies circular and localised non monetary economies have become national in scope and successful in both affluent and poverty stricken communities green energy producers are increasing climate change environment and conservation campaign organisations abound self sustaining communities eco village networks and volunteer groups and individuals who from the kindness of their hearts simply repopulate endangered species or plant edible food in public places for their communities authors and academic institutions research and share these topics and projections regarding current economic policies with urgency publishers are inundated with submissions regarding the negative projections for the fourth industrial revolution and vitriolic finger wagging at capitalism this appetite for change is not an insignificant force but to motivate everyday people these movements simply lack exposure and a concerted effort to utilise their influence and power in a common easy to apply and more embracing system they are dotted across the globe but no one has yet joined the dots until now all this article can do is skim the surface of that scope or signpost it as seeing is more likely to engender belief and counter the demoralising momentum that consumes media and people s time and efforts to survive respected television scientists and naturalists musicians and actors now sense a potential change in the political climate of their platform or defy it and have started a momentum in media that should be seized upon but as media sometimes reflects reality this is only the tip of the looming iceberg the sheer mass of social movement remains below the surface and unseen unless you dive into the internet to shed light on what s really going on the most recent and visible incarnation of this discomfort is extinction rebellion pushing beyond petitioning and protesting to civil disobedience and disruption to press the topic that is the most politically inconvenient our survival all of the existing forces for change are well informed and generally know about each other but if efforts are diverted for personal kudos or absorbed by determination to progress their individual agendas they will remain isolated near impotent forces this mass market is what the captains of the titanic protectionist neoliberal monetary market fear will make them look like a dinghy adrift in the north atlantic and many are of the let s face the music and dance persuasion with political and corporate wilful ignorance on climate change why get caught up in something protracted and energy wasting when it s possible to bypass it or supersede it first ask yourself who could get things done quicker and better than politicians and commercial magnates the answer is obvious the people who already do it now ask who does it with less and again nothing new there all the above when politicians complain about disrupting a day s work in full knowledge of a protest warning of the threat to that employment infrastructure they show themselves as more juvenile than the children protesting about ignoring their future if all the initiatives by motivated people trying to redress the adverse effects of capitalism are doing it with relatively small budgets is it not logical they are the first port of call to form a mutually supportive global network that can then invent or adopt its own non monetary economy or expand existing ones joining up the dots here s just a few examples anti capitalist populism and political activist movements populism gets a bad press when consisting of far left or right political representation even corbyn is to some far left in comparison with what some considered centre right new labour opponents cringe at the suggestion of more public engaged decision making brexit a brazen exposure of this resistance yet not all populism is so negative the rise of switzerland as a federal state began on 12 september 1848 in response to a 27 day civil war the sonderbundskrieg the constitution which was heavily influenced by the united states constitution and the ideas of the french revolution was modified several times during the following decades and wholly replaced in 1999 switzerland features a system of government not seen in any other nation direct representation sometimes called half direct democracy this may be arguable because theoretically the sovereign of switzerland is actually its entire electorate referenda on the most important laws have been used since the 1848 constitution amendments to the federal constitution of switzerland the joining of international organizations or changes to federal laws that have no foundation in the constitution but will remain in force for more than one year must be approved by the majority of both the people and the cantons a double majority any citizen may challenge a law that has been passed by parliament if that person is able to gather 50 000 signatures against the law within 100 days a national vote has to be scheduled where voters decide by a simple majority of the voters whether to accept or reject the

terrorists when trying to combat the excessive officially endorsed violence to wipe them out from one of the most overtly corrupt governments yet they have long been non violent gaining attention on a global level through their convention called the intercontinental encounter for humanity and against neoliberalism the zapatistas were able to help initiate a united platform for other anti neoliberal

everyday spanish people in major cities if they have heard of la pah and they shrug protests and movements like these that happened in many affluent european countries attended by millions of concerned citizens can be added to the revolts and coups that happened across the middle east turning into suppressions and all out civil war as in syria the most recent eruptions in capitalist communist china s hong kong some places remain off the media radar such as across africa but how many examples do we need like myanmar darfur yemen kuwait displacement by force is the quickest way to disempower as well as turn other nations against powerless refugees revolts are segregated and dismissed as minority isolated events for fear of unsettling further the conforming economic and political climate cordon cauterise and disempower anything but stitch them together in addition to the above it would be unwise to dismiss the potency and usefulness of online campaigns such as

could now become one of those movements sharing inspiring and informative specific information to empower everyday people of all ages unless they become demoralised and subdued as the occupy movement was it remains an inspiring and useful counter culture this will not go un noticed by capitalists so we need a way to combine self interests one of those being profitability speech about profit and economic growth being filthy words is simply well intended but unimaginative and somewhat moralistic fly swatting if plans to save the planet mean reforming monetary economic processes that predominantly employ immoral methods of reward then we are looking to the wrong people when will they ever change who will decide then police and enforce this economic morality a more constructive question would be what would they change for actually we need rapid growth industries in eco technology carbon neutrality and what we term ethical engineering and product development and in many other sectors so it has to come from another source and why should not all of that effort constitute a profitable market one that not only eclipses monetary capitalism but engages and offers capitalists

are successful non monetary economies a chance for everyone the parallel non monetary economy examines 70 of these varied and imaginative exchange methods and networks additional ones are covered in david boyle s funny money a search for alternative cash time dollars is the most widespread and successful non monetary sharing network its founder lawyer economist and academic tutor edgar s cahn

altering their ethics in a way money did not previously in some african countries people trade exchanging mobile phone credit where no cash outlets exist other economies print their own notes such as sods bricks groats and olivers or use air miles potatoes corn in fact if you wished to you could make a non monetary economy from waste products all it takes is a consensus and outlets that see a mutual benefit to take monetary dependency out of some transactions wir bank is one circular non monetary economy worth considering in our context as it embodies some of the principles that make a global non monetary economy possible wir is a complementary currency system in switzerland that serves sme mainly in hospitality construction manufacturing retail and professional services businesses can buy from one another without using swiss francs however wir is often used in combination with swiss franc in dual currency transactions wir now has over 60 000 users 45 000 smes and 15 000 employers or owners together they generate a 10 figure annual turnover wir units enter circulation when being lent by the bank to an account holder they are out of circulation when that loan is repaid the primary way accounting for the bulk of wir is through loans granted through the wir bank a secondary option is through an overdraft facility with predetermined terms one wir franc always equals the value of one swiss franc but wir credit cannot be redeemed for swiss francs this design criterion guarantees that money remains within the cooperative circle wir credit is purely electronic since 1995 it is possible to make payments using a single plastic charge card rather than using cheques in 2008 internet banking became available notwithstanding its major achievements wir suffers from some significant limitations in the first place it is not convertible to other units this is a usual problem with mutual credit based currencies until recently the technology was not available many people do not even consider it a problem they will claim that non convertibility is actually a strength as it forces participants to shop within the network however non convertibility damages liquidity as a result many businesses accept only a certain percentage in wir another problem is that consumers are not serviced businesses cannot pay their employers in wir for instance just think of what is possible leaving these limitations behind anthony migchels the swiss wir or how to defeat the money power 19 april 2012 according to a report by neweconomy net 21 06 19 across the world there are already 693 public banks which own assets worth us 37 72 trillion this is a mere smattering of what s available already nothing new under the sun but all these movements show it is possible to leave the limitations and precious time wasters behind taking qualities from all these currencies utilizing existing and developing technology and appropriating even capitalist ingenuity and greed means a global purely electronic parallel non monetary economy currency suggests something tangible or of value or accounting exchange is possible even if it is formed unilaterally and remains distinct in each locality the possibility remains to stitch these methods together into a global force re incentivizing monetary economic policies without having to touch them decided upon by the empowered mobilized trading power of the 99 majority this can be achieved within a few short years paul mason contextualized the impermanence of capitalism in post capitalism a guide to our future jeremy rifkin wrote about the marginal zero cost society and the rise of anti capitalism noam chomsky profit over people neoliberalism and the global order harry cleaver examined rupturing the dialectic the struggle against work money and financialisation and bernard steigler s the neganthropocene all address these stark warnings of crises to come but not with hopelessness and intransigence a chance for everyone the parallel non monetary economy examines these options and path finds how to go about removing the obstacles these authors movements and the current neoliberal monetary economy present making it happen firstly all these movements mentioned above including the vast network of new economic model organizations already conferencing issues surrounding capitalism with all extended networks supporters and memberships numbering into millions should combine and conference what can be achieved with a parallel non monetary economy they should unpack how it works practically what its projected impact will be and invite the un and governmental representatives but mainly provide opportunity for everyday people to sign up for it to simply choose it as a majority bargaining power then go about setting it up without corporate and political backing they will either follow or be forced to recognize its superiority when they see its achievements then the excellent guidelines and methods suggested by farid a khavari concluding towards a zero cost economy and kate rowarth s doughnut economics both incidentally dealing with the monetary economy not non monetary and advancements covered in the french film demain tomorrow can be used by any party wanting to collectively take back control and finally imagine a non party parliament or congress with individuals voted in for their track record and skills not political shenanigans and if politicians want those jobs imagine they have no party to please or battle but for once truly represent the majority decision and act at the country s behest the non monetary economy rewarding all currently unpaid abstract labour and voluntary work makes a logistical way to accommodate this possible both locally and nationally using the whole range of everyday people for consultation in fact far more is accomplishable including compensation to individuals and businesses for past losses due to tax misuse and waste or governmental mis information and politically induced prejudice the only way to address post truth paul mason concluded the 99 are coming to save us but i suggest not by the fourth industrial revolution still inhibited by monetary motives and employment conflicts but by a fifth eco industrial revolution radicalizing global employment economy and politics powered by everyday people everywhere no longer repressed by monetary dependency and its global out of control system this is not rose tinted glasses half full it is the parallel realty neoliberalism has caused and is now outnumbered by oh and one more thing not only is all this possible but there is a single institution that already does some of this to a small degree with a simple twist of its existing practices nothing new under the sun it could facilitate the whole global non monetary economy far more rapidly whilst keeping it separate from the monetary market these potentials give every individual scope for not only redressing injustices

menafn gulf times the us economy has entered its 11th year of uninterrupted expansion breaking the previous record for the longest period of growth in american history without a recession but far from celebrating many economists conclude from this unprecedented performance that a recession is now overdue if not immediately then surely before the 2020 presidential election fortunately for the us economy but sadly for president donald trump s opponents the idea that economic expansions have some kind of natural lifespan and then die of old age has neither empirical nor theoretical support history shows that us expansions since the end of world war ii have varied in length from 12 months to 120 months with no sign of mean reversion moreover it can be argued that the 18 year period from 19822000 was really one continuous economic upswing interrupted only briefly by the spike in oil prices caused by iraq s invasion of kuwait and there are clearer instances of advanced economies that have avoided recessions for much longer than the 10 year record the united states has just surpassed australia is now in its 28th year without a recession and the united kingdom experienced 17 years of uninterrupted growth from 19922008 unlike the us both australia and the uk are more recession prone because of their dependence on commodities finance and property speculation economic principles are equally unhelpful to advocates of the overdue recession theory the normal condition of any reasonably well managed market economy since the invention of active demand management policies in the 1940s is to continue expanding at around its trend rate of growth roughly 2 in the us in the postwar period recessions have generally resulted from three causes substantial monetary or fiscal tightening in response to inflationary pressures some kind of financial crisis such as the subprime mortgage collapse of 2008 and the technology bust of 2000 or a massive external shock that vastly increased energy prices until one of these events occurs we can be fairly confident that the us expansion will not just die of old age why then are so many economists now worried about a us recession and convinced that financial markets are underestimating the downside risks to economic growth the main reasons are the us china trade war and a financial warning signal the inverted yield curve the first risk is obvious the second requires some explanation an inverted yield curve is a relatively unusual condition that occurs when long term bond yields fall below short term interest rates in the us the overnight federal funds rate is around 2 4 but 10 year yields recently fell to below 2 such an inversion is often cited as a signal of imminent recession but it shouldn t be the signal often comes years before the recession it claims to predict more important bond market pricing has drastically changed in the decade since the global financial crisis bond yields have become increasingly divorced from real economic conditions partly because of quantitative easing and regulatory pressures on pension funds to buy bonds regardless of economic conditions but mainly because inflation seems to have decoupled from unemployment and growth even if the decoupling of growth and inflation ultimately turns out to be illusory the mere fact that the us federal reserve and other central banks believe that the old growth inflation linkage is broken means that they will keep interest rates much lower for much longer than in previous economic cycles as long as central bankers continue to behave like this bond yields will continue to reflect investors expectations about what central banks will do with short term interest rates rather than their expectations about economic prospects or recession risks the main message from financial markets as i argued in april is not that the us is near a recession it is simply that the fed is preparing to cut interest rates if that happens and it almost certainly will a us recession will become less likely not more so the same is true in china the chinese government and central bank have responded to trump s trade war albeit somewhat belatedly by cutting interest rates and reserve requirements reducing taxes ramping up public spending and easing credit restraints china s stimulus measures like the fed s expected easing will take some time to feed through into economic data but these measures virtually guarantee that the us china trade war will cause only limited damage to growth prospects in both countries at least in the next year or two which is the time horizon over which macroeconomic policies operate a much more serious threat to the world economy comes from europe an innocent bystander in the us china trade war that has already suffered far more than either of the belligerents when the international monetary fund revised its 2019 growth projections in april to take account of the problems that emerged in late 2018 the forecasts for china and the us were essentially unchanged despite their trade war up 0 1 percentage point in china down 0 2 in the us but the imf downgraded its growth forecast for germany by 1 1 percentage points by 0 9 for italy and by 0 6 for the eurozone as a whole europe has been the main victim of the us china trade war for the same reason it was the main victim of the 2008 financial crisis which also originated in the us while the us and china are stimulating their economies to counteract the trade slowdown the european authorities are as usual responding with exactly the wrong policies instead of easing monetary fiscal or credit policies the eurozone response is pro cyclical the european commission is trying to force italy to reduce public spending and raise taxes germany s finance ministry is using lower than expected budget surpluses as an excuse to squeeze investment and delay tax cuts and bank supervisors are forcing banks to tighten their credit standards increase loss provisions and cut lending to preserve capital such policies condemned europe to spend most of the post crisis period in recession or near recession while the us and china enjoyed a decade of uninterrupted growth if similarly foolish policies are maintained the same thing will happen again project syndicate anatole kaletsky is chief economist and co chairman of gavekal dragonomics and the

persistent undershoot of inflation with inflationary pressures muted the fed has more cover to act decisively to stave off a more pronounced slowdown we expect it to cut rates 25 bps at the july meeting and another 25 bps before the end of the year likely in october fed positions for rate cut the fed kept rates unchanged this week but opened the door to easing later this year by noting the heightened uncertainty to the economic outlook and the persistent undershoot of inflation seven committee members expected the year end fed funds rate to be 50 bps lower one expected it to be 25 bps lower and eight projected the fed s benchmark rate would remain unchanged one member also expected a hike while uber dove james bullard called for an immediate cut marking the first dissent of the powell era much more noteworthy is the fact that this meeting marked the first time the fomc has forecast any sort of cut since it began making its formalized summary of economic projections publicly available in 2012 those projections were not materially changed however with gdp and inflation forecasts shaved down modestly instead driving the dovish tilt at the fed is the uncertainty surrounding that outlook stemming mostly from ongoing trade negotiations and weakening global growth moreover with inflationary pressures muted the fed has more cover to act decisively to stave off a more pronounced slowdown powell dropped mention of inflation being transitory a word he used nearly a dozen times at the last fomc press conference a mere seven weeks ago as well as the need for patience and data dependence signaling what we believe to be a willingness to cut rates at the first sign of trouble indeed powell identified an overarching goal of sustaining the economic expansion as such the dots and press conference comments support our view that the fed will cut rates 25 bps in july and another 25 bps likely in october the bond market has really let the doves fly anticipating more than 75 bps of cuts by the end of 2019 underlying all of this including our overall macro forecast is trade which we expect to go unresolved for the foreseeable future presidents trump and xi will meet next week in japan as part of the g20 meeting ostensibly to reach a deal while a deal is not in our forecast a sooner than expected resolution to trade hostilities would dispel much uncertainty and likely obviate the need for a return to monetary policy easing in an economy with a 3 6 unemployment rate and a stock market at an all time high an unexpected deterioration or improvement in the trade arena could dramatically move the needle in either direction for the fed leading us to think markets are a bit too convinced of the magnitude of future easing yet with trade perhaps the most appropriate course of action is to expect the unexpected we also got a look at some of the most cyclical portions of the economy this week the housing market one of the primary transmission mechanisms for monetary policy continues to get a bit of a reprieve from drastically lower mortgage rates but has not meaningfully re accelerated while existing home sales are still down 1 1 over the year sales rose 2 5 in may and are trending in the right direction housing starts fell 0 9 in may and remain 5 3 below their prior year pace on a year to date basis the nahb builder confidence survey fell two points likely on fears of a prolonged trade war driving materials prices higher purchasing manager surveys plummeted this month with the empire manufacturing and philly fed indices dropping 26 4 the largest drop on record and 16 3 respectively u s outlook new home sales tuesday the sharp drop in mortgage rates this past month would normally be a panacea to a housing market that has stumbled under the weight of diminished affordability unfortunately we believe even the latest drop in mortgage rates which has seen rates on conventional 30 year mortgages fall below 4 may not be enough to overcome the rising anxiety among potential homebuyers who sense that lingering trade tensions are putting economic growth at risk while new construction is expected to gradually ramp back up this year we are still looking for modest gains we look for new home sales to rise 1 0 in may to an annualized rate of 680 000 for full year 2019 we look for new single family construction to climb 1 9 off a much larger and more inclusive base a larger proportion of new home construction will focus on more affordable product which are homes priced close to or below the median for a metro area previous 673k wells fargo 680k consensus 685k durable goods orders wednesday durable goods orders declined for the second time over the past there months in april underscoring the challenges trade policy

makers will closely monitor incoming data like durable goods orders for clues to any detrimental impact associated with trade policy uncertainty previous 2 1 wells fargo 0 2 consensus 0 3 month over month personal spending friday following a soft start to the year consumer spending picked up measurably in march and april with the two month gain as strong as the economy has seen in seven years even as real consumer spending was unchanged in april it is nonetheless set up for a significant rebound in the second quarter indeed the real spending level in april was up an annualized 2 2 above the q1 average and supports our call for strong consumer spending growth in q2 this solid spending gain will provide significant underlying support to q2 gdp growth which is likely to be restrained by a wider trade deficit and less inventory building a close eye will be kept on the pce deflator following chair powell s comments associated with this week s fomc meeting emphasizing risks to the outlook the fomc downgraded inflation expectations for 2019 and 2020 any further weakness in core inflation would support expectations for a july fed rate cut previous 0 3 wells fargo 0 4 consensus 0 5 month over month global review ecb signals policy easing ahead european central bank ecb president draghi caught markets off guard when he suggested in a speech this week that the central bank would likely ease monetary policy in the relatively near term we now think the ecb will cut rates deeper into negative territory in september and change its forward guidance although at this time we do not expect the central bank to restart its asset purchase program the bank of japan also met this week and signaled it was flexible on its yield target while the bank of england kept rates steady and acknowledged increased downside risks ecb s draghi springs a dovish surprise european central bank ecb president draghi caught markets off guard this week with an announcement that suggested the central bank was likely to ease monetary policy in the relatively near term specifically draghi noted that in the absence of improvement such that the sustained return of inflation to our aim is threatened additional stimulus will be required importantly draghi s comments suggest that the economic data need to improve to avoid further policy easing effectively making it more likely the central bank will ease policy the change in guidance comes as eurozone growth has continued to underwhelm and core inflation has showed signs of softening moreover market based inflation expectations have moved sharply lower recently although draghi s comments appear to have led to some stabilization top chart the ecb has a few policy measures in its toolkit if it decides to ease monetary policy including forward guidance interest rate cuts and renewed asset purchases in our view rate cuts are the most likely first order means by which the ecb will ease policy including a change in forward guidance to accompany that rate move specifically we expect the ecb to cut its deposit rate and its main refinancing rate by 10 bps to 0 50 and 0 10 respectively in september the ecb s current forward guidance is that rates will remain at current levels through h1 2020 but we would expect the ecb to change its language such that it now sees rates at present levels or lower and perhaps remove any time based guidance such that the commitment is more open ended asset purchases are less likely at this time in our view although we note the risk of a larger 20 bp rate cut in september or an additional 10 bp rate cut in december on a more positive note we learned this week that the eurozone services pmi recovered further to 53 4 in june while the manufacturing pmi remained in contraction territory the eurozone economy is primarily a services economy and thus it appears the bulk of the economy is growing if only moderately elsewhere the bank of japan boj met this week and made no changes to monetary policy although it acknowledged that it was flexible on its target range for the 10 year japanese government bond jgb yield currently set at 0 20 bps the yield is within a few bps of the bottom end of the range 0 20 and defending that level could entail outright sales of jgbs by the boj which would likely run counter to the central bank s messaging of powerful monetary easing finally the bank of england boe also announced policy this week and held its bank rate at 0 75 but acknowledged that the downside risks to the outlook had increased the central bank also noted that the probability of a nodeal exit had likely increased which markets perceived as a tepid acknowledgement that the boe may have a hard time raising rates in the coming quarters as the brexit process and the associated uncertainty drags on we still expect boe hikes next year but the risk is certainly skewed toward fewer hikes than we expect or no hikes at all particularly if there is no resolution to brexit by october or if the u k leaves the e u without a deal global outlook mexico central bank decision thursday monetary policy in mexico is especially tight at present with the nominal policy rate at 8 25 and core inflation of just under 4 suggesting the real policy rate is above 4 00 against this backdrop of restrictive monetary policy economic growth in mexico has been sluggish as real gdp grew just 1 2 year over year in the first quarter interest rate sensitive sectors have been particularly weak including gross fixed investment spending which fell 2 4 from a year earlier in march the central bank is widely expected to shift to an easing bias in the not too distant future but has thus far continued to convey a hawkish message in recent policy announcements however now that u s tariffs on mexico are no longer an immediate threat and the peso has stabilized the central bank may feel more comfortable backing away from its hawkish stance and slowly starting to signal rate cuts previous 8 25 consensus 8 25 eurozone cpi friday core inflation in the eurozone has been stuck right around 1 0 for several years now and despite recent increases in wage growth core inflation has yet to show any signs that it is ready to move higher persistent undershoots of the ecb s inflation target below but close to 2 may be feeding through to weakness in inflation expectations indeed the 5 year 5 year forward inflation swap a market based measure of inflation expectations often cited by the ecb reached new all time lows around 1 1 matching the average core cpi inflation rate since 2010 however those expectations snapped higher after ecb president draghi suggested that further stimulus may be coming if the economic situation does not improve his comments suggest that if growth and inflation do not materially improve the ecb is likely to cut interest rates we expect a 10 bp cut in september however core cpi inflation will be a key metric to watch next week for further clues on future ecb actions previous 0 8 consensus 1 0 year over year canada gdp friday canada s economy has slowed considerably over the past year or so as oil prices have generally moved lower and the housing market has cooled real gdp rose just 0 4 on a sequential annualized basis in the first quarter after growing just 0 3 in the prior quarter however the details of the q1 print were better than the headline as final domestic demand rebounded solidly on stronger consumer spending and fixed investment spending gdp data for april are released next week and will provide insight into the performance of the economy as q2 kicks off this week s softer than expected retail sales report for april suggests some modest downside risk for the consensus estimate for april gdp growth of 0 2

generally delivered dovish comments ecb president draghi gave a speech on tuesday in which he addressed the topic on why inflation remains well below the ecb s target the statement that received the most press was further cuts in policy rates remain part of our tools in other words the ecb is prepared to take rates further into negative territory accordingly we expect that at its september 12 policy meeting the governing council will reduce the ecb s deposit rate to 0 50 from 0 40 and its two week refinancing rate to 0 10 from 0 00 top chart see the report we wrote this week for more details the ecb was not the only major central bank generating headlines this week as widely expected the federal open market committee fomc decided on wednesday to leave its target range for the federal funds rate unchanged between 2 25 and 2 50 but the committee indicated that it could be easing policy in the not too distant future the fomc acknowledged that uncertainties to its economic outlook have increased and the committee stated that it will closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion we interpret this wording as a signal that the fed will cut rates at the first sign of trouble there were also important changes to the so called dot plot one committee member looks for rates to be 25 bps lower by the end of the year and seven members expect that rates will be 50 bps lower at the end of 2019 middle chart previously no committee members looked for rates to be lower at the end of the year we expect that the fomc will cut its target range for the fed funds rate 25 bps at its next meeting on july 31 and by another 25 bps in the fourth quarter probably at the october 30 meeting bottom chart this forecast depends at least in part on the assumptions we have made regarding u s trade policy see our monthly economic outlook for more details credit market insights rates down refinancing up mortgage applications dropped 3 4 this week after a 26 8 surge last week according to the mortgage bankers association while the weekly application rate is a volatile index last week s surge was the highest percentage increase since january 2015 the surge was concentrated in the refinancing portion of the index as homeowners took advantage of lower rates lower rates have also supported purchases however which year to date are outpacing the prior nine years indeed the conventional 30 year fixed mortgage rate dropped below 4 this month suggesting consumers can expect favorable home buying conditions to extend into the summer this is consistent with consumer sentiment toward buying a home according to the preliminary results of the university of michigan s survey of consumers the good time to buy a home measure improved 17 points to 147 this month the largest one month gain since 2013 but will favorable home buying conditions necessarily translate to increased purchasing limited home supply may add to the affordability issue of consumers according to corelogic investors accounted for 11 of u s home purchasers in 2018 with increased competition for single family homes weighing on medianpriced supply the affordability issue may cap the extent of a rebound in home sales still while we expect a modest rebound in sales this year what we see as more likely is consumers who have seen only modest wage growth take advantage of low rates to refinance their homes topic of the week should we worry about american debt part ii in the second report of our series on american debt we conclude that a downturn in the u s economy caused by financial stress in the household sector does not seem likely in the foreseeable future indeed the financial health of consumers has improved but still the rise in auto and student debt could have adverse effects at least at the margin on certain individuals and specific areas of consumer spending in coming years even though combined household debt has increased by 15 trillion in the past decade low long term interest rates a thriving stock market and tight credit spreads point to few signs of current financial stress the household balance sheet shows liabilities rising 1 6 trillion from 2008 but a holistic view shows that household net worth has risen by about 48 trillion today s lower financial obligations and household debt to income ratios are also improvements to be considered since 2008 auto loans have grown by 500 billion largely due to more originations to individuals with fico scores less than 660 the risk profile of new auto loans has remained unchanged but from 2015 2018 origination of loans to this subset increased 200 billion per annum the amount of outstanding auto loans stands at nearly 1 3 trillion but is not close to that of residential mortgage debt which exceeded 9 trillion at the height of the housing bubble in the case of a wave of defaults auto loans would not be as detrimental to the economy as residential mortgage debt was 10 years ago student loans have also sharply increased to 1 5 trillion today from 600 billion circa 2008 as with auto loans the mere magnitude of student loan debt does not compare to that of residential mortgages a decade ago and is not likely to bring the u s economy to its knees that said for certain individuals and segments of the economy there could be adverse implications since student loans are responsible for 35 of the outstanding debt owed by individuals age 18 29 years old since qualifying for mortgages or auto loans is more difficult with high debt loads headwinds could be exerted on the housing and auto markets and credit issues could arise due to delinquencies from these student loans in our next report we will evaluate debt in the non financial corporate debt stay tuned
president volodymyr zelensky promised ukrainian business leaders to liberalize the economy and improve business climate the national bank decided on a historic step to abolish the mandatory sale by exporters of foreign exchange proceeds the state budget was replenished by eur 1 billion after a successful placement of foreign government bonds while the statistics agency improved the outlook for gdp growth in the first quarter these are main economic news of the outgoing week amid summer heat and vacations for many ukrainians this week featured plenty of important economic developments on thursday june 20 president of ukraine volodymyr zelensky held a large meeting with ukrainian business leaders where he voiced a number of program promises on further liberalization of the national economy acceleration of privatization and deregulation of business many rounds of applause were heard that day as the ukrainian leader spoke видео дня zelensky started off by praising the national bank for preserving macrofinancial stability and promised to respect and protect the regulator s independence the president also said that he had canceled more than 160 decrees of his predecessors which hindered operations of businesses most of these decrees were issued during the cadence of leonid kuchma and then viktor yanukovych who later fled the country in disgrace among the abolished decisions was the one on the minimum amount of payments to notaries which will help reduce the cost of registration of real estate transactions as well as the fines for violation of regulations for cash registers operations by the way such cash register inspections traditionally were a headache for ukrainian businesses according to the state fiscal service in 2018 the agency conducted almost 17 000 inspections which resulted in the companies being fined uah 940 million at the same time violations were established in 100 of the cases that is every visit of tax authorities ended in a fine zelensky voiced an ambitious goal for the country to enter in three or four years the top 10 in doing business ranking over the previous three years ukraine has strengthened its position there having climbed to 71st spot from the 83rd position currently ukraine is one of the leaders in terms of growth rates in the ranking among other important promises voiced by president is the intention to pursue the european course of the state and cooperation with the key creditor of ukraine the international monetary fund zelensky set a goal in the next five years to join the european digital market and the unified energy system of the eu the head of state focused on the need to form a positive image of ukraine abroad so that there was a line of investors in our country i decided to invest in ukraine the most expensive thing i have which is my time and i urge all of you to do the same invest in ukraine said the president according to zelensky improving business climate in ukraine will also be facilitated by tax amnesty on preferential terms after which it will be possible to seriously consider introducing an exit capital tax and having it replace the existing profit tax however zelensky did not elaborate on the timeframe for such tax reform we are well aware that very often ukrainian businesses would withdraw money from the country not because they have a good life here but because of corruption pressure and a natural desire to simply protect their assets the president noted zelensky announced large scale privatization of state assets protection of competition and restrictions for monopolies as well as strengthening the fight against corruption in judiciary the president also supported demilitarization of units of the state fiscal service and the creation of the state financial investigation service with an emphasis on analytical work besides he suggested that the verkhovna rada deprive the sbu security service of ukraine of unnatural functions to have it deal with spies and saboteurs rather than businesses zelensky also announced his intention to lift administrative bans which are in fact remnants of soviet regulation it is the lifting of bans on certain activities such as gambling as well as restrictions on the disposal of currency and land by the way the head of state supported the launch of the land market since 2020 as noted by business representatives the promises voiced if fulfilled will indeed be able to improve business climate in ukraine and as a result accelerate growth of the national economy nbu s historic decision another important event for businesses this past week was the historic decision of the national bank of ukraine to cancel the mandatory sale of foreign currency proceeds by exporters thus the banking regulator made another revolutionary move on the path to forex liberalization the nbu press service noted that the abolition of the mandatory sale of foreign exchange proceeds will not have a negative impact on macro financial stability as in recent years with the standard sale of mandatory sales at 50 and its reduction to 30 businesses generally sold over 90 of the currency received the national bank stressed that the abolition of the mandatory sale of foreign currency is another step toward the free movement of capital as one of the strategic goals of the regulator such restrictions were naphthalene of the soviet past where the state had created artificial restrictions to prevent citizens from making independent decisions and freely managing their funds after all for example if the exporter intended to allocate the proceeds for the acquisition beyond ukraine of any materials and components using foreign currency it did not make sense to transfer the proceeds to hryvnia then exchange them for euros and at the same time also lose on the exchange rate difference business instantly responded to this gift from the regulator as the press service of the european business association noted entrepreneurs have been waiting for the corresponding simplification of currency legislation for more than twenty years this is another step towards full monetary liberalization and ensuring free movement of capital in accordance with the eu ukraine association agreement in addition this is an absolutely normal practice with which the whole world is guided said ihor hotsyk the association representative the steps taken towards liberalization and deregulation have a positive effect on financial stability in the state incidentally on tuesday june 18 the nbu presented a report on financial stability in june according to which system risks are currently at one of the lowest levels in history while macroeconomic conditions are favorable for banks at the same time the national bank still considers one of the key threats to financial stability in ukraine litigation over privatbank and the protracted pause in cooperation with the international monetary fund state budget replenished by eur 1 bln those were not all of this week s positive economic news on thursday the ministry of finance reported that ukraine had received funds from the placement of external government loan bonds in the amount of eur 1 billion with a yield of 6 75 per annum maturing in june 20 2026 this placement of securities marked ukraine s return to the borrowing market in euros after a fifteen year pause the bonds were mainly bought by asset management funds as well as foreign pension and insurance funds in terms of geography most of the bonds were acquired by investors from the united kingdom the usa germany and some other eu countries another important news of the outgoing week was the revision of ukraine s gdp growth estimates the state statistics service improved its previous outlook of economy growth in the first quarter of 2019 in annual terms up to 2 5 from 2 2 voiced previously and although the figure exceeds the previously published one it is still lower than the in the previous quarter 3 5 at the same time ukraine continues to show the highest growth of nominal gdp in europe due to the growth of incomes of the population thus nominal gdp for the first three months of 2019 amounted to uah 807 8 billion while gdp per capita was at uah 19 200 in the last week of june the state statistics service will publish may stats on industrial enterprises performance legislators will prepare for the early parliamentary elections scheduled for july 21 while ordinary ukrainians will continue to enjoy hot summer days nadiia burbela
menafn dailyfx g20 talking points the dollar marked a critical trend break through its 200dma this past week while thes p 500lost traction at its record highs monetary policy has been the most productive charge this past week but we will find its influence put to the test next week growth and trade war concerns will be put to the test in the week ahead particularly through the g20 summit through week s end see how retail traders are positioning in s p 500 goldand dollar based majors along with the other key fx pairs indices and oil intraday usingthe dailyfx speculative positioning data on the sentiment page will monetary policy continue to drive markets next week following my number one rule for fundamental analysis determining what is the most pressing motivation for the largest swath of the market i m left with the sense that we will see the speculative gears retooled over the coming week we are passing out of a week in which it was explicitly clear that monetary policy was the principle driver for the fx and capital markets alike if it weren t for the federal reserve s rate decision and forecasts the markets may have struggled for any kind of significant movement in benchmark assets what is particularly unusual about the charge for the likes of the s p 500 which pushed a record high is the consideration that the us central bank was not even that aggressive in its actual views and the markets paid far less attention to more overt commitments made by other groups as a driver of speculative interests traders should be mindful of hanging their expectations on the shoulders of groups like thefomc there are far fewer scheduled updates expected on the systemic aspect of the topic next week but there will also likely be intense interest in the many fed officials speeches scheduled anchored by powell s address chart of aggregate central bank balance sheets and s p 500 monthly while event risk catalysts are fleeting there is good reason to believe that a particularly important docket item in the week ahead will stir systemic interest in a frequent driver for the financial markets the g 20 summit the two day meeting in previous years has had few critical points to touch upon for which markets actually cared nowadays this meeting will act as a definitive progress report on numerous global issues trouble over the tempered pace of global growth and the tension between the us and iran will certainly be important items but it is trade wars which will draw the closest scrutiny for updates in the past few months the tension increased dramatically and then it has seemingly eased sharply just these past few weeks we have seen a list of threats made by the us against europe fade and a usmca deal is no longer being held up by the threat of a 5 percent tax on all mexican imports levied by the trump administration for a week the real interest is in the relationship between the us and china there is still the open threat made by the white house to expand its 25 percent tariff on chinese goods to encompass all of the country s shipments is progress is not made yet the language on both sides has recently thawed that said businesses are signaling they are accumulating pain and the us added 5 new countries to its entity list just on friday there is a lot of deserved uncertainty here chart of huawei overlaid withusdcnhin red daily ultimately the fundamental jumps we have received from a dovish turn in monetary policy and fostered hope that trade wars are soon to end represent only transient boosts to enthusiasm to permanently close the yawning gap between the level of risk taking and the tangible value to be found in the open market we need to restore a reliable foundation for economic expansion through the past week we were met with a number of downgrades in forecasted activity through entities like central banks and data reinforced a faltering trajectory the june pmis released on friday showed japan manufacturing further slowed and the united states own factory activity hit its slowest pace of expansion in nearly 10 years the euro area measures offered a measure of improvement over the previous month but these figures alone aren t changing the potential of the global economy chart of s p 500 and a risk reward index weekly the speculative intensity behind the dollar and us indices if we are looking for a definitive barometer as to which critical theme is at the helm of market trends there is unfortunately no consistently reliable measure for which we can rely that said there are certain assets that can better represent the specific measures that we have recently struggled with the dollar is arguably at the center of all the major fundamental concerns in monetary policy terms the fed s weight is even greater now than it has been in the past decade thanks to its effort to normalize while others trailed far behind in the meantime the us is the instigator for the vast majority of trades wars currently ongoing and it is unclear as to what scenario could actually confer benefit to the currency moving forward the state of economic expansion is frequently judged on a global basis through a singular review of the us itself at is this crossroads that makes the bearing of the greenback so remarkable a dominant theme or rare convergence of outcomes between them can drive theusdhigher or lower as it happens this past week s tumble represents the worst week s performance since february 2018 that swell in activity was likely necessary to finally drive thedxythrough 13 month channel support and the 200 day moving average while the benchmark currency is facing a potentially critical break it is still an uphill battle to overcome the shackles that have restricted this benchmark to its smallest 60 day historical range as a percentage of price on record chart of dxy dollar index and 3 month historical range weekly where the us currency is a more balanced measure of bullish or bearish developments on these critical themes the s p 500 dowand us indices are dramatically skewed this particular segment of the financial system has reflected a clear bias towards favorable developments that appetite has created a clear outperformance relative to global equities emerging markets yields and other traditional measures yet the extent of that disparity is hard to fully appreciate until we hit key milestones as we did this past week the s p 500 rose to a record high on a close basis thursday and an intraday measure through friday this seems to be a response to the combined influence of a market certain of impending fed rate cuts and anticipation of a trade resolution between the two largest economies next week these outcomes are far from certain but far more troubling is the consideration as to whether these scenarios would genuinely confer the kind of benefit that seems to be assumed thematic measures like gold and oil versus discreet flash points like kiwi and swiss franc while the benchmark currency and preferred asset in global portfolios are good filters for sentiment my favorite skewed lens for our particular conditions remains gold the precious metal mounted an incredible four day charge to round out the single best week s rally for the market since april 2016 in the process of this charge the commodity took out resistance on a six year long congestion resistance what was the source of this run while some may put the responsibility solely on the dollar s slide the true scale of the move reflects on the broad devaluation of traditional currencies as the world s largest central banks have collective reversed course back into an overt dovish perspective whileeurusdwill rise or fall as the title of least aggressive dove changes hands from a perspective outside of their relative influence we are seeing a universal depreciation of currency that leaves few viable options aside from gold if we were to add risk aversion to this mix it would likely hasten the return to 2011 s record highs another commodity that draws different explanations for influence but which reflects a more systemic issue iscrude oil while most superficial evaluations of the market consistently refer to regular inventory figures good sometimes for volatility but not trend the more consistent motivator has been affixed to demand global growth has clearly flagged and addition of risk aversion over previous weeks had painted a more effective picture now with the dow and peers jumping the picture is once again blurred yet as it happens i believe that supply is temporarily back in the driver s seat the news this past week that iran had shot down a us drone started the distant rumblings of another war for the world s largest military skepticism naturally follows this concern given the nation s wariness for further military engagements butreports that the us was on the verge of launching a retaliatory attackbut stopped it at the last minute raises serious concerns about the probabilities around this threat of a hot war chart of us crude oil daily while there is considerable traction that can be found through those assets that represent systemic themes it is not particularly easy to get the momentum rolling on the fundamental engines that naturally makes the trades based on these fluctuating winds just as precarious as such we should consider the more measured opportunities to be found in particular areas of the market looking at the docket ahead of us thenew zealand dollarrepresents a considerable potential for volatility the rbnz reserve bank of new zealand is not expected to cut rates at the meeting join us as we cover it live when we refer to swaps markets but that in itself is a meaningful development when we consider the fed is seen as potentially cutting three times according to futures estimates i will be evaluating the kiwi crosses a little more closely next week then there is theswiss franc while the currency didn t extend its run at the same tempo friday eurchfwas still lingering below critical support seemingly defended over the past few years the snb swiss national bank has stated

the political analyst pointed out that gold tends to go higher when there s a global economic downturn wars have erupted or an international crises is causing the destabilisation of the global world order gold is a safe haven investment mcgregor noted beijing is worried us china ties could get worse so the pboc has jumped to stockpile its gold reserves the us china trade war has been simmering since march 2018 when donald trump announced the introduction of high tariffs on steel and aluminium since then washington and beijing agreed upon a trade truce that was abruptly broken by the us on 10 may when the sino american negotiations ended without any sort of deal being reached now the world is awaiting the g20 summit in osaka japan wondering whether the two largest economies will meet at the negotiating table buy the yuan not gold if us and china strike new trade deal meanwhile gold may become the sole winner in the us china trade war as the yellow metal s price is steadily soaring according to billionaire investor paul tudor jones in two separate interviews given to bloomberg and cnbc the fed is likely to cut interest rates in 2019 due to the us china trade war which would result in the weakening of the us dollar and the strengthening of gold i think one of the best trades is gonna be gold if i had to pick my favourite for the next 12 to 24 months it d probably be gold jones told bloomberg on 12 june predicting that if it hit 1 400 it would quickly move to 1 700 on 21 june the precious metal burst past 1 400 per ounce reaching the highest level since september 2013 and could keep climbing still mcgregor believes that the spike in the yellow metal s prices may be halted and even reversed if us president donald j trump and chinese president xi jinping meet at the upcoming g20 and have fruitful talks the beijing based journalist noted that if the us finds itself dragged into a direct conflict with iran one would also see gold soaring even higher above 2 000 an ounce if tensions settle down in the middle east we can see gold drop in value too he suggested yes you will see a weaker dollar if there s a us china trade agreement because beijing will ask the pboc to raise the value of the chinese yuan so that washington can t complain china will be required to narrow trade imbalances and a stronger yuan makes that easier to do so if you ask me i say buy up the yuan not gold but only if there s a us china trade deal signed sealed and delivered

appreciate it i thought we could begin by talking about how has the geopolitics of oil changed especially vis à vis russia s war in ukraine and opec s recent announcement to cut oil production kissane well first of all i d just like to say thank you so very much for having me i m really delighted i am a big fan of cfr s academic webinars so to have the opportunity to participate in this in this way is very meaningful to me so thank you so wow there is so much happening in this space the geopolitics of oil this has been a tremendous fourteen months russia s reinvasion of ukraine very much upended the geopolitics of oil because russia is a significant producer one of the top three in the world and it s you know it s caused a kind of a reshaping a kind of a remapping of the of oil geopolitics and we ve seen some you know shifts in how countries think about oil security in light of larger questions about broader energy security questions and also on top of that is the ongoing energy transition coupled with you know climate change and the need to decarbonize so there s just it s been quite a you know a year and a half that has really sort of put energy security and oil security very much at the forefront of people s minds faskianos fantastic i thought maybe you had some really interesting data to show us and if you could walk us through those the trends you are seeing and really bring it to life that would be fantastic kissane sure so before i do i have a couple of slides and before i share my slides i think it s really important that sort of we understand how interconnected sort of the global energy system is and how interconnected we are when it comes to the flows of oil you know some countries are very well resourced endowed so they have oil and other countries do not so they need to import oil there s really no country in the world that doesn t need oil for larger national security issues and i think one of things that many people sort of are not necessarily aware of or think about is the amount of oil that gets produced every day so every day the world consumes over 100 million barrels a day and every day that 100 million barrels has to be has to be moved it has to be you know as part of getting it into the system getting it to its respective destinations and what we re not seeing which maybe some people may have thought that we would see at this point is we re not seeing a reduction in demand but we re seeing an expansion in demand and much of that global demand is coming out of asia and we re also of course seeing the with the reopening of china lots of really interesting questions as to what oil demand will be in china for the 2023 2024 years whether or not they will they will sort of put extra pressure on global demand and you know irina just also you know it s i m going to share this in my slides but you know last week s decision from opec to reduce production of course had an impact on the price of oil so when the decision was announced on sunday by monday morning we saw an uptick in the price it s stabilized but we are sort of looking at 80 plus a barrel oil and again lots of uncertainty as to what that s going to mean across economies that are in recessions experiencing sort of the beginnings of a recession and sort of what does it mean for the global economy where we may see sort of more energy inflation so one of the things that i really like to do when i teach the geopolitics of oil is sort of show some visuals because i think again sort of really reinforcing the interconnected nature of our global energy system but also sort of seeing where in the world is oil produced and where in the world are the are the importers and also just a couple of sort of fun pieces on what we have seen just this you know in the last week of course some of this you ll be familiar with those in the audience but this decision on the part of opec to reduce production by 1 2 million barrels a day again happening at a time not when we have an excess supply but when we re seeing a tight supply across the oil market so it came as a bit of a surprise to you know to even the most you know longstanding analysts and opec observers and again part of this is directed probably toward self interests on the part of saudi arabia and the oil producers that are really going to make the cuts but of course it also has an impact here for those of you that are sitting in the united states what does it mean then for prices that americans pay at the gas pump so the biden administration sort of came out after this decision was made in sort of being disappointed surprised that opec would make this decision now it s also important to sort of recognize that this is not just a singular opec decision this is part of now a larger opec and opec does also include russia as well as other countries like kazakhstan and mexico so the opec that we have historically known is now different because you have other countries that are not official members but nonetheless are part of what we now refer to as opec and these are the countries that are part of opec and really the country that s considered to be sort of in the driver s seat of opec is that of saudi arabia because saudi arabia is the largest producer within the opec organization producing anywhere from 10 to 11 million barrels a day venezuela has the largest reserves but it is far from being at capacity in terms of what it can what it can produce so just to kind of put that into perspective these are opec countries and their respective reserves and then non opec the united states being a non opec country but again this sort of this chart to the right shows you know again the world is consuming a little over 100 million barrels a day expected to increase over 2023 and into 2024 question marks as to when we may see peak oil demand but again to sort of link this to energy security energy security especially when it s in the context of oil security is making sure that we have adequate supply at affordable prices so when we see a reduction in supply at a time of tight markets that suggests that we re also going to see higher prices that s going to directly hit vulnerable economies and so again just to sort of point out sort of where in the world sort of are the top three oil producers the united states saudi arabia and russia russia remains in the top three canada as well our you know neighbor to the north and china is also a producer of oil the united states figure here also includes gas liquefied so liquid petroleum which the united states is endowed with a lot of both oil and natural gas and then the top oil consuming countries you have u s china and india now the united states is not the largest importer that position is now held by china but as far as consumption goes we consume over 20 million barrels a day again big question mark about china in terms of whether or not we will see higher demand coming out of china over the next year two years with china s reopening and what is being you know discussed as revenge tourism and more chinese who have accumulated a lot of savings 2 1 trillion how are they going to use that savings and whether or not after three years of being under lockdown restrictions whether or not we ll see impacts to demand and i think russia is there s lots of questions about russia and this is now we re fourteen months into you know russia s reinvasion of ukraine and i emphasize reinvasion because oftentimes we forget that you know russia invaded ukraine in 2014 but russia is still moving its oil and up until you know a few months ago its overall production and exports were as high at some points even higher than pre invasion now you have new countries that are takers of russian oil and they re buying it at discounted prices we see turkey singapore china has been a big buyer as well as india that they have been buying discounted russian oil lots of interesting questions that we could discuss about the oil price cap and seaborne embargo to europe but i think the takeaway from this slide is that russia continues to produce oil continues to sell it selling at a discounted price but there are still many countries in the world that are eager to take russian oil and again i m not going to go into this but i just love this slide to just emphasize the you know the world s pipelines these are the pipelines that help sort of the transit of oil something also that s really unique and interesting to look at is just tanker traffic so the tankers that carry oil around the world but again you know there are a lot of pipelines so twenty three two thousand three hundred and eighty one operational oil and gas pipelines again these are it s moving a lot of the oil that is consumed every day and then finally is this is you know one of the things that we oftentimes we think about the hundred million barrels a day that the world is consuming over 75 percent of the world s oil is controlled managed by state owned oil companies so saudi aramco being one pdvsa of venezuela being another but it s really important to sort of recognize the position that state owned companies have the rest is controlled or managed by international oil companies exxonmobil chevron eni total and a host of other host of other companies but again i think the you know to understand that nocs as they re referred to are very very important for understanding their role in the larger context of the geopolitics of oil and again what we saw last week coming out of opec this decision this is also being driven by state budget concerns this is again it s about the production of oil but it s also about you know governments and their budgets and oftentimes you know there is a desire to add more rather than you know more revenues rather than less so those are the slides that i have and i hope that they sort of provide some sort of context and a little bit of you know that we can discuss in the questions that i really look forward to answering from the audience faskianos thank you carolyn that was great so now we re going to go to all of you for your questions and comments gives queuing instructions all right so i m going to go to the first raised hand in the thing amadine hom go to you first and please accept the unmute yourself pause you are still muted pause ok i don t know are you there oh i think ok let s go to morton holbrook q yes good afternoon dr kissane what a shocking presentation laughs a hundred million barrels a day and it s going up notwithstanding the paris climate agreement of 2015 is that agreement simply a dead letter or is it having any effect on oil on fossil fuel production particularly oil production or what s the best scenario in terms of reducing dependence on fossil fuels considering the oil market thank you kissane well hi morton thank you so much for that excellent question yeah that s kind of why i emphasize that number is because a lot of people sort of just aren t aware of how much oil we continue to consume and again what the demand expectations are moving forward and these demand expectations are you know coming out of forecasts from the international energy agency so i think there s a big question as to when we see peak demand and you know if you look at bp scenarios they expect peak demand to happen you know before 2030 where as you know others kind of contest that they that they think that peak demand won t happen until after 2030 i mean again a lot depends on you know what we are now experiencing in the energy transition and how sort of quickly are we can we transition away from oil i think what s really critical when we re looking at oil is oftentimes we think only about the transportation sector so we re thinking about cars we re thinking about planes you know we re thinking about trucks and tankers and all these things but it s petrochemicals you know there s just a lot of oil that also goes into fertilizer so it really is across our economy and across economies across the global system one of the things that i always tell my students is even during covid where you had many countries right much of the world was experiencing some level of lockdown we did have a reduction in oil demand but it wasn t it wasn t like 20 million barrels it was under ten so the fact that now it s 2023 the world has reopened it s really hard to sort of see or to know with certainty is when we re going to see that see that reduction in demand now i think with the paris agreement what s also important is to note is you know if you re if you re in the oil and gas space and i was just at a conference earlier this morning where this was a point of conversation was you know what are the companies doing to reduce the emissions from production so how are they integrating carbon capture sequestration you know how are they managing the emissions that come from the production of fossil energy in this case that we re talking about oil and i think one of the things that i think if you sort of follow oil markets or a country like saudi arabia they are marketing low emission oil now we could you know we could sort of challenge well what does that you know what does that really mean but you are having you know countries that are now sort of competing to state that they have lower emitting carbon in the production in the production of oil and that s a whole other interesting sort of thing to look at in the context of the geopolitics of oil is to kind of understand the variation across emissions across different countries in the production of oil so we are you know again we are going to be going into cop 28 this fall again we are not seeing you know and we haven t seen a you know reduction in fossil energy demand again lots of people are sort of you know hoping that we ll start to see it sooner rather than later but for the time being and again you know to irina s first question that you know the last fourteen months and with you know with russia s invasion of ukraine it has both shown us that you know europe is sort of seeking to hasten the energy transition by building out more renewable energy and creating more opportunities to buy electric vehicles but there s still big swaths of the world that you know are still and have yet to move towards you know really reducing and that are actually going to see higher demand moving forward as their economies grow faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from jovana vujanic who is a graduate student at lewis university how big of an of an impact will the decision of the saudi energy minister to cut oil production have on the relationship between the united states and saudi arabia kissane love the question thank you so much yeah no it s a great one so my take is that of course this decision came as a bit of a surprise and it wasn t something that the united states you know wanted but i would say that the u s saudi relationship has been very tense for the last ten years and as part of that there are lots of different reasons for that but this is yet kind of another thing that saudi has done and again i think it s also saudi has taken a non alignment policy with relation to its position on russia and ukraine so it continues to you know it continues to have a relationship with russia it also has the relationship with ukraine as we saw you know china just brokered a very significant deal between saudi arabia and iran you know again saudi arabia and iran are two are two important producers for china so china is a large importer of oil so if you go back to world war the end of world war ii that s when the united states established the oil for security relationship with saudi arabia and as we have grown sort of more i wouldn t say independent but our as our own oil production has increased especially through the shale revolution our dependence on the middle east and saudi arabia more specifically has shifted so i think we re seeing a very different saudi arabia today which i think is going to be a challenge for the united states i think it s going to be very interesting to see what the summer holds last summer the biden administration did tap into the u s strategic petroleum reserves the largest the largest take in the history of the reserves which started in 1975 you know taking 180 million barrels out you know not because there was massive supply disruptions but because you know as the administration said it was you know it was it was it was a war it was a war specific decision because the you know russia s invasion of ukraine was causing energy prices to skyrocket and to cushion the american consumer and to better cushion the sort of the global economy the united states withdrew from the spr so i think the summer is going to be very interesting but i think we re going to see definitely much more attention in the years to come between the united states and saudi arabia it s not the relationship of the past this is a kind of a very new relationship that s a great question faskianos thank you thank you let s go curran flynn who has a raised hand q hello faskianos we can hear you but we re getting feedback so you might have two devices open q can you hear me now faskianos yes q that s better ok faskianos that s better thank you thank you so much q so i m here at king fahd university in saudi arabia right next to aramco here with my class from international relations and one of my students has a question nasser al nasir ph here he is q so thank you mrs carolyn my question is how could russia s use of alternative transportation methods such as the east siberian pipeline to china impact the u s market the domestic market and the role of the spr given potential insurance workarounds from russia s side such as ensuring russian tankers through their rdif fund and thank you to mrs irina kissane thank you and dr flynn thank you so much for having your students join this webinar so i m a little so the question is about the east siberian pipeline just could you would you mind repeating it i just want to make sure i have it i m clear on the question q so how could russia s use of alternative transportation methods such as the east siberian pipeline to china impact the u s energy markets i mean domestically and the spr given potential insurance workarounds from russia s side such as ensuring russian tankers to the rdif fund kissane yeah and that s a great question you know i think that you know begs a lot of things that we could be looking at right in terms of you know russia s kind of ability or capacity to sort of work around or find workarounds to the sanctions that were imposed and i think we ve seen sort of new markets so this kind of reshaping of the energy map with oil we see that as kind of in technicolor right whereas you know a lot of russian oil would go west is now going east you know china india being takers and of course you know other countries as well you know what will be its impact on the on the u s market i think that s you know again i do think the sanctions were sort of carefully put into place so that there wouldn t be massive disruptions so we again you know russia produces over 10 million barrels a day and about 7 million of those barrels are exported so you know if we lost all of that that would be a you know that would cause some very significant economic disruption globally we already saw you know impacts to sort of grains grain exports and food security in many different parts of the world so you know russia is finding different ways you have shadow tankers that russia is using to move to move its oil as you pointed out the east siberian pipeline you know i think there s only so much the united states can do or and european countries that are part of the sanctions regime can do to curtail russian exports of oil but i think that you know i think russia again has a has a desire and also you know revenue needs they re funding a very expensive war that they re finding ways to get their to get their oil out i think an interesting question is you know what does this mean in the years ahead the lack of investment for example that s going into russian energy infrastructure a lack of sort of any kind of western investment that is that is going in and what that is going to mean but again you know i think to your question i think we will see some you know we are seeing some impacts right there s a big question as to what you know what the next six months to a year will look like with regards to the reduction from opec and if we were to see a deeper curtailment on russian oil and you know would the united states then tap more into the spr we re now at you know we re down to seven hundred thousand barrels which of course is not insignificant but we also sort of have to be you know judicious about how we use the spr but thank you for the question faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from michael let s see trevett a ph d candidate at the university of southern mississippi china and other countries claim there are petroleum reserves under the south china sea what are your estimates of the potential amount there and has china begun to extract any of this oil kissane michael thank you so much that s a great question so china already is an oil producing country so you do have oil production in china in the south china sea i can t i can t say exactly i know that there have been geological tests that have shown the reserves again you do have you know you do have territorial concerns about sort of where is this you know can china can china tap those or seek to explore and tap those reserves again if there are if there is contention over the territory in which these reserves are located so you know china again one of the things that s very interesting about china is that china is an oil producer but china has seen over the last you know the last decade they have seen that they have experienced peak demand so i mean sorry peak supply so they are not producing as much as they used to and so you re seeing a year on year reduction in the producing capacity you know if you go back maybe five or six years ago there was lots of questions about if china could kind of replicate what happened in the united states around the shale oil revolution i think one of the big challenges for china is that of the you know where the shale reserves are located it s not near water lots of questions as to and some of it basically some of the tests have shown that it s it definitely is proving harder that you know they cannot sort of model the same level of development that we have seen in the united states so yeah no i think in the south china sea again i think we it s potentially possible that we might see it i wouldn t i wouldn t i wouldn t say it s soon faskianos thank you i m taking the next question from rob warren at the anglo american university of prague this question also got an upvote how do you foresee venezuela s role in the global oil market changing moving forward and can it be reintegrated into the global economy kissane oh these are all fantastic questions thank you all so much yeah venezuela is again you know venezuela has they have the largest reserves in the world as part of this webinar right you cfr had a kind of a primer on venezuelan and kind of you know you look at sort of where venezuela is and one of the biggest challenges confronting venezuela is both its politics but it s also it basically you know you don t have you don t have international oil service providers in the country i think the only the only one now that the u s the u s has sort of given a sanctions exemption to is that of chevron but i think yeah i mean if you were to see you know kind of shifts in the political regime and you were to see more openness then i think you could imagine you know venezuela having an opportunity or a pathway forward to be more integrated into the global energy system and the global oil system you know i think one of the big problems that venezuela faces is that most of its infrastructure is really old at this point and it would need a significant amount of reinvestment to get it up to a place that it could sort of meet its potential so you know venezuela is one of these countries that s not producing as much as it could right it has the potential to be producing 2 million plus more barrels per day but you know we ve seen that they really have just they went into freefall so i think that s a big issue and another big issue which god it goes back to an earlier question is that of emissions so the oil that comes out of venezuela is a very very heavy oil so it s it has very large carbon emissions associated with the production of that oil so that i think is again as we you know think about the emissions from oil production in countries that are sort of seeking to kind of market themselves as low emission producers you know venezuela definitely will have a very hard time recouping its where its oil sector was again it has the capacity it has the reserves but getting that getting that oil out of the ground right now you have a lot of significant above ground risks faskianos thank you i m going to go next to clemente abrokwaa raised hand so please unmute yourself q can you hear me please faskianos yes we can q thank you thank you so much for your for your talk i was also very shocked about the amount of barrels that we consume every day laughs i didn t know that but anyway i m from penn state university and my question is you just mentioned about the above ground you know effects and so the movement towards like electric vehicles and so on how do you think it is going to affect the african continent kissane thank you q i am i m thinking you know the economies and then infrastructure it will be very difficult for them to laughs move with the rest of the world in terms of electric vehicles and so on i just wanted your take on that kissane thank you clemente it s an excellent question yeah i mean you have countries across the african continent that not only have oil reserves but are already producing right nigeria is a is an oil producing country also has more capacity but again you have some above ground risks you also have the need for investment of new infrastructure i think one of the things that has been very interesting and i think it s getting it s getting more attention as it deserves is how western governments are some of i think a challenge across africa is that a lot of western governments have sort of said listen we re not going to invest in fossil fuels or also financial institutions western financial institutions we re not going to invest in fossil fuels or new projects that are fossil based and that you know that s problematic when you look across the african continent where you still don t have you know 100 percent energy access you know the idea of the transition to electric vehicles which is taking a very very long time even here across the across developed economies so the need for the infusion of more capital to go into you know across the continent of africa for oil and gas that s for their economies and for their own economic growth i think is really really pivotal and i think this is something that you know is being discussed across multilateral financial institutions and also you know is it hypocrisy right for western banks that have you know kind of funded the oil and gas industry or helped to fund the oil and gas industry in the united states and many different parts of the world and that are now sort of not allowing those funds to flow to africa and they have the again they have the they have the resources so you know is it you know the equity of some of these decisions that are being made i think is one that s is one that s really important and again i you know i said earlier in this talk is that you know all most of the demand for oil is not coming from north america and from europe all of the demand that we re seeing and new demand that we re going to see is coming from asia and is going to come from africa so again you know how are we going to make sure that that demand is met again going back to that idea of energy security so there is there is accessibility so there is reliable sources of energy at affordable prices you know without sort of thinking about kind of a whole of energy approach so i think it s very it s a very complex issue and i think you know western banks who have sort of taken very sharp positions on what they will and will not fund when it comes to new oil and gas projects are getting sort of challenged as to you know what does that mean then for you know countries across africa that are still very much in need of more energy not less and again recognizing that you know evs that again are still are you know we re seeing adoption here in the united states and across europe but it s a big big big adoption in china but it s very uneven so how do we ensure greater energy security for the continent of africa i think is a really critical question faskianos thank you i ll take the next question from kyle bales who is a senior at lewis university in romeoville illinois how is the war between russia and ukraine having an effect on the progress of the european green deal maybe you can tell us what the european define the european green deal for us carolyn give us the context for that kissane yes so again this is another fantastic question yeah the european green deal it s this is this is great yeah i mean a lot of people would say that the european green deal now is that the russia s invasion of ukraine has sort of said hey this is why the green deal is so important this is why we really need to more quickly transition to renewable energy because look what look what happened when we were dependent on russia for over 30 percent of our natural gas and look when russia you know illegally invades ukraine and suddenly weaponizes gas we are left very energy insecure it affects it affects consumers it affects industry across the continent so i think we re seeing not just through the green deal but we re also seeing through sort of european green industrial policy so in some ways akin to what you know we put into effect in this past summer is the inflation reduction act and we re seeing almost kind of this industrial competition around clean energy technologies and so europe is investing you know i think it s about 250 billion the united states it s about 370 billion towards the kind of the energy transition and helping to support domestic industries and companies to you know to be able to you know develop the technologies and to have the you know the opportunity to contribute to the energy transition so i think one thing though whenever i talk about europe it s really important is to sort of recognize that you know when you look across europe you have very different policies and kind of approaches to sort of thinking about energy and how quickly some countries want to transition and can transition whereas others you know are probably going to experience a slower transition so just really interesting example as you talked about the green deal is the eu taxonomy the green taxonomy that went into effect in the january of 2022 and there you had like really a lot of contention between france and germany because france wanted to make sure that nuclear was part of the green taxonomy germany was opposed right but germany wanted to make sure natural gas was part of the green taxonomy so ultimately in the end both natural gas and nuclear and again this was this predated russia s invasion of ukraine but in the eu green taxonomy you have you know you have both nuclear and natural gas in addition to other renewable energies that can make up this taxonomy that includes specific measures towards adaptation and mitigation for climate change so you know i think you re seeing this kind of some people call it a race a competition you know ideally it s you know we re kind of working together to because we re all sort of going in the same direction to you know support the transition and to reduce to reduce carbon emissions and to bring in more sort of cleaner energy technologies into our system faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from dr laeed zaghlami q yes good afternoon this is laeed good afternoon irina good afternoon carolyn i m very pleased to be part of your program just to want to be back to africa and particularly to nigeria how practical the two projects that nigeria is advocating for pipelines one from through algeria and the other one to morocco through western african countries how practical are these pipelines to supply gas to europe and parts of some african countries faskianos and dr zaghlami you are at algiers university correct q indeed irina yes i am professor at university of algiers faculty of information and communication faskianos thank you kissane dr laeed can i can i keep you on for just one second can i ask you what is the what is the status right now is it it s planned under construction where is what is the status of those two pipelines my understanding is that it s they re proposed but q yes well actually in practically the pipeline between algeria and abuja which means through niger and so forth is already in progress whereas the other project through thirteen western african countries they are supposed to be implemented by 2047 but is it is there any political game or something of strategic inaudible how practical how logical how efficiently will be for nigeria to have two similar project s kissane yeah no it s again thank you for the question you know pipelines again that s why i wanted to show the laughs kind of the map of pipelines is because you know a lot of pipelines transverse you know multiple countries right and this is this requires not just you know a lot of cooperation but it requires technically it also can be very complex to build to build pipelines and when you re talking about something like as you as you point out these are you know crossing many countries you know i think one of the again one of the issues is whether or not since you know what already is under construction i think you can you know with confidence that one will be completed anything that s not yet under construction and again the timeline 2047 is way out there a lot of a lot of uncertainty as to what the status of those projects will be moving forward for various reasons in terms of making sure that the investments are there someone i know that studies pipelines he says you know until the steel is in the ground you don t have the pipeline and so until you know that you ve got that you know you ve got all the oks and you feel that kind of security of being able to build it and being able to provide the resources to supply it and to move it i think algeria has been a really interesting case that hasn t gotten enough attention in terms of algerian gas that has that has helped support europe over the last years we ve seen an increase in algerian gas going into europe again a lot of attention on u s lng and the increase of liquefied natural gas exports into europe but also algeria has been you know very important for helping to support european energy security and make up for some of the losses of the of the russian gas and i think we ll see more attention on algeria and algeria s role as a you know as an important source of energy especially you know gas going into going into europe moving forward faskianos so i ll take the next written question from vincent brooks who is at harvard and diamondback energy board of directors how do you view the purchasing of discounted russian oil by india in particular relative to the purchasing by china how are they using the oil purchased and are you seeing more internal usage or external profit making sales in places like africa and what are the implications of all of this kissane right great great question so all of the above laughs in some ways right there is definitely sort of profits that are being made you know i was i was talking about this last week with someone and you know if you sort of put your shoe put yourself in the shoes of india right so india is a is a rapidly growing economy 1 4 billion you know if you had if you have very high energy inflation and high oil prices that s going to have ripples effects across the indian economy and so you know when you have a kind of opportunity to buy you know pretty steep discounted oil which you know they had been able to buy from russia you know for purposes of national security they ve been buying the oil and one of the things that s very interesting about india is that actually india has been building out its refining capacity so a lot of that oil is both for domestic and some of it is being sort of re exported but i think what we ve seen is that they re using that oil to also sort of enhance their capacity and capabilities as a rapidly emerging refining power in asia and we see that in some ways in china too so china even though oil demand was down in 2022 much of the oil that they were buying from russia went into its strategic supplies which you know they now have access to and again i think you know a big question is what we re going to see moving forward around oil demand in china wood mackenzie just published a really interesting piece kind of very bullish on the expectations for oil demand in china so whether or not they re going to continue to buy you know russian oil and again sort of taking advantage of these lower prices you know and i think i think one of the things that it s kind of an inconvenient truth whereas a lot of this oil trading used to happen in europe so european trading houses were kind of the main the main points of russian oil trade a lot of that has been moved out so you know russia has found ways to kind of bypass some of the sanctions and have set up in some cases they ve set up trading houses and some of those trading houses have been sort of set up in places that you know that they can sort of again bypass the compliance to the sanctions and you have some you have some russian oil traders that are making a lot of money laughs selling discounted oil and then reselling it a really interesting case a couple of months ago was out of malaysia malaysia announced or in the you know that they were that 1 5 million barrels were produced and sold but only malaysia doesn t produce that much so those were russian barrels that were sort of being sold under sort of the malaysian under the malaysian barrel so again i think china and india have you know have taken advantage some of this has again as i said has been re exported and some of it you know has been re exported through petroleum products because china and india you know both are building and have refining capacity faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from bhakti mirchandani at columbia university what global trajectory do you see for nuclear the russia ukraine crisis has taken some of the refining capacity offline and nuclear has the potential to change the geopolitics of energy and so what steps can be taken to foster nuclear energy kissane bhakti thank you and i was just at columbia earlier today for the center for global energy policy s conference yeah nuclear is very interesting right so when we re thinking about you know decarbonizing our energy systems you know nuclear plays a very important role because it s zero emitting so in certain parts of the world china being one saudi arabia you know you have a lot of new nuclear build you know in other parts of the world you have a lot of contention about nuclear we saw that even in germany which have you know three remaining nuclear power plants and even in the midst of massive energy crisis over the last year there was still sort of pushback about no those nuclear power plants need to be shut down whereas you would think ok in light of energy insecurity let s keep them open so you know france is an interesting country france had planned to reduce its nuclear capacity by 50 percent but this past year they pivoted and they ve said no we re actually going to build out more nuclear and we re sort of we re totally scrapping that idea of reducing nuclear energy and nuclear is very important for france s electricity system sweden has also announced that they are going to build new nuclear and they re going to increase by i think almost 50 percent again part of this is their to meet their targets of net zero we also see japan japan you know the fukushima disaster really turned japanese the japanese public off of nuclear very very deep opposition to restarting the nuclear power plants but this past year even though there s still safety concerns on the part of the public the public is also very concerned about energy insecurity and higher prices so nuclear being a domestic source of energy so i think when you look at you know net zero pathways i have not seen a net zero pathway that does not include nuclear so here in the united states the net zero america project out of princeton very important place for nuclear we just have a really hard time laughs building nuclear at cost so it s very expensive usually it s significant cost overruns and of course there is the i think they have a really significant pr problem people there s still a lot of concern about the safety of nuclear so i think to your point it s very very important for decarbonizing energy systems but you re going to see i think very disjointed approaches some countries are going are embracing nuclear and other countries are sort of doubling down on their opposition and are not going to allow nuclear to be part of the energy system faskianos we have so many questions and we are just not going to get to them all so i m going to take the next question from christian bonfili who s at torcuato di tella university in argentina so do you think carolyn that the landscape resulting from the ukraine invasion by russia vis à vis securitization of gas and energy between europe and russia could accelerate energy transition toward greener energy kissane great question i think in europe it is and i think you know many analysts would agree that the iea for example you know you had the you know how does europe continue you know to enhance and achieve energy security without the dependence on russia gas and a lot of that is through renewable energy you also have a lot of new attention on hydrogen and the role that hydrogen will play i think i think europe is being cautious and so they are not saying that they are going to completely move away from gas so as earlier questions are they getting gas from algeria or are they getting gas from norway are they getting more gas from the united states in the form of liquefied natural gas and then also an uncomfortable truth is they continue to get liquefied natural gas from russia so we ve seen an increase in lng from russia going into europe that said i think all in you are seeing that you know countries across europe are saying ok you know how can we enhance our energy security how do we build more sort of domestic energy sources solar wind we re seeing you know more rapid deployment you ve got a lot of questions about supply chains and things like that but i think overall i think the answer would be that it s quickening the energy transition faskianos so i will take the moderator prerogative to just ask the final question for you to close on and just to give us your top three what are the major challenges for the geopolitics of oil as you look out over the next five to ten year horizon that you would leave us with to be looking for kissane ok you know so i think what we saw right tensions between saudi arabia and the united states we also have a you know a hot war cold war depending on you know the term you want to use between the united states and china and lots of sort of questions as to what that s going to look like i think there s you know i think there s concern that you know we re not reducing demands but we re seeing tightening supply and so that s going to have you know very significant impacts for economies especially economies that are already very fragile economically fragile politically fragile so that concerns me a lot in terms of you know what happens when you know economies don t have adequate access to energy to make sure that their industries that their that consumers you know are able that the lights can stay on and you can get you know if you re dependent on cars you re depending on trucks like all these kinds of things are really really critical so i think we have to be very cautious moving forward that we don t take more out of the system before we have adequately set up the system to be resilient and to be able to sort of meet the energy security demands that are not are not they re not decreasing i think they are increasing and becoming even more complex so i think there s a lot of concerns and a lot of uncertainty and you know this definitely is going to be an area to watch in the years ahead faskianos carolyn kissane kissane excuse me thank you very much for shaping and sharing this discussion for sharing your terrific insights with us and to all of you for your questions and comments i m really sorry that we could not get to them all

what s not to like about skyrocketing iron ore prices key points iron ore prices have surged to their highest level in five years on the back of mine shutdowns in brazil iron ore prices have surged to their highest level in five years on the back of mine shutdowns in brazil chinese steel mill margins are being crushed and some have returned to making losses chinese steel mill margins are being crushed and some have returned to making losses consensus forecasts see iron ore prices sliding back below us80 tonne in coming years but mines will still be very profitable they paper over all manner of blemishes in the australian economy and help recession proof the lucky country further over the horizon on treasury figures a us10 rise above the currently conservative estimate of us55 tonne nominal gdp could be boosted by around 25 billion this year and the already stronger budget position will have 4 or 5 billion head start even before the next tax year begins that s a significant boost to the national income which in turn lifts living standards superannuants and investors benefit not only from the rising tide of the big miners share prices but also the dividends they are shovelling out the current dividend yields of bhp and rio tinto of around 6 or 7 per cent line up favourably against the big banks and more than favourably against the near zero return you get for lending your hard earned to the banks which lend it back to you at higher rates iron ore price sensitivities 10 tonne movement in iron ore price 2019 20 2020 21 nominal gdp 6 3b 13 6b tax receipts 1 1b 3 7b source federal budget 2019 can it last this time it s different is one of the more unnerving phrases in market and generally a signal to bail out once it becomes group think what is perhaps striking about the latest surge in prices is this time no one appears to be saying it s different that in itself may give the rally a few more legs but there are some distinct differences from the real boom years the current price approaching us120 tonne is still well short of the record us191 tonne in early 2011 or the 160 tonne reached in the last big rally seven years ago that last spurt was pretty well the death knell for phrases such as the super commodities cycle and stronger for longer up until then chinese gdp growth and its seemingly insatiable appetite for steel had led iron ore prices onwards and upwards two things happened the boom had driven a massive expansion in mining capacity and the chinese economy slowed supply up demand down prices inevitably fall the first lesson in economics 101 what s different the chinese economy may have slowed and will slow further but that doesn t mean it has stopped peak steel consumption on some estimates is still five or six years off much of the recent acceleration in price is due to the supply rather than demand side of the ledger but it is a more short term rather than long term supply issue another dam disaster in brazil this time at vale s feijao mine which killed around 250 people the death toll is still rising has scuttled around 6 per cent of seaborne supply since late january iron ore inventories at chinese ports have dwindled away to the lowest level in more than two years to extent australian miners are innocent and enriched bystanders to recent events they appear not be falling for same mistakes they made last time iron ore is being shipped out at near record pace supplied roy hill australian producers are focussing on value over volume cba commodities analyst vivek dhar says delivered cost of australian iron ore into china is around us30 tonne if you re selling it at us112 tonne you have quite a healthy margin they are dealing with the cash flow boost by either giving it back to shareholders investing in further cost cutting or reducing debt veteran ubs analyst glyn lawcock says the big miners are not spending on expansion all the money set aside for west australian operations has been in replacing mines facing exhaustion australia is now running at near record levels of production may was the second best month on record dr lawcock said yes we have windfall prices but it is a five year journey through design approval and building to get new mine capacity vale will be back before then chinese steel mills squeezed the capacity of chinese steel mills to pay is another factor putting a ceiling on the price while demand for steel has eased the soaring cost of raw materials has arguably hurt profitability more there are some cases where chinese steel mills are already unprofitable particularly with hot rolled coil steel steel for manufacturing has been under the pump on the back of the us china trade war rebar steel is doing a bit better on the back of construction and infrastructure spending mr dhar said the profitability of chinese steel mills is tumbling source cba bloomberg however like australian miners chinese steel mills are now on a sounder footing to deal with swings in fortune steel profitability has risen over recent years as government policy removed inefficient and often illegal producers utilisation rates have lifted as part of a structural shift most of the unsustainable mills were shuttered in 2016 and 2017 there has been only a minimal decline in capacity recently profitability in chinese steel mills hit record levels in 2018 hugh brown supplied chinese steel industry went through a period of record profitability last year there were super abnormal profits this year they re having a bad time dr lawcock says chinese steel mills will have a tight year from a margin point of view but they put away a lot last year when the grass was green and have come into this price spike in much better shape in a similar vein prices are not so high to fire up chinese miners into a shovelling frenzy the average iron ore content of chinese mines is around 13 per cent compared to 62 per cent from the likes of rio tinto and bhp in other words chinese mines have to shift around five times the ground to produce the same content as the australian mines the breakeven price for chinese mines is said to be around us80 tonne compared to sub us30 from the pilbara has the price peaked where the price peaks this time around is open to question but few observers see it going much higher similarly few see it plummeting back to the us40 tonne levels of late 2015 early 2016 we don t expect to stay over 100 in perpetuity dr lawcock says 90 a tonne this year looks a little conservative we have 80 pencilled in for 2020 over at cba it is a similar forecast with forecasts iron ore prices transitioning through the 90s and the 80s in time falling demand in the steel intensive construction sector may limit further upside for the iron ore price flickr tauno tõhk 陶诺 however mr dhar sounds a note of caution given recent weakness in steel intensive sectors such as property and manufacturing with margins now low enough to discourage steelmakers to produce steel we see downside risks to china s steel production and iron ore demand in coming weeks he said that will likely weigh on iron ore prices and likely push the steel under us100 tonne however he says another spurt of stimulus from chinese policymakers could shore up prices at current levels for some time yet 90 by the end of the year and in three years time around 65 tonne mr dhar says but that s still a healthy margin for the main producers maybe this time it will be different wall street retreats after record high after fairly boisterous week global markets

in the world today almost everyone has given up on rising rates and the possibility of inflation a large majority of investors believe that inflation is all but dead and central banks are more likely to lower rates than the raise them this overwhelming consensus has led to the possibility that the tide has gone too far to one side leaving any contrarian event at risk of causing a major calamity in the global economy these calamities could come in a multitude of forms a decade of rock bottom interest rates has resulted in the largest debt bubble that has ever existed in history the international monetary fund stated earlier this year that debt has reached a record level of us 184 trillion the level of debt is astounding while it seems unlikely real estate downturns and resulting recessions have frequently followed periods of cheap credit the problem this time is that that easy money is a global phenomenon which could lead to a painful correction if things go wrong we don t have to look much farther than the 2008 financial crisis to see what a credit crunch could look like and what if inflation picks up unexpectedly this has happened numerous times in the past so why not now a sudden jump in inflation could lead to a massive increase in interest rates it occurred in the late 1970s uncertainty can kill your portfolio so you need to be prepared to hedge against it buy a gold etf to hedge your portfolio each of these outcomes is extremely contrarian in nature no one expects them to occur which is what makes them so potentially damaging just think back to 2016 when no one thought interest rates would ever go higher the sudden move upwards over the next couple of years shocked investors eventually causing a minor collapse in the stock market in the fall of 2018 be prepared for the unexpected by using a gold investment the market is brittle and could be negatively impacted by a sudden downward move caused by one of the factors already mentioned probably the best investment for most canadian investors to use is ishares s p tsx global gold etf tsx xgd this etf provides exposure to many of the best gold related companies in the world and because it has exposure to the gold streamers like franco nevada as well as gold producers you are able to have leveraged exposure to the gold price recovery xgd is a slightly more expensive etf with a management expense ratio of 0 62 but it is a specialty etf focused on gold which requires more management than a standard index fund with gold experiencing an excellent run this year rising to a six year high of over us 1 400 this etf has given excellent returns of over 16 year to date the etf also has a modest dividend which might make you sleep better at night it is not huge at 1 41 as of this writing but it might give you the income you need to hold on to this fund while you ride out tumultuous times gold is a hedge against uncertainty uncertainty is rising and gold is once again taking its place as a store of wealth in troubled times the dollar is tanking on a dovish fed unrest in the middle east and trade talks are increasing uncertainty around the world guard your portfolio with a gold hedge build around an etf like xgd

efe haiti the poorest country in the western hemisphere has spent nearly a year mired in a political and economic crisis that has brought thousands of people onto the streets and which has as its root the long running debate over eliminating fuel subsidies in the current fiscal year ending june 30 the government has spent 35 billion gourdes 376 million on fuel subsidies resources that could have gone to improve haiti s struggling schools and health system anuncio the government of president jovenel moise who took office in february 2017 is having problems finding the money to pay public employees threatening to increase stress at a moment when haitians are already beset by runaway inflation the sharp depreciation of the gourde and fuel shortages the energy squeeze is due in part to a reduction in the amount of crude oil venezuela supplies on generous terms with much of the bill payable over 25 years at an interest rate of just 1 percent to haiti and other caribbean and central american nations under the petrocaribe program one idea behind the program was to enable the beneficiaries to take advantage of the long repayment schedule and use proceeds from domestic oil sales to finance public works projects anuncio dealing with its own economic woes oil rich venezuela has been forced to scale back the petrocaribe initiative yet the program continues to loom large in haitian politics an audit unveiled in february by haiti s superior court of auditors and administrative disputes revealed irregularities in petrocaribe between 2008 and 2016 and implicated 15 current and former officials as well as a company moise headed before becoming president in embezzling 3 8 billion in program funds the state subsidies to petroleum have caused substantial financial losses for the government haitian economist kesner pharel told efe anuncio the subsidies are exercising pressure on the local currency exchange market and maintaining inflationary pressures according to pharel who said that inflation climbed to 18 percent in april due to a combination of weak domestic output and a budget deficit swelled by the cost of fuel subsidies the international monetary fund imf and world bank have long urged haiti to phase out fuel subsidies but when the moise administration took a first step in that direction in july 2018 haitians responded with violent protests and the president abandoned the plan unemployment is more than 50 percent and more than half of haiti s roughly 10 million inhabitants survive on less than 2 a day anuncio the country s economy expanded by just 1 4 percent in 2018 a growth rate that was one of the lowest in the region and is projected to grow a modest 2 percent this year haiti s poor economy will increase social tension and aggravate the political crisis pharel said noting that the turmoil is hurting every sector including services which accounts for the largest share of gross domestic product the gradual elimination of fuel subsidies was part of the agreement moise s government signed with the imf in spring 2018 anuncio imf economists say the subsidies disproportionately benefit the well off moise faces a dilemma the vast majority of haitians could not afford electricity or fuel without subsidies and their elimination would surely lead to intensification of the demands for him to step down he has lost two prime ministers in less than a year jack guy lafontant resigned following the riots in july 2018 and his successor jean henry ceant left in march after parliament voted in favor of a motion of censure over the government s inability to address haiti s problems moise meanwhile refuses to resign and calls for dialogue but the opposition has rebuffed his appeals efe
new york ap why is the stock market so happy and the bond market so gloomy just as the s p 500 was setting a record high thursday bond yields were tumbling to their lowest levels since donald trump was elected the yield on the 10 year treasury which influences rates for mortgages and other loans dropped below 2 at one point it was above 3 20 in november usually stock prices rise when investors are feeling confident bond yields meanwhile often fall when investors are worried about a softening economy how can both be happening at the same time in large part it s because investors are locking in bets based on expectations for what the federal reserve will do with interest rates the u s china trade war is also playing a role here s a look at how ebullience and trepidation can occur simultaneously ___ how is the fed pushing the stock market higher most investors expect the fed to cut interest rates at its next meeting in july for the first time since the economy was swamped under the great recession in 2008 not only that many investors expect the central bank to cut rates another one or maybe even two times later this year it s a sharp turnaround from december 2018 when the fed raised rates for the seventh time in two years federal reserve chairman jerome powell speaks during a news conference following a two day federal open market committee meeting in washington wednesday june 19 2019 ap photo manuel balce ceneta for stocks lower rates can goose prices higher because stocks suddenly look more attractive than bonds lower rates also can encourage borrowing and more economic activity markets have accepted the new world order where low interest rates are viewed as a huge positive and people buy into the fact that you can afford to pay higher valuations for stocks said nate thooft senior portfolio manager at manulife asset management it s also not just the fed central banks around the world have shown their willingness to keep interest rates low to invigorate their economies ___ why are treasury yields falling short term yields tend to fall when expectations build for coming rate cuts longer term yields meanwhile fall when expectations for inflation are low and worries about the economy are growing inflation has remained remarkably tame some concerning economic figures meanwhile have been popping up around the world particularly in manufacturing countries have seen slowing momentum as the global trade war weighs on trade and business confidence the bond market has reacted more powerfully than the equity markets over the last several months both in anticipation of fed news and when it comes to global growth worries said thooft the bond market is usually seen as the more sober one when it comes to assessing economic trends rather than the stock market but thooft said the movement in bond yields may have been overdone ___ is the trade war also moving markets yes optimism is rising that the world s largest economies can make progress on their trade dispute when the u s and chinese leaders meet at the group of 20 summit next week trump s tweet announcing the meeting earlier this week helped send the s p 500 to one of its better days of the year up 1 ___ aren t the two things moving markets mutually exclusive if the trade war gets resolved will the fed still cut rates if trump and chinese president xi jinping make so much progress that a deal seems near fed policymakers may not cut rates or at least not in july but few economists expect much progress will be made most analysts say that the most likely outcome is that the two sides agree to schedule talks it s not clear whether trump will suspend his threat to slap more tariffs on the remaining 300 billion in chinese imports that haven t yet been taxed even if the trump xi meeting goes well the effects of trump s trade fights with europe and mexico as well as china will likely linger u s farmers have been hurt by retaliatory tariffs imposed on agricultural exports and u s business investment has slowed as companies delay planned expansions amid greater uncertainty trade fights don t unwind rapidly diane swonk chief economist at grant thornton said there are signs that the u s economy is stumbling and that low inflation is more stubborn than the fed previously thought both of which argue for lower rates they re getting the cuts said joe brusuelas chief economist at tax advisory firm rsm referring to stock market investors who bid up shares on anticipation of the fed slicing rates the u s domestic economy is decelerating at an accelerating pace ___ but the economy is doing well isn t it yes for now few economists are forecasting a recession but brusuelas and others expect growth could come in as low as 1 8 this year sharply below last year s 2 9 the boost to consumer spending from the tax cuts is fading brusuelas said and while the unemployment rate remains low hiring is on track to fall to its slowest pace since 2010 inflation has remained below the fed s 2 target which chairman jerome powell said as recently as april was likely a temporary issue stemming from cheaper gas and other factors but wednesday fed policymakers forecast that inflation would be just 1 5 at the end of this year while lower inflation might sound good it suggests that wages won t rise by enough to push prices higher ___ what if the fed surprises everyone and doesn t cut rates at all the expectation for rate cuts is so deeply entrenched in markets that most investors don t consider this a likely scenario brian jacobsen senior investment strategist at the multi asset solutions team at wells fargo asset management is outside the mainstream in saying that the fed might stand pat he says china s slowing economy adds urgency for its leaders to reach a deal while trump has seen how much the stock market wants a trade agreement if next week s meeting does offer some resolution expectations for a rate cut will be dashed but any disappointment could be offset by expectations for more durable economic growth around the world once again we could be in a position where bond yields rise and stocks rise as well jacobsen said we ll no longer have this divergence a television screen on the trading floor of the new york stock exchange shows the rate decision of the federal reserve wednesday june 19 2019 the federal reserve is leaving its key interest rate unchanged but signaling that it s prepared to start cutting rates if needed to protect the u s economy from trade conflicts and other threats ap photo richard drew

president trump in the midst of a year long trade battle with china ratcheted up the pressure on monday the treasury department officially labeled beijing as a currency manipulator allegations that trump has long heralded now the treasury department will work with the international monetary fund to try to undo the unfair advantage created by china s latest actions currently the yuan is around an exchange rate higher than 7 compared to the u s dollar but it s not the first that trump has criticized the monetary policy set by foreign governments at the beginning of the month the president accused china and the european union of intentionally deflating the value of their currencies even as the u s dollar remains relatively strong china and europe playing big currency manipulation game and pumping money into their system in order to compete with usa he wrote we should match or continue being the dummies who sit back and politely watch as other countries continue to play their games as they have for many years trump previously pushed back against the european central bank claiming the european bloc was unfairly competing against the greenback by deflating the value of the euro mario draghi just announced more stimulus could come which immediately dropped the euro against the dollar making it unfairly easier for them to compete against the usa trump wrote in a tweet they have been getting away with this for years along with china and others at the time draghi said the ecb was ready to cut interest rates if the economy needed it during a speech in portugal draghi noted that further cuts in policy rates remain part of our tools but why does the president think a weaker u s dollar is better for the economy essentially if the u s dollar is worth less relative to other currencies foreign countries are likely to buy more american goods boosting things like u s manufacturing while simultaneously helping to close the trade deficit trump frequently accused china of keeping its currency the yuan intentionally low to make exports cheaper and therefore increase the trade imbalance and since trump has taken office the dollar has remained strong much to his displeasure thanks to protectionist trade policies a big fiscal stimulus from the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act and monetary policy set by the federal reserve i want a strong dollar but i want a dollar that does great for our country not a dollar that s so strong that it makes it prohibitive for us to do business with other nations and take their business trump said during a speech in march before launching into criticism of fed chairman jerome powell we have a gentleman that likes a very strong dollar in the fed he added referring to powell click here to get the fox business app although the fed cut interest rates by 25 basis points during its july meeting the dollar has remained strong
the canadian dollar fell on friday with the release of retail sales showing a lower than expected gain in both core and headline data the loonie will end up the trading week by gaining 1 45 percent against the us dollar the fed signalled at the end of its june federal open market committee fomc meeting that the central bank is ready to cut interest rates oil prices surged as the dollar retreated as geopolitical risks and a refinery fire in the us will impact global supplies gold was also bid as investors sought the metal as an alternative asset class offering refuge from rising uncertainty the bank of canada boc is part of the dovish choir of major central banks but with inflation pushing higher it has not signalled it is ready to start easing its monetary policy in the short term the interest rate divergence will shrink with the us benchmark as the fed could try to be pro active although a fruitful meeting between presidents trump and xi could remove some of the pessimism inside the american central bank g20 trump xi meeting the top market event the us dollar fell across the board against major pairs in the last five trading days the fed delivered a dovish statement and a rate cut seems imminent based on chair powell s press conference the greenback is lower as investors are looking for yield elsewhere a big factor of the lack of appeal in the us dollar is the optimism on trade president trump and xi will meet in japan on a sidebar during the g20 meeting and the thawing of trade talks could lead to the much anticipated agreement between the two nations commodities have risen on the softness of the dollar but the iranian attack on a us drone increased tensions as iran could be under further economic sanctions us stocks have hit record highs as the fed is ready to cut the benchmark interest rate and the optimism on trade but there are concerns around the situation in the middle east and all eyes will be on the g20 meeting for updates on the us china relationship dollar on back foot on trade optimism and fed rate cut plans the eur usd rose 1 49 percent during the week the single currency was not the biggest winner against the greenback and it was mainly because the european central bank ecb was also dovish in its assessment of the european economy but reassured the market that the central bank is ready to act by cutting rates if necessary unlike the fed the ecb has not ended its easing cycle so it put its first possible rate hike further way until summer of 2020 german ifo business confidence will be published on monday the large sample size survey has declined in the past two months with businesses more dovish on the german economy in the next six months the german leading indicator will be crucial for the eur as the country is the engine of the union and low confidence could be contagious the us could be making trade peace with china at the g20 but the european car industry is next on the agenda as tariffs were delayed but not forgotten oil rises on supply disruptions and soft dollar west texas intermediate rose 9 19 percent during the week and brent gained 5 39 percent after the us drone incident iran shot the drone and versions differ if the spy drone had entered iranian airspace or if was flying in international airspace us president trump tweeted aggressive words towards iran but armed conflict eased as sanctions appear to be the preferred tactic us production has been on the rise but a fire at a major refinery could create a supply shortage of gasoline during peak driving season the trump xi meeting at the g20 meeting benefited the black stuff if an amicable tone is reached that will be putting less downward pressure on global growth concerns gold higher on safe haven appeal gold surged 4 36 percent during the last five trading days and remains close to the 1 400 price levels the yellow metal had struggled to break above 1 350 but the fed removed that obstacle when it dropped heavy hints that a rate cut is coming the us dollar fell and with macro risks keeping investors tense the appeal for gold as a safe haven was higher content is for general information purposes only it is not investment advice or a solution to buy or sell securities opinions are the authors not necessarily that of oanda business information services inc or any of its affiliates subsidiaries officers or directors if you would like to reproduce or redistribute any of the content found on marketpulse an award winning forex commodities and global indices analysis and news site service produced by oanda business information services inc please access the rss feed or contact us at info marketpulse com visit to find out more about the beat of the global markets 2023 oanda business information services inc
washington ap an eye toward his 2020 campaign president donald trump is turning to a familiar playbook of exaggerated boasts about economic performance and overdrawn complaints about a race tilted against him he insisted the electoral college gives democrats a big advantage in u s presidential elections making it difficult for republicans like himself to win that s wrong though in 2016 he often described the election as rigged against him trump in fact wouldn t have won the presidency without the electoral college system in which the votes of smaller rural states that tend to vote republican are weighted more heavily than big democratic leaning states like new york and california trump also claimed over the weekend that he s presided over one of the best u s economies ever he s wrong about that too the misleading rhetoric over the past week came as the president prepared to kick off his re election campaign tuesday in florida in trump s reckoning an iran tamed by him no longer cries death to america the border wall with mexico is proceeding apace the estate tax has been lifted off the backs of farmers the remains of u s soldiers from north korea are coming home and china is opening its wallet to the u s treasury for the first time in history these claims range from flatly false to mostly so here s a look president donald trump waves as he departs after speaking in the rose garden of the white house friday june 14 2019 in washington ap photo alex brandon electoral college trump in part addressing polls finding him lagging some of the 2020 democratic candidates it s always tougher for the republican because you know i don t know people people never cover this but the electoral college is very much steered to the democrats it s a big advantage for the democrats it s very much harder for the republicans to win fox news interview friday the facts actually the electoral college s unique system of electing presidents is a big reason why trump won the presidency four candidates in history including al gore in 2000 have won a majority of the popular vote only to be denied the presidency by the electoral college all were democrats in the 2016 election democrat hillary clinton received nearly 2 9 million more votes than trump after racking up more lopsided victories in big states such as new york and california according to election data compiled by the associated press but she lost the presidency due to trump s winning margin in the electoral college which came after he narrowly won less populous midwestern states such as michigan and wisconsin unlike the popular vote electoral college votes are set equal to the number of u s representatives in each state plus its two senators that means more weight is given to a single vote in a small state than the vote of someone in a large state ___ economy and taxes trump no president has done what i have in the first 2 1 2 years of his presidency including the fact that we have one of the best economies in the history of our country tweets saturday the facts this is one of trump s most frequent falsehoods the economy is solid but it s not one of the best in the country s history trump is also claiming full credit for an economic expansion that began under president barack obama in mid 2009 the economy expanded at an annual rate of 3 2 percent in the first quarter of this year that growth was the highest in just four years for the first quarter in the late 1990s growth topped 4 percent for four straight years a level it has not yet reached on an annual basis under trump growth even reached 7 2 percent in 1984 while the economy has shown strength it grew 2 9 in 2018 the same pace it reached in 2015 and simply hasn t hit historically high growth rates ___ trump wages are growing and they are growing at the fastest rate for this is something so wonderful for blue collar workers the biggest percentage increase blue collar workers remarks tuesday in council bluffs iowa the facts he s claiming credit for a trend of rising wages for lower income blue collar workers that predates his presidency some of the gains also reflect higher minimum wages passed at the state and local level the trump administration opposes an increase to the federal minimum wage with the unemployment rate at 3 6 the lowest since december 1969 employers are struggling to fill jobs despite all the talk of robots and automation thousands of restaurants warehouses and retail stores still need workers they are offering higher wages and have pushed up pay for the lowest paid one quarter of workers more quickly than for everyone else since 2015 in april the poorest 25 saw their paychecks increase 4 4 from a year earlier compared with 3 1 for the richest one quarter those gains are not necessarily flowing to the blue collar workers trump cited instead when measured by industry wages are rising more quickly for lower paid service workers hourly pay for retail workers has risen 4 1 in the past year and 3 8 for hotel and restaurant employees manufacturing workers the blue collars have seen pay rise just 2 2 and construction workers 3 2 ___ trump and to keep your family farms and ranches in the family we eliminated the estate tax also known as the death tax on the small farms and ranches and other businesses that was a big one people were having a farm they loved their children and they want to leave it to their children and the estate tax was so much the children would have to go out and borrow a lot of money from unfriendly bankers in many cases and they d end up losing the farm and it was a horrible situation remarks in council bluffs the facts there still is an estate tax more small farms may be off the hook for it as a result of changes by the republican controlled congress in 2017 but very few farms or small businesses were subject to the tax even before that happened congress increased the tax exemption temporarily so fewer people will be subject to those taxes previously any assets from estates valued at more than 5 49 million or nearly 11 million for couples were subject to the estate tax in 2017 the new law doubled that minimum for 2018 to 11 2 million or 22 4 million for couples for 2019 the minimums rose to 11 4 million or 22 8 million for couples those increased minimums will expire at the end of 2025 according to an analysis by the nonpartisan tax policy center only about 80 small farms and closely held businesses were subject to the estate tax in 2017 those estates represent about 1 percent of all taxable estate tax returns ___ russia investigation trump on special counsel robert mueller s report he said no collusion the report said no collusion abc news interview aired sunday trump the mueller report spoke it said no collusion and no obstruction and no nothing and in fact it said we actually rebuffed your friends from russia that we actually pushed them back we rebuffed them remarks wednesday in oval office the facts he s wrong to repeat the claim that the mueller report found no collusion between russia and the trump campaign it s also false that his campaign in 2016 denied all access to russians nor did the special counsel s report exonerate trump on the question of whether he obstructed justice mueller s two year investigation and other scrutiny revealed a multitude of meetings with russians among them donald trump jr s meeting with a russian lawyer who had promised dirt on clinton on collusion mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term he looked into a potential criminal conspiracy between russia and the trump campaign and said the investigation did not collect sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges on that front mueller noted some trump campaign officials had declined to testify under the fifth amendment or had provided false or incomplete testimony making it difficult to get a complete picture of what happened during the 2016 campaign the special counsel wrote that he cannot rule out the possibility that unavailable information could have cast a different light on the investigation s findings in his interview with abc news trump said if a foreign power offered dirt on his 2020 opponent he d be open to accepting it and that he d have no obligation to call in the fbi i think i d want to hear it trump said there s nothing wrong with listening ___ republican sen lindsey graham judiciary committee chairman in response to trump s comments that he d be open to accepting political dirt from foreign adversaries like russia the outrage some of my democratic colleagues are raising about president trump s comments will hopefully be met with equal outrage that their own party hired a foreign national to do opposition research on president trump s campaign tweet thursday the facts graham is making an unequal comparison he seeks to turn the tables on democrats by pointing to their use of a dossier of anti trump research produced by christopher steele a former british intelligence officer that was financed by the democratic party and hillary clinton s campaign graham also insists on equal outrage over democrats using that information from a former intelligence officer of britain an ally with a history of shared intelligence with the u s that s a different story from a foreign adversary such as russia which the mueller report concluded had engaged in sweeping and systematic interference in the 2016 presidential election moreover steele was hired as a private citizen though one with intelligence contacts the mueller report found multiple contacts between the trump campaign and russia and the report said it established that the russian government perceived it would benefit from a trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome and that the campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through russian efforts trump and his gop allies typically point to the steele dossier as the basis for the russia probe but the fbi s investigation began months before it received the dossier ___ trump what kind of a rigged deal is this and then on top of it after two years and after being the most transparent in history abc news interview aired sunday trump the democrats were very unhappy with the mueller report so now they re trying to do a do over or a redo and we re not doing that we gave them everything we were the most transparent presidency in history oval office remarks wednesday the facts it s highly dubious to say trump was fully cooperative in the russia investigation trump declined to sit for an interview with mueller s team gave written answers that investigators described as inadequate and incomplete said more than 30 times that he could not remember something he was asked about in writing and according to the report tried to get aides to fire mueller or otherwise shut or limit the inquiry in the end the mueller report found no criminal conspiracy between the trump campaign and russia but left open the question of whether trump obstructed justice according to the report mueller s team declined to make a prosecutorial judgment on whether to charge partly because of a justice department legal opinion that said sitting presidents shouldn t be indicted the report instead factually laid out instances in which trump might have obstructed justice specifically leaving it open for congress to take up the matter ___ iran trump speaking about iranians screaming death to america when barack obama was in the white house they haven t screamed death to america lately fox news interview friday the facts yes they have the death to america chant is heard routinely the chant marg bar amreeka in farsi dates back even before iran s 1979 islamic revolution once used by communists it was popularized by ayatollah ruhollah khomeini the revolution s figurehead and iran s first supreme leader after the u s embassy takeover by militants it remains a staple of hard line demonstrations meetings with current supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei official ceremonies parliamentary sessions and main friday prayer services in tehran and across the country some masters of ceremonies ask audiences to tone it down but it was heard for example from the crowd this month when khamenei exhorted thousands to stand up against u s bullying in one variation a demonstrator at tehran s quds rally last month held a sign with three versions of the slogan death to america in farsi death to america in arabic down with u s a in english ___ north korea trump i think we re going to do very well with north korea over a period of time i m in no rush our remains are coming back you saw the beautiful ceremony in hawaii with mike pence we re getting the remains back joint news conference wednesday with poland s president the facts the u s is not currently getting additional remains of american service members killed during the korean war with u s north korea relations souring the pentagon said last month it had suspended its efforts to arrange negotiations this year on recovering additional remains of american service members the pentagon said it hoped to reach agreement for recovery operations in 2020 the defense pow mia accounting agency said it has had no communication with north korean authorities since the vietnam summit between trump and north korean leader kim jong un in february that meeting focused on the north s nuclear weapons and followed a june 2018 summit where kim committed to permitting a resumption of u s remains recovery that effort had been suspended by the u s in 2005 the agency said it had reached the point where we can no longer effectively plan coordinate and conduct field operations with the north during this budget year which ends sept 30 last summer in line with the first trump kim summit in june the north turned over 55 boxes of what it said were the remains of an undetermined number of u s service members killed in the north during the 1950 53 war so far six americans have been identified from the 55 boxes u s officials have said the north has suggested in recent years that it holds perhaps 200 sets of american war remains thousands more are unrecovered from battlefields and former pow camps the pentagon estimates that about 5 300 americans were lost in north korea ___ border wall trump the wall is going up it s going up rapidly we re going to have over 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year and we just won the lawsuit on the wall fox news interview friday trump by next year at the end of the year we re going to have close to 500 miles of wall remarks tuesday at the republican party of iowa annual dinner the facts he s being overly optimistic it s unclear how trump arrives at 400 to 500 miles 800 km but he would have to prevail in legal challenges to his declaration of a national emergency or get congress to cough up more money to get anywhere close those are big assumptions and by far the majority of the wall he s talking about is replacement barrier not new miles of construction so far the administration has awarded contracts for 247 miles 395 km of wall construction but more than half comes from defense department money available under trump s feb 15 emergency declaration on may 24 a federal judge in california who was appointed by obama blocked trump from building key sections of the wall with that money in a separate case a federal judge in the nation s capital who was appointed by trump sided with the administration but that ruling has no effect while the california injunction is in place even if trump prevails in court all but 17 miles 27 km of his awarded contracts replace existing barriers the white house says it has identified up to 8 1 billion in potential money under the national emergency mostly from the defense department customs and border protection officials say the administration wants congress to finance 206 miles 330 km next year the chances of the democratic controlled house backing that are between slim and none ___ trade trump right now we re getting 25 on 250 billion worth of goods that s a lot of money that s pouring into our treasury we ve never gotten 10 cents from china now we re getting a lot of money from china remarks on june 10 with indianapolis 500 champions trump we re taking in right now billions and billions of dollars in tariffs and they re subsidizing product remarks tuesday in council bluffs the facts he s incorrect the tariffs he s raised on imports from china are primarily if not entirely a tax on u s consumers and businesses not a source of significant revenue coming into the country a study in march by economists from the federal reserve bank of new york columbia university and princeton university before the latest escalation found that the public and u s companies were paying 3 billion a month in higher taxes from the trade dispute with china suffering 1 4 billion a month in lost efficiency and absorbing the entire impact it s also false that the u s never collected a dime in tariffs before he took action tariffs on goods from china are not remotely new they are simply higher in some cases than they were before tariffs go back to the beginning of the u s and were once a leading source of revenue for the government not in modern times they equate to less than 1 of federal spending ___ trump look without tariffs we would be captive to every country and we have been for many years that s why we have an 800 billion trading deficit for years we lose a fortune with virtually every country they take advantage of us in every way possible cnbc interview on june 10 the facts trump isn t telling the whole story about trade deficits when he refers to 800 billion trade gaps he s only talking about the deficit in goods such as cars and aircraft he leaves out services such as banking tourism and education in which the u s runs substantial trade surpluses that partially offset persistent deficits in goods the goods and services deficit peaked at 762 billion in 2006 last year the united states ran a record 887 billion deficit in goods and a 260 billion surplus in services which added up to an overall deficit of more than 627 billion the u s does tend to run trade deficits with most other major economies but there are exceptions such as canada a nearly 4 billion surplus last year singapore 18 billion and britain 19 billion mainstream economists reject trump s argument that the deficits arise from other countries taking advantage of the united states they see the trade gaps as the result of an economic reality that probably won t bend to tariffs and other changes in trade policy americans buy more than they produce and imports fill the gap u s exports are also hurt by the american dollar s status as the world s currency the dollar is usually in high demand because it is used in so many global transactions that means the dollar is persistently strong raising prices of u s products and putting american companies at a disadvantage in foreign markets ___ federal reserve trump we have people on the fed that really weren t you know they re not my people but they certainly didn t listen to me because they made a big mistake cnbc interview on june 10 the facts actually most of the members on the fed s board of governors owe their jobs to trump in addition to choosing jerome powell a republican whom obama had named to the fed board to be chairman trump has filled three other vacancies on the board in his first two years in office lael brainard is the only democrat on the board there are still two vacancies on the seven member board trump had earlier intended to nominate two political allies herman cain and stephen moore but both later withdrew in the face of sharp opposition from critics ___ automakers trump all of the car companies you know long before i got here we lost 32 percent of our car industry our automobile manufacturing business to mexico fox news interview friday trump tariffs are a great negotiating tool a great revenue producer and most importantly a powerful way to get companies to come to the u s a and to get companies that have left us for other lands to come back home we stupidly lost 30 of our auto business to mexico tweets tuesday the facts he s incorrect that mexico took 30 of the u s automobile business in the years since the north american free trade agreement took effect in 1994 in 2017 14 of the vehicles sold in the u s were imported from mexico according to the center for automotive research a think tank in ann arbor michigan parts imported from mexico exceed 30 ___ trump if i put tariffs on as an example mexico you know what would happen 25 all the car companies would move back to the united states because they don t want to pay the 25 fox news interview friday trump if the tariffs went on at the higher level they would all come back tweet tuesday the facts he s wrong to assume that auto companies in mexico would immediately move back to the u s if there were a 25 tariff on mexican made vehicles and parts it takes three years or four years minimum to plan equip and build an auto assembly plant so there would be little immediate impact on production or jobs auto and parts makers are global companies and they would also look to countries without tariffs as a place to move their factories the companies could also just wait until after the 2020 election hoping that if trump is defeated the next president would get rid of the tariffs they re not going to invest in duplicative capacity in response to short term policy incentives said kristen dziczek a vice president at the center for automotive research it is possible that some production could be shifted back to the united states general motors for instance makes about 39 of its full size pickup trucks at a factory in silao mexico mainly light duty versions according to analysts at morningstar if the u s imposed a 25 tariff on assembled automobiles gm could shift some production to a factory in fort wayne indiana that also makes light duty pickups but there are limits that plant already is running on three shifts and is almost near its maximum capacity tariffs on mexico probably would cost auto jobs in the u s too because mexico would almost certainly retaliate with tariffs of its own tariffs on both sides would raise prices of vehicles because automakers probably would pass the charges onto their customers industry experts say higher prices would cause more buyers to shift into the used vehicle market cutting into new vehicle sales tariffs could be higher than 25 because parts go back and forth across the border multiple times in a highly integrated supply chain vehicles built in mexico get 20 to 30 of their parts from the u s so the tariffs would drive up prices there that would hit lower income people hard because automakers produce many lower priced new vehicles in mexico to take advantage of cheaper labor about 62 of u s vehicle and parts exports go to canada and mexico according to the center for automotive research tariffs would add 1 300 to 4 500 to the price of vehicles based just on the cost of parts the center estimated ___ associated press writers christopher rugaber eric

president trump in the midst of a year long trade battle with china ratcheted up the pressure on monday the treasury department officially labeled beijing as a currency manipulator allegations that trump has long heralded now the treasury department will work with the international monetary fund to try to undo the unfair advantage created by china s latest actions currently the yuan is around an exchange rate higher than 7 compared to the u s dollar advertisement advertisement but it s not the first that trump has criticized the monetary policy set by foreign governments at the beginning of the month the president accused china and the european union of intentionally deflating the value of their currencies even as the u s dollar remains relatively strong china and europe playing big currency manipulation game and pumping money into their system in order to compete with usa he wrote we should match or continue being the dummies who sit back and politely watch as other countries continue to play their games as they have for many years trump previously pushed back against the european central bank claiming the european bloc was unfairly competing against the greenback by deflating the value of the euro mario draghi just announced more stimulus could come which immediately dropped the euro against the dollar making it unfairly easier for them to compete against the usa trump wrote in a tweet they have been getting away with this for years along with china and others advertisement advertisement at the time draghi said the ecb was ready to cut interest rates if the economy needed it during a speech in portugal draghi noted that further cuts in policy rates remain part of our tools but why does the president think a weaker u s dollar is better for the economy essentially if the u s dollar is worth less relative to other currencies foreign countries are likely to buy more american goods boosting things like u s manufacturing while simultaneously helping to close the trade deficit trump frequently accused china of keeping its currency the yuan intentionally low to make exports cheaper and therefore increase the trade imbalance story continues and since trump has taken office the dollar has remained strong much to his displeasure thanks to protectionist trade policies a big fiscal stimulus from the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act and monetary policy set by the federal reserve i want a strong dollar but i want a dollar that does great for our country not a dollar that s so strong that it makes it prohibitive for us to do business with other nations and take their business trump said during a speech in march before launching into criticism of fed chairman jerome powell we have a gentleman that likes a very strong dollar in the fed he added referring to powell click here to get the fox business app advertisement advertisement although the fed cut interest rates by 25 basis points during its july meeting the dollar has remained strong related articles

there is nothing natural about money there is no link to some scarce essential form of money that sets a limit to its creation it can be composed of base metal paper or electronic data none of which is in short supply similarly despite what you may have heard about the need for austerity and a lack of certain cash generating trees there is no natural level of public expenditure the size and reach of the public sector is a matter of political choice which puts austerity the culling of expenditure in the public economy under some question for some countries such as greece the impact of austerity has been devastating austerity policies still persist despite numerous studies arguing that they were entirely misconceived based on political choice rather than economic logic but the economic case for austerity is equally mistaken it is based on what can best be described as fairytale economics so what were the justifications britain for example has lived under an austerity regime since 2010 when the incoming tory liberal democrat government reversed the labour policy of raising the level of public expenditure in response to the 2007 8 financial crisis the crisis had created a perfect storm bank rescue required high levels of public spending while economic contraction reduced tax income the case for austerity was that the higher level of public expenditure could not be afforded by the taxpayer this was supported by handbag economics which adopts the analogy of states as being like households dependent on a private sector breadwinner this article is part of conversation insights the conversation s insights team generates long form journalism derived from interdisciplinary research the team is working with academics from different backgrounds who have been engaged in projects aimed at tackling societal and scientific challenges in generating these narratives we hope to bring areas of interdisciplinary research to a wider audience you can read more insights stories here under handbag economics states are required to restrict their expenditure to what the taxpayer is deemed to be able to afford states must not try to increase their spending by borrowing from the private financial sector or by printing money although the banks were rescued by doing so by another name quantitative easing the creation of electronic money the ideology of handbag economics claims that money is to be generated only through market activity and that it is always in short supply request for increased public expenditure is almost invariably met with the response where s the money to come from when confronted by low pay in the nhs the british prime minister theresa may famously declared there is no magic money tree so where does money come from and what is money anyway what is money until the last 50 years or so the answer seemed to be obvious money was represented by cash notes and coin when money was tangible there seemed no question about its origin or its value coins were minted banknotes were printed both were authorised by governments or central banks but what is money today in richer economies the use of cash is declining rapidly most monetary transactions are based on transfers between accounts no physical money is involved in the run up to the financial crisis the state s role in relation to money held in bank accounts was ambiguous banking was a monitored and licensed activity with some level of state guarantee of bank deposits but the actual act of creating bank accounts was and is seen as a private matter there may be regulations and limitations but there is no detailed scrutiny of bank accounts and bank lending yet as the 2007 8 financial crisis showed when bank accounts came under threat as banks teetered on the edge of bankruptcy states and central banks had to step in and guarantee the security of all deposit accounts the viability of money in non investment bank accounts was demonstrated to be as much a public responsibility as cash kate mc author provided this raises fundamental questions about money as a social institution is it right that money can be generated by a private choice to take on debt which then becomes a liability of the state to guarantee in a crisis but far from seeing money as a public resource under neoliberal handbag economics money creation and circulation has increasingly been seen as a function of the market money is made solely in the private sector public spending is seen as a drain on that money justifying austerity to make the public sector as small as possible this stance however is based on a complete misunderstanding of the nature of money sustained by a series of deeply embedded myths myths about money neoliberal handbag economics is derived from two key myths about the origin and nature of money the first is that money emerged from a previous market economy based on barter the second is that money was originally made from precious metal it is claimed that bartering proved to be very inefficient as each buyer seller needed to find another person who exactly matched their requirements a hat maker might barter a hat for some shoes she needs but what if the shoe maker is in no need of a hat the solution to this problem so the story goes was to choose one commodity that everyone desired to act as a medium of exchange precious metal gold and silver was the obvious choice because it had its own value and could be easily divided and carried this view of the origin of money goes back to at least the 18th century the time of economist adam smith these myths led to two assumptions about money that are still current today first that money is essentially connected to and generated by the marketplace second that modern money like its original and ideal form is always in short supply hence the neoliberal claim that public spending is a drain on the wealth creating capacity of the market and that public spending must always be as limited as possible money is seen as a commercial instrument serving a basic market technical transactional function with no social or political force but the real story of money is very different evidence from anthropology and history shows that there was no widespread barter before markets based on money developed and precious metal coinage emerged long before market economies there are also many forms of money other than precious metal coins money as custom something that acts as money has existed in most if not all human societies stones shells beads cloths brass rods and many other forms have been the means of comparing and acknowledging comparative value but this was rarely used in a market context most early human communities lived directly off the land hunting fishing gathering and gardening the customary money in such communities was used mainly to celebrate auspicious social events or serve as a way of resolving social conflict for example the lele people who lived in what is now the democratic republic of congo in the 1950s calculated value in woven raffia cloths the number of cloths required for different occasions was fixed by custom twenty cloths should be given to a father by a son on achieving adulthood and a similar amount given to a wife on the birth of a child the anthropologist mary douglas who studied the lele found they were resistant to using the cloths in transactions with outsiders indicating that the cloths had a specific cultural relevance even stranger is the large stone money of the yap people of micronesia huge circular discs of stone could weigh up to four metric tons not something to put in your pocket for a trip to the shops there is plenty of other anthropological evidence such as this all over the world all pointing to the fact that money in its earliest form served a social rather than market based purpose money as power for most traditional societies the origin of the particular money form has been lost in the mist of time but the origin and adoption of money as an institution became much more obvious with the emergence of states money did not originate as precious metal coinage with the development of markets in fact the new invention of precious metal coinage in around 600bc was adopted and controlled by imperial rulers to build their empires by waging war most notable was alexander the great who ruled from 336 323bc he is said to have used half a ton of silver a day to fund his largely mercenary army rather than a share of the spoils the traditional payment he had more than 20 mints producing coins which had images of gods and heroes and the word alexandrou of alexander from that time new ruling regimes have tended to herald their arrival by a new coinage more than a thousand years after the invention of coinage the holy roman emperor charlemagne 742 814 who ruled most of western and central europe developed what became the basis of the british pre decimal money system pounds shillings and pence charlemagne set up a currency system based on 240 pennies minted from a pound of silver the pennies became established as the denier in france the pfennig in germany the dinero in spain the denari in italy and the penny in britain so the real story of money as coinage was not one of barterers and traders it emerged instead from a long history of politics war and conflict money was an active agent in state and empire building not a passive representation of price in the market control of the money supply was a major power of rulers a sovereign power money was created and spent into circulation by rulers either directly like alexander or through taxation or seizure of private holdings of precious metal nor was early money necessarily based on precious metal in fact precious metal was relatively useless for building empires because it was in short supply even in the roman era base metal was used and charlemagne s new money eventually became debased in china gold and silver did not feature and paper money was being used as early as the 9th century what the market economy did introduce was a new form of money money as debt money as debt if you look at a 20 banknote you will see it says i promise to pay the bearer on demand the sum of twenty pounds this is a promise originally made by the bank of england to exchange notes for the sovereign currency the banknote was a new form of money unlike sovereign money it was not a statement of value but a promise of value a coin even if made of base metal was exchangeable in its own right it did not represent another superior form of money but when banknotes were first invented they did the new invention of promissory notes emerged through the needs of trade in the 16th and 17th centuries promissory notes were used to acknowledge receipt of loans or investments and the obligation to repay them through the fruits of future transactions a major task of the emerging profession of banking was to periodically set all these promises against each other and see who owed what to whom this process of clearing meant that a great amount of paper commitments was reduced to relatively less actual transfer of money final settlement was either by payment with sovereign money coins or another promissory note banknote eventually the banknotes became so trusted that they were treated as money in their own right in britain they became equivalent to the coinage particularly when they were united under the banner of the bank of england today if you took a banknote to the bank of england it would merely exchange your note for one that is exactly the same banknotes are no longer promises they are the currency there is no other real money behind them what modern money does retain is its association with debt unlike sovereign money which was created and spent directly into circulation modern money is largely borrowed into circulation through the banking system this process shelters behind another myth that banks merely act as a link between savers and borrowers in fact banks create money and it is only in the last decade that this powerful myth has been finally put to rest by banking and monetary authorities it is now acknowledged by monetary authorities such as the imf the us federal reserve and the bank of england that banks are creating new money when they make loans they don t lend the money of other account holders to those who want to borrow bank loans consist of money conjured out of thin air whereby new money is credited to the borrowers account with the agreement that the amount will eventually be repaid with interest the policy implications of the public currency being created out of nowhere and lent to borrowers on a purely commercial basis have still not been taken on board nor has basing a public currency on debt as opposed to the sovereign power to create and directly circulate money free of debt the result is that rather than using their own sovereign power over money creation as alexander the great did states have become borrowers from the private sector where there are public spending deficits or the need for large scale future expenditure there is an expectation that the state will borrow the money or increase taxation rather than create the money itself dilemmas of debt but basing a money supply on debt is ecologically socially and economically problematic ecologically there is a problem because the need to pay off debt could drive potentially damaging growth money creation based on repaying debt with interest must imply constant growth in the money supply if this is achieved through increasing productive capacity there will inevitably be pressure on natural resources basing the money supply on debt is also socially discriminatory because not all citizens are in a position to take on debt the pattern of the money supply will tend to favour the already rich or the most speculative risk taker recent decades for example have seen a huge amount of borrowing by the financial sector to enhance their investments the economic problem is that the money supply depends on the capacity of the various elements of the economy public and private to take on more debt and so as countries have become more dependent upon bank created money debt bubbles and credit crunches have become more frequent this is because handbag economics creates an impossible task for the private sector it has to create all new money through bank issued debt and repay it all with interest it has to completely fund the public sector and generate a profit for investors but when the privatised bank led money supply flounders the money creating powers of the state come back into clear focus this was particularly plain in the 2007 8 crisis when central banks created new money in the process known as quantitative easing central banks used the sovereign power to create money free of debt to spend directly into the economy by buying up existing government debt and other financial assets for example the question then becomes if the state as represented by the central bank can create money out of thin air to save the banks why can t it create money to save the people money for the people the myths about money have led us to look at public spending and taxation the wrong way around taxation and spending like bank lending and repayment is in a constant flow handbag economics assumes that it is taxation of the private sector that is raising the money to fund the public sector that taxation takes money out of the taxpayer s pocket but the long political history of sovereign power over money would indicate that the flow of money can be in the opposite direction in the same way that banks can conjure money out of thin air to make loans states can conjure money out of thin air to fund public spending banks create money by setting up bank accounts states create money by allocating budgets when governments set budgets they do not see how much money they have in a pre existing taxation piggybank the budget allocates spending commitments that may or may not match the amount of money coming in through taxation through its accounts in the treasury and the central bank the state is constantly spending out and taking in money if it spends more money than it takes in it leaves more money in people s pockets this creates a budget deficit and what is effectively an overdraft at the central bank is this a problem yes if the state is treated as if it was any other bank account holder the dependent household of handbag economics no if it is seen as an independent source of money states do not need to wait for handouts from the commercial sector states are the authority behind the money system the power exercised by the banks to create the public currency out of thin air is a sovereign power it is no longer necessary to mint coins like alexander money can be created by keystrokes there is no reason why this should be monopolised by the banking sector to create new public money as debt deeming public spending as being equivalent to bank borrowing denies the public the sovereign people in a democracy the right to access its own money free of debt redefining money this foray into the historical and anthropological stories about money shows that long held conceptions that money emerged from a previous market economy based on barter and that it was originally made from precious metal are fairytales we need to recognise this and we need to capitalise on the public ability to create money but it is also important to recognise that the sovereign power to create money is not a solution in itself both the state and bank capacity to create money have advantages and disadvantages both can be abused the reckless lending of the banking sector for example led to the near meltdown of the american and european monetary and financial system on the other hand where countries do not have a developed banking sector the money supply remains in the hands of the state with massive room for corruption and mismanagement the answer must be to subject both forms of money creation bank and state to democratic accountability far from being a technical commercial instrument money can be seen as a social and political construct that has immense radical potential our ability to harness this is hampered if we do not understand what money is and how it works money must become our servant rather than our master mary mellor s new book money myths truths and alternatives is published by policy press on july 3 for you more from our insights

central banks are prepared to take fresh measures to strengthen and extend the business cycle primarily because price pressures are below what their predecessors thought would be acceptable levels draghi speaking for the ecb the federal reserve and the bank of japan ratcheted up their concerns which even without new initiatives were sufficient to drive interest rates lower there is no real definition of many terms economists throw around like recession or depression the two negative quarters of declining gdp is not a technical definition but a rule of thumb ironically there weren t recessions before the great depression the end of business or credit cycles were called panics and crises the use of recession appears to have been applied to economies to distinguish the end of the business cycle from the great depression neither the us nor europe seems to be on the verge of an economic contraction given a shrinking population the japanese economy can contract and per capita gdp can still rise the bundesbank warned last week that the german economy may have contracted in q2 but the eurozone flash composite pmi suggests the region expanded although the composite pmi averaged 51 8 in q2 following a 51 5 average in q1 gdp growth maybe half of the 0 4 in recorded in the first three months of the year the most important data point for the eurozone next week is the flash cpi reading some may see it as a non story as headline inflation is expected to remain at 1 2 and the core rate at 0 8 unchanged data is the story draghi was clear if conditions do not improve the ecb needs to provide more stimulus the federal reserve took a different spin the median economic forecasts were little changed but acknowledged softer price pressures the fed argued that it was the uncertainty around the economic forecasts that spurred the change in stance it exited its patient mode and appears poised to pounce on signs that the economy is faltering the atlanta fed s gdp tracker puts q2 us growth near 2 0 annualized the us report a revised estimate of q1 gdp on june 27 it is likely to remain a little above 3 0 so even if the ny fed s gdp tracker is right and growth in q2 is closer to 1 4 growth in h1 has seen been above trend although job growth appears to have slowed it has been enough to keep the unemployment rate at the lowest in a generation the low participation rate likely reflects a myriad of social issues well beyond the reach of monetary policy the day after the q1 gdp revisions the government reports personal consumption expenditures the continued jobs growth and wages growing above the rate of inflation has helped underpin consumption household consumption averaged a monthly increase of 0 5 a month in q1 after 0 2 in q4 18 and 0 3 for the entire year after a 0 3 increase in april consumption is expected to have firmed to 0 5 the american consumer remains the bedrock of the economy the year over year pace of the pce deflator is likely to be unchanged like eurozone s cpi though a bit higher of levels 1 5 at the headline which is what fed formally targets and the 1 6 core rate the market has discounted three fed rate cuts in h2 when there are four meetings some economists expect the first move to be 50 bp though the two precedents cited began with significantly higher interest rates fed president kashkari a non voting member of the fomc this year said that he advocated a 50 bp cut now however he failed to convince a single colleague even bullard who gave the first dissent under powell s chairmanship in favor of an immediate cut nor did kashkari convince the seven fed officials who do agree that 50 bp of cuts may be appropriate this year still it is difficult to imagine how much more fed easing can be discounted this year suggesting the market may have reached peak dovishness an insurance policy move of 25 or maybe even 50 bp is one thing but a campaign as the market has discounted into next year frontloaded due to political considerations is a horse of a different color operating broadly under the decision making principle of minimizing your maximum regret the fed wants to nurture and extend the recovery that seems like a noble goal however the widespread narrative which fed officials themselves have helped to propagate that the fed kills recoveries have led to poor economic outcomes over the past thirty years there have been three crises in the vernacular the s l crisis the tech bubble and the great financial crisis exactly none were caused by the federal reserve tightening monetary policy to the contrary each seems to have emanated from too lax of policy broadly understood to include regulatory authority have we collectively forgot about the insight from hyman minsky again to the extent the great moderation of longer and flatter business cycles and low inflation is due to a structural shift market economies rise of the less cyclical service sector international competition better inventory management big business becoming more self financing and changing demographics low interest rates for an extended period of time require other macroprudential tools in the framework i presented in my book political economy of tomorrow the underlying problem is one of absorbing surplus capital or what a bain study called the super abundance of capital the implication is that the long term secular decline in interest rates will persist until we find a way to absorb or destroy the capital we are cursed as old king midas was with wealth beyond what previous generations could only dream of and more there is so much capital that if all you want is a passive risk free return you increasingly are penalized for that isn t that the meaning of 13 trillion of negative yielding bonds the implication is that the long term secular decline in interest rates will persist until we find a way to absorb or destroy the capital we are cursed as old king midas was with wealth beyond what previous generations could only dream of and more there is so much capital that if all you want is a passive risk free return you increasingly are penalized for that isn t that the meaning of 13 trillion of negative yielding bonds the swiss 30 year yield has been negative since the start of the month and now some are asking whether the 30 year german bund currently yielding a little less than 30 bp can join it in negative territory the yield of the us 10 year note has been trending lower since 1981 through business cycles and a range of monetary policy frameworks and content the surplus capital challenge is secular not cyclical lower interest rates mean that investors should lower expectations for future returns there is another implication the internal hurdle rate for investments by corporations also needs to be reduced the failure to do so leads to under investment and more cash which is paying a diminishing return just like the idea of carbon traps is to taking this poisonous gas out of the air what is popularly called financialization was an attempt to create a place that could absorb the vast amounts capital that was being built which industry did not need so much what the great financial crisis did was to illustrate the limitations or challenges in managing the consequences said differently an important takeaway from the gfc was that the financialization process can lead to instability that has a feedback loop into the real economy china is part of the story too and also a part that we seem to lose track of the underlying strategy from a political economy point of view the real threat from china does not come from the places that seem to capture people s attention like bad loans and ghost cities these are issues for china but the global challenge arises from china s huge capacity the strategy was to integrate china into the world economy with things like the wto ascension to help manage this process like brexit the absorption of china s vast scale can happen orderly or disorderly and the risks of a disruptive outcome appear to have increased either way the thrust is deflationary aggravating those forces that are pushing down the cost of capital in the high income countries news that us and chinese negotiators are talking again ahead of trump and xi s meeting next weekend was greeted with a spurt optimism and equity buying the combination of the monetary signals and the trade talks lifted the shanghai composite nearly 4 5 last week to two month highs while the s p 500 was up half as much but closed at new record highs apparently the us administration thinks that a speech by the vice president criticizing china s human right practices is too provocative before the trade talks so it has been delayed again but blacklisting five more tech companies that are involved with china s super computer efforts is acceptable and was announced before the weekend the declaratory position of each side suggests little scope for an agreement china insists on unilateral disarmament the us must rescind all of its tariffs that have been imposed the us demands a concession from china for past wrongs and that fundamentally alter its economic development model comments by president trump have fanned chinese fears that america s real goal is to contain it china s flaunting of international trade norms is disruptive and perceived as aggressive acts the most that can reasonably be hoped for from the trump xi meeting is another cease fire in the trade war trump would suspend the 25 tariff on the remaining 325 bln or so of chinese imports that could go into effect as early as next month trade talks would resume perhaps for some fixed period a trade agreement will be hard enough to strike let alone a grand bargain despite the implications of chinese demographics chinese officials see time on their side it has not peaked while many see the us as in an inexorable decline disclaimer

caught between muted inflation and the prospect of a trade war the federal reserve has a fine line to walk at its meeting next week wall street is growing more certain that the central bank will implement one if not more interest rate cuts this year the consumer price index ticked up just 0 1 percent in may following a 0 3 percent increase the previous month in addition to wednesday s inflation measures the department of labor said thursday that import prices for may fell by 0 3 percent a steeper drop than expected this weaker than expected inflation data gives the fed a more compelling case for a rate cut adding to the growing amount of data that indicates a softening economy this adds to the narrative that the fed is likely to begin cutting rates later this year against the backdrop of slowing economic growth said emily roland head of capital markets research at john hancock investment management the reason the cpi data matters is it reinforces in the fed s mind what s been a troubling trend of slowing inflation that s less than their target said joseph lavorgna managing director and chief economist of the americas at natixis if the fed does pivot toward a more dovish stance as many expect more accommodative monetary policy will be driven by a combination of economic metrics signaling slower growth and worry about the destabilizing effect of a potential trade war with china the median dot plot from the march meeting showed one rate hike for next year but the bond market is now pricing in three rate cuts roland said for an institution that prizes stability and balance this turnaround has come at a surprising pace it s been a remarkable shift in the posture of the fed in just the past few weeks said dan north chief economist at euler hermes north america the numbers came in a little bit lighter than expected which means the fed does have some more room to consider a cut said brad mcmillan chief investment officer at commonwealth financial network but that move would be unlikely to come right away the fed has always said they are data dependent and the current data suggests they shouldn t do anything mcmillan said my guess is they ll hold off a little bit longer to get some clarity on maybe how the next payroll numbers are showing up gdp revisions maybe some progress on g 20 with trade lavorgna said the fed has a lot of reasons to cut rates it s not just the trade issues among economists though there is a growing expectation that the language used by fed chairman jerome powell will indicate that the prospect of a rate cut in july is on the table wall street always parses the minutiae of fed remarks but reading tea leaves this time around is a particularly high stakes activity at this point the fed is in a sit tight posture they re waiting to see what happens i m going to be looking for any sign that they re shifting from watchful waiting to we have to act mcmillan said they re very aware of what could go wrong the biggest unknown is the outcome of a potential china trade deal if the white house and beijing fail to meet at the g 20 summit later this month and forge a deal that will avert tariffs being levied on the entirety of chinese goods entering the u s the case for faster monetary easing grows stronger it all boils down to whether the fed is really concerned about the economic danger of the trade war mcmillan said the fed s other challenge is one of optics economists say president donald trump has frequently criticized his appointee to lead the central bank and called for lower interest rates the appearance that the central bank is acting on trump s bidding would hurt the fed s reputation and would be likely to spook investors if they continue to ease and it looks like they re doing it at the president s direction that does considerable damage to market confidence mcmillan said i actually do think that s part of the decision north said but we re also looking at weak data he said if indications of a slowdown continue to accumulate in prices consumption and job growth metrics it increases the likelihood that trump will eventually get his rate cut especially if the trade standoff is not resolved it appears that there is pressure to have a powell put on the economy north said but the fundamentals justify it as well it s not just what trump is saying

with the global economy enjoying uninterrupted growth for the last 10 years there is an increasing view that a recession is around the corner the view is getting louder by the day but one contrarian to this view is this there is plenty of room for growth albeit at a slower pace and while there will likely be a slowdown in growth it will not translate into a recession which is defined by a contraction in the economy for multiple quarters the main reason for the slowdown is the growing fears from the trade war between the united states and china

creation it can be composed of base metal paper or electronic data none of which is in short supply similarly despite what you may have heard about the need for austerity and a lack of certain cash generating trees there is no natural level of public expenditure the size and reach of the public sector is a matter of political choice which puts austerity the culling of expenditure in the public economy under some question for some countries such as greece the impact of austerity has been devastating austerity policies still persist despite numerous studies arguing that they were entirely misconceived based on political choice rather than economic logic but the economic case for austerity is equally mistaken it is based on what can best be described as fairytale economics so what were the justifications britain for example has lived under an austerity regime since 2010 when the tory liberal democrat government reversed the labour policy of raising the level of public expenditure in response to the 2007 08 financial crisis the crisis had created a perfect storm bank rescue required high levels of public spending while economic contraction reduced tax income the case for austerity was that the higher level of public expenditure could not be afforded by the taxpayer this was supported by a handbag economics that adopts the analogy of states as being like households dependent on a private sector breadwinner under handbag economics states are required to restrict their expenditure to what the taxpayer is deemed to be able to afford states must not try to increase their spending by borrowing from the private financial sector or by printing money although the banks were rescued by doing so by another name quantitative easing the creation of electronic money the ideology of handbag economics claims that money is to be generated only through market activity and that it is always in short supply request for increased public expenditure is almost invariably met with the response where s the money to come from when confronted by low pay in the nhs the british prime minister theresa may famously declared there is no magic money tree so where does money come from and what is money anyway what is money until the last 50 years or so the answer seemed to be obvious money was represented by cash notes and coin when money was tangible there seemed no question about its origin or its value coins were minted banknotes were printed both were authorised by governments or central banks but what is money today in the richer economies the use of cash is declining rapidly most monetary transactions are based on transfers between accounts no physical money is involved attacking labour s magic money tree was a theme in theresa may s 2017 general election campaign wpa pool getty in the run up to the financial crisis the state s role in relation to money held in bank accounts was ambiguous banking was a monitored and licensed activity with some level of state guarantee of bank deposits but the actual act of creating bank accounts was and is seen as a private matter there may be regulations and limitations but there is no detailed scrutiny of bank accounts and bank lending yet as the 2007 08 financial crisis showed when bank accounts came under threat as banks teetered on the edge of bankruptcy states and central banks had to step in and guarantee the security of all deposit accounts the viability of money in non investment bank accounts was demonstrated to be as much a public responsibility as cash this raises fundamental questions about money as a social institution is it right that money can be generated by a private choice to take on debt which then becomes a liability of the state to guarantee in a crisis but far from seeing money as a public resource under neoliberal handbag economics money creation and circulation has increasingly been seen as a function of the market money is made solely in the private sector public spending is seen as a drain on that money justifying austerity to make the public sector as small as possible this stance however is based on a complete misunderstanding of the nature of money sustained by a series of deeply embedded myths myths about money neoliberal handbag economics is derived from two key myths about the origin and nature of money the first is that money emerged from a previous market economy based on barter the second is that money was originally made from precious metal it is claimed that bartering proved to be very inefficient as each buyer seller needed to find another person who exactly matched their requirements a hat maker might barter a hat for some shoes she needs but what if the shoe maker is in no need of a hat the solution to this problem so the story goes was to choose one commodity that everyone desired to act as a medium of exchange precious metal gold and silver was the obvious choice because it had its own value and could be easily divided and carried this view of the origin of money goes back to at least the 18th century the time of adam smith in pictures anti austerity protest outside downing street show all 7 1 7 in pictures anti austerity

balls towards downing street these myths led to two assumptions about money that are still current first that money is essentially connected to and generated by the marketplace second that modern money like its original and ideal form is always in short supply hence the neoliberal claim that public spending is a drain on the wealth creating capacity of the market and that public spending must always be as limited as possible money is seen as a commercial instrument serving a basic market technical transactional function with no social or political force but the real story of money is very different evidence from anthropology and history shows that there was no widespread barter before markets based on money developed and precious metal coinage emerged long before market economies there are also many forms of money other than precious metal coins money as custom something that acts as money has existed in most if not all human societies stones shells beads cloths brass rods and many other forms have been the means of comparing and acknowledging comparative value but this was rarely used in a market context most early human communities lived directly off the land hunting fishing gathering and gardening the customary money in such communities was used mainly to celebrate auspicious social events or serve as a way of resolving social conflict for example the lele people who lived in what is now the democratic republic of congo in the 1950s calculated value in woven raffia cloths the number of cloths required for different occasions was fixed by custom twenty cloths should be given to a father by a son on achieving adulthood and a similar amount given to a wife on the birth of a child the anthropologist mary douglas who studied the lele found they were resistant to using the cloths in transactions with outsiders indicating that the cloths had a specific cultural relevance even stranger is the large stone money of the yap people of micronesia huge circular discs of stone could weigh up to four tons not something to put in your pocket for a trip to the shops the yapese of micronesia would need a forklift to cart about their cash anna lee cc by nc nd 2 0 there is plenty of other anthropological evidence such as this all over the world all pointing to the fact that money in its earliest form served a social rather than market based purpose money as power for most traditional societies the origin of the particular money form has been lost in the mist of time but the origin and adoption of money as an institution became much more obvious with the emergence of states money did not originate as precious metal coinage with the development of markets in fact the new invention of precious metal coinage in around 600bce was adopted and controlled by imperial rulers to build their empires by waging war most notable was alexander the great who ruled from 336 323bce he is said to have used half a ton of silver a day to fund his largely mercenary army rather than a share of the spoils the traditional payment he had more than 20 mints producing coins which had images of gods and heroes and the word alexandrou of alexander from that time new ruling regimes have tended to herald their arrival by a new coinage more than a thousand years after the invention of coinage the holy roman emperor charlemagne 742 814 who ruled most of western and central europe developed what became the basis of the british pre decimal money system pounds shillings and pence charlemagne set up a currency system based on 240 pennies minted from a pound of silver the pennies became established as the denier in france the pfennig in germany the dinero in spain the denari in italy and the penny in britain these greek coins date back 2 400 years afp getty so the real story of money as coinage was not one of barterers and traders it emerged instead from a long history of politics war and conflict money was an active agent in state and empire building not a passive representation of price in the market control of the money supply was a major power of rulers a sovereign power money was created and spent into circulation by rulers either directly like alexander or through taxation or seizure of private holdings of precious metal nor was early money necessarily based on precious metal in fact precious metal was relatively useless for building empires because it was in short supply even in the roman era base metal was used and charlemagne s new money eventually became debased in china gold and silver did not feature and paper money was being used as early as the ninth century what the market economy did introduce was a new form of money money as debt money as debt if you look at a 20 banknote you will see it says i promise to pay the bearer on demand the sum of twenty pounds this is a promise originally made by the bank of england to exchange notes for the sovereign currency the banknote was a new form of money unlike sovereign money it was not a statement of value but a promise of value a coin even if made of base metal was exchangeable in its own right it did not represent another superior form of money but when banknotes were first invented they did the new invention of promissory notes emerged through the needs of trade in the 16th and 17th centuries promissory notes were used to acknowledge receipt of loans or investments and the obligation to repay them through the fruits of future transactions a major task of the emerging profession of banking was to periodically set all these promises against each other and see who owed what to whom this process of clearing meant that a great amount of paper commitments was reduced to relatively less actual transfer of money final settlement was either by payment with sovereign money coins or another promissory note banknote eventually the banknotes became so trusted that they were treated as money in their own right in britain they became equivalent to the coinage particularly when they were united under the banner of the bank of england today if you took a banknote to the bank of england it would merely exchange your note for one that is exactly the same banknotes are no longer promises they are the currency there is no other real money behind them the london stock exchange in 1922 getty what modern money does retain is its association with debt unlike sovereign money which was created and spent directly into circulation modern money is largely borrowed into circulation through the banking system this process shelters behind another myth that banks merely act as a link between savers and borrowers in fact banks create money and it is only in the last decade that this powerful myth has been finally put to rest by banking and monetary authorities it is now acknowledged by monetary authorities such as the imf us federal reserve and bank of england that banks are creating new money when they make loans they don t lend the money of other account holders to those who want to borrow bank loans consist of money conjured out of thin air whereby new money is credited to the borrower s account with the agreement that the amount will eventually be repaid with interest the policy implications of the public currency being created out of nowhere and lent to borrowers on a purely commercial basis have still not been taken on board nor has basing a public currency on debt as opposed to the sovereign power to create and directly circulate money free of debt the result is that rather than using their own sovereign power over money creation as alexander the great did states have become borrowers from the private sector where there are public spending deficits or the need for large scale future expenditure there is an expectation that the state will borrow the money or increase taxation rather than create the money itself dilemmas of debt but basing a money supply on debt is ecologically socially and economically problematic ecologically there is a problem because the need to pay off debt could drive potentially damaging growth basing the money supply on debt is also socially discriminatory because not all citizens are in a position to take on debt the pattern of the money supply will tend to favour the already rich or the most speculative risk taker recent decades for example have seen a huge amount of borrowing by the financial sector to enhance their investments the economic problem is that the money supply depends on the capacity of the various elements of the economy public and private to take on more debt and so as countries have become more dependent upon bank created money debt bubbles and credit crunches have become more frequent the first run on a british bank in 150 years northern rock customers queue to get out their cash in 2007 getty this is because handbag economics creates an impossible task for the private sector it has to create all new money through bank issued debt and repay it all with interest it has to completely fund the public sector and generate a profit for investors but when the privatised bank led money supply flounders the money creating powers of the state come back into clear focus this was particularly plain in the 2007 08 crisis when central banks created new money in the process known as quantitative easing central banks used the sovereign power to create money free of debt to spend directly into the economy such as by buying up existing government debt and other financial assets the question then becomes if the state as represented by the central bank can create money out of thin air to save the banks why can t it create money to save the people money for the people the myths about money have led us to look at public spending and taxation the wrong way around taxation and spending like bank lending and repayment is in a constant flow handbag economics assumes that it is taxation of the private sector that is raising the money to fund the public sector that taxation takes money out of the taxpayer s pocket but the long political history of sovereign power over money would indicate that the flow of money can be in the opposite direction in the same way that banks can conjure money out of thin air to make loans states can conjure money out of thin air to fund public spending banks create money by setting up bank accounts states create money by allocating budgets when governments set budgets they do not see how much money they have in a pre existing taxation piggybank the budget allocates spending commitments that may or may not match the amount of money coming in through taxation through its accounts in the treasury and the central bank the state is constantly spending out and taking in money if it spends more money than it takes in it leaves more money in people s pockets this creates a budget deficit and what is effectively an overdraft at the central bank in the red governments don t create cash for their budgets they borrow getty is this a problem yes if the state is treated as if it was any other bank account holder the dependent household of handbag economics no if it is seen as an independent source of money states do not need to wait for handouts from the commercial sector states are the authority behind the money system the power exercised by the banks to create the public currency out of thin air is a sovereign power it is no longer necessary to mint coins like alexander did money can be created by keystrokes there is no reason why this should be monopolised by the banking sector to create new public money as debt deeming public spending as being equivalent to bank borrowing denies the public the sovereign people in a democracy the right to access its own money free of debt redefining money this foray into the historical and anthropological stories about money shows that long held conceptions that money emerged from a previous market economy based on barter and that it was originally made from precious metal are fairytales we need to recognise this and we need to capitalise on the public ability to create money but it is also important to recognise that the sovereign power to create money is not a solution in itself both the state and bank capacity to create money have advantages and disadvantages both can be abused the reckless lending of the banking sector for example led to the near meltdown of the american and european monetary and financial system on the other hand where countries do not have a developed banking sector the money supply remains in the hands of the state with massive room for corruption and mismanagement the answer must be to subject both forms of money creation bank and state to democratic accountability far from being a technical commercial instrument money can be seen as a social and political construct that has immense radical potential our ability to harness it is hampered if we do not understand what money is and how it works money needs to become our servant rather than our master mary mellor is emeritus professor at northumbria university where she was founding chair of the sustainable cities research institute this article originally

on tuesday united states steel corporation announced that it would idle three blast furnaces worldwide the mills affected are uss gary works in gary indiana uss great lakes works in ecorse michigan and uss košice in košice slovak republic the gary works mill operated four blast furnaces capable of producing 7 5 million tons of steel per year and will now operate just three its great lakes works mill which operated three blast furnaces and can produce 3 8 million tons of steel per year is now down to two furnaces the kosice mill produced 4 5 million tons annually and will now operate two blast furnaces instead of three effective this week us steel said that it based its decision on the fact that prices of its steel product were falling and sales were slowing its stock price has fallen over 50 percent year over year from 36 91 on june 18 2018 to 14 55 on june 20 2019 its second quarter earnings forecast are projected to be around 250 million below expectations of 291 1 million because of the furnace shutdowns hundreds or maybe thousands of workers could eventually lose their jobs worldwide while no layoffs have yet been announced the trend is clear the announcement comes just over ten months since us steel announced that it would invest 750 million into the gary works its largest facility worldwide which sprawls over one mile of shoreline on lake michigan and employs about 3 800 workers earlier this year the corporation was negotiating 47 million in tax breaks from the city of gary and state of indiana the mill is a linchpin of the economy in the impoverished gary region that has suffered from decades of deindustrialization at the hands of the corporate oligarchs with the poverty rate in gary standing at 35 8 percent more than twice the rate of the us as a whole the steelmaker s decision to shut down production in some of its mills comes less than one year and four months after president donald trump announced in march 2018 that he would place punitive tariffs on steel and aluminum entering the us from china and expand those tariffs in june 2018 to include canada mexico japan and european countries the tariffs are already having an overall adverse effect on the us economy as dan kadrmas president of truenorth steel said of the second round of metals tariffs the current u s capacity cannot meet the demands of the united states so we would need imports pretty much in every situation the recent announcement of us steel s blast furnace shutdowns underscores the advanced decay of the world capitalist system and the fundamental contradiction at the root of that decay the conflict between the nation state system and the globalized means of capitalist production the trump administration touted the tariffs as a blow struck on behalf of the american working class promising that they would protect jobs and add new ones with higher wages and benefits his actions were backed by republicans and democrats who promoted economic nationalism as a way to save the sinking ship of american capitalism whose world hegemony was threatened by the expanding economy of china which threatens to overtake the us as the world s leading economic power when the political representatives of the ruling class criticized trump s trade war agenda they did not do so out of concern for the impact that the inevitable job losses and wage cuts would have on working class families worldwide their sole concern was to defend the profits of american corporations some like democrat elizabeth warren even attacked trump from the right on the tariffs saying that they were not punitive enough predictably the tariffs sparked backlash from international leaders both the european union and china pushed through their own countermeasures further deepening the conflict between individual nation states in the global capitalist economy in the united states the united steelworkers usw union has long been one of the most vocal supporters of trump s trade war measures lining up us steelworkers behind the steel bosses while pitting american workers against their working class brothers and sisters overseas for their total subservience to the steel bosses usw leader have been well rewarded including president leo gerard who took in 208 000 in salary and benefits in 2018 the usw reported 1 08 billion in assets for the year 2018 up from 963 million in 2017 the usw brushed aside massive strike authorization votes to push through sellout contracts at arcelormittal and us steel this past autumn imposing wage increases below the rate of inflation sanctioning the creation of new tiers with lower wages and few benefits and with no guarantees against layoffs or for improved safety and health measures the production cuts announced by the usw are being driven by the insatiable profit demands of wall street which is seeking to drive up share prices by squeezing more profit off the hides of workers in the face of falling demand and cutthroat competition despite its sales slump uss remains extremely profitable with 1 1 billion in net earnings in 2018 its shares however continue to slump reaching 14 67 this week about 1 3 of its february 2018 high of 43 the program of the usw of lining up american workers behind the trade war measures of trump is utterly bankrupt it is not a question of making the nation state system work but taking up the fight for a socialist reorganization of society based on the fraternal cooperation of workers around the world and planning of production to meet human need not private profit as the shuttering of blast furnaces at us steel demonstrate trade war measures are ultimately aimed against the working class as each gang of rival capitalists attempts to offload the impact of the global economic crisis onto the backs of its rivals leon trotsky the founder of the fourth international writing just five years before the outbreak of the second world war warned in the midst of the great depression attempts to save economic life by inoculating it with virus from the corpse of nationalism result in blood poisoning which bears the name of fascism the same holds even more true today the methods of the ruling class to resolve its crisis lead to fascism and war the needed radical changes must come from a movement of the working class in the striving to break free from the capitalist system and establish international socialism and an opening up of the global economy based on international cooperation to serve the needs of the working class not the profit interests of the wealthy few the first step in waging a successful fight is for steelworkers to break free from the unions and the democratic and republican parties which are subservient to the corporations and steeped in nationalism and to form their own independent organizations rank and file committees of by and for the workers these committees must link up with workers in north and south america asia europe and africa to confront the global capitalist system and fight based on a socialist program to take control of banks and basic industries like steel and run them under the democratic ownership and control of the

washington ap president donald trump has a silent partner behind several of the accomplishments he likes to boast about barack obama despite assailing his democratic predecessor for waging a cruel and heartless war on american energy for example trump can brag about u s energy supremacy thanks to the sector s growth in the obama years and the obama trump decade is soon to yield an economic record if things stay on track a little longer the most sustained expansion in u s history though trump claims all the credit the expansion started in obama s first year continued through his presidency and has been maintained under trump there are no fist bumps in the offing however the past week saw the kickoff of trump s 2020 campaign with a rally in florida that and other events provided trump a platform that he used to exaggerate what he s done take some factually challenged swipes at obama and democrats at large and make promises that will be hard to keep a sampling migrants trump on separating children from adults at the mexican border when i became president president obama had a separation policy i didn t have it he had it i brought the families together i m the one that brought em together now i said something when i did that i m the one that put people together they separated i put em together interview with telemundo broadcast thursday jose diaz balart interviewer you did not the facts trump is not telling the truth the separation of thousands of migrant children from their parents resulted from his zero tolerance policy obama had no such policy after a public uproar and under a court order trump ceased the separations zero tolerance meant that u s authorities would criminally prosecute all adults caught crossing into the u s illegally doing so meant detention for adults and the removal of their children while their parents were in custody during the obama administration such family separations were the exception they became the practice under trump s policy which he suspended a year ago before trump s zero tolerance policy migrant families caught illegally entering the u s were usually referred for civil deportation proceedings not requiring separation unless they were known to have a criminal record then and now immigration officials may take a child from a parent in certain cases such as serious criminal charges against a parent concerns over the health and welfare of a child or medical concerns ___ trump on detention centers at the border president obama is the one that built those prison cells telemundo interview the facts he has a point whether they are called prison cells or something else obama held children in temporary ill equipped facilities and built a large center in mcallen texas that is used now democrats routinely and inaccurately blame trump for creating cages for children they are actually referring to chain link fencing inside the mcallen center obama s creation conditions for detained migrants deteriorated sharply during a surge of central american arrivals under trump particularly in el paso texas ___ trade trump this will be the largest trade deal ever made and it won t even be close if you take a look at the numbers second is so far away you don t even call it second so it s very exciting and very exciting for mexico very exciting for canada remarks thursday with canadian prime minister justin trudeau the facts that s wrong simply by virtue of the number of trade partners involved the proposed new agreement replacing the north american free trade agreement covers the same three countries the trans pacific partnership negotiated by the obama administration included the three nafta partners united states canada and mexico plus japan and eight other pacific rim countries trump withdrew the united states from the pact on his third day in office even the pacific deal pales in comparison with one that did go into effect with the u s on board the uruguay round concluded in 1994 the round of negotiations created the world trade organization and was signed by 123 countries the federal reserve bank of boston said the wto s initial membership accounted for more than 90 percent of global economic output ___ trump on his tariffs we are taking in billions and billions of dollars into our treasury we have never taken 10 cents from china rally tuesday in orlando florida the facts it s false to say the u s never collected a dime in tariffs on chinese goods before he took action they are simply higher in some cases than they were before it s also wrong to suggest that the tariffs are being paid by china tariff money coming into the treasury is mainly from u s businesses and consumers not from china tariffs are primarily if not entirely a tax paid domestically ___ iran trump president obama made a desperate and terrible deal with iran gave them 150 billion dollars plus i 8 billion dollars in cash iran was in big trouble and he bailed them out gave them a free path to nuclear weapons and soon instead of saying thank you iran yelled death to america i terminated deal tweet friday trump on his accomplishments and then terminating one of the worst deals ever made the iran deal that was made by president obama paid 150 billion paid 1 8 billion in cash i terminated that and iran is a much different country fox news interview wednesday the facts there was no 150 billion payout from the u s treasury the money he refers to represents iranian assets held abroad that were frozen until the international deal was reached and tehran was allowed to access its funds the payout of about 1 8 billion is a separate matter that dates to the 1970s when iran paid the u s 400 million for military equipment that was never delivered because the government was overthrown and diplomatic relations ruptured that left people businesses and governments in each country indebted to partners in the other and these complex claims took decades to sort out in tribunals and arbitration for its part iran paid settlements of more than 2 5 billion to u s citizens and businesses the day after the nuclear deal was implemented the u s and iran announced they had settled the claim over the 1970s military equipment order with the u s agreeing to pay the 400 million principal along with about 1 3 billion in interest the 400 million was paid in cash and flown to tehran on a cargo plane which gave rise to trump s dramatic accounts of money stuffed in barrels or boxes and delivered in the dead of night the arrangement provided for the interest to be paid later not crammed into containers ___ energy trump we ve ended the last administration s cruel and heartless war on american energy what they were doing to our energy should never be forgotten the united states is now the no 1 producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world orlando rally trump we re now no 1 in the world in energy fox news interview wednesday the facts as he s done many times before trump is crediting himself with things that happened under obama here s what the government s u s energy information administration says the united states has been the world s top producer of natural gas since 2009 when u s natural gas production surpassed that of russia and the world s top producer of petroleum hydrocarbons since 2013 when u s production exceeded saudi arabia s ___ jobs trump almost 160 million people are working that s more than ever before orlando rally the facts true but that s a tribute to americans making babies and immigrants coming to the country population growth in other words other than during recessions employment growth has been trending upward since 1939 when the labor department started counting the phenomenon is not a marker of leadership it has spanned successful and failed presidents more on point the annual rate of job growth has been within the same range since roughly 2011 it was 1 6 through may another measure is the proportion of americans with jobs and that is still below record highs the labor department says 60 6 percent of people in the u s 16 years and older were working in may that s below the all time high of 64 7 percent in april 2000 during bill clinton s administration though higher than the 59 9 percent when trump was inaugurated in january 2017 ___ trump women s unemployment is now the lowest it s been in 74 years orlando rally the facts no the jobless rate for women of 3 1 in april was the lowest in 66 years not 74 and it ticked up in may to 3 2 ___ economy trump it s soaring to incredible new heights perhaps the greatest economy we ve had in the history of our country orlando rally the facts the economy is not one of the best in the country s history it expanded at an annual rate of 3 2 percent in the first quarter of this year that growth was the highest in just four years for the first quarter in the late 1990s growth topped 4 percent for four straight years a level it has not yet reached on an annual basis under trump growth even reached 7 2 percent in 1984 the economy grew 2 9 in 2018 the same pace it reached in 2015 under obama and simply hasn t hit historically high growth rates trump has legitimate claim to a good economy but when it comes to records there s one he will have to share with obama the economy is on track to achieve its longest expansion ever in july much of that decade long growth came during obama s presidency an achievement that trump so far has largely sustained other than in its durability the economy is far from the finest in history __ the wall trump we ll have over 400 miles built by the end of next year fox news interview wednesday trump we re going to have over 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year it s moving very rapidly orlando rally the facts that s highly unlikely and even if so the great majority of the wall he s talking about would be replacement barrier not new miles of construction trump has added strikingly little length to barriers along the mexico border despite his pre eminent 2016 campaign promise to get a wall done even to reach 400 miles or 640 kilometers he would have to prevail in legal challenges to his declaration of a national emergency or get congress to find more money to get anywhere close so far the administration has awarded contracts for 247 miles 395 km of wall construction but that initiative has been constrained by court cases that are still playing out in any event all but 17 miles 27 km of his awarded contracts so far would replace existing barriers ___ taxes trump we ve done so much with the biggest tax cut in history orlando rally the facts his tax cuts are nowhere close to the biggest in u s history it s a 1 5 trillion tax cut over 10 years as a share of the total economy a tax cut of that size ranks 12th according to the committee for a responsible federal budget president ronald reagan s 1981 cut is the biggest followed by the 1945 rollback of taxes that financed world war ii post reagan tax cuts also stand among the historically significant president george w bush s cuts in the early 2000s and obama s renewal of them a decade later ___ environment trump our water and our air today is cleaner than it ever was our air it s the best it ever was fox news interview wednesday trump our air and water are the cleanest they ve ever been by far orlando rally the facts not true about air quality which hasn t gotten better under the trump administration u s drinking water is among the best by one leading measure after decades of improvement progress in air quality has stalled over the last two years the u s had more polluted air days than just a few years earlier federal data show there were 15 more days with unhealthy air in america both last year and the year before than there were on average from 2013 through 2016 the four years when america had its fewest number of those days since at least 1980 the obama administration in fact set records for the fewest air polluted days in 2016 on water yale university s global environmental performance index finds 10 countries tied for the cleanest drinking water the u s among them on environmental quality overall the u s was 27th behind a variety of european countries canada japan australia and more switzerland was no 1 ___ judges trump on the confirmation of federal judges president obama was very nice to us he didn t fill the positions orlando rally the facts trump s sarcasm aside he does have a better success rate than obama in filling judicial vacancies the republican controlled senate in obama s last two years avoided taking action on many of his nominees republicans still control the senate and have been able to confirm about 120 of trump s picks despite their slim majority that s about 35 more than obama had confirmed at this point in his presidency ___ health care trump we will always protect patients with pre existing conditions always orlando rally the facts his administration s actions say otherwise it is pressing in court for full repeal of obama s health law which requires insurers to take all applicants regardless of medical history and charge the same standard premiums to healthy people and those who had medical problems before or when they signed up trump and other republicans say they ll have a plan to preserve protections for people with pre existing conditions but the white house has provided no details ___ abortion trump leading democrats have even opposed measures to prevent the execution of children after birth orlando rally the facts executing children is already a crime trump is offering here a somewhat toned down version of a distorted story he s been telling for months that falsely suggests democrats are ok with murder his account arises from extremely rare instances when babies are born alive as a result of an attempted abortion when these cases occur execution is not an option when a baby is born with anomalies so severe that he or she would die soon after birth a family may choose what s known as palliative care or comfort care this might involve allowing the baby to die naturally without medical intervention providing comfort without life extending treatment is not specific to newborns it may happen with fatally ill patients of any age ___ veterans trump we passed va choice they ve been trying to get that passed also for about 44 years orlando rally the facts no congress approved the private sector veterans choice health program in 2014 and obama signed it into law trump signed an expansion of it ___ russia investigation trump i m the most transparent president in history i let mueller have everything they wanted fox news interview wednesday the facts it s highly questionable to say trump was fully cooperative in the russia investigation trump declined to sit for an interview with robert mueller s team gave written answers that investigators described as inadequate and incomplete said more than 30 times that he could not remember something he was asked about in writing and according to the report tried to get aides to fire the special counsel or otherwise shut or limit the inquiry in the end the mueller report found no criminal conspiracy between the trump campaign and russia but left open the question of whether trump obstructed justice according to the report mueller s team declined to make a prosecutorial judgment on whether to charge partly because of a justice department legal opinion that said sitting presidents shouldn t be indicted the report instead factually laid out instances in which trump might have obstructed justice specifically leaving it open for congress to take up the matter ___ associated press writers josh boak christopher rugaber matthew daly seth borenstein ricardo alonso zaldivar and colleen long in washington and elliot spagat in san diego contributed to this report ___ find ap fact check follow

by california is a place unlike any other on the globe it boasts perhaps the greatest natural resources of any state along with shining high tech industries however like many good economic stories government policies threaten its future thank you for reading this post don t forget to subscribe indeed its government has made california unsustainable of course it wasn t always this way as the 1960s came to a close in california it had a population of nearly twenty million in the decade before its economic strength afforded the construction of a vast state water project and higher education system that was the envy of the world matched with a majestic and trade friendly coastline along with visionary business leaders california s future seemed secured no more and here are the four major reasons california is at such great risk 1 california s infrastructure deficit that vast state water project was designed for a population not much greater than 25 million today on any one day california verges on nearly 40 million people within its borders and is projected to reach 50 million if not higher in the last 50 years however california s infrastructure needs have been ignored the state s water system remains essentially is as it was in the 1960s as for its roads a recent headline declared that california s roads are some of the poorest in the nation and rapidly getting worse according to a 2017 infrastructure report card driving on roads in need of repair in california costs each driver 844 per year and 5 5 of bridges are rated structurally deficient drinking water needs in california are an estimated 44 5 billion and wastewater needs total 26 2 billion 678 dams are considered to be high hazard potential the state s schools have an estimated capital expenditure gap of 3 2 billion in 2017 california s governor jerry brown estimated california was facing 187 billion in unmet infrastructure needs however the bay area council economic institute pegs the cost of california s unfunded infrastructure needs at up to 737 billion and possibly as much as 765 billion who is right it s hard to know but all of those figures are more than daunting 2 government debt how much in debt are the california governments that s hard to know too according to a january 2017 study california state and local governments owe 1 3 trillion as of june 30 2015 the study was based on a review of federal state and local financial disclosures in other words that 1 3 trillion in debt is the amount to which california governments admit other studies believe it to be more indeed one study says it is actually 2 3 trillion and a recent hoover institute stated that there is over 1 trillion in pension liability alone or 76 884 per household incredibly there are 4 million current pension beneficiaries a number that continues to grow and which exceeds the total population of 22 states what s the right number apparently it is so large it is hard to accurately estimate in every case the number is staggering 3 california s taxes and regulations when you consider the california legal system and its regulatory system inclusive of the world s most comprehensive global warming law california is likely the most regulated state in the country if not the world california also is among the highest taxed states in the nation california has the highest income tax rates the top rate is 13 3 the next closest top tax rate is in oregon at 9 9 however oregon does not have a sales tax california has the 10th highest sales tax what is remarkable about the california income tax isn t just that it has the highest rate it is how little income it takes just above 52 000 to qualify for california rate of 9 3 given the high cost of living in california that means many californians are subject to that rate on the other hand for more than a decade fewer than 150 000 of california s 35 million people pay half of all of its income tax a highly imbalanced system now many might think california needs all of those taxes given its infrastructure deficit and debt the problem with that notion is that those prolonged high taxes debt burden and regulations limit california s economic future after all why would businesses locate in california in the future with the impending tax aggeddon that must be in the offing also california s middle class has been hollowed a recent cnbc headline read californians fed up with housing costs and taxes are fleeing state in big numbers where are they going many have left for low tax states offering more jobs than california they have been replaced by those taking advantage of california s magnet government policies which increase california s long term spending needs for those that remain according to smartasset com california has the highest debt to income ratio in the country little wonder the demographer joel kotkin concluded that the state is run for the very rich the very poor and the public employees it is also how california found itself with the worst poverty problem and why california ranks dead last among u s states in quality of life according to a study by u s news all of which brings us to the number one reason california is not sustainable 4 the california governments you would think all of the above would have government officials deeply worried so much so that they would cut back everywhere they could if you thought that you would be wrong very wrong california spends nearly 200 billion a year on budget and even more off budget in the form of programs paid with bonds i e debt financing as for the pension debt of that nearly 200 billion in the most recent budget less than 2 billion was allocated to paying down that pension debt more than that was spent this year on a high speed rail project currently estimated to cost 70 billion and which no one seems to want beyond that as i wrote earlier california is moving ever farther left and wants the nation to pay for it the next generation of leaders gavin newsom kevin de leon xavier becerra and kamala harris are significantly to the left of the old and conservative by comparison jerry brown and diane feinstein that new generation of leaders are supported by an influx of friendly voters who are replacing those that are leaving all of those leaders support the dozens of lawsuits brought by the democrat attorney general xavier becerra against the trump administration many describe those lawsuits as part of california democrats resistance movement a resistance designed to result in political gains more than policy benefits gavin newsom kevin de leon xavier becerra and kamala harris also support some form of significantly expanded healthcare benefits if not universal healthcare which is estimated to cost as much as 400 billion a year that is not a typo all of them support the california magnet policies that attracted so many of those in california illegally in fact there is no indication that the next generation has any concern for the future debt instead they support higher taxes what taxes will those be within a decade you can expect higher income taxes and sales taxes there is always a movement afoot to do away with california s landmark property tax protection known as prop 13 you also can expect a service tax a tax on lawyers and accountants as well as hairdressers and gardeners that service tax would be on top of the existing income tax beyond all of that sooner or later an asset tax will be proposed california counties already collect an asset tax on businesses look for that to be proposed statewide as california lurches ever farther to the left and if forced to confront future debt is there a silver lining in this story if you are living in one of the 49 other states you should learn from the lesson that is california if you are living in california there is always the lesson of how michigan came to be governed by a more centrist government of course that came after the failure of the prior government for now however for all its concern for sustainable foods and products california is on a high speed rail to unsustainability tom del beccaro is the author of the divided era a

the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies has been gradually entering the charity sector purportedly providing more transparency and trust to the industry especially given a decrease in people s trust in charity organizations where the public is increasingly concerned about how charities spend raised money governments and blockchain projects embrace charity space governments around the world have been showing increasing interest in blockchain deployment and digital currency adoption for philanthropy although few of them have implemented clear regulations toward the new type of currency at the legislative level recently the british virgin islands a united kingdom overseas territory in the carribean partnered with blockchain firm lifelabs io to launch an alternative cryptocurrency enabled payments infrastructure for residents across its network of islands to ensure that residents can continue access essential goods and services in the event of a humanitarian crisis andrew fahie premier and minister of finance of the british virgin islands said that blockchain based financial innovation comes at a pivotal time for our people and our economy while the memory of recent natural disasters remains fresh in our minds and hearts and the pressure for increased economic efficiency keeps mounting the mayor of the south korean capital seoul introduced a five year plan for developing the blockchain industry in the city last october the project entitled blockchain city of seoul contains a number of measures for promoting and developing blockchain related initiatives and education in the city from 2018 to 2022 last september china s ministry of civil affairs mca revealed plans to implement blockchain as part of an overhaul of its charity tracking system the mca s four year plan through 2022 specifically pledges to explore the use of blockchain technology in charitable donations charity tracking transparent management and elsewhere story continues officials were set to build a tamper proof charity organization information query system and enhance the authority transparency and public trust of information publishing and search services the plan confirmed that the blockchain tech component was chosen to complete the new round of the charity china platform s upgrade recent years have seen a number of blockchain and crypto focused organizations from well known to newly formed ones stepping into the charity industry as well just recently news broke that a charitable campaign dubbed airdrop venezuela which is set to enable direct transfer of 1 million in cryptocurrency donations to the country s citizens registered 60 000 verified beneficiaries and raised 272 000 the campaign leader professor steve hanke underscored that the project aims to demonstrate how crypto can be used by relief agencies globally to securely and transparently deliver funds and aid to people in need as the country struggles a still ongoing political crisis and ongoing economic turmoil bitcoin btc trading volumes in venezuela were reported to have reached an all time high in february of this year in the united states the bail bloc initiative started using cryptocurrency raised through charity to help people get out of the u s immigration and customs enforcement ice pretrial incarceration last november ice is a law enforcement agency of the federal government of the u s the mission of which is to monitor cross border crime and illegal immigration the bail bloc set a goal to help charged immigrants pay their bail with money raised through cryptocurrency mining the initiative released an app that consumes a small portion from 10 by default to 50 optionally of users computing power to mine monero xmr once it is installed leading cryptocurrency exchange binance revealed in february that its philanthropic arm binance charity foundation bcf which was first launched in october 2018 rolled out its charity campaign lunch for children in the capital of uganda kampala according to the program the organization is set to provide two meals a day during the full year of 2019 to more than 200 students and school staff in late 2018 the bcf opened a new fundraising channel on its blockchain powered donation platform the program is conducted in support of terminally ill patients and disadvantaged children in malta and gozo the ceo of cryptocurrency exchange coinbase brian armstrong announced the launch of a charitable initiative dubbed givecrypto org to financially empower people by distributing cryptocurrency globally last june givecrypto org intends to raise funds from crypto owners and distribute small amounts to people who live in emerging markets more specifically to those going through financial crisis a bitcoin only charity called the pineapple fund that was established by an anonymous donor contributed 5 104 btc to 60 charities around the world in 2017 supporting a variety of projects from clean water supply in sub saharan africa to digital rights protection at the time the donated digital currency was exchanged into 55 750 000 the progressive adoption of digital currencies makes traditional nonprofit organizations more flexible in attracting funds from new sources according to a report by the largest donor advised fund in the u s fidelity charitable the organization received over 30 million in cryptocurrency contributions in 2018 and 106 million since the program s launch in 2017 fidelity reportedly received 69 million which made it a record year for cryptocurrency donations while in 2016 the value of crypto donations amounted to only 7 million fidelity notes in the report that digital currency donations eliminate any capital gains taxes and give the full fair market value to charity recently the world was appalled by the massive destruction of the 800 year old french cathedral notre dame de paris following the devastating fire that engulfed the church on april 15 days after an array of companies organizations and individuals donated millions of dollars to reconstruct the damaged cathedral with the international cryptocurrency and blockchain community reacting promptly by launching donation campaigns as well the french crypto community also launched a cryptocurrency donation campaign dubbed notre dame des cryptos to help rebuild the cathedral the team behind the campaign emphasized that many people around the world want to fund the reconstruction with bitcoin being a global and universal cross border solution that is reliable against censorship blockchain s potential to ensure fairer more equitable aid and distribution of donated funds has been recognized by leading organizations around the world including the united nations the red cross and save the children and the notre dame case is just a local example of how effectively blockchain has been helping raise charitable donations in recent years united kingdom based charities aid foundation caf recognizes digital currency and blockchain as the technologies that have some fascinating features that could have a huge impact on charities and charitable giving and points out their potential for radical transparency of donations and the possibility of making it easier to get aid money to where it is needed commenting on blockchain integration into internal processes of charity organizations rhodri davies head of policy and program leader at caf told cointelegraph radical transparency through the use of decentralised ledgers either using crypto or some form of tokening bring the potential for enhancing trust among donors by giving far greater certainty over how money is spent this would be particularly valuable when giving cross border into jurisdictions where there are often justifiable fears about corruption and mismanagement however davies noted that radical transparency may cause problems as well as that many nonprofits already face challenges convincing sceptical donors about the need to spend money on core costs which are seen as overheads or admin cost if those donors were able to see where their individual donations went within an organisation this is likely to exacerbate the problem as there would probably be many instances where a donor would not be happy that their money wasn t going to the perceived front line how blockchain and crypto may transform the charity space recent years have marked a significant progress in the adoption of digital currencies and blockchain in philanthropy by some governments and international organizations indeed blockchain enables donors to see what path their donations came from from the moment it was contributed to the moment it was spent purportedly ensuring a high level of transparency and eliminating misreporting the blockchain powered project givetrack backed by bitcoin nonprofit organization bitgive was created with the objective to let donors trace transactions on a public platform in real time thus being aware of the final destination of their donations over the life of the platform it recorded fund flows to projects featured from code to inspire desafio run for water and america solidaria bitgive which supports 12 cryptocurrencies carried out global campaigns including medic mobile the water project save the children techno fundación parlas and team rubicon for tornado relief davies stressed that charities also need to be careful what they put on a ledger for instance if a grantmaker is funding lgbtq rights in a country where homosexuality is still illegal e g uganda and they use a blockchain based platform to move money they would need to be very careful that they didn t unwittingly publish information that allowed organisations or individuals to be identified and arrested news broke in 2015 when nonprofit media outlet propublica reported about inappropriate expenditures of donated funds that the red cross received in the course of the lamika project which was aimed at building of hundreds of permanent homes for those affected by the earthquake in haiti s capital city port au prince in 2011 the red cross had reportedly received nearly half a billion dollars while only six houses were built as of 2015 the red cross won t disclose details of how it has spent the hundreds of millions of dollars donated for haiti but our reporting shows that less money reached those in need than the red cross has said the news outlet argued notably the survey trust in charities and the overseas developments sector prepared by research consultancy firm nfpsynergy shows a 6 fall in people s trust in charities in 2017 wherein 54 of 1 000 surveyed adults said they trusted charities a great deal or quite a lot compared with 60 a year earlier blockchain is set to cut out middlemen and issues presented by bureaucracy as well as a lack of administrative expertise which could subsequently improve the reputation of charities francesco nazari fusetti social entrepreneur and founder of ethereum blockchain based token aidcoin and full service platform charitystars which was designed to allow charitable organizations to raise funds told cointelegraph that charities must keep in touch with their donors all the way through the project and keep updating them about the new milestones reached in order to prove that a success story is true as well as to ensure the work is sustainable nazari fusetti continued adding financials and proofs of payment definitely helps to create a success story but only with crypto and blockchain we can aim to give full transparency about the use of funds davies made an example of the use of decentralized autonomous organization dao structures that purportedly enable social movements to coordinate and operate more effectively at scale we have already seen a growing trend for such movements to take the form of loose networks rather than traditional centralised organizations e g black lives matter metoo the climate strikes often these movements face challenges in terms of maintaining focus and momentum or carrying out practical action and the additional structure provided by a dao might enable them to overcome these challenges but without having to adopt traditional approaches among other challenges blockchain can purportedly help solve are slow settlement times for transferring funds from philanthropy organizations to beneficiaries and the volatility of contributions made in foreign currency or securities although price volatility of digital currencies poses the risk that donations could be worth something different the moment it is needed it also applies to foreign currency markets last october binance released a report on crypto donations to provide relief for west japan following devastating floods in mid july stating it had raised 1 41 million in various types of erc 20 tokens at the time volunteer service provider open japan which received 169 85 ether eth 5 3 million yen or 47 257 at that time from binance said that it was carried out instantly and after confirming the transfer we were able to convert it to japanese yen receiving this donation left us with a deep impression of cryptocurrency both its growing effect on our world and its potential digital competence of charities bitcoin is currently the leading cryptocurrency in terms of charitable donations while no exact figure is available for the amount of bitcoin that charities received in 2017 it was certainly in excess of 100 million exeblock s survey dubbed eight ways charities are cashing in on cryptocurrencies says and further adds for u s donors making charitable contributions in cryptocurrency is a good tax planning strategy because if the irs considers these currencies as property for tax purposes meaning that upon liquidation any appreciation of the assets are subject to capital gains tax however if the cryptocurrency is donated prior to be being converted to dollars the donor receives a tax credit equal to the market value of the asset at the time of donation there is no tax on cryptocurrencies that are converted to cash in a donor advised account this approach increases the donation size by up to 21 speaking about major obstacles that stand between a charity and its mission nazari fusetti named fundraising to be the biggest issue for charities nowadays this is according to him why charities are keen to explore new tech opportunities to attract new donors sharing his experience of working with charities jorge mejia assistant professor of operations and decisions technologies at the kelley school of business at indiana university told cointelegraph that charities are often not led by tech savvy leaders but i think they are getting better over time particularly because many charities have realized they need some online presence to tap into the charity crowdfunding market i think a large gap for charities is obtaining volunteers that want to work on the tech side of things meanwhile among 5 352 nongovernmental organizations surveyed 72 accepted website donations with only 1 accepting bitcoin and only 3 had a digital wallet in the united kingdom only 15 of surveyed charities have been through the full digital transformation process and have embedded it while 45 did not have a digital strategy at all in 2018 the survey showed skills to be the second biggest barrier 51 for charities following funding 58 over half 53 reportedly saw their digital strategy skills low and 55 rated themselves as fair or low at keeping up to date with digital trends notably 73 of the surveyed charities said that they had low to very low skills in artificial intelligence ai which is up from 68 a year earlier also 62 of the survey participants reportedly rated their digital fundraising skills as fair to low with 58 saying their digital governance skills as fair to low nazari fusetti argued that through blockchain we could score a life changing goal for charitable organizations however the general trend shows that charities are reluctant to tech adoption generally charities are reluctant to tech adoptions but there are some cases especially with big brands such as unicef which show the opposite innovation takes time skilled employees and financial capital which are limited resources to small charities therefore it makes it more difficult for them to embrace new technologies davies stated that technologies such as augmented reality ar and virtual reality vr have already entered the charity sector as these technologies can purportedly be deployed to craft compelling narratives and drive empathy according to davies a number of nonprofits already use ar and vr in their fundraising and awareness raising the key findings from techtrust s digital survey 2018 report which surveyed 1 262 charity organizations show that in 2017 the majority 58 of charities did not incorporate digital into their overall strategy with 14 of those with no it staff being from large multinational companies digital charity survey 2018 part 1 digital charity survey 2018 part 2 of them 82 reportedly hold sensitive data that is not to be shared and are aware of the general data protection regulation gdpr also 27 of the surveyed said they would upgrade their it infrastructure and only 9 of charities were planning to reduce their spending on it infrastructure of the surveyed charities 31 did not have applications in the cloud 9 did not have remote access to their customer relationship management crm and 27 saw benefit in cloud software digital charity survey 2018 part 3 digital charity survey 2018 part 4 according to the international fund for agricultural development transaction costs to send remittances currently exceed 30 billion annually with fees particularly high to the poorest countries and remote rural areas the world food program the food assistance branch of the united nations and the largest humanitarian organization fighting hunger claimed that through the implementation of blockchain it managed to reduce fees for international payment transactions which let the program to save around 150 000 a month mejia argued that philanthropic organizations can strive to record and track their successes and failures using mobile and web apps and added a charity no longer needs to depend on a small but influential number of donors but can actually reach millions of people through the web however i think to be successful online charities need to document their ability to deliver value they need to be able to show potential donors that they can truly solve problems for people in need the question is whether they can do it consistently i have always felt that there is too much distance between donors and charities for example if i donate 10 for an emergency relief effort why can t i get some assurance that the money was used properly related articles
the federal reserve has conducted our nation s monetary policy for 99 years without a formal inflation target during those years inflation was among the variables considered by the federal open market committee when conducting monetary policy but the committee did not target a specific rate according to a paper published by the san francisco fed inflation targeting crept into the fomc s modus operandi in 2000 with their informal adoption of 1 5 elevated to 2 in 2007 and formalized and officially published at 2 as measured by the core personal consumption expenditures index pce in 2012 inflation has hovered below that level since onset of the subprime crisis in 2007 and the lingering question is why despite the trump tax cut increases in employment not seen in years and substantial wage growth any one of which in the past has been sufficient to trigger inflationary pressures it has remained stubbornly dormant let s review how we got here in the 1970s under former fed chairs arthur burns and g william miller inflation moved steadily upward reaching a high of 11 3 in 1979 when shortly thereafter president jimmy carter selected paul volcker as his inflation assassin volcker s punishing monetary policy accompanied by nationwide protests against his sky high interest rates painfully brought inflation down to 1 9 by 1986 upon volcker s resignation in 1987 former president ronald reagan appointed alan greenspan to replace him and for most of his 18 year tenure under four different presidents inflation remained in a range conducive to economic growth that is more than 2 and less than 4 when greenspan resigned in 2006 he was about to be coronated the greatest fed chair ever when the subprime crisis materialized in 2007 and he reported we didn t see it coming with but few exceptions our inflation rate has since been under 2 fed chairman jerome powell s recent response to this dilemma was reported by the wall street journal s may 4th front page story white house escalates feud with fed he stated the march inflation factor could have been held down by temporary numbers such a response is problematic for two reasons first economics upon which monetary policy relies for its assumptions theories and models is a soft science unlike a hard science like physics when an object is dropped gravity ensures its progression downward at a given rate of speed whereas the effects of the fed s monetary policy decisions upon the economy historically have been hit or miss propositions and everything in between second about 17 of the fed s annual operating expenses of 5 billion and 10 of its nationwide staffing of 22 000 are directed to monetary policy given the uncertainty underlying a soft science and the fed s 2007 slumber on subprime such a magnitude of resources calls for a much more definitive prognosis than maybe inflation is being held down by temporary numbers to be fair let s give credit to the fed for doing yeoman s work after becoming aware of the 2007 crisis whose countermeasures prevented our plunging into financial armageddon among other matters it avoided use of negative interest rates that have plagued japan europe and the other nations whose central banks pursued that strategy although having drawbacks use of quantitative easing was a much better choice than submarining the economy moreover our nation s debt of 22 trillion would have been 800 billion larger without it due solely to the fed s increased earning transfers to treasury emanating from its inflated security portfolio now president trump and his economic advisers are encouraging the fed to lower interest rates by another percentage point and to resume bond purchases to further stimulate economic growth on the premise that the tax cut is holding down inflationary pressures fed chairman powell recently put the possibility of one or more interest rate cuts on the table in the near term on the other hand greenspan among others has suggested that the problem with inflation is how we measure it stating there is a bias in the statistic you re getting statistics which are not correct thus impugning the fed s use of the pce as well as all other current measures of inflation there is also the possibility that technological improvements could be masking inflation but the only known factor that can be linked directly to the absence of inflationary pressures is the arrival of the subprime crisis and the fed s reaction to it when the fed funds market collapsed and the fomc redefined the fed funds rate from being the price banks paid to purchase required liquidity in the market to being the interest rate that the fed pays banks to retain excess reserves about 20 of the pre crisis fed funds market remains in which reserve holding banks purchase funds for arbitrage in their reserve accounts among the many consequences of the redefined fed funds rate is that the fomcs interest rate changes have not reverberated through the economy like they once did for example since onset of the crisis there have been nine 25 basis point increases in the fed funds rate driving it up to a range of 2 25 2 5 but the average 5 year cd is yielding 1 38 according to bankrate and inflation has remained mired below 2 except for 2012 when it bumped up slightly above it for a short period of time our planet already houses five countries with deflationary economies and 14 more with an inflation rate of just a positive half percent or less included among these is japan at 47 and switzerland s is at just 53 the bottom line is it s time for the fed to unravel this mystery if for no other reason than to provide peace of mind that negative interest rates and even worse a deflationary economy are not in our future until then our central bank will be much like a pilot flying an airplane with a suspect broken altimeter which professional pilots do not do jim kudlinski phd former federal reserve board official author of the tarnished

oil gold stocks and bonds had their best rally since 2011 after us federal reserve chair hinted at possible rate cuts one crossed out word was all it took to send financial markets into a unified celebration that has few precedents in the past decade stocks rose to records bonds surged oil jumped almost 10 and even gold got into the act as traders celebrated a dovish conversion at the federal reserve one back of the envelope measure shows the rally in everything was the strongest since 2011 banished of late has been the soul searching that had afflicted investors for more than a year instead investors closed their eyes and bought fortified by the willingness of jerome powell s central bank to forego its pledge to be patient in formulating interest rate policy bonds are running because of what the fed is doing directly and then everything else is running because the fed s actions have decreased the chance of a recession said steve chiavarone a portfolio manager with federated investors that s exactly what the fed said they wanted to do they want to extend the expansion they re also extending the rally the average wire to wire return in stocks bonds oil and gold was somewhere around 4 in the week the most since 2011 proxies less hostage to high volatility assets aqr capital management s risk parity portfolios for instance posted more muted gains that were still among the biggest in years worryingly to many the rally continued to lift both risk on and risk off assets while equity and oil surged so too did government bonds pushing the 10 year treasury yield below 2 for the first time since 2016 the moves extended the dueling bull market theme in which treasury traders fret about dimming growth while everyone else celebrates an accommodative fed each camp expects it to end badly for the other a race of this pace in both stocks and fixed income is unsustainable said marshall front the chief investment officer at front barnett associates people who were long bonds are going to have a problem we re not going to have a recession or a dip in economic activity that s going to take us off course and rates are going to go back up others are less squeamish there s been a lot of press suggesting that the bond and stock markets are conveying different messages to investors said mark heppenstall chief investment officer of penn mutual asset management but to me where we stand in interest rates today where we stand in persistent low inflation today means that whatever investors are willing to pay for earnings should be higher based on the fact that interest rates are lower for now it s a boon to portfolios modeled on the classic 60 40 stock bond allocation the first quarter marked the best period for the strategy in nearly a decade and now it looks as though those gains are set to grow come the end of the second for the naturally skeptical it s hard to watch everything go up at once without conjuring visions of bubbles doomed to pop getting the timing right on those calls is harder than it might seem in the 12 months following days when pretty much every asset class rose in unison the s p 500 has been higher nearly 70 of the time with a median gain of roughly 8 according to data from sundial capital research inc when compared to the returns of fixed income currencies and commodities stocks almost always outperformed over the same period there is some risk that activity like this is bubblicious jason goepfert president of sundial wrote to clients wednesday but it hasn t been that much of a worry it triggered before the 87 crash and again at the top of the 2000 bubble but otherwise it was mostly fake news conversely the dollar lost momentum this week in the wake of a dovish fed and lower inflation expectations which tends to strengthen the case for other assets a weaker greenback could help sales for large companies that do business overseas as prices turn incrementally cheaper in other countries it also helps commodities that are priced in dollars like gold lindsey bell an investment strategist at cfra is recommending that her clients increase exposure to the metal through exchange traded funds like the 33 billion spdr gold shares fund or the 12 5 billion ishares gold trust td securities also raised its price target for a long gold trade don t fight the fed reasons chiavarone everyone whether they admit it or not believes that there needs to be some major comeuppance some cleansing moment because for whatever reason the good puritan instinct that lies in america feels as though you can only cleanse through some level of pain he said there s an obsession of when the next recession is going to come what i think has been forgotten is that if you want lower for longer you also have to accept the longer part of it and that s what we re getting
politics ap fact check the silent partner in trump s boasts president donald trump says goodbye to canadian prime minister justin trudeau right at the west wing of the white house thursday june 20 2019 after their meeting in washington ap photo jacquelyn martin jacquelyn martin ap washington ap president donald trump has a silent partner behind several of the accomplishments he likes to boast about barack obama despite assailing his democratic predecessor for waging a cruel and heartless war on american energy for example trump can brag about u s energy supremacy thanks to the sector s growth in the obama years and the obama trump decade is soon to yield an economic record if things stay on track a little longer the most sustained expansion in u s history though trump claims all the credit the expansion started in obama s first year continued through his presidency and has been maintained under trump advertisement there are no fist bumps in the offing however the past week saw the kickoff of trump s 2020 campaign with a rally in florida that and other events provided trump a platform that he used to exaggerate what he s done take some factually challenged swipes at obama and democrats at large and make promises that will be hard to keep a sampling migrants trump on separating children from adults at the mexican border when i became president president obama had a separation policy i didn t have it he had it i brought the families together i m the one that brought em together now i said something when i did that i m the one that put people together they separated i put em together interview with telemundo broadcast thursday jose diaz balart interviewer you did not the facts trump is not telling the truth the separation of thousands of migrant children from their parents resulted from his zero tolerance policy obama had no such policy after a public uproar and under a court order trump ceased the separations zero tolerance meant that u s authorities would criminally prosecute all adults caught crossing into the u s illegally doing so meant detention for adults and the removal of their children while their parents were in custody during the obama administration such family separations were the exception they became the practice under trump s policy which he suspended a year ago advertisement before trump s zero tolerance policy migrant families caught illegally entering the u s were usually referred for civil deportation proceedings not requiring separation unless they were known to have a criminal record then and now immigration officials may take a child from a parent in certain cases such as serious criminal charges against a parent concerns over the health and welfare of a child or medical concerns ___ trump on detention centers at the border president obama is the one that built those prison cells telemundo interview the facts he has a point whether they are called prison cells or something else obama held children in temporary ill equipped facilities and built a large center in mcallen texas that is used now democrats routinely and inaccurately blame trump for creating cages for children they are actually referring to chain link fencing inside the mcallen center obama s creation conditions for detained migrants deteriorated sharply during a surge of central american arrivals under trump particularly in el paso texas ___ trade trump this will be the largest trade deal ever made and it won t even be close if you take a look at the numbers second is so far away you don t even call it second so it s very exciting and very exciting for mexico very exciting for canada remarks thursday with canadian prime minister justin trudeau advertisement the facts that s wrong simply by virtue of the number of trade partners involved the proposed new agreement replacing the north american free trade agreement covers the same three countries the trans pacific partnership negotiated by the obama administration included the three nafta partners united states canada and mexico plus japan and eight other pacific rim countries trump withdrew the united states from the pact on his third day in office even the pacific deal pales in comparison with one that did go into effect with the u s on board the uruguay round concluded in 1994 the round of negotiations created the world trade organization and was signed by 123 countries the federal reserve bank of boston said the wto s initial membership accounted for more than 90 percent of global economic output ___ trump on his tariffs we are taking in billions and billions of dollars into our treasury we have never taken 10 cents from china rally tuesday in orlando florida the facts it s false to say the u s never collected a dime in tariffs on chinese goods before he took action they are simply higher in some cases than they were before it s also wrong to suggest that the tariffs are being paid by china tariff money coming into the treasury is mainly from u s businesses and consumers not from china tariffs are primarily if not entirely a tax paid domestically ___ iran trump president obama made a desperate and terrible deal with iran gave them 150 billion dollars plus i 8 billion dollars in cash iran was in big trouble and he bailed them out gave them a free path to nuclear weapons and soon instead of saying thank you iran yelled death to america i terminated deal tweet friday advertisement trump on his accomplishments and then terminating one of the worst deals ever made the iran deal that was made by president obama paid 150 billion paid 1 8 billion in cash i terminated that and iran is a much different country fox news interview wednesday the facts there was no 150 billion payout from the u s treasury the money he refers to represents iranian assets held abroad that were frozen until the international deal was reached and tehran was allowed to access its funds the payout of about 1 8 billion is a separate matter that dates to the 1970s when iran paid the u s 400 million for military equipment that was never delivered because the government was overthrown and diplomatic relations ruptured that left people businesses and governments in each country indebted to partners in the other and these complex claims took decades to sort out in tribunals and arbitration for its part iran paid settlements of more than 2 5 billion to u s citizens and businesses the day after the nuclear deal was implemented the u s and iran announced they had settled the claim over the 1970s military equipment order with the u s agreeing to pay the 400 million principal along with about 1 3 billion in interest the 400 million was paid in cash and flown to tehran on a cargo plane which gave rise to trump s dramatic accounts of money stuffed in barrels or boxes and delivered in the dead of night the arrangement provided for the interest to be paid later not crammed into containers advertisement ___ energy trump we ve ended the last administration s cruel and heartless war on american energy what they were doing to our energy should never be forgotten the united states is now the no 1 producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world orlando rally trump we re now no 1 in the world in energy fox news interview wednesday the facts as he s done many times before trump is crediting himself with things that happened under obama here s what the government s u s energy information administration says the united states has been the world s top producer of natural gas since 2009 when u s natural gas production surpassed that of russia and the world s top producer of petroleum hydrocarbons since 2013 when u s production exceeded saudi arabia s ___ jobs trump almost 160 million people are working that s more than ever before orlando rally the facts true but that s a tribute to americans making babies and immigrants coming to the country population growth in other words other than during recessions employment growth has been trending upward since 1939 when the labor department started counting the phenomenon is not a marker of leadership it has spanned successful and failed presidents more on point the annual rate of job growth has been within the same range since roughly 2011 it was 1 6 through may another measure is the proportion of americans with jobs and that is still below record highs the labor department says 60 6 percent of people in the u s 16 years and older were working in may that s below the all time high of 64 7 percent in april 2000 during bill clinton s administration though higher than the 59 9 percent when trump was inaugurated in january 2017 advertisement ___ trump women s unemployment is now the lowest it s been in 74 years orlando rally the facts no the jobless rate for women of 3 1 in april was the lowest in 66 years not 74 and it ticked up in may to 3 2 ___ economy trump it s soaring to incredible new heights perhaps the greatest economy we ve had in the history of our country orlando rally the facts the economy is not one of the best in the country s history it expanded at an annual rate of 3 2 percent in the first quarter of this year that growth was the highest in just four years for the first quarter in the late 1990s growth topped 4 percent for four straight years a level it has not yet reached on an annual basis under trump growth even reached 7 2 percent in 1984 the economy grew 2 9 in 2018 the same pace it reached in 2015 under obama and simply hasn t hit historically high growth rates trump has legitimate claim to a good economy but when it comes to records there s one he will have to share with obama the economy is on track to achieve its longest expansion ever in july much of that decade long growth came during obama s presidency an achievement that trump so far has largely sustained other than in its durability the economy is far from the finest in history __ the wall trump we ll have over 400 miles built by the end of next year fox news interview wednesday trump we re going to have over 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year it s moving very rapidly orlando rally advertisement the facts that s highly unlikely and even if so the great majority of the wall he s talking about would be replacement barrier not new miles of construction trump has added strikingly little length to barriers along the mexico border despite his pre eminent 2016 campaign promise to get a wall done even to reach 400 miles or 640 kilometers he would have to prevail in legal challenges to his declaration of a national emergency or get congress to find more money to get anywhere close so far the administration has awarded contracts for 247 miles 395 km of wall construction but that initiative has been constrained by court cases that are still playing out in any event all but 17 miles 27 km of his awarded contracts so far would replace existing barriers ___ taxes trump we ve done so much with the biggest tax cut in history orlando rally the facts his tax cuts are nowhere close to the biggest in u s history it s a 1 5 trillion tax cut over 10 years as a share of the total economy a tax cut of that size ranks 12th according to the committee for a responsible federal budget president ronald reagan s 1981 cut is the biggest followed by the 1945 rollback of taxes that financed world war ii post reagan tax cuts also stand among the historically significant president george w bush s cuts in the early 2000s and obama s renewal of them a decade later ___ environment trump our water and our air today is cleaner than it ever was our air it s the best it ever was fox news interview wednesday advertisement trump our air and water are the cleanest they ve ever been by far orlando rally the facts not true about air quality which hasn t gotten better under the trump administration u s drinking water is among the best by one leading measure after decades of improvement progress in air quality has stalled over the last two years the u s had more polluted air days than just a few years earlier federal data show there were 15 more days with unhealthy air in america both last year and the year before than there were on average from 2013 through 2016 the four years when america had its fewest number of those days since at least 1980 the obama administration in fact set records for the fewest air polluted days in 2016 on water yale university s global environmental performance index finds 10 countries tied for the cleanest drinking water the u s among them on environmental quality overall the u s was 27th behind a variety of european countries canada japan australia and more switzerland was no 1 ___ judges trump on the confirmation of federal judges president obama was very nice to us he didn t fill the positions orlando rally the facts trump s sarcasm aside he does have a better success rate than obama in filling judicial vacancies the republican controlled senate in obama s last two years avoided taking action on many of his nominees republicans still control the senate and have been able to confirm about 120 of trump s picks despite their slim majority that s about 35 more than obama had confirmed at this point in his presidency advertisement ___ health care trump we will always protect patients with pre existing conditions always orlando rally the facts his administration s actions say otherwise it is pressing in court for full repeal of obama s health law which requires insurers to take all applicants regardless of medical history and charge the same standard premiums to healthy people and those who had medical problems before or when they signed up trump and other republicans say they ll have a plan to preserve protections for people with pre existing conditions but the white house has provided no details ___ abortion trump leading democrats have even opposed measures to prevent the execution of children after birth orlando rally the facts executing children is already a crime trump is offering here a somewhat toned down version of a distorted story he s been telling for months that falsely suggests democrats are ok with murder his account arises from extremely rare instances when babies are born alive as a result of an attempted abortion when these cases occur execution is not an option when a baby is born with anomalies so severe that he or she would die soon after birth a family may choose what s known as palliative care or comfort care this might involve allowing the baby to die naturally without medical intervention providing comfort without life extending treatment is not specific to newborns it may happen with fatally ill patients of any age ___ veterans trump we passed va choice they ve been trying to get that passed also for about 44 years orlando rally advertisement the facts no congress approved the private sector veterans choice health program in 2014 and obama signed it into law trump signed an expansion of it ___ russia investigation trump i m the most transparent president in history i let mueller have everything they wanted fox news interview wednesday the facts it s highly questionable to say trump was fully cooperative in the russia investigation trump declined to sit for an interview with robert mueller s team gave written answers that investigators described as inadequate and incomplete said more than 30 times that he could not remember something he was asked about in writing and according to the report tried to get aides to fire the special counsel or otherwise shut or limit the inquiry in the end the mueller report found no criminal conspiracy between the trump campaign and russia but left open the question of whether trump obstructed justice according to the report mueller s team declined to make a prosecutorial judgment on whether to charge partly because of a justice department legal opinion that said sitting presidents shouldn t be indicted the report instead factually laid out instances in which trump might have obstructed justice specifically leaving it open for congress to take up the matter ___

since he was sworn in as the president of the united states only two years ago donald trump has dangled economic promises to the palestinians as an incentive to make concessions in his so called deal of the century peace plan at the same time however the us administration has employed financial cuts to long standing programmes including the agency in charge of palestinian refugees unrwa as punishment against palestinian leaders for refusing to accept israeli and us terms for talks but while trump s slashing of funds for the palestinian authority pa unrwa and humanitarian projects benefitting civilians may appear particularly extreme the palestinian economy has long been held hostage in a bid to coerce the palestinian leadership into returning to the negotiating table with israel aid dependency the palestinian economy is intrinsically linked to international support particularly so since the establishment of the pa in 1993 as part of the oslo accords stay informed with mee s newsletters sign up to get the latest alerts insights and analysis starting with turkey unpacked an estimated 2bn was initially pledged to the pa by foreign donors in 1993 in order to build the governmental institutions that would eventually be incorporated into a future state of palestine had the terms of the oslo accords been followed that is since then the pa has depended on foreign support to help pay its 137 000 employees run its ministries and ensure water electricity sewage and medical treatment access in palestinian towns and villages in 2003 foreign aid to the pa amounted to 58 percent of its budget worth 747m according to the palestinian ministry of finance as the pa grew and in doing so began to depend more on taxation the proportion of the budget coming from foreign aid slowly decreased making up only 15 4 percent of the 2016 budget roughly 733m nonetheless this aid has not been without strings attached the current american administration has drastically reduced its contributions to organisations benefitting palestinians in the past two years applying financial pressure in the hope of obtaining political compromises on key issues such as the fate of east jerusalem refugees right of return and the status of illegal israeli settlements in the west bank in contrast to its ever shrinking financial aid to palestinians while overall foreign donor funding decreased by a third between 2008 and 2018 the us continues to provide israel with billions of dollars in military aid each year taxes held hostage while the pa has relied more and more on taxes to fund its budget what should be a straightforward matter of state finances has been anything but the pa directly collects domestic taxes from its citizens amounting to 764m in 2017 out of a total domestic revenue of 1 15bn but under the paris protocol signed in 1994 as part of the oslo accords israel collects taxes on palestinian imports and exports as well as vat on behalf of the pa in 2017 customs revenue transferred by israel to the pa also known as clearance revenues amounted to 2 49bn on average israel collects around 175m each month in taxes on palestinian imports and exports on behalf of the pa like the rest of the oslo agreements what was intended to be a temporary arrangement pending the creation of a fully fledged palestinian state remains until this day shackling the palestinian economy to a stalled peace process us pressure and years of occupation that restrict the movement of goods and people vital elements for any economy to grow a palestinian protester holds a placard reading down with the paris protocol and the oslo agreement during a protest in ramallah in september 2012 afp moreover israel has yielded the paris protocol as a punitive tool against palestinians using the customs fees and taxes it collects on behalf of the pa as a means of pressure on the ramallah based government the most recent case was in february when israel withheld 138m in tax transfers to the pa as retaliation over payments made by palestinian institutions to palestinian prisoners held by israel as well as to the families of palestinians killed by israelis while pa president mahmoud abbas has said that the pa would refuse any incomplete transfers of funds from israel the latest dispute has put the pa further at risk of diving into an intractable financial crisis facing a financial abyss between 2012 and 2016 the four biggest donors to the palestinian authority were the eu and its individual member states 981m saudi arabia 908m the world bank 872m and the us 477m according to pa ministry of finance reports the situation has dramatically changed since the us severed all funding to unrwa in 2018 despite having been its leading financial contributor since the agency s inception unrwa employees and their relatives in gaza city protest against job losses caused by us funding cuts in july afp meanwhile state agency usaid ceased all its foreign aid payments to the pa in february the agency had spent 268m on public projects in the west bank and gaza as well as palestinian private sector debt repayment in 2017 but significant cuts to all new funding were already in place by june 2018 the usaid cuts however have been at the request of pa officials fearful of being sued in the us under the 2018 anti terrorism clarification act atca which entitle american citizens to take recipients of us money to court for alleged acts of war the cuts have nonetheless left the un and palestinian leadership scrambling to find alternative sources of funding with the us almost completely out of the picture the eu is by far the largest donor of the pa in 2018 it paid 171m in assistance to the pa and 415m in total aid benefitting palestinians traditionally the saudi kingdom has also been a generous donor to the palestinian liberation organisation the umbrella palestinian political body but it also gives the pa around 220m annually after israel withheld taxes collected on behalf of the pa earlier this year qatar which usually contributes financially to gaza centred aid pledged 480m to rescue the pa from collapse the pa has rarely been so strapped and desperate for cash since its foundation in 1993 gaza on the brink of ruin while the fatah led pa based in the occupied west bank has been struggling the gaza strip has been in even more dire straits under an air sea and land siege imposed by israel and egypt since hamas took over control of the small coastal enclave after a power dispute with fatah in 2007 the gazan economy has been heavily dependent on international aid to subsidise its education medical and humanitarian services in 2014 various un organisations sent a total of 845m in aid to the gaza strip the same year the palestinian territory suffered under a devastating war with israel the damage caused by the war was such that the pa estimated it would cost 7 8bn to rebuild in the aftermath of the seven week conflict the damage caused by the 2014 war on gaza s infrastructure continues to affect the besieged enclave years later afp despite the continued feud between hamas and the pa gaza remains reliant on pa funds which accounts for one third of its budget in 2016 the pa allocated nearly 1 5bn to gaza despite as little as 325m in revenue from taxes and customs being collected in the strip but the rift between fatah and hamas has also meant that just as the pa has fallen under israeli and us pressure it has used money to coerce hamas into political compromise most pa funds in gaza go to its employees there while the vast majority do not work due to the pa s insistence that they not contribute to the hamas led authorities their salaries are a vital security net for many families as more than half of gaza residents live in poverty in the past two years however the pa has repeatedly slashed these salaries as a way to punish hamas leaving thousands of civilians worried about their survival as us cuts to unrwa have also affected the livelihoods of countless others pennies for palestine largesse for israel palestinians recent financial woes under the trump administration stand in stark contrast with the us s continued generosity towards israel in 2018 the pa s total budget stood at around 5bn that same year the us gave israel 3 85bn in military aid alone while much of the foreign aid to the occupied palestinian territories has gone to paving roads and providing basic services the us has simultaneously heavily invested in israel s military capacities which play an essential part in maintaining the occupation of palestinian lands in fact one could argue that continued american support of israel s military directly impedes the effectiveness of foreign aid to palestinians cases abound of foreign funded infrastructure including hospitals and schools being destroyed during military offensives or in the course of routine army activity in the west bank the self defeating cycle is so pervasive that palestinians have a saying that goes the eu fund the pa builds and israel destroys meanwhile with reports emerging that the trump administration has been seeking large donations from arab gulf countries the us eu japan and china to fund the economic component of the peace plan one high income country remains conspicuously unsolicited for funds despite being in the eye of the storm israel economic chimaeras the us led peace to prosperity workshop in bahrain on 25 june meant as the opening salvo before the rest of the deal of the century is revealed highlights how pivotal economic pledges are in the us s plan to achieve peace but what trump s advisor on israel jason greenblatt has hailed as the opportunity of a generation has preemptively been dismissed by palestinian leadership as an attempt to trade political rights for money this is not the first time palestinians have been presented with enthusiastic pitches for economic opportunity that later fizzled into nothing a gaza and jericho first plan industrial zones a deep water port built on an artificial island a short lived airport all these projects meant to breathe life into the palestinian economy either failed to ever see the light of day or never delivered on their promises while trump s son in law and adviser jared kushner who has been charged with putting the deal of the century together seems to believe that only an environment conducive to business investments can grant palestinians self determination and better lives many palestinians see financial promises as fundamentally meaningless so long as palestinians do not have a sustainable sovereign state to enact and benefit from such economic measures one thing seems certain without addressing the root causes of the palestinian economy s instability the deal of the century s heavy dependence on financial incentives to get palestinians to acquiesce to a peace deal appears doomed to maintain the status quo
president donald trump speaks during a meeting with canadian prime minister justin trudeau in the oval office of the white house thursday june 20 2019 in washington ap photo evan vucci associated press president trump doesn t like u s trade deficits he also doesn t like migrants flowing into the u s from south of the border his tariffs and tariff threats are slowing trade and world economic growth and this will in turn increase the migrant flows into the united states after all as foreign economic activity slows and more foreigners are either thrown out of work or find their incomes drying up they will be motivated to migrate trump remains clueless as to why tariffs fuel migration but that s not trump s only international trade blind spot he and his cabinet think that u s trade deficits are a problem and that they are caused by foreign countries that manipulate their currencies and engage in unfair trade practices these ideas are wrongheaded these misguided ideas have plagued other administrations even those lead by free market presidents like ronald reagan indeed i spent many days while at reagan s council of economic advisers trying to defend the president s free trade ideas but at the end of the day the free trader faction which was led by the likes of reagan himself lost the war the protectionists who harbored exactly the same wrongheaded ideas as trump rolled us as my longtime colleague and close friend bill niskanen who was a member of reagan s council of economic advisers put it in his definitive book reaganomics an insider s account of the policies and the people oxford university press 1988 trade policy in the reagan administration is best described as a strategic retreat the consistent goal of the president was free trade both in the united states and abroad in response to domestic political pressure however the administration imposed more new restraints on trade than any administration since hoover a strategic retreat is regarded as the most difficult military maneuver and may be better than the most likely alternative but it is not a satisfactory outcome for those who want even more detail and a confirmation of that provided by nisknanen there is nothing better than the magisterial treatise by douglas irwin clashing over commerce a history of u s trade policy university of chicago press 2017 let s turn to the simple economics and evidence about the trade deficit that proves why president trump s trade message and protectionist policies are to put it simply wrong in economics identities play an important role these identities are obtained by equating two different breakdowns of a single aggregate identities are interesting and usually important by definition in national income accounting the following identity can be derived it is the key to understanding the trade deficit imports exports investment savings government spending taxes given this identity which must hold the trade deficit is equal to the excess of private sector investment over savings plus the excess of government spending over tax revenue so the counterpart of the trade deficit is the sum of the private sector deficit and the government deficit federal state and local the u s trade deficit therefore is just the mirror image of what is happening in the u s domestic economy if expenditures in the u s exceed the incomes produced in the u s which they do the excess expenditures will be met by an excess of imports over exports read a trade deficit the table below shows that newly released u s data support the important trade identity the cumulative trade deficit the u s has racked up since 1975 is about 12 377 trillion and the total investment minus savings deficit is about 11 255 trillion the data talk and they talk pretty loudly prof steve h hanke so president trump can bully countries he identifies as unfair traders he can impose all the restrictions on trading partners that his heart desires but it won t change the trade balance never mind the fact that most economists think president trump s ideas on trade are wrong when it comes to trade trump is the master of the message and the optics in consequence his base is with him on trade and so are a surprising number of others the problem is that trump s trade message is tailor made for delivery on twitter and television indeed those media outlets are suitable for sound bites but not for complex arguments and data points that s why economics is at a disadvantage when it comes to trump s favorite media nevertheless this is what economics has to say about the trade deficit bugaboo first it is not a problem indeed the u s has run a trade deficit every year since 1975 and the u s has done relatively well since then the sky didn t fall because of our trade deficit secondly the trade deficit is not made by foreigners who engage in unfair trade practices it is homegrown made in the u s a to the extent that domestic savings in the u s falls short of domestic investments the economy must import more than its exports resulting in a negative trade balance to finance the excess of imports over exports the u s must import capital from abroad this can be done without strain because the u s dollar is the world s reserve currency our borrowing from abroad shows up in the huge chunk of u s public debt that is held by foreigners as it turns out the trump administration s fiscal policies which promise an ever widening fiscal deficit will throw a spanner in trump s trade policy works if his fiscal deficits are not offset by an increase in private savings relative to private investment increases in the federal deficit will translate into larger trade deficits so the u s trade deficit will not only be made in the good old u s a it will be made by president trump himself an arch enemy of trade deficits

likes to boast about barack obama despite assailing his democratic predecessor for waging a cruel and heartless war on american energy for example trump can brag about u s energy supremacy thanks to the sector s growth in the obama years and the obama trump decade is soon to yield an economic record if things stay on track a little longer the most sustained expansion in u s history though trump claims all the credit the expansion started in obama s first year continued through his presidency and has been maintained under trump there are no fist bumps in the offing however the past week saw

separated i put em together interview with telemundo broadcast thursday jose diaz balart interviewer you did not the facts trump is not telling the truth the separation of thousands of migrant children from their parents resulted from his zero tolerance policy obama had no such policy after a public uproar and under a court order trump ceased the separations zero tolerance meant that u s authorities would criminally prosecute all adults caught crossing into the u s illegally doing so meant detention for adults and the removal of their children while their parents were in custody during the obama administration such family separations were the exception they became the practice under trump s policy which he suspended a year ago before trump s zero tolerance policy migrant families caught illegally entering the u s were usually referred for civil deportation proceedings not requiring separation unless they were known to have a criminal record then and now immigration officials may take a child from a parent in certain cases such as serious criminal charges against a parent concerns over the health and welfare of a child or medical concerns ___ trump on detention centers at the border president obama is the one that built those prison cells telemundo interview the facts he has a point whether they are called prison cells or something else obama held children in temporary ill equipped facilities and built a large center in mcallen texas that is used now democrats routinely and inaccurately blame trump for creating cages for children they are actually referring to chain link fencing inside the mcallen center obama s creation conditions for detained migrants deteriorated sharply during a surge of central american arrivals under trump particularly in el paso texas ___ trade trump this will be the largest trade deal ever made and it won t even be close if you take a look at the numbers second is so far away you don t even call it second so it s very exciting and very exciting for mexico very exciting for canada remarks thursday with canadian prime minister justin trudeau the facts that s wrong simply by virtue of the number of trade partners involved the proposed new agreement replacing the north american free trade agreement covers the same three countries the trans pacific partnership negotiated by the obama administration included the three nafta partners united states canada and mexico plus japan and eight other pacific rim countries trump withdrew the united states from the pact on his third day in office even the pacific deal

countries the federal reserve bank of boston said the wto s initial membership accounted for more than 90 percent of global economic output ___ trump on his tariffs we are taking in billions and billions of dollars into our treasury we have never taken 10 cents from china rally tuesday in orlando florida the facts it s false to say the u s never collected a dime in tariffs on chinese goods before he took action they are simply higher in some cases than they were before it s also wrong to suggest that the tariffs are being paid by china tariff money coming into the treasury is mainly from u s businesses and consumers not from china tariffs are primarily if not entirely a tax paid domestically ___ iran trump president obama made a desperate and terrible deal with iran gave them 150 billion dollars plus i 8 billion dollars in cash iran was in big trouble and he bailed them out gave them a free path to nuclear weapons and soon instead of saying thank you iran yelled death to america i terminated deal tweet friday trump on his accomplishments and then terminating one of the worst deals ever made the iran deal that was made by president obama paid 150 billion paid 1 8 billion in cash i terminated that and iran is a much different country fox news interview wednesday the facts there was no 150 billion payout from the u s treasury the money he refers to represents iranian assets held abroad that were frozen until the international deal was reached and tehran was allowed to access its funds the payout of about 1 8 billion is a separate matter that dates to the 1970s when iran paid the u s 400 million for military equipment that was never delivered because the government was overthrown and diplomatic relations ruptured that left people businesses and governments in each country indebted to partners in the other and these complex claims took decades to sort out in tribunals and arbitration for its part iran paid settlements of more than 2 5 billion to u s citizens and businesses the day after the nuclear deal was implemented the u s and iran announced they had settled the claim over the 1970s military equipment order with the u s agreeing to pay the 400 million principal along with about 1 3 billion in interest the 400 million was paid in cash and flown to tehran on a cargo plane which gave rise to trump s dramatic accounts of money stuffed in barrels or boxes and delivered in the dead of night the arrangement provided for the interest to be paid later not crammed into containers ___ energy trump we ve ended the last administration s cruel and heartless war on american energy what they were doing to our energy should never be forgotten the united states is now the no 1 producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world orlando rally trump we re now no 1 in the world in energy fox news interview wednesday the facts as he s done many times before trump is crediting himself with things that happened under obama here s what the government s u s energy information administration says the united states has been the world s top producer of natural gas since 2009 when u s natural gas production surpassed that of russia and the world s top producer of petroleum hydrocarbons since 2013 when u s production exceeded saudi arabia s ___ jobs trump almost 160 million people are working that s more than ever before orlando rally the facts true but that s a tribute to americans making babies and immigrants coming to the country population growth in other words other than during recessions employment growth has been trending upward since 1939 when the labor department started counting the phenomenon is not a marker of leadership it has spanned successful and failed presidents more on point the annual rate of job growth has been within the same range since roughly 2011 it was 1 6 through may another measure is the proportion of americans with jobs and that is still below record highs the labor department says 60 6 percent of people in the u s 16 years and older were working in may that s below the all time high of 64 7 percent in april 2000 during bill clinton s administration though higher than the 59 9 percent when trump was inaugurated in january 2017 ___ trump women s unemployment is now the lowest it s been in 74 years orlando rally the facts no the jobless rate for women of 3 1 in april was the lowest in 66 years not 74 and it ticked up in may to 3 2 ___ economy trump it s soaring to incredible new heights perhaps the greatest economy we ve had in the history of our country orlando rally the facts the economy is not one of the best in the country s history it expanded at an annual rate of 3 2 percent in the first quarter of this year that growth was the highest in just four years for the first quarter in the late 1990s growth topped 4 percent for four straight years a level it has not yet reached on an annual basis under trump growth even reached 7 2 percent in 1984 the economy grew 2 9 in 2018 the same pace it reached in 2015 under obama and simply hasn t hit historically high growth rates trump has legitimate claim to a good economy but when it comes to records there s one he will have to share with obama the economy is on track to achieve its longest expansion ever in july much of that decade long growth came during obama s presidency an achievement that trump so far has largely sustained other than in its durability the economy is far from the finest in history __ the wall trump we ll have over 400 miles built by the end of next year fox news interview wednesday trump we re going to have over 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year it s moving very rapidly orlando rally the facts that s highly unlikely and even if so the great majority of the wall he s talking about would be replacement barrier not new miles of construction trump has added strikingly little length to barriers along the mexico border despite his pre eminent 2016 campaign promise to get a wall done even to reach 400 miles or 640 kilometers he would have to prevail in legal challenges to his declaration of a national emergency or get congress to find more money to get anywhere close so far the administration has awarded contracts for 247 miles 395 km of wall construction but that initiative has been constrained by court cases that are still playing out in any event all but 17 miles 27 km of his awarded contracts so far would replace existing barriers ___ taxes trump we ve done so much with the biggest tax cut in history orlando rally the facts his tax cuts are nowhere close to the biggest in u s history it s a 1 5 trillion tax cut over 10 years as a share of the total economy a tax cut of that size ranks 12th according to the committee for a responsible federal budget president ronald reagan s 1981 cut is the biggest followed by the 1945 rollback of taxes that financed world war ii post reagan tax cuts also stand among the historically significant president george w bush s cuts in the early 2000s and obama s renewal of them a decade later ___ environment trump our water and our air today is cleaner than it ever was our air it s the best it ever was fox news interview wednesday trump our air and water are the cleanest they ve ever been by far orlando rally the facts not true about air quality which hasn t gotten better under the trump administration u s drinking water is among the best by one leading measure after decades of improvement progress in air quality has stalled over the last two years the u s had more polluted air days than just a few years earlier federal data show there were 15 more days with unhealthy air in america both last year and the year before than there were on average from 2013 through 2016 the four years when america had its fewest number of those days since at least 1980 the obama administration in fact set records for the fewest air polluted days in 2016 on water yale university s global environmental performance index finds 10 countries tied for the cleanest drinking water the u s among them on environmental quality overall the u s was 27th behind a variety of european countries canada japan australia and more switzerland was no 1 ___ judges trump on the confirmation of federal judges president obama was very nice to us he didn t fill the positions orlando rally the facts trump s sarcasm aside he does have a better success rate than obama in filling judicial vacancies the republican controlled senate in obama s last two years avoided taking action on many of his nominees republicans still control the senate and have been able to confirm about 120 of trump s picks despite their slim majority that s about 35 more than obama had confirmed at this point in his presidency ___ health care trump we will always protect patients with pre existing conditions always orlando rally the facts his administration s actions say otherwise it is pressing in court for full repeal of obama s health law which requires insurers to take all applicants regardless of medical history and charge the same standard premiums to healthy people and those who had medical problems before or when they signed up trump and other republicans say they ll have a plan to preserve protections for people with pre existing conditions but the white house has provided no details ___ abortion trump leading democrats have even opposed measures to prevent the execution of children after birth orlando rally the facts executing children is already a crime trump is offering here a somewhat toned down version of a distorted story he s been telling for months that falsely suggests democrats are ok with murder his account arises from extremely rare instances when babies are born alive as a result of an attempted abortion when these cases occur execution is not an option when a baby is born with anomalies so severe that he or she would die soon after birth a family may choose what s known as palliative care or comfort care this might involve allowing the baby to die naturally without medical intervention providing comfort without life extending treatment is not specific to newborns it may happen with fatally ill patients of any age ___ veterans trump we passed va choice they ve been trying to get that passed also for about 44 years orlando rally the facts no congress approved the private sector veterans choice health program in 2014 and obama signed it into law trump signed an expansion of it ___ russia investigation trump i m the most transparent president in history i let mueller have everything they wanted fox news interview wednesday the facts it s highly questionable to say trump was fully cooperative in the russia investigation trump declined to sit for an interview with robert mueller s team gave written answers that investigators described as inadequate and incomplete said more than 30 times that he could not remember something he was asked about in writing and according to the report tried to get aides to fire the special counsel or otherwise shut or limit the inquiry in the end the mueller report found no criminal conspiracy between the trump campaign and russia but left open the question of whether trump obstructed justice according to the report mueller s team declined to make a prosecutorial judgment on whether to charge partly because of a justice department legal opinion that said sitting presidents shouldn t be indicted the report instead factually laid out instances in which trump might have obstructed justice specifically

fed likely to leave rates alone but signal readiness to cut washington ap jerome powell has tantalized the financial world with the prospect that the federal reserve he leads may soon cut interest rates for the first time in over a decade probably not quite yet though when the fed issues a policy statement wednesday and powell holds a news conference the message will likely echo the theme the chairman struck in a speech early this month that the fed will act if it thinks the trump administration s trade conflicts are threatening the u s economy powell s remarks were seen as a signal that the fed will likely cut rates later this year and the stock market surged in response yet economists say when or even whether the fed eases credit this year will depend on a host of factors that are hard to predict will trump s trade wars be resolved before they inflict real damage on the economy will the job market remain resilient will inflation finally edge close to the fed s target level investors collectively envision a fed rate cut by july and possibly further cuts after that some are even betting on a rate cut this week many economists though think the fed will wait until september at the earliest to announce its first drop in its benchmark short term interest rate since 2008 and might not cut again in 2019 a few fed watchers foresee no rate cut at all this year file in this june 4 2019 file photo federal reserve chairman jerome powell speaks at a conference involving its review of its interest rate policy strategy and communications in chicago on wednesday june 19 the federal reserve releases its latest monetary policy statement and updated economic projections ap photo kiichiro sato file the fed is meeting this week against the backdrop of president donald trump s trade war with china with its escalating tariffs and counter tariffs on each other s products the trade war has magnified concern and uncertainty for businesses and investors about whether and how much the economy will suffer the u s manufacturing sector in particular is weakening on monday the federal reserve bank of new york reported that an index it compiles of manufacturing in new york state plunged this month into negative territory to its lowest point since 2016 the index reflects manufacturing conditions in the state trump is expected to meet with president xi jinping of china at a group of 20 nations summit in japan at the end of this month the fed may want to see whether that meeting produces any breakthrough in the u s china trade war before deciding whether the economy requires an interest rate cut i think any fed move this week would be premature said sung won sohn an economics professor at loyola marymount university in los angeles still some fed watchers think that in the policy statement the central bank will issue wednesday it will replace a reference to being patient about rate changes to some new phrasing that would hint at a forthcoming rate cut should it decide the economy needs it when the fed adjusts its key short term rate it influences rates on everything from mortgages to credit cards to home equity lines of credit and can help stimulate the economy analysts expect the fed s description of the economy to note signs of a slowdown i think the fed will talk about the weakening labor market and softness in business investment to acknowledge that growth has downshifted said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics the statement will reinforce the message that powell has already articulated that the economy is slowing and the trade war will pose an additional threat if it escalates most analysts say they think economic growth has slowed sharply in the current april june quarter to around a 1 5 percent annual rate only half the pace of the past year unemployment remains at a 50 year low of 3 6 percent though job growth slowed to just 75 000 in may a possible sign that some employers have become more cautious about hiring trump gearing up for his 2020 re election campaign has been escalating his public attacks on the fed a highly unusual move that has raised concern that he is undermining the fed s independence as a central bank the president has asserted that under powell s leadership the fed hurt the economy by tightening credit too much last year and by failing to lower rates since then in television interviews last week trump insisted that the fed s policies have been very destructive to us and argued that the economy and the stock market would be performing far better under a looser interest rate policy when powell has been asked about trump s attacks on the fed he has replied simply that the central bank will do whatever it thinks best for the economy regardless of political pressures though most analysts think the fed will cut rates at least once before the year ends others foresee no changes at all this year especially if the u s china trade war is resolved and the economy and the job market appear solid advertisement if there is a rate cut this year i think it will be much later in the year and i don t see more than one cut said david jones an economist and veteran fed watcher i just think the fed would like to stick with what they ve got they are solidly in neutral at the moment

they had settled the claim over the 1970s military equipment order with the u s agreeing to pay the 400 million principal along with about 1 3 billion in interest the 400 million was paid in cash and flown to tehran on a cargo plane which gave rise to trump s dramatic accounts of money stuffed in barrels or boxes and delivered in the dead of night the arrangement provided for the interest to be paid later not crammed into containers ___ energy trump we ve ended the last administration s cruel and heartless war on american energy what they were doing to our energy should never be forgotten the united states is now the no 1 producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world orlando rally trump we re now no 1 in the world in energy fox news interview wednesday the facts as he s done many times before trump is crediting himself with things that happened under obama here s what the government s u s energy information administration says the united states has been the world s top producer of natural gas since 2009 when u s natural gas production surpassed that of russia and the world s top producer of petroleum hydrocarbons since 2013 when u s production exceeded saudi arabia s ___ jobs trump almost 160 million people are working that s more than ever before orlando rally the facts true but that s a tribute to americans making babies and immigrants coming to the country population growth in other words other than during recessions employment growth has been trending upward since 1939 when the labor department started counting the phenomenon is not a marker of leadership it has spanned successful and failed presidents more on point the annual rate of job growth has been within the same range since roughly 2011 it was 1 6 through may another measure is the proportion of americans with jobs and that is still below record highs the labor department says 60 6 percent of people in the u s 16 years and older were working in may that s below the all time high of 64 7 percent in april 2000 during bill clinton s administration though higher than the 59 9 percent when trump was inaugurated in january 2017 ___ trump women s unemployment is now the lowest it s been in 74 years orlando rally the facts no the jobless rate for women of 3 1 in april was the lowest in 66 years not 74 and it ticked up in may to 3 2 ___ economy trump it s soaring to incredible new heights perhaps the greatest economy we ve had in the history of our country orlando rally the facts the economy is not one of the best in the country s history it expanded at an annual rate of 3 2 percent in the first quarter of this year that growth was the highest in just four years for the first quarter in the late 1990s growth topped 4 percent for four straight years a level it has not yet reached on an annual basis under trump growth even reached 7 2 percent in 1984 the economy grew 2 9 in 2018 the same pace it reached in 2015 under obama and simply hasn t hit historically high growth rates trump has legitimate claim to a good economy but when it comes to records there s one he will have to share with obama the economy is on track to achieve its longest expansion ever in july much of that decade long growth came during obama s presidency an achievement that trump so far has largely sustained other than in its durability the economy is far from the finest in history __ the wall trump we ll have over 400 miles built by the end of next year fox news interview wednesday trump we re going to have over 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year it s moving very rapidly orlando rally the facts that s highly unlikely and even if so the great majority of the wall he s talking about would be replacement barrier not new miles of construction trump has added strikingly little length to barriers along the mexico border despite his pre eminent 2016 campaign promise to get a wall done even to reach 400 miles or 640 kilometers he would have to prevail in legal challenges to his declaration of a national emergency or get congress to find more money to get anywhere close so far the administration has awarded contracts for 247 miles 395 km of wall construction but that initiative has been constrained by court cases that are still playing out in any event all but 17 miles 27 km of his awarded contracts so far would replace existing barriers ___ taxes trump we ve done so much with the biggest tax cut in history orlando rally the facts his tax cuts are nowhere close to the biggest in u s history it s a 1 5 trillion tax cut over 10 years as a share of the total economy a tax cut of that size ranks 12th according to the committee for a responsible federal budget president ronald reagan s 1981 cut is the biggest followed by the 1945 rollback of taxes that financed world war ii post reagan tax cuts also stand among the historically significant president george w bush s cuts in the early 2000s and obama s renewal of them a decade later ___ environment trump our water and our air today is cleaner than it ever was our air it s the best it ever was fox news interview wednesday trump our air and water are the cleanest they ve ever been by far orlando rally the facts not true about air quality which hasn t gotten better under the trump administration u s drinking water is among the best by one leading measure after decades of improvement progress in air quality has stalled over the last two years the u s had more polluted air days than just a few years earlier federal data show there were 15 more days with unhealthy air in america both last year and the year before than there were on average from 2013 through 2016 the four years when america had its fewest number of those days since at least 1980 the obama administration in fact set records for the fewest air polluted days in 2016 on water yale university s global environmental performance index finds 10 countries tied for the cleanest drinking water the u s among them on environmental quality overall the u s was 27th behind a variety of european countries canada japan australia and more switzerland was no 1 ___ judges trump on the confirmation of federal judges president obama was very nice to us he didn t fill the positions orlando rally the facts trump s sarcasm aside he does have a better success rate than obama in filling judicial vacancies the republican controlled senate in obama s last two years avoided taking action on many of his nominees republicans still control the senate and have been able to confirm about 120 of trump s picks despite their slim majority that s about 35 more than obama had confirmed at this point in his presidency ___ health care trump we will always protect patients with pre existing conditions always orlando rally the facts his administration s actions say otherwise it is pressing in court for full repeal of obama s health law which requires insurers to take all applicants regardless of medical history and charge the same standard premiums to healthy people and those who had medical problems before or when they signed up trump and other republicans say they ll have a plan to preserve protections for people with pre existing conditions but the white house has provided no details ___ abortion trump leading democrats have even opposed measures to prevent the execution of children after birth orlando rally the facts executing children is already a crime trump is offering here a somewhat toned down version of a distorted story he s been telling for months that falsely suggests democrats are ok with murder his account arises from extremely rare instances when babies are born alive as a result of an attempted abortion when these cases occur execution is not an option when a baby is born with anomalies so severe that he or she would die soon after birth a family may choose what s known as palliative care or comfort care this might involve allowing the baby to die naturally without medical intervention providing comfort without life extending treatment is not specific to newborns it may happen with fatally ill patients of any age ___ veterans trump we passed va choice they ve been trying to get that passed also for about 44 years orlando rally the facts no congress approved the private sector veterans choice health program in 2014 and obama signed it into law trump signed an expansion of it ___ russia investigation trump i m the most transparent president in history i let mueller have everything they wanted fox news interview wednesday the facts it s highly questionable to say trump was fully cooperative in the russia investigation trump declined to sit for an interview with robert mueller s team gave written answers that investigators described as inadequate and incomplete said more than 30 times that he could not remember something he was asked about in writing and according to the report tried to get aides to fire the special counsel or otherwise shut or limit the inquiry in the end the mueller report found no criminal conspiracy between the trump campaign and russia but left open the question of whether trump obstructed justice according to the report mueller s team declined to make a prosecutorial judgment on whether to charge partly because of a justice department legal opinion that said sitting presidents shouldn t be indicted the report instead factually laid out instances in which trump might have obstructed justice specifically leaving it open for congress to take up the matter ___ associated press writers josh boak christopher rugaber matthew daly seth borenstein ricardo alonso zaldivar and colleen long in washington and elliot spagat in san diego contributed to this report ___ find ap fact check follow

brics the real reason they are important october 24 2012 6 13 pm brics are embracing the change argues senior journalist peter lavelle in his swot analysis it is a truism today to say the brics countries brazil russia india china and south africa are important however this is rarely explained why this is the case other than these five countries are key drivers of global economic growth in a time when most advanced western economies are grappling with austerity indeed this is obvious but the brics mean so much more what follows is a swot analysis explaining their real importance and quite possibly reasons to expect the brics to be around for a while to come as well as to stand out as countries to be emulated in the emerging market world strengths the greatest strength the brics have is their though relative in these tough times growth stories the imf has recently released a new global growth forecast cutting growth from 3 3 per cent in 2012 and 3 6 per cent in 2013 down from 3 5 per cent this year and 3 9 per cent next year no one can blame the brics for this new forecast in fact the imf squarely put blame on the u s and europe for not getting their fiscal monetary budget cliffs in order to be fair china s growth trajectory is slowing but that is partly due to lower demand for its exports by the more advanced economies another strength is the continued internal purchasing demand within each of the brics economies importantly another strength is the natural tendency to trade their goods in national currencies the brics you see have a natural desire to start avoiding the greenback the american debt crisis and the continued use of quantitative easing by the federal reserve weaken the dollar s prospects some of the collective declarations brics have made have been an interesting turn of events most notably while doling out 75 billion to the imf for the eurozone bailout fund also when they spoke out against protectionism in the december 2011 wto ministerial meet issuing a joint declaration to the effect weaknesses at face value the greatest weakness of the brics is the fact that they are treated as junior partners by the major emerged economies the imf washington consensus has long been designed to protect and advance the economies of the euro atlantic japan sphere of economic influence changing this hard and one could argue ultimately unfair reality has been slow coming however the great recession of 2008 to the present has changed this calculus the brics have scarce overlapping and collective foreign policy agendas and as a result unable to create a united front to demand reordering of the global political system overnight or anytime soon though they can and are separately demanding the rich western world under siege due to their own policy mistakes to take pause and truly listen to the complaints of the emerging market world the most recent wto trade round comes to mind as well as russia and china s growing complaints regarding washington deteriorating debt problems threats for those secretly hoping the brics will present themselves as an alternative to western centric political order any time soon would be ill advised to bet the farm on this scenario the greatest threat to the brics is western mismanagement of their economies what they can do collectively at the moment is increased bilateral trade among themselves using their national currencies the eurozone crisis and washington s propensity to export inflation via quantitative easing threatens not only the brics but also the rest of the global economy also and ironically another threat is the obvious political desire of individual brics countries to act out alone separately when victims of selfish policy making coming out washington and brussels we witnessed this not long ago with brazil s fury against ben bernanke quantitative easing loud words came out of brasilia but almost zero international read brics collective response opportunities the most important opportunity the brics have before them is the growing ability to act alone and collectively this may seem paradoxical but it isn t opportunities abound first continue real and meaningful reforms at home all the brics have ample room to re structure their economies to be more competitive globally and grow their middle classes and combat poverty they all have a toolbox of fiscal and monetary options unlike their emerged western peers all have learned the lesson of not financialising their economies wall street and high street are acts not to follow in these emerging and vitally important states the real economy counts and real people count even more concluding thoughts the fact the brics exist says something important and very telling the current global economic and financial order is undergoing irreversible change because it is exhausted and out of new ideas the brics are not forcing this change they are embracing it and adapting to this change accordingly the brics will rarely act together toward particular foreign policy goals but count on them to all collectively demand the global economy truly serve the interests of consumers in the global marketplace each member of the brics have specific and diverse characteristics but their interest toward a more equitable global economic order is all but universal among them the views expressed in

according to the chinese calendar 2019 is denoted as the year of the pig for swiss investment bank ubs the year of the pig has not been particularly kind to the firm in china earlier this month paul donovan an economist at ubs broadcast a research note on consumer price inflation in the note he described the impact of swine flu on consumer price inflation in china and went on to comment that the incidence of swine flu matters if you are a chinese pig and it matters if you are consuming pork in china the reaction to donovan s comments were swift and furious social media in china captured the phrase chinese pig suggesting the author committed an act of racial insensitivity and naked racism in the days following both paul donovan and ubs felt the wrath of china s blogosphere and the bank was dropped from transactions already in progress over the course of many years ubs has carefully built its platform in china and has recently gained approval to take majority control over its securities joint venture there ubs securities with this incident it seems all of that is now in peril on its face it would be very difficult to say the economist s words or statement were in any way shape or form racist nevertheless this incident demonstrates the pitfalls of doing business in china and the possibility that words taken out of context can be lost in translation in order to implement damage control ubs has benched donovan and has made numerous public apologies to assuage the authorities in china and the chinese people that it rectify its mistakes caught in the vise of heightened sensitivities partly associated with the ongoing trade war with the united states there is a growing sense of nationalism and national pride within chinese society as the trade war continues unabated evidence is mounting that the economic picture within china is becoming increasingly clouded growing sentiment within the united states of china s unfair trade practices has only elevated defensiveness within china resulting in backlash against ubs how will this play out for ubs will ubs be forever shut out of china s market in my opinion no this incident and the longer term impact on ubs will soon fade the reason being is that china is going to need all of the help it can get as trade frictions continue unresolved all of the vital signs of china s economy are starting to point in a downward direction as the trade wars and tariffs start to bite chinese consumers are tightening their belts as seen in lower automotive sales and factories laying off workers as orders begin to dry up foreign companies including apple are starting to pull their factories out of china and rearrange supply chains to places such as vietnam as trade flows and foreign direct investment go into reverse stresses within china s economy will become increasingly difficult to manage china s debt to gdp ratio stands at over 250 percent for many observers this is the ticking time bomb that overhangs the chinese economy much of this debt resides in both private sector and public sector entities with a significant portion held in numerous underperforming state owned companies the portion of non performing loans in loan portfolios is escalating and this situation is bound to get worse as trade flows contract due to the ongoing trade wars to address rising risks on the horizon china has imposed currency controls advanced numerous liquidity injections into the banking system restricted outbound investment and acquisitions and restrained lending into speculative sectors such as real estate in 2018 china s state council approved measures for debt laden chinese companies to convert outstanding debt to equity as a measure to shore up deteriorating bank balance sheets given this backdrop and the growing clouds on the financial horizon china will need access to global capital markets and the services that ubs can provide china s leaders would be well advised to heed the words of sun tzu in the art of war insult and injury is temporary death is permanent arthur dong is a professor at georgetown university s mcdonough school of business he specializes in legal and business engagements between china and the united states
call for strong and sovereign union making europe more sovereign is proclaimed to be their main concern which requires considerable willingness to compromise on both sides the paper reads only a strong sovereign and empowered europe can assert its values and the interests of its citizens if we do not want others to decide over our heads europe has to provide a response maas commented according to spiegel it also puts forward detailed proposals for reforms both france and germany supported making decisions by the majority in what concerns foreign policy and called to increase political costs for undermining eu unanimity the paper suggests that the eu member states which see the majority s decision critical should rather constructively abstain instead of voting against the decision autonomous defence policy spiegel also points out that many proposals are aimed at making the eu more independent from major powers including russia china and the us among other things the document repeatedly mentions the european payment channel instex that is supposed to maintain the eu iranian trade against the backdrop of new us sanctions the agreement points out that the eu needs more effective instruments to ward off the extraterritorial sanctions of third countries the document also suggests that the eu should have more autonomous defence policy as maas and le drian called for a european security council to be set up and better implementation of joint arms exports rules besides berlin and paris called for establishing a european military training mission called the peace facility eff designed to support african partners growing industry giants the top diplomats also insist on revising industrial policies and eu competition rules to make it possible for european businesses to compete at the global level and create european industry champions in different spheres namely battery cell manufacturing smart health technology and cybersecurity we want to systematically strengthen europe s capabilities as a technology and science champion maas said this goes hand in hand in hand with calls to develop a robust trade policy which includes negotiating a free trade agreement with the uk and fair rules for dealing with china namely full access of european companies to the chinese market and the protection of intellectual property france and germany also called for closer integration within the currency union trying to persuade sceptics including the netherlands and the baltic states to make the euro more independent of the dollar and more important as a reserve currency worldwide several eu governments have shown their support for a more independent course amid the escalating tensions between washington and brussels the relations of transatlantic partners have been marred with donald trump s decision to impose higher import duties following a tariff row and the us withdrawal from the iran nuclear deal amid the disagreements france germany and spain endorsed the idea of a real european army which would have greater autonomy from the us this did not go over well with nato nor washington nato secretary general stoltenberg said that europe should organise its defence efforts within nato rather than on its own while us president donald trump who has long been pushing europeans to beef up contributions to the alliance called macron s idea insulting
claim president trump says the us economy is perhaps the greatest it s ever been he launched his 2020 re election campaign at a rally in florida with the familiar claim about the success of the economy under his administration according to the washington post last year the president has made the claim or a variant of it dozens of times reality check verdict yes the economy has been doing well but there have been periods when it was even stronger there are some indicators that are less good and fears over the consequences of a trade war with china have unsettled financial markets the growth in gdp the value of goods and services in the economy has generally been strong the most recent data shows a 3 1 growth for the first quarter of 2019 this is lower than the 2018 peak of 4 2 second quarter which has been the highest level achieved during president trump s administration this is however less than the 5 1 achieved in the second quarter of 2014 during the obama presidency and there were times in the 1950s and 1960s when gdp growth was even higher if you choose to look at the health of the economy based on gdp mr trump s claims are suspect when compared to the national economic boom of the post war years says megan black assistant professor of history at the london school of economics the post war era saw tremendous economic growth most notably in manufacturing but also in agriculture transportation trade finance real estate and mining so the growth indicators currently are good but not the best ever stock market soars then wobbles president trump has highlighted the rising value of us financial markets in particular the dow jones industrial average which follows the shares of 30 major us companies it s true the dow reached record highs under his administration mr trump s supporters argue that his corporation tax cuts along with his us focused policies his clampdown on bureaucracy and his promises of infrastructure investment have all helped however in recent months the index has been highly volatile in december 2018 it recorded its biggest weekly drop in percentage terms since 2008 the sharp fall was attributed to trade tensions with china interest rate increases and a looming government shutdown that worried the markets jobs and wages so what s happening in the broader economy with employment and wages the unemployment rate in may stood at 3 6 the lowest since 1969 it s been falling for some years a downward trend that began during president barack obama s time in office ryan sweet of moody s analytics points to the changing profile of the us working population as a key factor here there is now a greater proportion of older workers and better educated workers both of which tend to have lower unemployment rates mr trump has also highlighted record low levels of african american unemployment in particular he s right in that in may 2018 unemployment for black americans fell to 5 9 the lowest figure since the 1970s but it increased to 7 in february this year and is currently 6 2 some us media reporting at the time highlighted some important caveats the figures tend to be volatile and vary from month to month the rate is still higher than for other ethnic groups and the president s daughter ivanka has tweeted that the unemployment rate for women was at a 65 year low again that had begun to fall prior to mr trump taking office as for wages average hourly earnings growth throughout 2017 was between 2 5 and 2 9 continuing a generally upward trend which began during president obama s administration this year wages continued to rise and reached 3 4 in february before slowing slightly they are currently rising faster than the rate of inflation which was 1 8 in may 2019 which means real incomes are rising a final measure worth looking at is household income real median household income has been growing for the past three years but the rate of growth has slowed according to official figures and in september 2018 the us census bureau questioned whether its own figure for 2017 a record high of 61 372 per annum was that high due to differences in the way surveys had been conducted in previous years it s true that the fiscal stimulus tax cuts and federal government spending rises under president trump have helped to provide an impetus to growth even if by some indicators not everyone may be feeling the benefits

first the pound and then the dollar global currencies are usually centuries in the making and reflect the clout of the nation state underpinning them now facebook plans to short circuit that historical and economic process and to create from scratch an instant world currency its latin based name libra from which the symbol is derived hints at the vaulting ambition of the project mark zuckerberg the founder and driving force of facebook looks set on trying to create a new monetary domain to rival the roman empire libra is not the first attempt to create a new digital currency based on the blockchain technology to secure and validate transactions through a common digital ledger that honour goes to bitcoin launched a decade ago the first cryptocurrency s rollercoaster ride showed that it failed to satisfy the three crucial functions of any money namely providing a stable store of value an effective means of exchange and a unit of account bitcoin is in effect a speculative asset rather than a meaningful currency unlike bitcoin and other wannabe cryptocurrencies created in its wake libra does have a realistic chance to become a new money that is widely used for one thing it will use an initially centralised version of the blockchain technology which for some subverts its very point which is to distribute authority unlike bitcoin it will not require massive computational power and use of electricity to validate transactions as important libra will be backed by assets in the shape of bank deposits and short term government securities that reserve held in a basket of national currencies will come mainly from the users of libra through the money they pay to purchase it this should provide ballast for the value of libra avoiding the wild lurches of bitcoin though it will still fluctuate against the dollar and other national currencies as well as offering a relatively stable digital currency libra will have the backing of a wide range of stakeholders other than facebook an independent not for profit body will govern and manage the new currency based in geneva the libra association will draw its members from non profit organisations as well as global businesses twenty eight outfits including facebook have already pledged to become founder members each making an investment of at least 10m these include financial firms such as paypal and visa online services such as spotify and ebay telecoms companies such as vodafone and non profit organisations such as kiva and mercy corps notably no bank has yet joined the hope is that there will be around 100 members each with one vote by the time of the launch in the first half of 2020 most important of all libra will be able to tap into facebook s global network of 2 4bn monthly users although it will face competition calibra a new subsidiary of facebook looks likely to dominate access to the new currency calibra will provide a digital wallet that customers can use to save send and spend libra together with other providers of such wallets it will work with authorised resellers such as cryptocurrency exchanges that will allow users to change their money into libra facebook aims to slash if not eliminate the cost of making payments across frontiers one big potential market for such low cost transfers is the remittances sent by migrants to their families those sent to low and middle income countries amounted to 529bn in 2018 according to the world bank which estimates that the global average cost of sending 200 to such economies was around 7 per cent in the first quarter of 2019 facebook also hopes that the service will serve the 1 7bn around the world who lack access to a bank creating a more inclusive financial system despite such worthy sounding ambitions facebook has a hard nosed commercial rationale to set up libra mixing payments and advertising has been a successful model for wechat the chinese super app that started as a messaging service but now provides much more besides although calibra will not generally share account information or financial data with facebook or any third party without customer consent some customers may indeed give their permission even if they do not calibra will reinforce facebook s appeal to its existing users while luring more in facebook s battlecry was once to move fast and break things the company may have dropped that motto but it now looks intent on smashing the old monetary order the new currency is a challenge to central banks and regulators as much as to payment providers facebook has taken on a formidable bunch of adversaries which are likely to turn the launch of libra into an obstacle course the plan for libra talks grandly about working with authorities to shape a regulatory environment that encourages technological innovation while maintaining high standards of consumer protection not so fast they will respond you will have to follow the same rules as other financial institutions calibra will apply for money transmission licences but this may not be enough if libra is categorised as a security it will come under the securities and exchange commission in america and regulators elsewhere are likely to muscle in too already the g7 countries are on the case setting up a new working group to examine wider risks to the financial system a particular worry is that the new currency could become a vehicle for money laundering regulators around the world will want to ensure that this does not happen and are likely to demand compliance with obligations such as know your customer which will increase costs mark carney governor of the bank of england said in his mansion house speech on thursday that the central bank approaches libra with an open mind but not an open door arguing that if the new currency fulfilled its ambitions it would be systemically important at the least facebook is likely to find that the proposed launch of libra in the first half of 2020 could be grounded for some time to come zuckerberg is used to getting his own way but this time he may find that he has reached too far
actor danny glover right and author ta nehisi coates left testify about reparation for the descendants of slaves during a hearing before the house judiciary subcommittee on the constitution civil rights and civil liberties at the capitol in washington wednesday june 19 2019 ap photo pablo martinez monsivais do the descendants of slaves deserve reparations for the first time in a century and a half there is a legitimate political debate on this question many of the top democratic presidential hopefuls support establishing them in some form or at least launching a commission to study how it might be done this past week on juneteenth the house held a hearing on h r 40 a bill that would do just that but if americans are now willing to entertain the notion of restorative justice for the legacy of institutional racism slavery alone is the wrong place to focus the damge to african americans goes far beyond abolition in 1865 efforts to subordinate and economically exploit black people continued though peonage convict leasing sharecropping jim crow redlined black ghettos and mass incarceration the ideology of white supremacy used to justify slavery persists why should subsequent racist practices get a pass while we zoom in on outright bondage anti black segregation lives on and the current damage to slavery s descendants is direct and measurable in other words reparations should repair what white supremacy still breaks atoning for the legacy of chattel slavery is simply not enough in 2016 the average black male worker earned only 70 of the hourly wage of the average white male down from 80 in 1979 education does not change widening black white wage gaps they exist at all education and wage levels only 41 of black families were homeowners in 2014 compared to 71 of white families for every dollar of wealth held by a median white family a median black family holds 8 cents in wealth black students perennially lag whites in achievement not to mention high school and college completion blacks and whites use drugs at similar rates but african americans are 6 5 times more likely than whites to be imprisoned by states for drug charges where did these unequal conditions come from they aren t just the aftereffects of slavery generations of intentionally racist policies play a role from the early 1900s through the 1960s the descendants of slaves migrated north and west to escape jim crow and seek opportunity america s response to this great migration of at least 6 million people was to confine them in ghettos disinvest there and overinvest in white areas a pattern of unequal distributional politics that continues to this day in the 1930s a federal agency the home owners loan corporation redlined more than 200 american cities giving majority black neighborhoods a lowly d rating on a scale of a to d which marked them as hazardous to lending institutions grade a went only to homogenous white neighborhoods that decision reverberated and became destiny blacks could not get loans to buy or invest in their homes starving whole neighborhoods of credit discouraged outsiders from investing there a recent federal reserve study examined those neighborhoods and found that a d rating 80 years ago correlated with present disinvestment and decline it increased black segregation and depressed homeownership and property values it accounted for 40 of the gap in home values between d and c rated neighborhoods by 1980 and untold differences in value compared with a neighborhoods major federal policies supported expanding and demarcating segregated black space and exclusionary white space the federal housing administration fha insured the 30 year mortgage to bring homeownership to the masses who turned out to be white thanks to low down payments and interest rates for those who could qualify for an fha guaranteed loan buying a home became cheaper than renting the fha insured mortgages primarily for white suburbia creating and reifying white space while refusing to invest in black communities or to underwrite mortgages for blacks who sought to buy in white areas the veterans administration operated its mortgage insurance programs in the same racially discriminatory manner african americans cut out of the government s largest wealth building programs were preyed on by nontraditional lenders and washington paid city housing authorities to build public housing and acquiesced when officials intentionally assigned blacks and whites to separate and unequal housing projects the interstate highway program the largest public works project in history when it was built facilitated white flight from cities and created concrete barriers that demarcated the black side of town that whites learned to fear under the congressionally enacted urban renewal program for slum clearance which james baldwin called negro removal the federal government subsidized the local destruction of nearly 400 000 mostly black occupied homes cleansing downtown centers in the 1950s through the early 1960s most of those residents moved to segregated public housing or more marginal neighborhoods quarantining blacks in slum conditions and then blaming inhabitants for those conditions became its own vicious circle in the 20th century african americans were hypersegregated very high segregation along demographers metrics like dissimilarity and isolation in more than 40 cities no other racial or ethnic group was subjected to such apartheid thankfully levels of segregation between blacks and whites have declined considerably since 1970 but the footprint of concentrated poverty has exploded since 2000 the truly disadvantaged descendants of slaves are african americans stuck in neighborhoods that higher income blacks have fled politicians like president donald trump typecast them as thugs welfare queens or other stereotypes that mask opportunity hoarding among affluent whites and justify the way things are and federal state and local governments and private actors continue to invest in and encourage segregation in houston america s fourth largest city virtually no public housing is located in majority white areas by its own admission in an analysis submitted to the department of housing and urban development and approved by the mayor and city council in 2015 the city of houston concentrated more than 71 of government subsidized housing in only five of its 88 neighborhoods all of which were very poor and nonwhite other american cities mirror this intentional pattern with pernicious effects segregated communities tend to rate low on social mobility for poor children and the gap in life expectancy between blacks and whites in very segregated cities can rise to 20 years due to increased exposure to trauma lead poisoning allergens in poor quality housing fast food swamps and healthy food deserts clearly the repercussions of institutional government sanctioned racism live on and they extend well past the confines of slavery in 2016 overwhelmingly white school districts received 23 billion more in state and local funding than majority nonwhite districts that served about the same numbers of children according to edbuild a new jersey based group that researches and advocates for school funding this disparity is caused by inequality in property tax wealth differences in local tax bases in turn result from this long history of intentional segregation countries with high performing education systems put their most talented teachers and extra resources in disadvantaged schools according to the organization for economic co operation and development the vast majority of american states do the exact opposite a 2009study of texas schools for instance found that black students attended schools with less experienced teachers than white students had and that this inequity significantly affected a widening academic performance gap between black and white students texas is hardly an outlier unofficial redlining and mortgage discrimination against african americans continue in the 21st century predatory lenders targeted black neighborhoods for their most usurious subprime mortgages before the 2008 housing crisis according to a study by two princeton sociologists then foreclosures reduced the black homeownership rate to the level it was in 1968 at the start of the civil rights revolution in housing meanwhile segregation creates city politics that reproduce inequality political scientist jessica trounstine in her important new book segregation by design argues that wealthy whites still try to segregate themselves through restrictive zoning and anti black prejudice and that local governments still acquiesce and invest more in their neighborhoods in baltimore for example a recent analysis found that neighborhoods that are less than half black receive nearly four times the investment of neighborhoods that are overwhelmingly black maryland gov larry hogan in 2015 canceled a proposed light rail red line that would have connected poor jobless black neighborhoods of baltimore to major job centers hogan redirectedits earmarked state funding to roads in exurbs and rural counties meanwhile he supported the purple line for affluent suburbs of washington reparations should be designed to repair what is broken in this country to disrupt the practices of american caste that harm slavery s descendants and hoard opportunity in affluent areas they should create a new infrastructure of opportunity and inclusion in poor black neighborhoods richly resourced schools and community centers public transit opportunity fellowships housing choice vouchers and mandatory inclusive housing elsewhere a formal apology for slavery would be welcome but even better would be a commitment at all levels of government to stop causing and to reverse the harm sheryll cashin georgetown university sheryll cashin a law professor at georgetown

hi welcome to big a newsletter about the politics of monopoly if you d like to sign up you can do so here or just read on this issue is about the fear going through corporate america which is a little discussed topic because well there are few people willing to speak out and risk retribution but first some follow up on facebook s libra project which i discussed yesterday world domination facebook co founder chris hughes has a thoughtful piece in the ft making a few different points on why regulators should stop libra the first is how libra can undermine the ability of poor countries to conduct monetary policy and central banking in general the sponsors are right that a liquid stable currency would be attractive to many in emerging markets so attractive in fact that if enough people trade out of their local currencies they could threaten the ability of emerging market governments to control their monetary supply the local means of exchange and in some cases their ability to impose capital controls decentralisation is a popular silicon valley buzzword but it has decidedly failed in monetary policy centuries of financial instability led to the gradual emergence of today s network of central banks after many mistakes we have learnt that we want a central bank to act to increase or decrease the monetary supply in moments of contraction or expansion this power to help keep an economy stable is something we should be reinforcing and improving not endeavoring to demolish hughes also notes something else which is that the libra association could also wield significant power over the workings of global finance unless regulators jump in quickly these for profit companies will set the standards for identity verification at least in the short run as well as defining the rules and enforcement around the privacy of transactions and what to do in case of theft i hadn t really thought this through but if facebook is able to redefine compliance with the bank secrecy act rules it could restructure payments in a fairly profound way hughes is deeply concerned that libra will catch on i m a skeptic but then zuckerberg does have a track of changing the world so we can t dismiss this effort alphaville ft in contrast to hughes has a hilarious cheat sheet on what libra actually is and how shoddily done the project looks libra is not actually blockchain or crypto currency or permissionless it just uses those buzzwords to disguise the fact they are setting up an unregulated exchange trade fund and potentially violating antitrust law via a payments cartel alphaville s izabella kaminska raises a very good point which is that if you want to help the unbanked why do you need to create a new currency she also offers a new rule of thumb that sounds right for the last century new communications technologies radio television vcrs the internet have all been initially sold as something that will help with education and have actually been used for entertainment alphaville suggests a corollary for new financial technology it s initially sold as something that will help the unbanked and it s actually used to sell drugs none of this is to say the international payments system right now is perfect it s not international transfers cost enormous amounts of money largely price gouging by companies like western union but a significant announcement came yesterday not from facebook but from the bank of england which says it will allow tech companies which meet stringent standards to set up bank accounts at the bank of england address at the not actually kidding threadneedle street on par with banks and enter the payments business ok so there we go i worked in congress on dodd frank for years and in particular transparency at the federal reserve but the truth is i hate thinking about payments and finance no matter what it seems i can t get away from them curse you mark zuckerberg for forcing me to think about this stuff monopolies and a wave of terror in american commerce yesterday an important story came out on the house antitrust subcommittee investigation of big tech by by chairman david cicilline he talked about something we don t typically associate with commerce fear representative david cicilline a democrat and a top antitrust lawmaker said on thursday that many of the small digital companies are reliant on the giants for access to consumers saying that relationship makes them concerned about raising their voice raising concerns about the monopoly power of these platforms if you look at the size of some of the large platforms their ability to exclude people from the platform can result in closing the business cicilline told reporters that s sort of the most dangerous consequence of this kind of concentration is the ability to exclude rivals put them out of business diminish innovation diminish entrepreneurship diminish choices for consumers he said anyone who has worked in policy around antitrust will have experience with the little guy expressing terror at something his or her dominant supplier or buyer might do along with the frustration at not being able to say anything in public for fear of retaliation this is the core argument against monopolization which is that it prevents citizens from exercising their right to participate in the public square when i was a congressional staffer i was lobbied on once or twice a year by small companies concerned that a merger might destroy them for instance during the staples office depot merger a small company that made a certain office supply said that the 25 year old buyer who would take over the category in which they operated didn t like them and would simply start sourcing their product from china at a comparable cost if the merger went through poof 125 good jobs gone the executives told me that the entire supply chain was scared of this dynamic why i asked don t you or others oppose the merger publicly fear of retaliation this fear was enabled by the obama administration s antitrust policy and it had severe political consequences rural america moved far to the right during the obama years and there s a reason in the 2007 2008 primary in iowa obama discussed monopolization in agriculture which is particularly severe in the chicken industry when obama took office his administration began bold hearings into consolidation and told farmers they could speak out and the government would have their back against powerful processors i don t want to get into all of the details here but chicken processors essentially have no power vis a vis the large companies who contract them out to turn chicks into poultry they are told what feed to use how to care for the chickens and what price they will receive the ability to retaliate is total obama pledged something important for these proud farmers independence as lina khan reported years ago the message seemed to be clear the highest brass in the obama administration was listening closely to how america s independent farmers are pushed around by big companies and they were no longer going to tolerate it staples told the crowd at the hearing that he feared that pilgrim s pride the processing company with which he contracts might punish him for voicing his troubles later christine varney the government s chief antitrust regulator at the time who was sitting in front of an american flag spoke up mr staples let me say i fully expect you will not experience retaliation by virtue of your presence here today she said handing him a piece of paper with her phone number on it but if you do you call me the hearing erupted into applause of course varney did nothing eric holder did nothing and tom vilsack did little towards the end of the administration they proposed some mild regulations that the trump administration promptly threw in the trash but that was seven years after they promised there would be no retaliation and then enabled retaliation fear is pervasive across the economy at this point and most of the people who will speak up are those who have left their companies brian kelly the founder of pioneering ad technology appnexus testified to congress recently that google is a monopoly and needs to be broken up why was he able to do that because he sold his company to at t similarly i spoke on a panel a few months ago in congress on airlines and adam goldstein the former ceo of flight travel booking site hipmunk talked as well i used to love hipmunk but it s terrible now and i don t use it goldstein explained why he noted that after the wave of consolidation among airlines during the obama years airlines stopped allowing his site to have access to pricing data unless they hid certain routes to consumers this move to avoid competition destroyed the business and harmed consumers it s also obviously illegal and the department of transportation has antitrust authority it doesn t use to stop it why did goldstein speak publicly hipmunk sold itself off and he s no longer there i ve heard from venture capitalists frightened to talk for fear they can t sell portfolio companies to big tech i ve heard from farmers and boutique owners about retaliation small banks and credit unions on retaliation from their software providers and even large companies afraid they ll spook shareholders if they go public with how dominant google or amazon is fear is everywhere normalized even a week ago the united autoworkers lost a unionization vote in tennessee at a volkswagen plant the loss was devastating a win for the union would have been historic foreign automakers such as vw and toyota tm own 31 factories and produce nearly half of the cars built in the united states none of those 31 foreign owned plants have ever been unionized workers there are generally paid less than workers represented by the uaw the rumors were that volkswagen was telling workers that if they voted to unionize the company would simply shut the plant down was that true maybe but workers couldn t risk it again this is fear the fear of retaliation and now i m going to guess ford and gm are now going to demand more concessions from their workers who have few options like the farmers and ceos i ve mentioned none of this warranted much press attention or attention by the presidential candidates despite it being a central political problem in america today there are many public policy levers that brought us to this point of fear and desperation eroding antitrust laws union protections and financial rules are some of them but the point is that we are in a moment of low level quiet terror like a soft authoritarian regime where the coercive power functions by effectively seizing the property of its victims it s a bit like the mob without the breaking of kneecaps part though with health care systems as they are and remember the people i ve mentioned are relatively powerful ceos of companies venture capitalists farmers who own their own land unionized workers etc just go down the line and think about what it s like for those without property or power this situation is not new in the 1950s emanuel celler who i ll reference frequently in this newsletter had a debate with the ceo of dupont in the pages of reader s digest celler was discussing a situation where a ge salesman said he d sell refrigerator compressors at any cost to put a competitor out of business which caused panic in the refrigerator industry the head of ge charles wilson soon said there was nothing to the story and the salesman had been talked to still celler wrote i don t like to see men first terrorized and then relieved to find out that charles wilson is feeling kindly and won t let his men shoot here s how celler started out his essay under our ancient common law your neighbor must not point a gun at you even though he has never shot anyone similarly our antitrust laws were intended to protect businessmen not only from violence but from fear of violence i love that quote because it says it really says it all right there there are many reasons efficiency being one that we should force competition within markets without allowing anti competitive behavior we want companies competing over producing better goods and services not the acquisition and abuse of power it is simply more efficient if everyone has to win because their products are better as opposed to they have a bigger legal budget or more power but fundamentally america and any democracy should mean a land where we are free from fear free from domination right now in the commercial sector it is anything but thanks for reading and if you liked it you can sign up here for more issues of big a newsletter on how to

on june 17 the board of directors of the baltimore symphony orchestra locked out bso musicians in an escalation of its efforts to force the musicians to accept draconian cuts bso management is demanding a 20 percent cut in salary reduction in vacation from nine weeks to four and a permanent reduction in the orchestra s season from 52 weeks to 40 this latest assault on the livelihood of the 77 full time bso musicians comes just weeks after management canceled all summer concerts and reduced the annual number of paid weeks from 52 to 40 as a result of that decision announced on may 30 the musicians will not be paid from mid june into september and will have no health insurance after june 30 bso management continues to receive pay and benefits despite the cancellation of the summer concert series according to management they plan on ending the lockout in september in order to resume concerts for the 2019 2020 season if the lockout continues until september and the summer session is not reinstated the musicians will lose more than 2 5 million in wages and benefits the musicians have been working without a contract since january when a four month contract extension expired at the end of that contract the musicians were making less when adjusted for inflation than they were 10 years ago brian prechtl a percussionist with the bso told the baltimore sun that the lockout is a scare tactic to elicit a very punitive contract from the musicians they re going to balance the budget on our backs musicians and their supporters have been picketing in front of baltimore s meyerhoff symphony hall all week one supporter wrote on the bso s facebook page that he decision to lock out the musicians deny them their pay and forfeit your contractual obligations and promises is utterly unquestionably despicable bso management claims that the orchestra has lost more than 16 million over the past decade rather than drawing on its 60 million endowment or appealing to the state of maryland for additional funding management is taking aim at the musicians living standards of note the chair of the bso board of directors is barbara bozzuto married to thomas bozzuto chairman and co founder of the bozzuto group a major residential real estate developer in maryland according to the company s website it generates 500 million in annual revenue these are the social layers targeting one of baltimore s few remaining cultural institutions negotiations between the bso and the union for the musicians local 40 543 of the american federation of musicians resumed on friday at these negotiations the musicians learned that in addition to receiving no pay and no health insurance as of june 30 their long term disability insurance was canceled by bso management on june 17 and that effective september 1 the board will cancel their life insurance policies musicians are asking for a 2 percent cost of living raise and argue that management could easily afford this by drawing from the endowment increased state funding would also be an avenue to provide adequate funding for the musicians whose base salary is about 83 000 a year however as with other social welfare or cultural needs sufficient state funding for the symphony is not forthcoming while earlier this year the maryland general assembly passed legislation providing a meager 1 6 million for the bso in the 2020 fiscal year budget which begins july 1 and another 1 6 million for the following year governor larry hogan has said he is unlikely to release even these funds that amount would cover more than half the musicians salary and benefits for the summer months hogan told the baltimore sun we continually pour millions and millions of dollars into the bso but they ve got real serious issues and problems with the management with losing the support of their donor base and the legislature took the money out of the budget and fenced it off failure to provide for the cultural needs of the population stands in stark contrast to the willingness of capitalist politicians to provide handsome subsidies to big business as one example in april of last year the maryland legislature passed a tax incentive package of 8 5 billion in an unsuccessful attempt to lure amazon to the state to build a new headquarters merely 1 percent of this proposed handout could easily fund the baltimore symphony for many years in its coverage of the lockout jacobin magazine unsurprisingly portrayed this latest attack on the working class and its right to culture in racialist terms the democratic socialists of america dsa affiliated publication wrote jeopardizing one of baltimore s main cultural institutions is just another feather in the cap of hogan s program of austerity measures that punishes baltimore a minority majority city in order to rally the support of his wealthy white suburban base the attack on the baltimore symphony musicians is an attack on the working class as a whole this lockout and the attempt to drastically reduce the baltimore musicians pay comes amid similar efforts to attack the living standards of other symphony musicians in recent months in chicago musicians waged a seven week strike in the spring despite the courageous battle of the chicago musicians they were forced to accept a concessions filled contract due to the isolation of their strike by the trade unions the chicago workers had gone on strike principally to defend their defined benefit pension plan as a result of a deal pushed through by their union and strongly backed by then mayor rahm emanuel beginning july 1 2020 the musicians will transition from a defined benefit plan to a defined contribution plan with all new hires after that date placed in the defined contribution plan at the conclusion of the strike the dsa described this defeat in glowing terms stating on twitter congratulations to cso musicians on their 7 week long strike to protect their retirement benefits direct action gets the goods the struggle of symphony workers shows that the defense of culture and decent standards of living for cultural workers are incompatible with the capitalist system in which the social and cultural needs of the working class are subordinated to the profit interests of the wealthy in the end the only answer to the attacks on the bso musicians lies in mobilizing the broadest sections of the working class in the fight to defend art culture and every social right that is in the fight for socialism
president donald trump speaks during a meeting with canadian prime minister justin trudeau in the oval office of the white house thursday june 20 2019 in washington trump declared thursday that iran made a very big mistake in shooting down a u s drone but suggested it was an accident rather than a strategic error ap photo evan vucci the worry last week was that the trump administration was ginning up fake intelligence about iran blowing up oil tankers in the strait of hormuz to justify a war against iran then this week president donald trump said the iranian attacks weren t a big deal the episode is another indication of the underlying modesty not a very trumpian word of the administration subtract trump s taste for nonstop controversy and rhetorical brinkmanship and you re left with an incrementalist center right government that has pursued an expansionary fiscal policy and avoided foreign war for a period of peace and prosperity that in any other universe would be at the core of a stay the course reelection message for a while the obama doctrine was don t do stupid stuff the trump team has built out the doctrine to privately consider and sometimes openly threaten stupid stuff but at the end of the day don t do it usually the mexico tariff threat was typical if trump had gone through with the steadily escalating tariffs it would have been a blow to our own economy and that of an ally instead he got what might prove to be meaningful concessions from mexico even if he hadn t he easily could have found some reason to delay or call off the tariffs the thing about a trump threat is that he always controls whether he s going to go through with it or not he s going to pull out of the north american free trade agreement actually no he s not he s going to impose auto tariffs on canada well not really what he s going to do is sign a new trade deal with mexico and canada that s a somewhat altered version of nafta and urge congress to pass it allies might be understandably appalled or at times alarmed by his habit of berating them and squeezing them for concessions but the alliance system a product of deeper forces than the persona of any one president remains intact in the middle east trump accelerated an anti isis campaign that he inherited announced a withdrawal from syria that he didn t fully follow through on and kept troops in afghanistan steady as she goes pulling out of the iran nuclear accord is a big deal and given that it s not entirely clear how the administration imagines resolving the crisis genuinely a shot in the dark although trump says he wants to talk another gamble is the trade war with china a truly significant departure from the old bipartisan consensus yet even here trump presumably has the off ramp of a fig leaf deal should he decide that he wants to take it at home in terms of the economy everything except for the tariffs has been geared to preserving and boosting the recovery from the tax cuts to the deregulation to the lack of interest in cutting spending to trump s jawboning of the federal reserve to keep rates low the action on immigration is heavily focused on the border with the goal of diminishing a growing crisis rather than fashioning a transformation trump has kept the senate occupied with a steady diet of judicial nominations approved by the conservative legal establishment any political fence sitter inclined to consider this a solid record of accomplishment has the competing information to consider of trump s constant tweeting and lurid yet meaningless controversies given the choice you d prefer that people believed that your administration was cautious and incremental while it undertook far reaching changes rather than believe it s on the verge of careening out of control while pursuing a fairly reasonable path the careening out of control has seemed a real possibility at times of course and his shambolic confrontational governing style could yet catch up to him for now he can plausibly make a reelection pitch that despite what you might have gathered he s been a steward of a country enjoying markedly good times rich lowry courtesy photo rich lowry is the editor of national review comments lowry nationalreview com leonard pitts is on vacation his column will return in july
