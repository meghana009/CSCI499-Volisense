london harvard university professor alberto alesina has returned to the debate on budget deficits austerity and growth back in 2010 alesina told european finance ministers that many even sharp reductions of budget deficits have been accompanied and immediately followed by sustained growth rather than recessions even in the very short run now with fellow economists carlo favero and francesco giavazzi alesina has written a new book entitled austerity when it works and when it doesn t which recently received a favourable review from his harvard colleague kenneth rogoff new book old tune the authors conclusion in a nutshell is that in certain cases the direct output cost of spending cuts is more than compensated for by increases in other components of aggregate demand the implication is that austerity cutting the budget deficit not expanding it may well be the right policy in a recession alesina s previous work in this area with silvia ardagna was criticised by the international monetary fund and other economists for its faulty econometrics and exaggerated conclusions and this new book which analyzes 200 multi year austerity plans carried out in 16 organisation for economic cooperation and development countries between 1976 and 2014 will also no doubt keep the number crunchers busy but that is not the main point correlation is not causation the association of fiscal retrenchment and economic growth tells us nothing about the underlying relationship between the two does shrinking the deficit cause economic growth or does growth cause the deficit to shrink all the econometrics in the world cannot prove that one caused the other or that both may not be the result of something else there are simply too many omitted variables that is other possible causes of either or both outcomes so called statistical proofs always start with a theory of causation to which the data are fitted to get the result the theorist wants alesina s theory rests on two conceptual pillars the main one is that if deficits persist businesses and consumers will expect higher taxes and will therefore invest and consume less spending cuts on the other hand signal lower taxes in the future and thus stimulate investment and consumption the second supplementary pillar is the assumption that rising public debt leads investors to expect a default this expectation forces up interest rates on government bonds leading to higher overall borrowing costs austerity by stopping the growth of debt can bring about a sizeable reduction in interest rates and thus enable increased investment this supplementary case cannot be regarded as a general rule if a country has its own central bank and issues its own currency the government can cause interest rates to be whatever it wants them to be by ordering the central bank to print money in this case low interest rates will be the result not of austerity but rather of monetary expansion and this of course is what has happened with quantitative easing in the united states the united kingdom and the eurozone interest rates have stayed at rock bottom for years as central banks have pumped hundreds of billions of dollars pounds and euros into their economies so we are left with alesina s main pillar a credible commitment to public spending cuts today will boost output by removing the expectation of higher taxes tomorrow the same argument explains why on alesina s view it is better to reduce the deficit by cutting spending than by raising taxes spending cuts address the problem of the automatic growth of entitlements and other spending programmes whereas tax increases do not alesina writes modern macroeconomics emphasises that people s decisions about what to do today are influenced by their expectations of what will happen in the future john maynard keynes too understood the crucial importance of expectations he is credited by john hicks with introducing the method of expectations into economics however keynes s expectational map was very different from alesina s his investors do not form their expectations by looking at the government s deficit and calculating what effect it will have on their future tax bills in fact they scarcely notice the deficit at all what they do notice is the size of their markets for keynes entrepreneurs decisions to create jobs depend on their expected income from increasing employment an economic downturn reduces their expected sales proceeds causing them to lay off workers a cut in government spending implies that they can expect still fewer sales causing them to lay off even more workers thus deepening the recession conversely a rise in government spending or tax cuts increases expectations of sales and so reverses the downturn for example if the demand for automobiles falls fewer will be sold and fewer workers will be employed in making them if the government increases its spending on public works this will not only employ more workers directly but also increase the demand for automobiles so the output of the economy grows by more than the government s extra spending thus reducing the deficit in very simple terms therefore we have two opposite theories of the appropriate fiscal policy in a slump keynes says an announced reduction in public spending signals to businesspeople that their incomes will be reduced because fewer people will be buying the goods and services they produce but alesina says that an announced reduction in public spending signals to businesspeople that they can expect lower taxes tomorrow and therefore will spend more today readers must decide which theory they find more plausible personally i much prefer the characterisation contained in the recent book austerity 12 myths exposed austerity is a tool of financial interests not a solution to the problems caused by them robert skidelsky a member of the british house of lords is professor emeritus of political economy at warwick university copyright

desperate times call for desperate measures policymakers in the developed world have been left gasping amidst the ruins of slow economic growth high youth unemployment and rising income inequality such conditions are usually the perfect breeding ground for heterodox economic ideas the contemporary avatar of such an idea is the sensational modern monetary theory mmt in the frenzy of hope that this theory will provide the panacea for all ills the conspicuous fact has been overlooked that mmt is not modern but a resurrection of an old failed idea the origin of mmt mmt proposes that a state which issues its own currency cannot go bankrupt or default as it can always print currency to settle all obligations thus rather than worrying about arbitrary fiscal deficit targets or spiralling public debt the state should spend to ensure full employment in an economy mmt says that there is only one constraint to the state s expenditure inflation and not taxes or public debt also read china threat theory may harm indian economy says global times mmt is a synthesis of ideas which can be traced back to at least a century ago the theory assimilates ideas from the work of primarily georg friedrich knapp john maynard keynes abba lerner and hyman minsky since the 1990s a group of post keynesian economists have further developed and propagated the idea in academic circles and the blogosphere the primary economists in this group are warren mosler l randall wray stephanie kelton and bill mitchell a good place to start unravelling mmt is knapp s 1905 publication the state theory of money mmt s conception of money parallels knapp s hypothesis that money is a creature of law rather than a commodity which independently sprang up in a market as per knapp money is what the state decrees as money more specifically only that commodity or token can serve as money which the state accepts in settlement of taxes this approach to money is called the chartalist approach the chartalist notion of money is different from the metalist approach which links the value of money to a precious metal or to it being scarce the metalist view says that money originated independently as that commodity which served as a common medium of exchange like precious metals irrespective of any state decree under knapp s state theory of money it is not required that money should be converted into a precious commodity this is because as a creature of law the decree of the state is sufficient to ensure that any token which the state declares as money will act as the predominant medium of exchange it is important to understand the link between knapp s chartalist approach to money and mmt as the state is central to the creation of a monetary system the state is also responsible for taking full cognizance of its discretionary powers over money supply to ensure full employment if this entails printing currency for state expenditure to ensure full employment so be it this ties closely with abba lerner s doctrine of functional finance the forerunner to the contemporary mmt thought which we examine next abba lerner a russian born british economist in his popular 1943 paper titled finance and the federal debt suggested that since the state does not have any constraints on currency issuance fiscal policy should be evaluated only by what effects it has on the economy and not by pre conceived notions of sound finance thus the only criteria for evaluating fiscal policy is the function that it plays in promoting employment and income lerner s functional approach to finance flowing from the state theory of money was premised on the fact that a government which issues debt in its own currency can never go bankrupt and has full discretion on printing currency lerner wrote that functional finance rejects completely the traditional doctrines of sound finance and the principle of trying to balance the budget over a solar year or any other arbitrary period lerner sought to take the idea of fiscal deficit further from where keynes left it keynes opened the window for the government to actively use fiscal policy for the management of aggregate demand during the great depression of the 1930s the prolonged economic slowdown provided keynes with the impetus to challenge the classical economics bedrock of balanced budgets and he actively advocated for the use of fiscal policy to manage aggregate demand lerner felt that the right lessons were not learnt from keynes breakthrough even after the popularity of keynes ideas the argument remained that the government merely had to get things going and then the economy could go on by itself thus deficits were only to be run during recessions or depressions and in normal times the government should balance its budget or run fiscal surpluses lerner countered this in his famous steering wheel hypothesis which stated that the control of the steering wheel for the economy should permanently rest with the state also read us adds india to its monitoring list for currency practices in his functional finance paper published in 1943 lerner emphasized that there is no reason for supposing that the spending and taxation policy which maintains full employment and prevents inflation must necessarily balance the budget lerner stated that no matter what unimagined heights the national debt might reach no danger to the society is presented as long as the government maintains total demand equal to that of current output also as long as the public is willing to lend to the state there is no threat of a burgeoning national debt irrespective of how many zeros are added to the national debt when the public becomes reluctant to lend the state can always print money another key figure on whose shoulders mmt stands is hyman minsky an american economist echoing lerner s functional finance approach minsky wrote that in developed western economies the national debt is unique among all income earning assets for there is no default risk attached to this asset minsky s financial instability hypothesis which predicts the crisis prone nature of capitalism also fits neatly in the mmt framework and justifies the government having a seat at the steering wheel of an economy it is important to note how similar the contemporary mmt thought is to the doctrine of functional finance in fact most commentators hark back to lerner s work while discussing mmt paul krugman the nobel prize winning economist writes that mmt seems to be pretty much the same thing as abba lerner s functional finance doctrine from 1943 kelton says that mmters like herself have rediscovered old ideas and assembled them into a complete macroeconomic frame the heydays of functional finance it is easy to see why the idea of functional finance was popular in the first half of the twentieth century the great depression of the 1930s was the perfect stage for the keynesian revolution and from keynes moving on to lerner was only a jump the 1940s witnessed the second world war and the only way that the government could meet war expenses without resorting to high taxation and borrowing was by printing money the popularity of functional finance in that era can be gauged from the fact that the chairman of the federal reserve bank of new york beardsley ruml said in 1946 that raising taxes for revenue are obsolete the abandonment of the gold standard by revoking domestic convertibility of dollar to gold in 1933 by roosevelt set the stage for the ascendancy of functional finance in 1971 nixon scrapped the convertibility of dollar for international payments as well sounding the final death knell of the gold standard the breaking of the link between the dollar and gold marked an important step in the evolution of functional finance and removed an important constraint on printing currency for financing government expenditure also read rbi needs to go for larger rate cut in next monetary policy review sbi report knapp s foresight that money does not need the backing of a precious metal proved prophetic the post war world had fully moved towards a paper based fiat currency system as described by l randall wray the development of a non convertible paper currency system came nearly three quarters of a century after knapp s book was first published 1905 he had recognized that the money of a state does not derive its value from metal and indeed that no metal is needed domestically once the state is free from convertibility of its issued currency to a precious metal its spending is not constrained by either the stock of precious metals or taxes thus as dictated by mmt why should the fiscal policy be bound by notions of sound finance or a balanced budget when the state can never run out of money or default the turning of the tide during the 1950s and up to the mid 1960s functional finance was humming on smoothly post war reconstruction required an expansive fiscal policy which the federal reserve was willing to accommodate the relationship between the federal reserve and the governments of eisenhower and kennedy was amicable as inflation was calm the federal reserve was willing to keep a loose monetary policy even though the government was pump priming the economy things changed in 1964 with the government of lyndon johnson the johnson administration believed that allowing a modest amount of inflation to reach low unemployment was not risky as long as the economy had not reached full employment it would have enough slack to keep wage pressures in check and if inflation did emerge they believed fiscal policy rather than the fed was the most effective tool to manage it this prescription has lerner s functional finance written all over it the views of the federal reserve had however changed due to its anticipation of rising inflationary pressures in the economy in 1965 the federal reserve increased interest rates under the chairmanship of william mcchesney martin jr much to the chagrin of johnson from this point onwards things went on a downhill the co ordination between the monetary and fiscal policy broke down in 1969 inflation in the us hit an eighteen year high of 5 75 per cent martin s term was set to end in january 1970 and he did not expect it to be renewed given the election of richard nixon nixon was uncomfortable with martin s hawkish streak on inflation and appointed arthur burns as his replacement before assuming the chairmanship of the federal reserve burns served as nixon s white house adviser the appointment was perceived as a political move to provide nixon s administration with a less hostile monetary policy the consequence of a more malleable federal reserve became evident the entire 1970s witnessed a stubbornly high inflation refusing to lie low earning the moniker of the great inflation it was only after the appointment of paul volcker in 1979 and his ruthless monetary tightening that tamed inflation and brought an end to america s worst inflation episode since the civil war the stagflation of the 1970s sounded the death knell of functional finance the world was once again reminded of the pernicious effect of inflation something which had eclipsed from the memory of the public in the post war era the mood during the 1980s took a complete u turn the governments of margaret thatcher in the uk and ronald reagan in the us rolled back government and ceded a larger space for the private sector to operate the stagflation era saw milton friedman s doctrine of monetarism overshadowing functional finance monetarism s emphasis on removing the state s discretion over money supply was directly in opposition to functional finance s doctrine of the state enjoying a seat at the steering wheel of the economy freidman wrote that inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon in the sense that it is and can be produced only by a more rapid increase in the quantity of money than in output a steady rate of monetary growth at a moderate level can provide a framework under which a country can have little inflation and much growth both lerner and minsky revised their views on functional finance so severe and persistent was the great inflation that even the father of functional finance lerner had second thoughts on the practicality of his theories during the 1970s lerner adopted views in favour of monetarism not because he feared that the state would default on its debt but because of concerns on inflation the stagflation episode convinced lerner that his earlier steering wheel argument ignored institutional aspects of the economy and focused too much on the macro even before the stagflation episode minsky was of the view that lerner s steering wheel hypothesis was too mechanistic minsky rightly felt that rather than target aggregate demand in general fiscal policy had to be directed towards certain segments of the economy based on institutional realities some of minsky s post 1990 writings have arguably deviated from the core principles of functional finance minsky emphasized that rather than total government spending it mattered what the government spent on he also spoke about how the quality of the fiscal deficit post the reagan era had deteriorated and the need for the government to validate its debt through taxation minsky s financial instability hypothesis also highlighted the risks of an aggressive fiscal policy he wrote the 1960 s witnessed the apparent victory of keynesian policy however the successful application of keynesian policy may result in an economy that is inherently unstable this instability is not the result of a tendency to stagnate or enter into a deep depression state rather it is due to a tendency to explode thus mechanistic pump priming of the economy could lead to instability and an eventual crash popularly referred to as the minsky moment in the financial markets with severe spill over repercussions to the real economy what explains the current popularity of mmt we can trace two events which have played a large part in the resurrection of the old functional finance ideas in its new avatar of mmt first is the disappearance of the inflation problem in the developed world in japan the persistent economic problem post the real estate crash of 1989 has been fighting deflation even after several rounds of fiscal stimulus leading to one of the highest public debt to gdp ratio in the world and extraordinarily loose monetary policy japan has struggled to fight deflation similar has been the story in the euro region and the united states post the global financial crisis of 2007 both the european central bank and the federal reserve have engaged in large scale monetary easing which has substantially increased the size of their balance sheets yet the dreaded monster of inflation did not rear its head the last few decades of benign inflation have put the memory of the great inflation squarely behind us the low inflation in the developed world has lulled us into believing that being a hawk on inflation is also akin to being a dinosaur in this environment a policy which advocates taking the limits out of fiscal expansion not only sounds appealing but logical ideas are creatures of their times and the current economic predicaments demand heterodoxy the world is yearning for a new paradigm as nearly every arrow in the policymaker s arsenal has been deployed a new paradigm which challenges existing doctrines and more importantly which says that there is still hope mmt has provided hope that the intractable economic problems can indeed be solved if only we look at things in a new light blinded by this hope the fact that mmt is not new and has been tried in the past has remained hidden a true evaluation of mmt should ground its theories in history to contextualize its prescriptions else in the not so far away future we may be forced to unwillingly recollect those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it

chairmanship of william mcchesney martin jr much to the chagrin of johnson from this point onwards things went on a downhill the co ordination between the monetary and fiscal policy broke down in 1969 inflation in the us hit an eighteen year high of 5 75 per cent martin s term was set to end in january 1970 and he did not expect it to be renewed given the election of richard nixon nixon was uncomfortable with martin s hawkish streak on inflation and appointed arthur burns as his replacement before assuming the chairmanship of the federal reserve burns served as nixon s white house adviser the appointment was perceived as a political move to provide nixon s administration with a less hostile monetary policy the consequence of a more malleable federal reserve became evident the entire 1970s witnessed a stubbornly high inflation refusing to lie low earning the moniker of the great inflation it was only after the appointment of paul volcker in 1979 and his ruthless monetary tightening that tamed inflation and brought an end to america s worst inflation episode since the civil war the stagflation of the 1970s sounded the death knell of functional finance the world was once again reminded of the pernicious effect of inflation something which had eclipsed from the memory of the public in the post war era the mood during the 1980s took a complete u turn the governments of margaret thatcher in the uk and ronald reagan in the us rolled back government and ceded a larger space for the private sector to operate the stagflation era saw milton friedman s doctrine of monetarism overshadowing functional finance monetarism s emphasis on removing the state s discretion over money supply was directly in opposition to functional finance s doctrine of the state enjoying a seat at the steering wheel of the economy freidman wrote that inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon in the sense that it is and can be produced only by a more rapid increase in the quantity of money than in output a steady rate of monetary growth at a moderate level can provide a framework under which a country can have little inflation and much growth both lerner and minsky revised their views on functional finance so severe and persistent was the great inflation that even the father of functional finance lerner had second thoughts on the practicality of his theories during the 1970s lerner adopted views in favour of monetarism not because he feared that the state would default on its debt but because of concerns on inflation the stagflation episode convinced lerner that his earlier steering wheel argument ignored institutional aspects of the economy and focused too much on the macro even before the stagflation episode minsky was of the view that lerner s steering wheel hypothesis was too mechanistic minsky rightly felt that rather than target aggregate demand in general fiscal policy had to be directed towards certain segments of the economy based on institutional realities some of minsky s post 1990 writings have arguably deviated from the core principles of functional finance minsky emphasized that rather than total government spending it mattered what the government spent on he also spoke about how the quality of the fiscal deficit post the reagan era had deteriorated and the need for the government to validate its debt through taxation minsky s financial instability hypothesis also highlighted the risks of an aggressive fiscal policy he wrote the 1960 s witnessed the apparent victory of keynesian policy however the successful application of keynesian policy may result in an economy that is inherently unstable this instability is not the result of a tendency to stagnate or enter into a deep depression state rather it is due to a tendency to explode thus mechanistic pump priming of the economy could lead to instability and an eventual crash popularly referred to as the minsky moment in the financial markets with severe spill over repercussions to the real economy what explains the current popularity of mmt we can trace two events which have played a large part in the resurrection of the old functional finance ideas in its new avatar of mmt first is the disappearance of the inflation problem in the developed world in japan the persistent economic problem post the real estate crash of 1989 has been fighting deflation even after several rounds of fiscal stimulus leading to one of the highest public debt to gdp ratio in the world and extraordinarily loose monetary policy japan has struggled to fight deflation similar has been the story in the euro region and the united states post the global financial crisis of 2007 both the european central bank and the federal reserve have engaged in large scale monetary easing which has substantially increased the size of their balance sheets yet the dreaded monster of inflation did not rear its head the last few decades of benign inflation have put the memory of the great inflation squarely behind us the low inflation in the developed world has lulled us into believing that being a hawk on inflation is also akin to being a dinosaur in this environment a policy which advocates taking the limits out of fiscal expansion not only sounds appealing but logical ideas are creatures of their times and the current economic predicaments demand heterodoxy the world is yearning for a new paradigm as nearly every arrow in the policymaker s arsenal has been deployed a new paradigm which challenges existing doctrines and more importantly which says that there is still hope mmt has provided hope that the intractable economic problems can indeed be solved if only we look at things in a new light blinded by this hope the fact that mmt is not new and has been tried in the past has remained hidden a true evaluation of mmt should ground its theories in history to contextualize its prescriptions else in the not so far away future we may be forced to unwillingly recollect those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
published monday 27 may 2019 print disqus missing inflation debt rubicon velocity falling the complex debt and currency dance too high and getting wider they shall not grow old modern technology was supposed to make travel less necessary we can meet by phone video and now in virtual reality but we re still traveling more than ever i certainly am the reason is simple technology can t yet replace face to face conversation and especially group conversations it is genetically hardwired in our species we spend more time on the phone and skype than ever but technology also makes information more complex and nuanced conveying it often requires a personal presence so we fly around and talk in person i thought of that last week at the strategic investment conference i ve been writing about japanification of the developed world economy explaining what i mean by that as best i can in these letters but in talking to conference attendees i found that i have not effectively communicated some of the nuances to be clear i don t want japanification nor do i think it will deliver the desired results i believe that in the next recession policymakers will respond with massive fiscal and monetary stimulus and instead of producing growth it will depress growth and leave us all in the same morass japan has endured for almost three decades in other words i believe that both government and central banks will tryjapanification of course under other names but i don t expect it to work in the way they would hope when faced with the imminent possibility of recession depression or even a crash authorities will try to do something but they will have very few choices the default option of ever larger stimulus will kick in so like japan the us will see yet more quantitative easing and extraordinarily low interest rates along with annual federal deficits of 2 trillion and higher alternatives like restructuring the tax code and balancing the budget will be nowhere in sight at best this process will result in an even slower growing economy and avoid total meltdown that s the optimistic view given what i understand today about the political and economic realities as i see them i also believe that it is the most likely scenario the others are much darker however i also believe there is an off ramp that could short circuit the japanification effect leading to something closer to normal more on that below today i want to go deeper into the intellectual and academic rationale behind this outlook dr lacy hunt has long been an enormous influence on my understanding of economics in this letter i ll discuss his latest ideas i should note that any errors are mine and not his fault lacy briefly presented two theorems at the sic after his scholarly lecture that s really what it was i brought up my favorite central banker and former bis chief economist bill white the three of us had possibly the most stimulating discussion of the whole conference at least for me you can and should view it all on our virtual pass but i ll share some highlights below this is important and you need to understand it because it is the exact opposite of what many people think missing inflation let s start with some facts that may be inconvenient for some but are nonetheless facts back in the 1980s and 1990s many of us in the conservative and gold bug movements me included thought excessive government spending and the resulting debt would eventually bring inflation or even hyperinflation we wanted a hawkish federal reserve or better yet a gold standard to prevent it i have many friends close friends who still deeply believe in a gold standard but that s a discussion for another day reality turned out differently federal debt rose steadily inflation didn t here s a chart of the on budget public debt since 1970 using actual dollars instead of the more usual percentage of gdp and with a log scale to eliminate the hockey stick illusion source st louis fed here is the same data in terms of debt to gdp note the brief shining moment when the us was growing faster than the debt rose and actually ran surpluses in the late 1990s these were also times when gdp grew faster than the deficits and debt but the general trend is from the lower left to the upper right there was a significant jump during the great recession you can see the debt growth started to level out in the late 1990s but then took off again yet the only serious inflation in this whole period occurred in the first decade paul volcker stamped it out in the early 1980s i am not saying we had no inflation at all obviously we did and in many parts of the economy significantly more than the official average measures reflect some of it manifested in asset prices stocks real estate instead of consumer goods we like that and typically don t consider it inflation but it is but there was nothing remotely like the kind of major inflation that this level of government debt should theoretically have caused based on what we understood in the 1970s and 1980s remember ross perot and his charts it hasn t happened one argument is that technology reduced production costs enough to offset the higher debt burden that s probably part of it but i think a minor part the real answer is twofold first is the way high government debt interacts with interest rates over long periods and with a time lag but almost inexorably second but no less understood is the demand for certain currencies even as government debt and obligations rise a little reminder interest rates and inflation are really two sides of the same coin interest is the cost of money liquidity that cost is heavily influenced by the risk of money being devalued i e inflation expectations if lenders expect higher inflation then they expect to be repaid in cheaper dollars and thus demand more of them via higher interest rates so inflation drives rates higher while lack of inflation keeps them low as we ve seen since 2008 this brings us to lacy hunt s sic session in which he presented two important theorems they are related but i will discuss them separately debt rubicon i ll start by just quoting lacy then explain what i believe he means federal debt accelerations ultimately lead to lower not higher interest rates debt funded traditional fiscal stimulus is extremely fleeting when debt levels are already inordinately high thus additional and large deficits provide only transitory gains in economic activity which are quickly followed by weaker business conditions with slower economic growth and inflation long term rates inevitably fall that first sentence should come with a little boom cannon icon it will shock many people who think rising federal debt raises interest rates through a crowding out effect that means the government because it is the most creditworthy borrower sucks up capital and leaves less available to private borrowers who must then pay more for it via higher interest rates or a weakened currency that is the case for most countries in the world yet clearly it has not been the case for some countries in recent decades specifically larger developed economies that s not to say it never will be but actual experience supports lacy s point and not just in the us here are four charts he showed at sic in the us japan the eurozone and the uk sovereign rates fell as government debt rose that is not how keynesian or most other macroeconomic theories say debt funded fiscal stimulus should work additional cash flowing through the economy is supposed to have a multiplier effect spurring growth and eventually raising inflation and interest rates this has not happened the reason it hasn t happened is that we have crossed a kind of debt rubicon in recent history past performance really is not an indicator of future results today in much of the developed world the existing debt load is so heavy that additional dollars have a smaller effect the new debt s negative effects outweigh any benefit the higher taxes that politicians often think will reduce the deficit serve mainly to depress business activity we see the result in slower economic growth plus lower interest rates and inflation note we are talking here about fiscal policy i e government spending on jobs programs infrastructure etc when financed by issuing new debt central banks aren t directly involved until they start financing the government debt via qe or some version of mmt which lacy and the rest of the speakers at the sic will hasten to point out are not equivalent velocity falling lacy s second theorem supports the first monetary decelerations eventually lead to lower not higher interest rates as originally theorized by economist milton friedman as debt productivity falls the velocity of money declines making monetary policy increasingly asymmetric one sided and ineffectual as a policy instrument irving fisher s equation of exchange m2 v gdp says gdp is equal to the money supply times its turnover or velocity the federal reserve heavily influences the former but not the latter that it turns out is a serious problem the fed s phillips curve fixation gives it the illusion that every macroeconomic problem is a nail and monetary policy is the ideal tool hammer to fix it of course that s not true looser financial conditions don t help when the economy has no productive uses for the new liquidity with most industries already having ample capacity the money had nowhere to go but back into the banks hence velocity fell 33 in the two decades that ended in 2018 now if velocity is falling then any kind of fed stimulus faces a tough headwind it can inject liquidity but can t make people spend it nor can it force banks to lend and in a fractional reserve system money creation doesn t go far unless the banks cooperate later in the conference bill white observed that this is why monetary policy is increasingly ineffective the banks respond to each crisis the same way and every time they find that it takes more aggressive action to produce the same effect obviously that can t go on forever bill called it a fundamental intemporal inconsistency the result is that public and private debt keeps rising but also becomes less productive lacy showed how in a world of falling monetary velocity the amount of gdp growth produced by each additional dollar of debt fell 24 in the last 20 years that s why we have so much more debt now and yet slower growth this also explains why this year s first quarter notwithstanding growth has been so sluggish since 2014 that was when money supply peaked so for five years now we ve had both a shrinking money supply and slowing velocity that s not a recipe for inflation and the more recent jump in federal deficit spending is making matters worse not better in our q a lacy and bill discussed how linear economic models are just not working and nonlinear analysis is so critical a lot of practical people are turned off by this thinking it shouldn t be so complex but these same people would never tell a physicist to avoid nonlinear concepts the economy is complex and getting more so as the world adds new seemingly critical variables i should also note that lacy only had 30 minutes for his presentation and had to make a complex argument in an abbreviated time there are scores more corollary points we could explore the complex debt and currency dance astute readers will quickly point out that rising debt in places like venezuela has brought extraordinary inflation and currency devaluation historically that s what rapidly rising government debt does i simply point you to rogoff and reinhart s this time is different where they examine every debt and currency crisis for the last few centuries the circumstances may have been different but the result was the same yet today things do indeed seem different japan the us the uk and other countries seem able to expand their government debts beyond historically acceptable levels and get away with it interest rates have stayed low often getting lower and going negative while currency valuations have remained relatively stable the operative word here is relatively what is different is the international demand for currencies and debt denominated in those currencies a globalized economy yielded a surplus of savings that seeks a home in what is perceived as safe assets nobody thinks venezuela is safe that is why in a global crisis money flies to the us and other reserve currencies these safe haven currencies have the exorbitant privilege of running large fiscal deficits thought experiment if italy were to remove itself from the euro and reissue the lira does anybody really think that italy would keep today s low rates ditto for greece and other countries left on their own these currencies would devalue relative to stronger ones like germany and their interest rates would rise this is not necessarily a bad thing the safety valves of currency devaluation and bond market vigilantes saved italy numerous times before it joined the euro what most people don t realize is that italy grew faster than germany in real terms for the 20 30 years prior to joining the euro despite its inflation and devaluations how long can this go on the japanese experience suggests much longer than we would think forever no there is a point where the zeitgeist the perceived global narrative about a country and currency changes and currencies and interest rates become unhinged it can happen seemingly overnight again how long can this go on we simply don t want to know the answer to that question we will only know after the fact and it will be a horrible painful fact to experience better to find a viable exit ramp too high and getting wider i ll wrap up with a direct quote from lacy hunt which you will probably want to read several times his academic prose takes a little time to sink in but when it does you should be concerned if not terrified the parallels to the past are remarkable but there appears to be one fatal similarity the fed appears to have a high sensitivity to coincident or contemporaneous indicators of economic activity however the economic variables i e money and interest rates over which they have influence are slow moving and have enormous lags in the most recent episode in the last half of 2018 the federal reserve raised rates two times by a total of 50 basis points in reaction to the strong mid year gdp numbers these actions were done despite the fact that the results of their previous rate hikes and monetary deceleration were beginning to show their impact of actually slowing economic growth the m2 money growth rate was half of what it was two years earlier signs of diminished liquidity were appearing and there had been a multi quarter deterioration in the interest rate sensitive sectors of autos housing and capital spending presently the treasury market by establishing its rate inversion is suggesting that the fed s present interest rate policy is nearly 50 basis points too high and getting wider by the day a quick reversal could reverse the slide in economic growth but the lags are long it appears that history is being repeated too tight for too long slower growth lower rates the fed waited too long to raise rates and then overshot the mark when it finally got around to it i was calling for rate hikes in 2012 and 2013 the fed could have hiked 50 to 75 basis points per year normalizing interest rates and letting the economy adjust slowly rather than all at once late in the cycle having realized it fomc members then paused but too late and possibly for the wrong reasons now they re trapped lacy thinks an immediate 50 bp cut might help but he s not optimistic they will do it or that it will work if they do if that s right then we are in for slower growth and probably recession sooner rather than later in a debt laden highly leveraged economy it probably won t be a mild one either i mentioned earlier that i believe there is an off ramp exit for the us economy in the coming weeks i m going to respond to ray dalio s recent two part letter and then his third longer piece seemingly endorsing modern monetary theory mmt it will probably be a multipart series and will allow all of us to have a much larger thought experiment a potentially educational experience than we have been having in the spirit of dalio s own radical transparency philosophy maybe it is time to start thinking the unthinkable before we move on at least in this letter from the strategic investment conference let me gently suggest that you take advantage of our virtual pass you can see most of the 33 speakers on video listen to them on audio and read the transcripts of the sessions i m getting many responses raving about the conference from people who weren t even there they watched on the virtual pass which is the next best thing and maybe think about joining us next year at the phoenician in scottsdale arizona on may 11 14 as my friend kent k wrote one of the best things about attending sic is not only the information learned from these rock star speakers you get to actually have a drink with them and sometimes dinner and pick their brain from a financial context it would be like seeing the rolling stones or paul mccartney perform and then having a casual conversation with them afterwards i have never attended any other conference that provides this kind of experience they shall not grow old on the five hour flight from dallas to puerto rico this past weekend i decided to watch a movie scrolling through the seemingly endless choices i came across the documentary by peter jackson of lord of the rings fame called they shall not grow old jackson and his team went through world war i film archives to assemble an extraordinarily moving view of the reality total brutality and utter inhumanity of war the entire documentary consists of actual film from the era starting out black and white and eventually becoming colorized it is a well done homage to these soldiers bravery and patriotism over 10 million died during that single war and the civilian death toll was almost as large in the us it is memorial day weekend where we annually pay tribute to those who lost their lives to keep countries free and democratic spending less than two hours watching they shall not grow old would be a good way to honor their sacrifice it is a window into times and events simply not imaginable to most of us and while you re watching remember that european bond markets were very calm almost up to the last moment no one really thought war was coming but then the unthinkable happened it s time to hit the send button and to those of you who served

could china dump its us treasuries to fight the trade war a contrarian view is emerging in beijing as american pundits and polls dismiss the idea that china would dump its massive holdings of us treasury debt as retaliation against us tariffs a contrarian view is emerging in beijing that the government may use the securities as a weapon of last resort china s us 1 12 trillion holdings account for just 5 per cent of total us national debt which may mean any material damage on the us economy stemming from a bond sales would be limited in addition even if it did cause market volatility china s remaining holdings would also be hurt which the chinese may view as a move that is too risky us sceptics have said while we think china will continue to sell treasuries as it has for most of the last year we do not think that the pace at which they sell will increase as a direct response measure for tariffs rather we believe that the pace at which they sell treasuries will continue to track the pace at which they see capital inflows said matthew hornbach an analyst at morgan stanley however with beijing vowing to fight to the end and the us preparing to place a 25 per cent tariff on a further us 300 billion of chinese imports china may have no choice but to sell its us treasury holdings according to some analysts and reports widely distributed on china s social media this would devalue us bonds causing yields to rise potentially sharply if china converted the dollar proceeds from its sale back into yuan it would strengthen the chinese currency against the us dollar potentially significantly however one line of thinking is that because the trade war could remove the us as a viable market for chinese exports a strengthening yuan against the dollar which would make chinese goods more expensive for american buyers may be seen as an acceptable outcome by chinese policymakers this will only happen when china has no other option it is a weapon of last resort said david chin the founder of basis point consulting if china is not exporting to the us any more then they do not need to have a weak yuan and strong dollar to encourage americans to buy however china would have to sell strategically to maximise profits while triggering enough panic in the global financial markets chin said china is making a profit on its us 1 1 trillion treasury holdings it bought them at an average of 3 3 per cent yield over the past decade compared to the current yield of 2 4 per cent on 10 year treasury bonds that leaves room for it to sell us 700 billion of its us 1 1 trillion holding before pushing yields to its break even point of 3 3 per cent the us 700 billion figure is based on russia s sale of around us 81 billion of us treasuries between march and may last year which pushed yields from the 2 80 per cent to 2 90 per cent chinese media has already laid out a plan for how beijing could offload its treasury holdings initially china may want to avoid market attention by quietly and occasionally offloading us treasuries local media reported once the market became accustomed to such trades china could rapidly ramp up sales to create panic and a quick correction in the market the reports said because of the massive size of the us treasuries market buyers and sellers have the power to cause investment changes to snowball so as to influence market sentiment and trigger investor fear that could spill into the broader capital markets traders said massive amounts of continuous selling of us debt will raise suspicion among professional traders that there is a major seller in the market which could be china said jasper lo chief investment strategies at eddid securities and futures that could quickly spillover worries of the value of us dollar treasuries and assets and cause global financial market turmoil the dollar s weighting among global central banks reserves has gradually declined the latest data from the international monetary fund imf showed that in the global central banks foreign exchange reserves at the end of last year the dollar ratio had dropped from 72 per cent in 2000 to 61 7 per cent by the last quarter of 2018 the third consecutive quarterly decline and the lowest level since 2013 non us central banks are increasingly reluctant to hold us bonds in large amounts because of the relatively low returns the low yields are a result of risk aversion among investors sparked by mounting concerns over a global recession and the federal reserve s dovish monetary policy overall march was a bad month for us assets with overseas investors selling a net us 12 5 billion in us treasury bonds and us 24 billion in us stocks the biggest seller of us treasury bonds was canada which sold us 12 5 billion worth of securities the biggest drop in its holdings since july 2011 similarly china s us treasury holdings in march decreased by us 10 4 billion to us 1 1205 trillion its lowest since may 2017 according to data from the us treasury the decline contrasted sharply with the increase in its foreign exchange reserves to us 3 1 trillion in the same month the highest since august last year china remained however the largest us foreign creditor ahead of japan which added us 5 7 billion in march bringing its holdings to us 1 0781 trillion a five month high like many other countries the composition of china s reserves remain a closely held secret but it is thought that about two thirds of its us 3 1 trillion in foreign exchange reserves are held in dollar denominated assets much of that in us treasuries by increasing the share of gold and special drawing rights the imf s composite currency in its foreign exchange reserves chinese media said beijing was shoring up support to ensure the stability of the yuan if china does resort to dumping us treasuries it could incite unknown us counter measures which could heighten market volatility china s play could also draw the wrath of other large bond holders such as japan and the european union it s a very convoluted situation because there are parties involved like the eu with their holdings so this is a big geopolitical move that is a significant situation but only when there is no hope for reconciliation chin said for now the notion of escalating the trade war with monetary weapons is seen as just talk particularly on the us side from wall street pundits to regulators they could certainly sell them if they want to but since global markets are global markets i m not sure there d be much of an effect st louis federal reserve bank president james bullard a member of the us central bank s policymaking federal open market committee said at a conference in hong kong on wednesday he noted that the slide in china s foreign reserves which could been partially due to sales of us treasuries by nearly us 1 trillion between mid 2014 and early 2017 had been a non event in global markets i don t think it as much of a threat as it s made out to be he said with additional reporting from jodi xu klein and daniel bases source south china morning post

its consolidated financial statements for the twelve months ended 31 december 2018 full year results 2018 were rescheduled to 24 may 2019 due to the need to complete the comprehensive capital structure review of the group as was announced by the company on 15 april 2019 nyrstar initiated a review of its capital structure the capital structure review in october 2018 in response to the challenging financial and operating conditions being faced by the group as previously announced these conditions included substantial working capital and liquidity outflows experienced during the fourth quarter of 2018 and first quarter of 2019 necessitating the raising of urgent short term funding combined with the group s materially reduced underlying ebitda performance in 2018 and the maturity of certain liabilities during 2019 these factors resulted in the need to reconsider the group s capital structure the capital structure review identified a very substantial additional funding requirement that the group is unable to meet without a material reduction of the group s indebtedness as a consequence the capital structure review has necessitated negotiations between the group s financial creditors in order to develop a deleveraging and funding plan as part of a comprehensive balance sheet recapitalisation alternatives to such a recapitalisation would place the future of the group and its stakeholders at severe risk as at the date of this announcement the company is in the process of implementing the recapitalision the company has received from its auditor and is publishing today an opinion issued in accordance with article 143 2 of the belgian company code non compliance opinion on the basis that certain information requested from the company was not timely delivered the company is working hard to deliver such information to its auditor with the intention that the auditor will issue its audit opinion once it has audited such information the full year results that are published today will then again be published to the market together with the audit opinion that the auditor will then issue group financial overview group gross profit for 2018 of eur 1 118 million was up 4 on 2017 driven by higher zinc production volumes in mining and metals processing and marginally higher zinc and gold prices which were both up 1 partially offset by deteriorating benchmark zinc treatment charge terms and a weaker us dollar against the euro direct operating costs for 2018 of eur 1 014 million increased 16 on 2017 due to higher zinc production volumes in mining and metals processing higher electricity prices at the smelters increased mining costs as a result of the restart of operations at myra falls and the ramp up of mining operations at middle tennessee group underlying ebitda of eur 99 million in 2018 a decrease of 52 on 2017 due to a weakening of the us dollar against the euro lower lead and silver prices a 15 reduction in the benchmark zinc treatment charge higher direct operating costs per tonne of zinc in both mining and metals processing underlying adjustments in 2018 were a total of eur 49 million comprising eur 2 million of embedded derivatives eur 22 million of restructuring expense eur 1 million of m a related transaction expense and eur 30 million of other expenditure relating primarily to the write off of payments that were connected with the divestment of the el toqui mine in chile depreciation depletion and amortisation expense for 2018 of eur 162 million was up 4 year on year in 2018 the company recognised a non cash pre tax impairment loss of eur 99 million 2017 impairment gain of eur 126 million this impairment loss 2017 impairment gain relates fully to pre tax impairment losses on nyrstar s mining assets eur 85 9 million at langlois and myra falls and specific asset write offs in metals processing eur 11 4 million net finance expense including foreign exchange for 2018 of eur 151 million eur 207 million in 2017 primarily due to a net foreign exchange gain of eur 6 5 million in 2018 compared to a loss of eur 59 9 million in 2017 the interest expense in 2018 of eur 128 3 million was higher than in 2017 eur 104 4 million nyrstar recognised an income tax expense for the year ended 31 december 2018 of eur 250 million 2017 income tax benefit of eur 37 million representing an effective income tax rate of 68 9 for the year ended 31 december 2017 481 3 the tax rate is impacted by non recognition of current year losses and by the de recognition of previous losses relating mainly to nyrstar sales marketing ag the us group and the canadian group given it is not probable that these tax losses will be used in the future considering forecast profit projections loss after tax of eur 618 million in 2018 compared to a net profit of eur 47 million in 2017 mainly as a result of the impairment charges related to the write down of the carrying value of the langlois and myra falls mines the partial de recognition of nyrstar sales marketing ag and nyrstar us deferred tax assets due to reduced expected recoverability and the operational losses incurred in 2018 and change of control impacts capital expenditure was eur 229 million in 2018 representing a decrease of 37 year on year driven by a substantial reduction in metals processing from eur 303 million in 2017 to eur 126 million in 2018 with the completion of the port pirie redevelopment and a eur 45 million increase in mining with the restart of the myra falls mine net debt at the end of 2018 at eur 1 643 million excluding the zinc metal prepay was 49 higher compared to the end of 2017 eur 1 102 million at the end of 2017 predominantly due to substantial working capital outflow during q4 2018 due to higher commodity prices no new silver prepays in h2 2018 reduction in non committed letter of credit lines from banking counterparties tightened credit terms with a number of suppliers the reclassification of eur 82 5 million and eur 50 7 million of prepayments for deliveries of silver metal and zinc metal respectively from deferred income to loans and borrowing at 31 december 2018 as the group had no ability to settle by physical delivery of silver metal and zinc metal respectively from its own production and the reclassification of perpetual securities eur 174 9 million at 31 december 2018 from equity to loans and borrowings6 the net debt inclusive of the zinc metal prepay and perpetual securities at the end of 2018 was eur 1 771 million up 30 compared to the end of 2017 cash balance at the

operations and to proactively managing risks including with respect to people and the environment at nyrstar we work together to create a workplace where all risks are effectively identified and controlled and everyone goes home safe and healthy each day of their working life in 2018 we placed particular emphasis on the prevention of hand injuries which account for a large portion of our total injuries a dedicated hand injury prevention program entitled because some tools cannot be replaced was introduced at all operations with the purpose of eliminating unsafe conditions contributing to hand injuries improving tools and personal protective equipment and changing at risk behaviours relevant to hand injuries we also continued the implementation of the process safety management system launched in 2017 and strengthened controls related to hydrogen explosion risks at our smelters the group continued to make significant progress in safety performance no severe irreversible injuries occurred the frequency rate of cases with time lost or under restricted duties dart for the company achieved a new record low of 3 7 an improvement of 7 compared to a rate of 3 9 in 2017 the frequency rate of cases requiring at least a medical treatment rir was 6 7 this is a 4 increase compared to 6 4 in 2017 more important the number of days lost due to ltis and rw injuries reached a new

million in 2018 a decrease of 34 over 2017 due to lower treatment charges higher energy prices in europe and australia during h2 2018 and the suspension of operations at port pirie in december 2018 partially offset by higher production of zinc copper silver and minor metals marginally stronger year over year gross profit up 1 at eur 863 million in 2018 was mainly driven by higher zinc prices up 1 compared to 2017 which were constrained by the zinc price collar hedging in place at that time and higher production volumes of zinc metal and by products largely offset by a 19 decrease in zinc and lead treatment charge income annual 2018 zinc benchmark treatment charge terms were settled during q2 2018 at approximately 15 below the 2017 terms at usd 147 per tonne of concentrate the total premium gross profit contributions were relatively flat compared to 2017 down 2 driven by marginally higher volumes and relatively flat average realised premia rates by product gross profit

production year over year was despite the planned maintenance shuts at auby balen clarksville and hobart and was assisted by a lack of material unplanned outages which had impacted production volumes in 2016 and 2017 however zinc and lead metal production was impacted during q4 2018 by lower raw material inventory as a consequence of the company s liquidity constraints lead metal production at port pirie of 160kt was down 7 year over year due to a 38 day planned blast furnace maintenance outage in q2 2018 and a shut of the blast furnace for december 2018 during december 2018 the company chose not to operate the old sinter plant at port pirie in order to further support reducing lead in air emissions which ended the year below the defined limit in addition nyrstar also performed maintenance on the tsl furnace and blast furnace during december 2018 these maintenance shuts were to address a tsl furnace cooling issue and to bring forward maintenance previously scheduled for the

zinc in concentrate in 2018 was marginally below the revised full year guidance range of 140kt to 150kt this lower level of zinc in concentrate production has been largely due to disappointing production performance of the langlois and the middle tennessee mines and commercial production at the myra falls mine commencing slightly later than had been originally anticipated at the start of the year and the impact of the suspension of ore extraction at year end to address deficiencies identified in compliance orders from the ministry for energy mines petroleum resources in british columbia other developments port pirie redevelopment on 1 february 2019 nyrstar published an operational and financial update which included amongst other items a financial update with regards to the port pirie redevelopment the company provides the following additional clarification with regards to the latest port pirie redevelopment guidance the historic and normalised forecast pro forma underlying ebitda for port pirie hobart and australian metals processing is summarised in the table below pro forma underlying ebitda eurm 2016a 2017a 2018a 2019f 2020f port pirie 8 18 11 38 56 hobart 51 40 31 57 69 australian metals processing 59 58 20 95 125 the total pro forma underlying ebitda guidance of eur 95 million and eur 125 million for australian metals processing in fy 2019 and fy 2020 respectively is the aggregate of the total pro forma underlying ebitda contribution from both the port pirie and the hobart smelters under normalised liquidity and operating conditions this guidance is not incremental or uplift as was the case for the port pirie redevelopment guidance provided before 1 february 2019 and will be materially negatively impacted by the liquidity constraints that have been experienced by the group in q4 2018 and h1 2019 the normalised underlying ebitda guidance is the total pro forma ebitda contribution from the two australian smelters the main factors driving the negative pro forma underlying ebitda result for port pirie in 2018 were a combination of increased costs due to the continued ramp up of the tsl furnace with the parallel operation of the sinter plant and higher energy prices production outage in december 2018 and technical process bottlenecks which reduced the recovery of metal from the feed other macro factors such as lower lead treatment charges and metal prices also negatively impacted the pro forma underlying ebitda at port pirie the allocation of additional costs to residues between 2016 and 2018 has had an impact on the guided pro forma underlying ebitda contribution from the port pirie redevelopment in fy 2019 and to a lesser extent in fy 2020 as was disclosed in nyrstar s press release on 1 february 2019 the processing of historical inventory will provide a cash flow benefit of approximately eur 70 million in fy 2019 if there had not been costs allocated to these residues in 2016 to 2018 the underlying ebitda contribution from port pirie in fy 2019 would be approximately eur 70 million higher the other main reasons for the current lower but still material pro forma underlying ebitda contribution guidance from the port pirie redevelopment as compared to previous guidance are lower metal recovery assumptions as a result of technical process bottlenecks at port pirie which results in a reduction in free metal extracted from all feed processed by port pirie these bottlenecks primarily the slag fumer and copper plant at port pirie were identified in the preparation of the 5 year business plan for the capital structure review process and were incorporated in the pro forma underlying ebitda modelling for australian metals processing and the application of one year of actual operating data instead of the projected data which nyrstar previously needed to rely on as was indicated in the operational and financial update published on 1 february 2019 the metals processing segment profitability of both the australian sites are intrinsically linked by the raw material flows between the two sites and are only possible due to the port pirie redevelopment in the absence of the port pirie redevelopment the hobart and port pirie sites would both be non operational and would not contribute ebitda to the metals processing segment furthermore the pro forma underlying ebitda of the two sites individually but not of australian metal processing overall depends on the internal re charge arrangements between the two sites for internal residues that are used as feedstock at the sites for this reason to provide more clarity the company has decided to show the proforma underlying ebitda for australian metal processing with a breakdown of this figure to port pirie and hobart the total project cost for the port pirie redevelopment was approximately aud 714 million this is inclusive of the feasibility study costs and project management labour costs management changes in connection with the capital structure review process nyrstar announced on 18 january 2019 that mr martyn konig had taken up the role of executive chairman and that mr roman matej had been appointed to serve as interim chief financial officer mr michel abaza the former chief financial officer left the nyrstar group with immediate effect strategic foreign exchange hedges since 2016 nyrstar has entered into a series of 12 month rolling foreign exchange options to hedge the company s monthly exposure related to the direct operating costs denominated in australian dollars aud canadian dollars cad and in euro eur utilising put and call collar structures during the course of 2018 eur usd exposure was unhedged in h1 2018 and hedged on a fixed forward basis at 1 18 in h2 2018 for the aud usd transactional exposure various collars were executed resulting in a weighted average collar of 0 70 to 0 80 for approximately 100 of 2018 for the cad usd transactional exposure on langlois various collars were executed resulting in a weighted average collar of 1 32 to 1 36 for approximately 100 of 2018 transactional cad usd currency exposure for the mining segment was hedged with a fixed forward of 1 32 in 2019 in january and february 2019 nyrstar unwound all of its strategic forward foreign exchange hedges due to the loss of credit lines from the hedge counterparties strategic metal price hedges in h1 2018 nyrstar had in place zinc price collar hedges to protect 70 of total free metal produced at the zinc smelters and north american mines within a price range of usd 2 300 t and usd 3 094 t above and below these prices nyrstar s exposure was limited to 30 of the total free metal produced in h2 2018 nyrstar had in place zinc price collar hedges to protect 50 of total free metal produced at the zinc smelters and north american mines within a price range of usd 2 600 t and usd 3 842 t above and below these prices nyrstar s exposure was limited to 50 of the total free metal produced during 2018 nyrstar continued with its 12 month rolling hedging programme and had hedged the majority of its zinc free metal exposure 150kt for the mining segment at c usd 3 000 t zinc in concentrate production in 2020 was also partly hedged with approximately 16kt hedged at a zinc price of c usd 2 900 t in december 2018 nyrstar terminated all of its strategic metal hedges to provide additional liquidity to the business metal at risk hedging at any given time nyrstar holds metal either as work in progress or finished good inventory that has been priced in but not priced out as this metal remains exposed to fluctuations in the underlying metal price until it is priced out it is called metal at risk the actual metal at risk at any given point in time fluctuates with deliveries of raw materials and production levels as a risk mitigation process nyrstar has always consistently monitored its metal at risk on an ongoing basis and undertaken hedging to mitigate the metal price exposure in what nyrstar refers to as transactional hedging the price of placing these transactional hedges is dependent on whether future or forward prices are higher or lower than current or spot prices as indicated by the shape of the forward underlying metal price curve future prices can be either higher or lower than current prices depending on a range of factors and can change quite rapidly at times the hedges required to hedge nyrstar s metal at risk position are determined by whether the net position is positive meaning nyrstar has more metal priced in than is priced out or alternatively is negative meaning nyrstar has more metal priced out than is priced in as announced by nyrstar on 1 february 2019 it has been continuing to manage tightly its cash and inventory levels and has been evaluating additional measures to improve its liquidity position during the course of march 2019 nyrstar closed out all of its metal at risk hedge positions to release cash collateralized against the credit lines as a consequence of closing out these metal at risk hedges nyrstar realised a one off cash benefit of approximately usd 40 million and is now fully exposed to fluctuations in metal prices for its metal at risk cyber attack in january 2019 nyrstar was subject to a cyber attack certain it systems including email were impacted the cyber attack issue was subsequently contained and resolved the operational and financial impact of the cyber attack on nyrstar s metals processing and mining operations was not significant perpetual securities distribution amounton 29 april 2019 nyrstar port

president donald trump has from time to time lobbed tweets toward opec imploring it to open the spigots and boost supply to lower the price of oil the cartel has largely ignored the pleas but u s producers seem to have responded in one of the few positive developments for the economy and markets west texas intermediate crude futures tumbled as much as 3 11 in their biggest decline since february after the u s energy department said weekly american crude inventories swelled to the highest in almost two years the report rekindled talk of a glut beginning to form which helped send prices tumbling below 45 a barrel at the end of last year though at a low of about 61 on wednesday the glut would most likely have to get much bigger before oil prices fell back to those levels nevertheless any declines are a welcome development when concern is rising that america s economy might not be able to shrug off the e scalating trade war with china or the worldwide economic slowdown after all as recently as october oil had broken through the 75 a barrel level and strategists were talking about 100 being reached before too long that would be devastating for the u s and global economy especially with the organization for economic cooperation and development which had already made big cuts to its global economic projections in march doing so again on tuesday trimming its 2019 forecast to 3 2 from 3 3 where oil goes from here may depend on the production agreement between opec and russia while they have managed to push crude prices higher production cuts are weighing on russia s economy which expanded by just 0 5 in the first quarter below all 14 estimates in a bloomberg survey there is now speculation that the president vladimir putin of russia may not agree to extend the deal when it expires next month according to bloomberg news s olga tanas bonds may see some supply relief u s treasuries rallied on tuesday despite minutes of the federal reserve s april 30 may 1 monetary policy meeting showing that policy makers avoided any discussion of a possible interest rate cut maybe bond traders were just relieved that the meeting between trump and democratic leaders in congress to discuss infrastructure fell apart after all it s common knowledge that the only way to pay for what both sides have estimated would be a 2 trillion plan would entail more borrowing and while bond yields have fallen this year there are signs that a surge in borrowing may be causing demand at u s debt auctions to be trending lower lower demand would generally mean that the u s isn t able to borrow at the best rates possible costing taxpayers billions of dollars the total amount of u s debt outstanding has grown by 2 trillion to 22 trillion under the trump administration while the interest that the u s pays out to holders of its treasury securities has risen to 523 billion from 432 6 billion in 2016 buybacks return after short vacation although the fed minutes showed policy makers didn t talk rate cuts stock traders seemed happy that they at least judged that their patient approach to monetary policy would be appropriate for some time at least that s what the brief rebound in stocks from their lows of the day after the minutes were released would suggest or maybe it was the return of the primary driver of stocks in recent years corporate buybacks with earnings season basically over companies are back to buying their shares client data compiled by bank of america showed that at 2 4 billion the amount of buybacks last week jumped 23 from a year earlier making the week the eighth busiest since the firm began tracking the data in 2008 according to bloomberg news s lu wang and vildana hajric last month the equity strategists at goldman sachs made evident just how important buybacks have been to stocks net buybacks averaged 420 billion annually since 2010 while buying from households mutual funds pension funds and foreign investors was less than 10 billion for each fed data compiled by the firm showed playing possum the conventional wisdom is that the trade war is hurting china more than the u s indeed the oecd estimates the country s economy will slow by 0 4 percentage point this year while the u s s will slow by just 0 1 percentage point but what if the data which is generally believed to be heavily massaged before release coming out of china that shows a softening economy is just a ruse or at least partly a ploy to throw the u s off track admittedly that sounds like something for the tin foil hat wearing conspiracy crowd but what else explains china s booming demand for iron ore the analysts at goldman sachs on wednesday boosted their price outlook for iron ore saying an unexpected rise in china s use of the steel making ingredient is compounding supply shortfalls they raised their average 2019 price target to 91 a ton from 81 according to bloomberg news s marvin g perez chinese steel consumption has surprised to the upside the goldman sachs analysts wrote in a research note chinese steel production jumped 6 6 in 2018 and 10 in the first four months of this year and goldman upgraded its forecast for steel output in the nation from a contraction of 0 5 to a 4 expansion this year the one dip nobody s buying already one of the two worst performing currencies this year turkey s lira took it on the chin again wednesday depreciating a world leading 0 86 the weakness brought the lira s decline this year to 13 4 behind only the argentine peso s 16 slide but here s one dip that nobody wants to buy it turns out that a barrage of interventionist policies by president recep tayyip erdogan s government has backfired starving the economy of investment fueling demand for foreign currency among households and businesses and further undermining the lira according to bloomberg news s cagan koc and constantine courcoulas despite assurances that capital controls aren t an option turkey has sought to stabilize its currency by reintroducing a tax on foreign currency sellers and imposing a settlement delay for purchases by individuals of more than 100 000 i can t see any significant flows returning until policy makers become more market friendly said win thin global head of currency strategy at brown brothers harriman co tea leaves the national association of realtors said tuesday that existing home sales fell 0 4 in april which was a mild shocker because the median estimate of economists surveyed by bloomberg was for a 2 7 gain sales have now fallen in five of the past six months and in 13 of the past 17 months that qualifies as a slump new home sales have held up better rising in each of the first months of the year to about the highest since before the financial crisis but april it seems was not kind to the real estate industry despite a big drop in mortgage rates economists forecast the government will say thursday that new home sales dropped 2 5 in the month the economy depends on a strong and healthy housing market but if the real estate market is cooling off despite the decline in borrowing costs it may force economists to ratchet down

after the failure and abuses of privatization became apparent public private partnerships have since been promoted ostensibly to mobilize private finance for the public purpose in all too many cases ppps have socialized costs and losses while ensuring private financial gains kuala lumpur malaysia may 21 2019 ips after the failure and abuses of privatization and contracting out services from the 1980s there has been renewed appreciation for the role of the state or government earlier promoters of privatization have taken a step backward only to take two more forward to instead promote public private partnerships ppps ppps for most purposes ppps are essentially long term contracts underwritten by government guarantees with which the private sector builds and sometimes runs major infrastructure projects or services traditionally provided by the state such as hospitals schools roads railways water sanitation and energy ppps are promoted by many governments associated with the organization for economic co operation and development oecd and some multilateral development banks especially the world bank as the solution to the financing shortfall needed to achieve development including the sustainable development goals sdgs since the late 1990s many countries have embraced ppps in many areas ranging from healthcare and education to transport and infrastructure with mixed consequences they were less common in developing countries but that is changing rapidly with many countries in asia latin america and africa now introducing enabling legislation and initiating ppp projects ppps are now an increasingly popular means to finance mega infrastructure projects but dams highways large plantations pipelines and energy or transport infrastructure can ruin habitats displace communities and devastate natural resources typically social and environmental legislation is weakened or circumscribed to attract investors for ppps there are also a growing number of dirty energy ppps devastating the environment undermining progressive environmental conservation efforts and exacerbating climate change ppps have also led to forced displacement repression and other abuses of local communities indigenous peoples displaced farmers and labourers among others ppp financing more public than private nevertheless experiences with ppps have been largely although not exclusively negative and very few ppps have delivered results in the public interest there has been some supposed success with infrastructure ppps mainly due to financing arrangements generally ppps for hospitals and schools have much poorer records compared to infrastructure one can have good financing arrangements due to preferential interest rates for a poor ppp project nevertheless private finance all over the world still accounts for a small share of infrastructure financing however good financing arrangements will not make a bad ppp project any better ppps typically involve public financing for developing countries to attract bids from influential private companies often from abroad blended finance export financing and new supposed aid arrangements have become means for foreign governments to support powerful corporations bidding for ppp contracts abroad especially in developing countries incredibly such arrangements are increasingly counted as overseas development assistance as north south south south or triangular development cooperation like privatization ppps often increase fees or charges for users ppp contracts often undermine the public interest in other ways with generous host government incentives and other privileges often compromising and undermining the state s obligation to regulate in the public interest ppps can limit government capacity to enact new legislation and other policies such as strengthened environmental or social regulations that might adversely affect or constrain investor interests ppps public pain private gain ppp contracts are typically complex negotiations are subject to commercial confidentiality making it hard for civil society and parliamentarians to provide checks and balances in the public and national interest such limited transparency significantly increases the likelihood of corruption and undermines democratic accountability it is important to establish the circumstances required to achieve efficiency gains and to recognize the longer term fiscal implications of ppp related contingent liabilities shifting public debt to government guaranteed debt does not really reduce government debt liabilities but obscures accountability as it is taken off budget and is no longer subject to parliamentary let alone public scrutiny hence ppps are more likely to be abused because they are typically off balance sheet so that they do not show up as government debt giving the illusion of easy money or credit despite claims to the contrary ppps are typically riskier for governments than for the private companies involved as the government may be required to step in to assume costs and liabilities if things go wrong ppps also undermine democracy and national sovereignty as such contracts tend not to be transparent and subject to unaccountable international adjudication due to investor state dispute settlement isds commitments rather than national or international courts under world bank proposed ppp contracts for example national governments can even be liable for losses due to strikes by workers government procurement one alternative of course is government or public procurement in many instances ppps have become the most expensive financing option and much less cost effective than transparent competitive government procurement they cost governments significantly more in the long run than if the government procures on an open competitive basis or if projects are directly financed by government borrowings generally ppps are much more expensive than government procurement despite government subsidized credit however with a competent government doing good work government procurement can be efficient and low cost with a competent government and accountable consultants efficient government procurement has generally proved far more cost effective than ppp alternatives it is therefore important to establish when and why meaningful gains can be achieved through ppps

first a review of last week s events eur usd complaints and sometimes even moans have been heard everywhere in the last months about the low volatility of this pair the same is true about last week until the second half of thursday the maximum range of its fluctuations did not exceed 45 points the pair spent most of the time napping sleepily crawling along the narrow corridor of 25 points however the events of the week from the aggravation of the us china trade war and the upcoming elections to the european parliament to the statements by the fed leadership and poor data on business activity in germany and the eurozone played into the hands of the dollar as a result the pair as most experts had suggested 75 fell to the two year lows stopping at 1 1105 per euro but it is not only the economy of europe but also that of the usa which is experiencing problems the unexpectedly weak preliminary business activity index markit 50 9 instead of the expected 53 0 and the weak statistics on the real estate market led to a collapse in the yield of us government bonds and a sharp reversal of the eur usd pair to the north the euro s recovery was also facilitated by the closure of short positions at the lows reached before the three day weekend in the usa and the uk apparently the european currency and the statement of the british prime minister theresa may about her resignation added to this as a result the euro won back 100 points and the pair finished the week at 1 1205 gbp usd so mrs may is leaving her version of the brexit agreement will not be voted once again in parliament and the country is in for the next reshuffle in the leadership of the conservative party according to many analysts the head of the government can now be someone from the supporters of a hard exit from the eu like the former mayor of london and foreign minister boris johnson how will the market react most likely the reaction will be negative but this news has not so far greatly affected investor sentiment following the euro taking advantage of weak us macroeconomic statistics supported by the elimination of short positions the pair pushed off from the two year low in the 1 2600 zone and went up putting the final point in this session at 1 2710 usd jpy the japanese yen could not resist the dollar in the first half of the week either recall that 50 of analysts had expected the pair to rise to the height of 111 00 and one third of them has called the highest resistance 110 00 the truth as often happens was somewhere in the middle and the pair fixed the week high at 110 65 after that investors started to doubt thanks to the harsh statements of chinese leader xi jinping about the new great march and independence they began to realize that the yen could be a more reliable haven than the dollar the yield on us government bonds went down while wall street analysts started to talk about a high probability of deterioration in the financial results of american companies in the second half of the year and that the us economy could now be under attack due to rising prices and lower consumer demand as a result the pair turned around and returning to the values of a week ago completed the five day week at 109 30 cryptocurrencies the crypto market capitalization schedule almost repeats what happens to the reference coin bitcoin dropped from 8 335 to 7 000 capitalization fell from 255 8 billion to 229 2 billion bitcoin adjusted to 8 265 and capitalization rose to 255 5 billion quite often this graph can be successfully used as a leading indicator it should be recalled that only 25 of experts predicted a trend reversal last week the overwhelming majority voted for its continuation finding that the decline in the btc usd pair to the level of 7 000 is just a temporary correction in their opinion it had to return to the 8 000 zone after which it should move for some time in the side channel then approaching the resistance level of 8 500 where its growth was stopped last july then moving away from it that s exactly what happened as for the forecast for the coming week summarizing the opinions of a number of analysts as well as forecasts made on the basis of a variety of methods of technical and graphical analysis we can say the following eur usd both graphical and technical analysis point to continued growth of the pair on the h4 timeframe but at the same time 25 of oscillators are already in the overbought zone at d1 the situation is different one third of the indicators are colored red one third are green and another third are gray neutral but the graphical analysis insists on further strengthening of the dollar and the continuation of the downward trend in fact the situation in the global economy is quite complicated there are more obscure prospects for brexit the lack of clarity with the results of the elections to the european parliament on may 26 and multi pass maneuvers in the us china trade war here the forecasts regarding the fed s monetary policy also vary so far the chances of its mitigation for this year have grown from 68 to 78 if this forecast comes true the interest rate on the us dollar can be reduced by 0 25 in less than four months but at the same time the ecb recognizing the weakness of the european economy speaks of its readiness to take supporting measures in the minutes of the last meeting so far 60 of analysts side with the bulls believing that the powerful rebound of the pair from support in the 1 1110 zone has shown the bears fatigue and their inability to continue the struggle the support levels are 1 1150 and 1 1110 the resistance levels are 1 1225 and 1 1263 the next target is 1 1325 gbp usd at the time of writing this forecast it is not yet known which of the british parties will show which result in the elections to the european parliament who will get the advantage brexit supporters or its opponents who will be the head of the uk government theresa may departure may in the short term strengthen the pound but in no way will it eliminate the long term risks that is why 65 of experts supported by 90 of oscillators and trend indicators on d1 have voted for the pair to fall further the nearest support is at 1 2660 and 1 2600 followed by the 2018 lows 1 2475 and 1 2405 35 of analysts rely on the growth of the pair the immediate goals are 1 2825 and 1 3000 then 1 3125 and 1 3200 a compromise forecast is given by graphical analysis on d 1 first supported by 1 2600 a rise to the height of 1 2825 and then the collapse and the bottom in the zone 1 2475 usd jpy 100 of the trend indicators and 85 of the oscillators on h4 and d 1 are colored red 70 of experts have also voted for the further fall of the pair and the strengthening of the yen as a reserve currency at the same time 15 of oscillators give signals about the pair being oversold as for the graphical analysis it draws first a fall to the horizon 108 50 and then a trend reversal and a growth to the height of 110 65 it should be borne in mind that one or two unpredictable tweets of us president trump regarding the prospects for relations with china are enough to deploy the pair and accelerate it to either side the support levels are 109 00 108 50 and 107 75 the resistance levels are 110 25 110 65 111 00 and 111 65 cryptocurrencies the european central bank has released a report stating that although cryptocurrencies do not have a serious impact on the real economy now in the future it is possible that they can replace the euro but this is for the future as for the present analysts at jpmorgan chase believe that the recent rise in the price of bitcoin has brought it beyond what they call the inherent value of cryptocurrency and that this could be a harbinger of another long recession however if we sum up the opinions of their colleagues only 15 of experts now support the scenario with a fall 45 believe that the pair will move to the side channel of 7 500 8 400 and 40 are

the twelve months ended 31 december 2018 full year results 2018 were rescheduled to 24 may 2019 due to the need to complete the comprehensive capital structure review of the group as was announced by the company on 15 april 2019 nyrstar initiated a review of its capital structure the capital structure review in october 2018 in response to the challenging financial and operating conditions being faced by the group as previously announced these conditions included substantial working capital and liquidity outflows experienced during the fourth quarter of 2018 and first quarter of 2019 necessitating the raising of urgent short term funding combined with the group s materially reduced underlying ebitda performance in 2018 and the maturity of certain liabilities during 2019 these factors resulted in the need to reconsider the group s capital structure the capital structure review identified a very substantial additional funding requirement that the group is unable to meet without a material reduction of the group s indebtedness as a consequence the capital structure review has necessitated negotiations between the group s financial creditors in order to develop a deleveraging and funding plan as part of a comprehensive balance sheet recapitalisation alternatives to such a recapitalisation would place the future of the group and its stakeholders at severe risk as at the date of this announcement the company is in the process of implementing the recapitalision the company has received from its auditor and is publishing today an opinion issued in accordance with article 143 2 of the belgian company code non compliance opinion on the basis that certain information requested from the company was not timely delivered the company is working hard to deliver such information to its auditor with the intention that the auditor will issue its audit opinion once it has audited such information the full year results that are published today will then again be published to the market together with the audit opinion that the auditor will then issue group financial overview group gross profit for 2018 of eur 1 118 million was up 4 on 2017 driven by higher zinc production volumes in mining and metals processing and marginally higher zinc and gold prices which were both up 1 partially offset by deteriorating benchmark zinc treatment charge terms and a weaker us dollar against the euro direct operating costs for 2018 of eur 1 014 million increased 16 on 2017 due to higher zinc production volumes in mining and metals processing higher electricity prices at the smelters increased mining costs as a result of the restart of operations at myra falls and the ramp up of mining operations at middle tennessee group underlying ebitda of eur 99 million in 2018 a decrease of 52 on 2017 due to a weakening of the us dollar against the euro lower lead and silver prices a 15 reduction in the benchmark zinc treatment charge higher direct operating costs per tonne of zinc in both mining and metals processing underlying adjustments in 2018 were a total of eur 49 million comprising eur 2 million of embedded derivatives eur 22 million of restructuring expense eur 1 million of m a related transaction expense and eur 30 million of other expenditure relating primarily to the write off of payments that were connected with the divestment of the el toqui mine in chile depreciation depletion and amortisation expense for 2018 of eur 162 million was up 4 year on year in 2018 the company recognised a non cash pre tax impairment loss of eur 99 million 2017 impairment gain of eur 126 million this impairment loss 2017 impairment gain relates fully to pre tax impairment losses on nyrstar s mining assets eur 85 9 million at langlois and myra falls and specific asset write offs in metals processing eur 11 4 million net finance expense including foreign exchange for 2018 of eur 151 million eur 207 million in 2017 primarily due to a net foreign exchange gain of eur 6 5 million in 2018 compared to a loss of eur 59 9 million in 2017 the interest expense in 2018 of eur 128 3 million was higher than in 2017 eur 104 4 million nyrstar recognised an income tax expense for the year ended 31 december 2018 of eur 250 million 2017 income tax benefit of eur 37 million representing an effective income tax rate of 68 9 for the year ended 31 december 2017 481 3 the tax rate is impacted by non recognition of current year losses and by the de recognition of previous losses relating mainly to nyrstar sales marketing ag the us group and the canadian group given it is not probable that these tax losses will be used in the future considering forecast profit projections loss after tax of eur 618 million in 2018 compared to a net profit of eur 47 million in 2017 mainly as a result of the impairment charges related to the write down of the carrying value of the langlois and myra falls mines the partial de recognition of nyrstar sales marketing ag and nyrstar us deferred tax assets due to reduced expected recoverability and the operational losses incurred in 2018 and change of control impacts capital expenditure was eur 229 million in 2018 representing a decrease of 37 year on year driven by a substantial reduction in metals processing from eur 303 million in 2017 to eur 126 million in 2018 with the completion of the port pirie redevelopment and a eur 45 million increase in mining with the restart of the myra falls mine net debt at the end of 2018 at eur 1 643 million excluding the zinc metal prepay was 49 higher compared to the end of 2017 eur 1 102 million at the end of 2017 predominantly due to substantial working capital outflow during q4 2018 due to higher commodity prices no new silver prepays in h2 2018 reduction in non committed letter of credit lines from banking counterparties tightened credit terms with a number of suppliers the reclassification of eur 82 5 million and eur 50 7 million of prepayments for deliveries of silver metal and zinc metal respectively from deferred income to loans and borrowing at 31 december 2018 as the group had no ability to settle by physical delivery of silver metal and zinc metal respectively from its own production and the reclassification of perpetual securities eur 174 9 million at 31 december 2018 from equity to loans and borrowings6 the net debt inclusive of the zinc metal prepay and perpetual securities at the end of 2018 was eur 1 771 million up 30 compared to the end of 2017 cash balance at the end of 2018 was eur 239 million compared to eur 68 million at the end of 2017 safety health and environment prevent harm is a core value of nyrstar the company is committed to maintaining safe operations and to proactively managing risks including with respect to people and the environment at nyrstar we work together to create a workplace where all risks are effectively identified and controlled and everyone goes home safe and healthy each day of their working life in 2018 we placed particular emphasis on the prevention of hand injuries which account for a large portion of our total injuries a dedicated hand injury prevention program entitled because some tools cannot be replaced was introduced at all operations with the purpose of eliminating unsafe conditions contributing to hand injuries improving tools and personal protective equipment and changing at risk behaviours relevant to hand injuries we also continued the implementation of the process safety management system launched in 2017 and strengthened controls related to hydrogen explosion risks at our smelters the group continued to make significant progress in safety performance no severe irreversible injuries occurred the frequency rate of cases with time lost or under restricted duties dart for the company achieved a new record low of 3 7 an improvement of 7 compared to a rate of 3 9 in 2017 the frequency rate of cases requiring at least a medical treatment rir was 6 7 this is a 4 increase compared to 6 4 in 2017 more important the number of days lost due to ltis and rw injuries reached a new record low of 202 this is 20 lower than the previous best of 255 days

higher energy prices in europe and australia during h2 2018 and the suspension of operations at port pirie in december 2018 partially offset by higher production of zinc copper silver and minor metals marginally stronger year over year gross profit up 1 at eur 863 million in 2018 was mainly driven by higher zinc prices up 1 compared to 2017 which were constrained by the zinc price collar hedging in place at that time and higher production volumes of zinc metal and by products largely offset by a 19 decrease in zinc and lead treatment charge income annual 2018 zinc benchmark treatment charge terms were settled during q2 2018 at approximately 15 below the 2017 terms at usd 147 per tonne of concentrate the total premium gross profit contributions were relatively flat compared to 2017 down 2 driven by marginally higher volumes and relatively flat average realised premia rates by product gross profit contributions were positively impacted by higher gold and sulphuric acid prices and higher production volumes of copper silver gold indium and sulphuric acid compared to 2017 after a fire in q4 2015 the indium plant was re built in 2016 and resumed production by the end of q1 2017 with 29 8 tonnes of indium metal produced in 2017 and a further ramped up production volume of 42 6 tonnes in 2018 direct operating costs increased in 2018 up 12 compared to 2017 at eur 727 million due to increased energy prices in europe and australia and higher production volumes of zinc metal and by products capital expenditure spend in 2018 decreased by 59 on 2017 in line with the revised lower capital expenditure guidance provided for 2018 eur 130 million to eur 140 million compared to 2017 eur 303 million the lower capital expenditure has been driven by the completion of the port pirie

tonnes of zinc metal in 2018 representing a 4 increase on 2017 the increase in zinc metal production year over year was despite the planned maintenance shuts at auby balen clarksville and hobart and was assisted by a lack of material unplanned outages which had impacted production volumes in 2016 and 2017 however zinc and lead metal production was impacted during q4 2018 by lower raw material inventory as a consequence of the company s liquidity constraints lead metal production at port pirie of 160kt was down 7 year over year due to a 38 day planned blast furnace maintenance outage in q2 2018 and a shut of the blast furnace for december 2018 during december 2018 the company chose not to operate the old sinter plant at port pirie in order to further support reducing lead in air emissions which ended the year below the defined limit in addition nyrstar also performed maintenance on the tsl furnace and blast furnace during december 2018 these maintenance shuts were to address a tsl furnace cooling issue and to bring forward maintenance previously scheduled for the blast furnace in january 2019 the tsl furnace resumed operation on 15 december 2018 operations review mining

lower level of zinc in concentrate production has been largely due to disappointing production performance of the langlois and the middle tennessee mines and commercial production at the myra falls mine commencing slightly later than had been originally anticipated at the start of the year and the impact of the suspension of ore extraction at year end to address deficiencies identified in compliance orders from the ministry for energy mines petroleum resources in british columbia other developments port pirie redevelopment on 1 february 2019 nyrstar published an operational and financial update which included amongst other items a financial update with regards to the port pirie redevelopment the company provides the following additional clarification with regards to the latest port pirie redevelopment guidance the historic and normalised forecast pro forma underlying ebitda for port pirie hobart and australian metals processing is summarised in the table below pro forma underlying ebitda eurm 2016a 2017a 2018a 2019f 2020f port pirie 8 18 11 38 56 hobart 51 40 31 57 69 australian metals processing 59 58 20 95 125 the total pro forma underlying ebitda guidance of eur 95 million and eur 125 million for australian metals processing in fy 2019 and fy 2020 respectively is the aggregate of the total pro forma underlying ebitda contribution from both the port pirie and the hobart smelters under normalised liquidity and operating conditions this guidance is not incremental or uplift as was the case for the port pirie redevelopment guidance provided before 1 february 2019 and will be materially negatively impacted by the liquidity constraints that have been experienced by the group in q4 2018 and h1 2019 the normalised underlying ebitda guidance is the total pro forma ebitda contribution from the two australian smelters the main factors driving the negative pro forma underlying ebitda result for port pirie in 2018 were a combination of increased costs due to the continued ramp up of the tsl furnace with the parallel operation of the sinter plant and higher energy prices production outage in december 2018 and technical process bottlenecks which reduced the recovery of metal from the feed other macro factors such as lower lead treatment charges and metal prices also negatively impacted the pro forma underlying ebitda at port pirie the allocation of additional costs to residues between 2016 and 2018 has had an impact on the guided pro forma underlying ebitda contribution from the port pirie redevelopment in fy 2019 and to a lesser extent in fy 2020 as was disclosed in nyrstar s press release on 1 february 2019 the processing of historical inventory will provide a cash flow benefit of approximately eur 70 million in fy 2019 if there had not been costs allocated to these residues in 2016 to 2018 the underlying ebitda contribution from port pirie in fy 2019 would be approximately eur 70 million higher the other main reasons for the current lower but still material pro forma underlying ebitda contribution guidance from the port pirie redevelopment as compared to previous guidance are lower metal recovery assumptions as a result of technical process bottlenecks at port pirie which results in a reduction in free metal extracted from all feed processed by port pirie these bottlenecks primarily the slag fumer and copper plant at port pirie were identified in the preparation of the 5 year business plan for the capital structure review process and were incorporated in the pro forma underlying ebitda modelling for australian metals processing and the application of one year of actual operating data instead of the projected data which nyrstar previously needed to rely on as was indicated in the operational and financial update published on 1 february 2019 the metals processing segment profitability of both the australian sites are intrinsically linked by the raw material flows between the two sites and are only possible due to the port pirie redevelopment in the absence of the port pirie redevelopment the hobart and port pirie sites would both be non operational and would not contribute ebitda to the metals processing segment furthermore the pro forma underlying ebitda of the two sites individually but not of australian metal processing overall depends on the internal re charge arrangements between the two sites for internal residues that are used as feedstock at the sites for this reason to provide more clarity the company has decided to show the proforma underlying ebitda for australian metal processing with a breakdown of this figure to port pirie and hobart the total project cost for the port pirie redevelopment was approximately aud 714 million this is inclusive of the feasibility study costs and project management labour costs management changes in connection with the capital structure review process nyrstar announced on 18 january 2019 that mr martyn konig had taken up the role of executive chairman and that mr roman matej had been appointed to serve as interim chief financial officer mr michel abaza the former chief financial officer left the nyrstar group with immediate effect strategic foreign exchange hedges since 2016 nyrstar has entered into a series of 12 month rolling foreign exchange options to hedge the company s monthly exposure related to the direct operating costs denominated in australian dollars aud canadian dollars cad and in euro eur utilising put and call collar structures during the course of 2018 eur usd exposure was unhedged in h1

transactional cad usd currency exposure for the mining segment was hedged with a fixed forward of 1 32 in 2019 in january and february 2019 nyrstar unwound all of its strategic forward foreign exchange hedges due to the loss of credit lines from the hedge counterparties strategic metal price hedges in h1 2018 nyrstar had in place zinc price collar hedges to protect 70 of total free metal produced at the zinc smelters and north american mines within a price range of usd 2 300 t and usd 3 094 t above and below these prices nyrstar s exposure was limited to 30 of the total free metal produced in h2 2018 nyrstar had in place zinc price collar hedges to protect 50 of total free metal produced at the zinc smelters and north american mines within a price range of usd 2 600 t and usd 3 842 t above and below these prices nyrstar s exposure was limited to 50 of the total free metal produced during 2018 nyrstar continued with its 12 month rolling hedging programme and had hedged the majority of its zinc free metal exposure 150kt for the mining segment at c usd 3 000 t zinc in concentrate production in 2020 was also partly hedged with approximately 16kt hedged at a zinc price of c usd 2 900 t in december 2018 nyrstar terminated all of its strategic metal hedges to provide additional liquidity to the business metal at risk hedging at any given time nyrstar holds metal either as work in progress or finished good inventory that has been priced in but not priced out as this metal remains exposed to fluctuations in the underlying metal price until it is priced out it is called metal at risk the actual metal at risk at any given point in time fluctuates with deliveries of raw materials and production levels as a risk mitigation process nyrstar has always consistently monitored its metal at risk on an ongoing basis and undertaken hedging to mitigate the metal price exposure in what nyrstar refers to as transactional hedging the price of placing these transactional hedges is dependent on whether future or forward prices are higher or lower than current or spot prices as indicated by the shape of the forward underlying metal price curve future prices can be either higher or lower than current prices depending on a range of factors and can change quite rapidly at times the hedges required to hedge nyrstar s metal at risk position are determined by whether the net position is positive meaning nyrstar has more metal priced in than is priced out or alternatively is negative meaning nyrstar has more metal priced out than is priced in as announced by nyrstar on 1 february 2019 it has been continuing to manage tightly its cash and inventory levels and has been evaluating additional measures to improve its liquidity position during the course of march 2019 nyrstar closed out all of its metal at risk hedge positions to release cash collateralized against the credit lines as a consequence of closing out these metal at risk hedges nyrstar realised a one off cash benefit of approximately usd 40 million and is now fully exposed to fluctuations in metal prices for its metal at risk cyber attack in january 2019 nyrstar was subject to a

the twelve months ended 31 december 2018 full year results 2018 were rescheduled to 24 may 2019 due to the need to complete the comprehensive capital structure review of the group as was announced by the company on 15 april 2019 nyrstar initiated a review of its capital structure the capital structure review in october 2018 in response to the challenging financial and operating conditions being faced by the group as previously announced these conditions included substantial working capital and liquidity outflows experienced during the fourth quarter of 2018 and first quarter of 2019 necessitating the raising of urgent short term funding combined with the group s materially reduced underlying ebitda performance in 2018 and the maturity of certain liabilities during 2019 these factors resulted in the need to reconsider the group s capital structure the capital structure review identified a very substantial additional funding requirement that the group is unable to meet without a material reduction of the group s indebtedness as a consequence the capital structure review has necessitated negotiations between the group s financial creditors in order to develop a deleveraging and funding plan as part of a comprehensive balance sheet recapitalisation alternatives to such a recapitalisation would place the future of the group and its stakeholders at severe risk as at the date of this announcement the company is in the process of implementing the recapitalision the company has received from its auditor and is publishing today an opinion issued in accordance with article 143 2 of the belgian company code non compliance opinion on the basis that certain information requested from the company was not timely delivered the company is working hard to deliver such information to its auditor with the intention that the auditor will issue its audit opinion once it has audited such information the full year results that are published today will then again be published to the market together with the audit opinion that the auditor will then issue group financial overview group gross profit for 2018 of eur 1 118 million was up 4 on 2017 driven by higher zinc production volumes in mining and metals processing and marginally higher zinc and gold prices which were both up 1 partially offset by deteriorating benchmark zinc treatment charge terms and a weaker us dollar against the euro direct operating costs for 2018 of eur 1 014 million increased 16 on 2017 due to higher zinc production volumes in mining and metals processing higher electricity prices at the smelters increased mining costs as a result of the restart of operations at myra falls and the ramp up of mining operations at middle tennessee group underlying ebitda of eur 99 million in 2018 a decrease of 52 on 2017 due to a weakening of the us dollar against the euro lower lead and silver prices a 15 reduction in the benchmark zinc treatment charge higher direct operating costs per tonne of zinc in both mining and metals processing underlying adjustments in 2018 were a total of eur 49 million comprising eur 2 million of embedded derivatives eur 22 million of restructuring expense eur 1 million of m a related transaction expense and eur 30 million of other expenditure relating primarily to the write off of payments that were connected with the divestment of the el toqui mine in chile depreciation depletion and amortisation expense for 2018 of eur 162 million was up 4 year on year in 2018 the company recognised a non cash pre tax impairment loss of eur 99 million 2017 impairment gain of eur 126 million this impairment loss 2017 impairment gain relates fully to pre tax impairment losses on nyrstar s mining assets eur 85 9 million at langlois and myra falls and specific asset write offs in metals processing eur 11 4 million net finance expense including foreign exchange for 2018 of eur 151 million eur 207 million in 2017 primarily due to a net foreign exchange gain of eur 6 5 million in 2018 compared to a loss of eur 59 9 million in 2017 the interest expense in 2018 of eur 128 3 million was higher than in 2017 eur 104 4 million nyrstar recognised an income tax expense for the year ended 31 december 2018 of eur 250 million 2017 income tax benefit of eur 37 million representing an effective income tax rate of 68 9 for the year ended 31 december 2017 481 3 the tax rate is impacted by non recognition of current year losses and by the de recognition of previous losses relating mainly to nyrstar sales marketing ag the us group and the canadian group given it is not probable that these tax losses will be used in the future considering forecast profit projections loss after tax of eur 618 million in 2018 compared to a net profit of eur 47 million in 2017 mainly as a result of the impairment charges related to the write down of the carrying value of the langlois and myra falls mines the partial de recognition of nyrstar sales marketing ag and nyrstar us deferred tax assets due to reduced expected recoverability and the operational losses incurred in 2018 and change of control impacts capital expenditure was eur 229 million in 2018 representing a decrease of 37 year on year driven by a substantial reduction in metals processing from eur 303 million in 2017 to eur 126 million in 2018 with the completion of the port pirie redevelopment and a eur 45 million increase in mining with the restart of the myra falls mine net debt at the end of 2018 at eur 1 643 million excluding the zinc metal prepay was 49 higher compared to the end of 2017 eur 1 102 million at the end of 2017 predominantly due to substantial working capital outflow during q4 2018 due to higher commodity prices no new silver prepays in h2 2018 reduction

at the end of 2017 safety health and environment prevent harm is a core value of nyrstar the company is committed to maintaining safe operations and to proactively managing risks including with respect to people and the environment at nyrstar we work together to create a workplace where all risks are effectively identified and controlled and everyone goes home safe and healthy each day of their working life in 2018 we placed particular emphasis on the prevention of hand injuries which account for a large portion of our total injuries a dedicated hand injury prevention program entitled because some tools cannot be replaced was introduced at all operations with the purpose of eliminating unsafe conditions contributing to hand injuries improving tools and personal protective equipment and changing at risk behaviours relevant to hand injuries we also continued the implementation of the process safety management system launched in 2017 and strengthened controls related to hydrogen explosion risks at our smelters the group continued to make significant progress in safety performance no severe irreversible injuries occurred the frequency rate of cases with time lost or under restricted duties dart for the company achieved a new record low of 3 7 an improvement of 7 compared to a rate of 3 9 in 2017 the frequency rate of cases requiring at least a medical treatment rir was

higher energy prices in europe and australia during h2 2018 and the suspension of operations at port pirie in december 2018 partially offset by higher production of zinc copper silver and minor metals marginally stronger year over year gross profit up 1 at eur 863 million in 2018 was mainly driven by higher zinc prices up 1 compared to 2017 which were constrained by the zinc price collar hedging in place at that time and higher production volumes of zinc metal and by products largely offset by a 19 decrease in zinc and lead treatment charge income annual 2018 zinc benchmark treatment charge terms were settled during q2 2018 at approximately 15 below the 2017 terms at usd 147 per tonne of concentrate the total premium gross profit contributions were relatively flat compared to 2017 down 2 driven by marginally higher volumes and relatively flat average realised premia rates by product gross profit contributions were positively impacted by higher gold and sulphuric acid prices and higher production volumes of copper silver gold indium and sulphuric acid compared to 2017 after a fire in q4 2015 the indium plant was re built in 2016 and resumed production by the end of q1 2017 with 29 8 tonnes of indium metal produced in 2017 and a further ramped up production volume of 42 6 tonnes in 2018 direct operating costs increased in 2018 up 12 compared to 2017 at eur 727 million due to

capital expenditure guidance provided for 2018 eur 130 million to eur 140 million compared to 2017 eur 303 million the lower capital expenditure has been driven by the completion of the port pirie

tonnes of zinc metal in 2018 representing a 4 increase on 2017 the increase in zinc metal production year over year was despite the planned maintenance shuts at auby balen clarksville and hobart and was assisted by a lack of material unplanned outages which had impacted production volumes in 2016 and 2017 however zinc and lead metal production was impacted during q4 2018 by lower raw material inventory as a consequence of the company s liquidity constraints lead metal production at port pirie of 160kt was down 7 year over year due to a 38 day planned blast furnace maintenance outage in q2 2018 and a shut of the blast furnace for december 2018 during december 2018 the company chose not to operate the old sinter plant at port pirie in order to further support reducing lead in air emissions which ended the year below the defined limit in addition nyrstar also performed maintenance on the tsl furnace and blast furnace during december 2018 these maintenance shuts were to address a tsl furnace cooling issue and to bring forward maintenance previously scheduled for the blast furnace in january 2019 the tsl furnace resumed operation on 15 december 2018 operations review mining

lower level of zinc in concentrate production has been largely due to disappointing production performance of the langlois and the middle tennessee mines and commercial production at the myra falls mine commencing slightly later than had been originally anticipated at the start of the year and the impact of the suspension of ore extraction at year end to address deficiencies identified in compliance orders from the ministry for energy mines petroleum resources in british columbia other developments port pirie redevelopment on 1 february 2019 nyrstar published an operational and financial update which included amongst other items a financial update with regards to the port pirie redevelopment the company provides the following additional clarification with regards to the latest port pirie redevelopment guidance the historic and normalised forecast pro forma underlying ebitda for port pirie hobart and australian metals processing is summarised in the table below pro forma underlying ebitda eurm 2016a 2017a 2018a 2019f 2020f port pirie 8 18 11 38 56 hobart 51 40 31 57 69 australian metals processing 59 58 20 95 125 the total pro forma underlying ebitda guidance of eur 95 million and eur 125 million for australian metals processing in fy 2019 and fy 2020 respectively is the aggregate of the total pro forma underlying ebitda contribution from both the port pirie and the hobart smelters under normalised liquidity and operating conditions this guidance is not incremental or uplift as was the case for the port pirie redevelopment guidance provided before 1 february 2019 and will be materially negatively impacted by the liquidity constraints that have been experienced by the group in q4 2018 and h1 2019 the normalised underlying ebitda guidance is the total pro forma ebitda contribution from the two australian smelters the main factors driving the negative pro forma underlying ebitda result for port pirie in 2018 were a combination of increased costs due to the continued ramp up of the tsl furnace with the parallel operation of the sinter plant and higher energy prices production outage in december 2018 and technical process bottlenecks which reduced the recovery of metal from the feed other macro factors such as lower lead treatment charges and metal prices also negatively impacted the pro forma underlying ebitda at port pirie the allocation of additional costs to residues between 2016 and 2018 has had an impact on the guided pro forma underlying ebitda contribution from the port pirie redevelopment in fy 2019 and to a lesser extent in fy 2020 as was disclosed in nyrstar s press release on 1 february 2019 the processing of historical inventory will provide a cash flow benefit of approximately eur 70 million in fy 2019 if there had not been costs allocated to these residues in 2016 to 2018 the underlying ebitda contribution from port pirie in fy 2019 would be approximately eur 70 million higher the other main reasons for the current lower but still material pro forma underlying ebitda contribution guidance from the port pirie redevelopment as compared to previous guidance are lower metal recovery assumptions as a result of technical process bottlenecks at port pirie which results in a reduction in free metal extracted from all feed processed by port pirie these bottlenecks primarily the slag fumer and copper plant at port pirie were identified in the preparation of the 5 year business plan for the capital structure review process and were incorporated in the pro forma underlying ebitda modelling for australian metals processing and the application of one year of actual operating data instead of the projected data which nyrstar previously needed to rely on as was indicated in the operational and financial update published on 1 february 2019 the metals processing segment profitability of both the australian sites are intrinsically linked by the raw material flows between the two sites and are only possible due to the port pirie redevelopment in the absence of the port pirie redevelopment the hobart and port pirie sites would both be non operational and would not contribute ebitda to the metals processing segment furthermore the pro forma underlying ebitda of the two sites individually but not of australian metal processing overall depends on the internal re charge arrangements between the two sites for internal residues that are used as feedstock at the sites for this reason to provide more clarity the company has decided to show the proforma underlying ebitda for australian metal processing with a breakdown of this figure to port pirie and hobart the total project cost for the port pirie redevelopment was approximately aud 714 million this is inclusive of the feasibility study costs and project management labour costs management changes in connection with the capital structure review process nyrstar announced on 18 january 2019 that mr martyn konig had taken up the role of executive chairman and that mr roman matej had been appointed to serve as interim chief financial officer mr michel abaza the former chief financial officer left the nyrstar group with immediate effect strategic foreign exchange hedges since 2016 nyrstar has entered into a series of 12 month rolling foreign exchange options to hedge the company s monthly exposure related to the direct operating costs denominated in australian dollars aud canadian dollars cad and in euro eur utilising put and call collar structures during the course of 2018 eur usd exposure was unhedged in h1 2018 and hedged on a fixed forward basis at 1 18 in h2 2018 for the aud usd transactional exposure various collars were executed resulting in a weighted average collar of 0 70 to 0 80 for approximately 100 of 2018 for the cad usd transactional exposure on langlois various collars were executed resulting in a weighted average collar of 1 32 to 1 36 for approximately 100 of 2018 transactional cad usd currency exposure for the mining segment was hedged with a fixed forward of 1 32 in 2019 in january and february 2019 nyrstar unwound all of its strategic forward foreign exchange hedges due to the loss of credit lines from the hedge counterparties strategic metal price hedges in h1 2018 nyrstar had in place zinc price collar hedges to protect 70 of total free metal produced at the zinc smelters and north american mines within a price range of usd 2 300 t and usd 3 094 t above and below these prices nyrstar s exposure was limited to 30 of the total free metal produced in h2 2018 nyrstar had in place zinc price collar hedges to protect 50 of total free metal produced at the zinc smelters and north american mines within a price range of usd 2 600 t and usd 3 842 t above and below these prices nyrstar s exposure was limited to 50 of the total free metal produced during 2018 nyrstar continued with its 12 month rolling hedging programme and had hedged the majority of its zinc free metal exposure 150kt for the mining segment at c usd 3 000 t zinc in concentrate production in 2020 was also partly hedged with approximately 16kt hedged at a zinc price of c usd 2 900 t in december 2018 nyrstar terminated all of its strategic metal hedges to provide additional liquidity to the business metal at risk hedging at any given time nyrstar holds metal either as work in progress or finished good inventory that has been priced in but not priced out as this metal remains exposed to fluctuations in the underlying metal price until it is priced out it is called metal at risk the actual metal at risk at any given point in time fluctuates with deliveries of raw materials and production levels as a risk mitigation process nyrstar has always consistently monitored its metal at risk on an ongoing basis and undertaken hedging to mitigate the metal price exposure in what nyrstar refers to as transactional hedging the price of placing these transactional hedges is dependent on whether future or forward prices are higher or lower than current or spot prices as indicated by the shape of the forward underlying metal price curve future prices can be either higher or lower than current prices depending on a range of factors and can change quite rapidly at times the hedges required to hedge nyrstar s metal at risk position are determined by whether the net position is positive meaning nyrstar has more metal priced in than is priced out or alternatively is negative meaning nyrstar has more metal priced out than is priced in as announced by nyrstar on 1 february 2019 it has been continuing to manage tightly its cash and inventory levels and has been evaluating additional measures to improve its liquidity position during the course of march 2019 nyrstar closed out all of its metal at risk hedge positions to release cash collateralized against the credit lines as a consequence of closing out these metal at risk hedges nyrstar realised a one off cash benefit of approximately usd 40 million and is now fully exposed to fluctuations in metal prices for its metal at risk cyber attack in january 2019 nyrstar was subject to a cyber attack certain it systems including email were impacted the cyber attack issue was subsequently contained and resolved the operational and financial impact of the cyber attack on nyrstar s metals processing and mining operations was not significant perpetual securities distribution amount on 29 april 2019 nyrstar port pirie pty ltd notified the holder of the perpetual securities that it elected to cash pay all of the distribution amount interest fees on the perpetual securities for the period 27 november 2018 to 27 may 2019 being aud 13 2 million and also that it would redeem 29 125

the perspective atlanta georgia may 26 2019 liberian currency it has been sixteen years since the liberian civil crisis came to an end in 2003 the motivations of the civil war itself were unproductive and created unbearable conditions that still impact negatively on the well being of liberians one such impact is the poor state of the economy until 1989 the economy was relatively stable and living conditions of liberians were good in comparison to some of its west african neighbors during the period before the civil war the political elites underestimated the benefits of a functioning economy that attracted nationals from neighboring countries to take advantage of the enduring liberian economy the fights in those years were not about the economy and the wellbeing of liberians rather it was about access to political power and authority this attitude continues to unveil itself even today the political elites struggled for political emancipation and ignored economic emancipation which was and is still the felt needs of liberians it is a reality that when citizens have jobs and are capable of addressing the bread and butter issues then politicians will live and work in peace if not they get the opposite this has been the state of affairs in liberia for many years and has further manifested itself under president george m weah s administration liberia is in a serious state of near collapse due to the poor state of the economy driven by the exchange rate as attributed by some liberians as well as the dual currency united states dollars and liberian dollars used concurrently in the liberian economy while i am not an economist i do believe that the dual currency has provided cushion to the ailing economy however in my view what has been missing is leadership strategic leadership has been a fundamental gap in the post war governance of the country the government of liberia needs to provide the right leadership in the management of the dual currency economy the government has got to take actions to reduce the demand for the united states dollars on the local market it does not make sense for the liberian government to collect taxes in united states dollars by asking taxpayers to go out on the local market and find united states dollars to pay lawful taxes in a country that does not produce united states dollars is a factor for creating unnecessary demand for the us dollar the government needs to also ensure that those who want to import goods and services into liberia do not go through the burden of trying to buy united states dollars on the local market as this also creates an unnecessary demand for the united states dollars there is also no need for goods and services to be sold in united states dollars on the local market schools and clinics should not be allowed to sell their goods and services in the us dollars banks and financial service institutions should not be allowed to give united states dollars to any of their customers unless that customer can prove that they are traveling outside of the country flight ticket hotel bookings etc for which they have a need for united states dollars the government multinational companies and private businesses operating in liberia should not pay their employees and or contractors in united states dollars not even their expatriate staff unless they are traveling outside the country international governmental organizations and foreign missions should be exempted from this measure due to diplomatic immunity in my high school economics i was taught the law of supply and demand the higher the demand the higher the price and the lower the demand the lower the price and this is exactly what this article argues that successive liberian governments past and present have continued to create unnecessary demand for the united states dollars without the correspondent capacity to supply the currency in the local market the us dollar is produced and controlled by the federal reserve of the united states of america and not the central bank of liberia why tag the country s economic activities to the currency we have no control over if the government take measures to stop too many people chasing a few united states dollars on the local market the demand for the united states dollars might be reduced however some might argue that the government will not be able to service its debts local and international since the country s export sector is still very weak i maintain in this article that such a supposition is a weak argument let me pose a couple of questions to the proponents of such an argument where are the us dollars that are currently used to pay government taxes coming from and how is it being generated the lack of leadership on the part of our governments past and present that i mentioned earlier has got to do with the desire for officials of government to keep united states dollars in their pockets to buy personal goods and services and not necessarily the need to service the country s debts this must stop officials of government need to delay their gratification to allow the country to survive amidst the declining economic situation in the country the current liberian government needs to move very fast and reduce the demand for the united states dollars by taking certain steps which should include but not limited to all taxes must be paid in liberian dollars except multinational companies operating in liberia with subsidiaries abroad or listed on any of the stock markets the government must pay all goods and services in liberian dollars including salary and benefits for all category of employees in all branches of the liberia government including the president vice president speaker chief justice etc the only payment to be made in united states dollars are those to be spent outside of the country for any official of government to get payment in united states dollars he or she must provide proof that they will spend that money outside of liberia the government must transition its budget from united states dollars to liberian dollars and subsequently ensure that all service providers supporting the initiatives of government do likewise and transact in liberian dollars it doesn t matter who is involved this is where equity fairness and justice must be enforced the government must ensure that all supermarkets and businesses label their goods and services in liberian dollars and businesses pay hefty fines if caught accepting united states dollars for their goods and services that multinational companies exchange their united states dollars brought into the country for liberian dollars through the central bank in fact the commercial banks with whom they transact businesses should hold the united states dollars and give them liberian dollars to pay salaries of their staffs however expat staff may be exempted only in case if they need money to use abroad and can prove that they need such an amount these actions are as necessary as the systems and processes the government would put in place to ensure that those who need united states dollars through the formal banking system can access it within 24 hours or less the government should brace itself to mobilize all the united states dollars that comes into the country under its authority and regulate how is it used within its borders besides what happens within the local markets there are big international currency exchange brokers sitting in washington dc london brussels etc who are buying and selling local currencies that influence the exchange rates these brokers are dealing directly with the commercial banks and financial service institutions providing them better exchange rates as against what the central bank is providing they have argued in most countries where they operate that they are contributing to the stability of the exchange rate i do not buy their argument instead they are contributing to manipulating the rate for two reasons they are not a registered business within the country and are not legal taxpayers but yet maximize profit through the exchange of currencies by offering better rates than the official rate their action to participate in the currency exchange market while sitting outside of the country has the potential to manipulate the exchange rate at their advantage and putting local exchange businesses at the disadvantage even though local exchange businesses are legal taxpayers the government needs to watch out for commercial banks doing business with these international foreign exchange businesses operating inside the country without being a legal entity under the laws of liberia these potential currency manipulators do not see anything wrong with their operations and therefore will go all out to defend their actions including persuading ill prepared officials to stand on their side they exist in other parts of west africa but i have no proved if they are operating in liberia the government needs to find its footprint on the currency shores of liberia and put in place the necessary regulatory framework finally there is nothing wrong with the dual currency in liberia it has existed since the 1980s when the military government introduced the coins lrd5 00 to regulate the movement of united states bank notes capital flight from the country and forced people to invest the dual currency has helped cushion the dual currency market the problem we now face is the unpatriotic actions of our governments which has increased the demand for the united states dollars over the liberia dollars there is a need to ensure that the liberian dollars regain its glory as of the legal tender and regulate transactions in the united states dollars on the local market so that the value of the liberian dollar will appreciate by decreasing the demand for the united states dollar about the author joseph jimmy sankaituah holds msc degree in diplomacy and

the green new deal gnd drawn up by congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez and ed markey is the most ambitious and comprehensive program to deal with climate change ever made by political representatives to congress and the u s public it calls for making dramatic changes within the next ten years to end our reliance on fossil fuels that are warming the planet at an alarming rate but it is not only about curbing carbon dioxide co2 emissions it is most of all a proposal to set us on a path of creating an ecologically sustainable society the gnd lays out seven major proposals for ending u s society s addiction to fossil fuels the most destructive form of addiction known on this planet dramatically expand existing renewable power sources and deploy new production capacity with the goal of meeting 100 of national power demand through renewable sources building a national energy efficient smart grid upgrading every residential and industrial building for state of the art energy efficiency comfort and safety eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from manufacturing agricultural and other industries eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from transportation and other infrastructure and upgrading water infrastructure to ensure universal access to clean water funding massive investment in the draw down of greenhouse gases making green technology industry expertise products and services a major export of the united states with the aim of becoming the undisputed international leader in helping other countries bringing about a global green new deal these seven policy prescriptions are ambitious enough yet the gnd goes further by stipulating it shall recognize that a national industrial economic mobilization of this scope and scale is a historic opportunity to virtually eliminate poverty in the united states and to make prosperity wealth and economic security available to everyone participating in the transformation it spells this out with eight specific proposals provide all members of society the opportunity training and education to be a full and equal participant in the transition including through a job guarantee program to assure a living wage job to every person who wants one diversify local and regional economies to ensure workers have the necessary tools opportunities and economic assistance to succeed during the energy transition require strong enforcement of labor workplace safety and wage standards that recognize the rights of workers to organize and unionize free of coercion intimidation and harassment and creation of meaningful quality career employment ensure a just transition for all workers low income communities communities of color indigenous communities rural and urban communities and the front line communities most affected by climate change pollution and other environmental harm including by ensuring that local implementation of the transition is led from the community level protect and enforce sovereign rights and land rights of tribal nations mitigate deeply entrenched racial regional and gender based inequalities in income and wealth including without limitation ensuring that federal and other investment will be equitably distributed to historically impoverished low income de industrialized or other marginalized communities include measures such as basic income programs universal health care programs and any others as the select committee may deem appropriate to promote economic security labor market flexibility and entrepreneurship deeply involve national and local labor unions to take a leadership role in the process of job training and worker deployment these eight proposals regarding full employment universal health care support for unions and marginalized communities opposition to racial and gender based discrimination etc may seem on the surface to have little to do with the gnd s central aim of radically reducing greenhouse has emissions within the next ten years but in fact these eight proposals have a great deal to do with the seven that address ending reliance on fossil fuels they are not some throw away meant to sneak a radical political agenda into an otherwise technical discussion of how to lower co2 emissions they are needed to wean u s society away from its addiction on fossil fuels here is why climate justice can t be achieved without changing the structures of u s society that make it hard to break from our reliance on fossil fuel over 1 4 million americans directly work for the fossil fuel industry it makes no sense to propose scaling back and eventually eliminating this industry unless those displaced from it are assured of jobs that pay decent wages and benefits as jedediah britton purdy recently put it in the twenty first century environmental policy is economic policy keeping the two separate is an anachronism moreover innumerable parts of our society depend on fossil fuel in addition to the gas we put in our cars this includes building construction packaging and agriculture most pesticides and fertilizers are made from fossil fuels even shampoo yes almost all of them are oil based just look around you almost everything from the plastic tables and chairs to the formica panels and light fixtures are by products of petroleum these and many more products and the industries that make them will have to be reconfigured to drastically reduce co2 emissions clearly this cannot be done unless there is buy in from the mass of the u s public which needs affordable housing health care free education and the elimination of racial and gender based policies that maintain the status quo instead of fostering the common good in sum global warming is a social justice issue if we don t address the social injustice that is the main condition for the possibility and even the necessity of the addiction to fossil fuels we are left without an approach to making even a dent in the problem this is already obvious from some recent events in france macron s government imposed a carbon tax on gasoline as part of its effort to meet the international accords reached several years ago to lower greenhouse gas emissions but it did so at the same time as reducing tax rates for the rich and cutting social programs as a result the yellow vest movement arose initially united around a demand that the gasoline tax be revoked their demands have have since exceeded that it isn t that they don t care about global warming many participating in the protests are farmers who see evidence of it every day but they don t want those already subjected to austerity measures and social marginalization to be the only ones to pay the cost of redressing climate change it is one of the virtues of the gnd that it doesn t include a carbon tax in its lists of proposals the aim should not be imposing regressive taxes on the consumption of fossil fuels but rather restricting their production through a comprehensive program that can transition u s society from its currently ecologically unsustainable energy policies although the gnd does not mention how much it will cost to achieve this transition it will clearly cost trillions of dollars is spending that much realistic or an utter fantasy it is surely necessary given that the intergovernmental panel on climate change recently reported that we have 12 years to transform the global economy away from fossil fuels it we expect a livable climate for human beings twelve years the clock is ticking and we cannot wait until the effects of global warming become so dire as to be irreversible moreover the trillions that it will cost to transition from carbon based to sustainable energy systems pales in comparison with the many trillions more that will have to be spent dealing with mass migrations loss of habitats and farmland and the need to rebuild entire cities and even countries as sea levels inundate coastal areas it is worth keeping in mind that the global energy infrastructure is today worth 30 to 40 trillion and turns over every three or four decades that s a huge sum of money needed just to reproduce the carbon based energy infrastructure we already have why not spend a commensurate or even greater amount to eliminate it altogether with a new system of producing energy given that the continued use of the one we have now may spell the end of civilization as we have known it for these reasons the gnd is an important starting point for conceiving how to take effective action now to halt and reverse the impact of climate change but it is only a starting point since it has its limitations the problems begin with its name the green new deal obviously harkens back to the new deal of the 1930s and 1940s the comprehension program born in response to the great depression that produced the modern welfare state while many praise its beneficial social impact the new deal actually did not lift the u s out of the depression world war ii did by 1944 70 cents of every dollar spent in the u s went to the military the size and role of the state expanded enormously enabling the u s to marshal the power and resources needed to defeat nazi germany and fascist japan in doing so the new deal introduced important legislation that improved the lives of much of the populace especially workers and including african americans which is one reason blacks switched their long held allegiance to the republican party to the democrats during the new deal however the aim of the new deal was to save capitalism from collapse not to transition to a new social order here is where the comparison with our situation today ends since we cannot effectively deal with climate change without transitioning to a new social order this is because capitalism has been hooked on fossil fuel for over two centuries it is endemic to the very structure of the capitalist economy capitalism is a system defined by the drive to increase monetary wealth especially in the form of profit as an end in itself every business exists to make a profit if profit rates for a particular enterprise decline relative to others it is only a matter of time before it will be driven out of business fossil fuels are highly conducive for economies driven by the profit motive since it packs an enormous amount of energy into a relatively small volume that is easily transportable from one location to another capital s abstractive logic of domination which seeks to liberate social life from natural spatial determinations for the sake of augmenting value as an end in itself is almost inexorably drawn to fossil fuels that can be transported anywhere it is therefore extremely unlikely that it will be possible to wean capitalism off of its addition to fossil fuel without undermining the economic principles that govern it the gnd implicitly points in this direction this by calling for a series of changes that get in the way of the business model pursuit of profit such as its insistence on full employment paying workers a living wage providing free health care and education to all citizens etc but this fits uneasily with the model of the new deal of the 1930s and 1940s which was trying to save capitalism when the gnd was being drafted alexandia ocasio cortez initially didn t want to call it the green new deal perhaps for some of these reasons but others thought it has a catchy ring that would connect with the public but as a result most critics as well as supporters of the gnd take the phrase literally by thinking the same principles and policies that drove roosevelt s new deal can save us from the grave threat of climate change today but there are at least three major problems with this viewpoint the first problem is that is narrows the horizon of the debate over global warming to private interests versus government intervention or corporations versus the state private industries and enterprises operate according to the profit motive for this reason it is argued they lack an incentive to produce goods and servies in an ecologically healthy way if profit rates can be maintained or increased by using carbon based fuels they will use them unless prevented to do so by some outside force that outside force is the government or state since government is based in the collection and distribution of revenue it is not driven many argue by the profit motive it has no inherent incentive to produce goods and services in a manner damaging to the environment at least when it is subject to the needs of the citizenry instead of corporate interests that manipulate it to serve its ends since the entire economic model is based on carbon based emissions it will take an outside force like the state to compel businesses to act otherwise and they need to be compelled to act very soon otherwise we will reach the tipping point beyond which dealing with global climate change will be outside of our reach furthermore the amount of economic resources and political power that even the largest corporate entity can muster let alone private individuals is minuscule compared to that of the government the world s largest multinational corporation apple has a valuation of 800 billion far smaller than this year s federal budget of 4 5 trillion state and local government budgets account for 3 1 trillion more no private or business interest can match this level of resources there would never have been a u s highway system without government spending little of it came from private sources and there would never have been the internet personal computers or smart phones without government spending the microprocessor was a product of hundreds of billions of dollars devoted to research and development by the defense department and nasa and so it is when it comes to climate change when it comes to such a huge and complex issue as moving our society away from its addiction to fossil fuels a massive degree of government intervention in at least some form will be needed there is much to be said for this argument if we face a 12 year deadline to seriously reduce carbon emissions it isn t going to happen by relying on the market or private individuals yes we can take individual steps to reduce our consumption of meat 79 of the land devoted to agriculture in the u s is devoted to animal feed which produces a huge percentage of global greenhouse gas emissions we can use less plastic when we shop and we can try to recycle more but such actions welcome as they are cannot stop the impending catastrophe on their own they are drops in the bucket as benjamin selwyn argues what we need to avert climate catastrophe is a systemic approach to comprehending and transforming the current global economy however it is a major mistake to frame such a transformation in terms of uncritically embracing the power of the state first governments are readily prone to being used by corporate and oligarchic interests for their own ends they are not neutral formations devoid of class interests that has always been the case but it has never been truer than today to give but one of many recent examples the supreme court s ruling on citizens united has allowed a flood of corporate money including much from the fossil fuel industry to shape government policy therefore relying on the state to curb carbon emissions won t work with the kind of political system we have today it will instead require a radical transformation of the entire structure of american governance it will require nothing less than a political revolution in which the u s and other countries become genuine social democracies in the original sense of that term that serve the needs of its citizens instead of the corporate elites that preside over them in a word the goals of the gnd require transitioning from the partial and flawed democracy we have today to a genuine or true democracy this is where the comparison of the green new deal to the new deal of the 1930s and 1940s is quite misleading the new deal did not transform the structure of american politics in some respects it further entrenched it one reflection of this is the way in which congress passed the new deal with the support of southern white segregationists who used it to solidify their power at the expense of african americans roosevelt s housing policy which was a central component of the new deal gave federal support to racially segregated housing which prevented blacks from buying or renting property in many parts of the country the authors of the gnd are aware of this which is why one of its points calls for a just transition for all workers low income communities communities of color indigenous communities however far too many supporters of the gnd seem to naively presume that such goals can be accomplished with the framework of existing power structures they assume that the state is more powerful than civil society can ever be there is no doubt that the state appears to be powerful even infinitely powerful however it is not as powerful as it appears since it is ultimately dependent on the structures of civil society where the latter remain unchanged the limits of policy changes at the level of the state become evident second governments are notoriously bureaucratic institutions that tend to defer delay or indefinitely postpone implementing even the most well thought out and valuable plans and initiatives whereas private businesses pursue money as an end in itself the state and governments promote bureaucracy as an end in itself obviously this also applies to non state entities as well as in academia one enthusiastic supporter of the gnd the acclaimed labor historian jeremy brecher has become so enthralled of its presumed connection to roosevelt s new deal that he recently proclaimed government initiative is necessary to cut through inertia bottlenecks and bureaucratic red tape i confess to finding it very strange to call upon government bureaucrats to cut through bureaucratic red tape it s sort of like asking the foxes to guard the hen house for these and related reasons although the green new deal quite understandably originated as a legislative initiative it cannot be allowed to remain one if it stays as a purely legislative initiative it will die a quick death since there is very little chance that congress will approve it anytime in the near future and none at all so long as trump is in power since he cares not a whit for the future of the planet his only concern is the future of his and his friend s financial investments climate change deniers are so much in love with their pocketbooks that they seem not even to care about the future of their own children the live by the motto after me the deluge however the barrier to the gnd being taken seriously in congress isn t limited to trump or the republicans since many congressional democrats are likewise beholden to big business a case in point is nancy pelosi who has dismissed the gnd as a green dream she is wrong about this the gnd is not a mere fantasy it sets forth a valuable series of goals that should be actively promoted with as much enthusiasm and force as we can muster but doing so will require that we take the gnd beyond the confines of its legislative origin by advancing aspects of it in our communities social organizations and other institutions of civil society it must become taken up revised developed and radicalized as part of a mass social movement that is not simply an arm of one or another government agency third and most important confining the response to global warming within the parameters of the dichotomy of private versus government or market versus state misses a fundamental determinant the growth imperative that is endemic to capitalist societies since capitalism is based on a drive to increase monetary wealth as an end in itself capitalist enterprises face a constant urge to grow and expand regardless of human or natural limits this is why efforts to control capital either through legislative initiatives or changing administrative policies or personnel always prove quixotic they all rest on the assumption that capital s growth imperative is generated by the personifications of capital instead of by capital itself it is not the system s representatives that drives the growth imperative but the growth imperative that drives the representatives the new deal was a clear expression of this it aimed to redistribute greater amounts of wealth to workers and the poor as a way to pump up consumer demand as a way to achieve greater economic growth in other words government was used as a catalyst to spur greater capital accumulation and it worked at least by the time world war ii came around not surprisingly however the new deal was not aimed at protecting the environment except when it came to fostering policies of soil conservation but even there it was with the aim of increasing the productivity of agricultural labor the gnd is a form of ecological keynesianism in that it uses the power of the state to redistribute resources from the fossil fuel industry to renewable energy industries but it does not address how to slow down defer or eliminate capitalism s growth imperative on the contrary it seeks to harness that imperative by using state power to encourage investments in ecological sustainable industries as against ones dominated by fossil fuels that may all seem well and good but let us not forget that retrofitting every building in the u s to become energy efficient as called for in the gnd s stated goals will require an awful lot of steel cement and yes petrochemical based products it is not so clear that this would not add to the global carbon imprint even as carbon emissions come down in other areas moreover if companies can grow their businesses by earning higher profit rates with materials and technologies that are less environmentally beneficial than others they are likely to do so but it is not so obvious that we can blithely assume that the government can be used to block such tendencies since the state is bound up with the logic of capital in a myriad of ways an economic as well as political revolution will clearly be needed to wean society away from its capitalistic growth imperative as ashley dawson has recently argued the goals of the gnd often seem at odds with the means that are singled out to achieve them proposals for genuine ecological and social reconstruction therefore cannot simply substitute renewable energy for fossil fuels while leaving the current global system of spiraling production and consumption untouched instead the growth based presuppositions of the new deal and environmental keynesianism must be challenged what we really need in other words is a crash program to shrink those sectors of the economy that are environmentally destructive while in tandem sectors that do no environmental damage are expanded she adds at the end of the day environmental keynesianism is predicated on economic expansion since new growth means that fresh resources need to be exploited any environmental benefits of more efficient technology and a transition to renewable energy will ultimately be undermined and the biocrisis will intensify i should also add that market based economies based on private ownership of goods and services are not the only ones with a built in growth imperative the same was true for statist communist regimes such as the ussr and china which placed the entire society under the control of the state while engaging in some of the most egregious ecological destruction of any system in world history neither private capitalism nor state capitalism both of which are mainly focused on quantitative output since both adhered to the law of value and surplus value has succeeded in curbing capitalism s inherent growth imperative the world surely needs economic growth and development but one of a radically different type than has defined modern industrial societies up to this point in time leaving this unaddressed poses some major problems when it comes to dealing with global warming what is making it harder to address this issue at the present moment is the new found love affair many on the left are currently experiencing with state directed capital investment as the indigenous environmental network recently stated in emphasizing the fundamental need to challenge and transform the current dominant political and economic systems that are driving forest destruction social injustice and the climate crisis the aoc markey platform risks being an exercise in futility and could actually allow for increased emissions and global warming we demand that fossil fuels be kept underground and that the subsidies and tax breaks that keep the fossil fuel industry viable be shifted towards a clear grassroots based just transition so what would such a just transition look like time is short and we need effective policies now we can t simply wait for capitalism to be overcome to begin promoting them so what can be done in the short term to meet the goals of the gnd and beyond i would like to conclude here with a modest proposal along these lines as noted the gnd lays out the goal to reduce and ultimately eliminate net carbon emissions within 10 years and that is all well and good building upon but taking the gnd further let s envision this every company and business is required to reduce carbon based products or co2 emissions within a specified amount of time if they fail to do so say after one year they face a hefty government penalty if they fail to meet their targets again the ownership right of the business is denied to the employers and the government hands over control of it to the employees please note that this is not nationalization the government itself does not take them over as has occurred in many countries over the last 100 years the employees take them over and democratically run the company as a cooperative enterprise of course these worker owned enterprises would also face mandatory restrictions on co2 emissions and use of carbon based products if they fail to meet them the enterprise is hit with a hefty tax penalty since the employees now own the company and there is no separate management or ownership structure which also means no shareholders of stocks that don t actually work in the enterprise the penalty can be paid only through a reduction in the workers paychecks the employees now have a built in incentive to meet the quotas since otherwise they will earn less wages and benefits and since every enterprise in the country is subject to the same stipulations there is no way to evade the limits on the use of fossil fuel moreover since these are worker owned enterprises in which the proceeds circulate back to the employees fetters are placed upon capital s growth imperative workers might use a share of the proceeds to expand the enterprise but it is just as likely that they will use it to shorten the workweek provide services to workers or simply give themselves a raise worker controlled enterprises tend to dampen at least initially the profit driven imperative of capitalist enterprises since they are based on a different imperative meeting the human needs of its members however this becomes hard to sustain if such changes are restricted to a single country since goods traded on the world market at a lower cost of production will tend to drive worker owned enterprises out of business for this reason karl marx never believed that socialism could exist in one country neither can a viable transition to a carbon free economy since it is a global problem it ultimately needs a global solution worker owned cooperatives and enterprises are great ways to begin to get there but they are not ends in themselves the ultimate end assuming we can mitigate climate change to the point of living long enough to get there is the abolition of value production on a global level nevertheless on the national level an effective transition from a carbon based productive system could be achieved without relying exclusively on either privately owned or governmental agencies the government provides the legal mechanism for transferring ownership of the enterprise from the capitalists to the workers who have the motivation and incentive to care for the environment that the capitalists tend to lack but the government is not in the driver s seat when it comes to controlling the overall process the people themselves do so through forms of association and organization they forge as members of civil society a gnd of this sort would transition from a carbon reliant model of energy production and consumption to a sustainable one based on renewal energy by taking what drives the destruction of nature and natural resources the growth imperative of the logic of capital kali akuno of the climate justice alliance and director of cooperation jackson a mississippi group that grow out of the civil rights movement has referred to this as a solidarity economy anchored by a network of cooperatives and worker owned democratically self managed enterprises my argument boils down to this in order to save and preserve what we have in common the earth we must transition to a form of society that respects the commons it is not about passively waiting for such a society to miraculously arise the commons is already here although hidden from view by the ideologies and structures of existing society by fighting to reclaim the commons which includes not only the land but also the social powers at our disposal to collectively organize our lives without recourse to hierarchical forms of domination we can transition to a new society at the same as saving the earth itself it seems to me that working for this would be worth the effort see draft text for proposed addendum to house rules for the 116th congress of the united states the green new deal s realism by jedehiah britton purdy the new york

the twelve months ended 31 december 2018 full year results 2018 were rescheduled to 24 may 2019 due to the need to complete the comprehensive capital structure review of the group as was announced by the company on 15 april 2019 nyrstar initiated a review of its capital structure the capital structure review in october 2018 in response to the challenging financial and operating conditions being faced by the group as previously announced these conditions included substantial working capital and liquidity outflows experienced during the fourth quarter of 2018 and first quarter of 2019 necessitating the raising of urgent short term funding combined with the group s materially reduced underlying ebitda performance in 2018 and the maturity of certain liabilities during 2019 these factors resulted in the need to reconsider the group s capital structure the capital structure review identified a very substantial additional funding requirement that the group is unable to meet without a material reduction of the group s indebtedness as a consequence the capital structure review has necessitated negotiations between the group s financial creditors in order to develop a deleveraging and funding plan as part of a comprehensive balance sheet recapitalisation alternatives to such a recapitalisation would place the future of the group and its stakeholders at severe risk as at the date of this announcement the company is in the process of implementing the recapitalision the company has received from its auditor and is publishing today an opinion issued in accordance with article 143 2 of the belgian company code non compliance opinion on the basis that certain information requested from the company was not timely delivered the company is working hard to deliver such information to its auditor with the intention that the auditor will issue its audit opinion once it has audited such information the full year results that are published today will then again be published to the market together with the audit opinion that the auditor will then issue group financial overview group gross profit for 2018 of eur 1 118 million was up 4 on 2017 driven by higher zinc production volumes in mining and metals processing and marginally higher zinc and gold prices which were both up 1 partially offset by deteriorating benchmark zinc treatment charge terms and a weaker us dollar against the euro direct operating costs for 2018 of eur 1 014 million increased 16 on 2017 due to higher zinc production volumes in mining and metals processing higher electricity prices at the smelters increased mining costs as a result of the restart of operations at myra falls and the ramp up of mining operations at middle tennessee group underlying ebitda of eur 99 million in 2018 a decrease of 52 on 2017 due to a weakening of the us dollar against the euro lower lead and silver prices a 15 reduction in the benchmark zinc treatment charge higher direct operating costs per tonne of zinc in both mining and metals processing underlying adjustments in 2018 were a total of eur 49 million comprising eur 2 million of embedded derivatives eur 22 million of restructuring expense eur 1 million of m a related transaction expense and eur 30 million of other expenditure relating primarily to the write off of payments that were connected with the divestment of the el toqui mine in chile depreciation depletion and amortisation expense for 2018 of eur 162 million was up 4 year on year in 2018 the company recognised a non cash pre tax impairment loss of eur 99 million 2017 impairment gain of eur 126 million this impairment loss 2017 impairment gain relates fully to pre tax impairment losses on nyrstar s mining assets eur 85 9 million at langlois and myra falls and specific asset write offs in metals processing eur 11 4 million net finance expense including foreign exchange for 2018 of eur 151 million eur 207 million in 2017 primarily due to a net foreign exchange gain of eur 6 5 million in 2018 compared to a loss of eur 59 9 million in 2017 the interest expense in 2018 of eur 128 3 million was higher than in 2017 eur 104 4 million nyrstar recognised an income tax expense for the year ended 31 december 2018 of eur 250 million 2017 income tax benefit of eur 37 million representing an effective income tax rate of 68 9 for the year ended 31 december 2017 481 3 the tax rate is impacted by non recognition of current year losses and by the de recognition of previous losses relating mainly to nyrstar sales marketing ag the us group and the canadian group given it is not probable that these tax losses will be used in the future considering forecast profit projections loss after tax of eur 618 million in 2018 compared to a net profit of eur 47 million in 2017 mainly as a result of the impairment charges related to the write down of the carrying value of the langlois and myra falls mines the partial de recognition of nyrstar sales marketing ag and nyrstar us deferred tax assets due to reduced expected recoverability and the operational losses incurred in 2018 and change of control impacts capital expenditure was eur 229 million in 2018 representing a decrease of 37 year on year driven by a substantial reduction in metals processing from eur 303 million in 2017 to eur 126 million in 2018 with the completion of the port pirie redevelopment and a eur 45 million increase in mining with the restart of the myra falls mine net debt at the end of 2018 at eur 1 643 million excluding the zinc metal prepay was 49 higher compared to the end of 2017 eur 1 102 million at the end of 2017 predominantly due to substantial working capital outflow during q4 2018 due to higher commodity prices no new silver prepays in h2 2018 reduction in non committed letter of credit lines from banking counterparties tightened credit terms with a number of suppliers the reclassification of eur 82 5 million and eur 50 7 million of prepayments for deliveries of silver metal and zinc metal respectively from deferred income to loans and borrowing at 31 december 2018 as the group had no ability to settle by physical delivery of silver metal and zinc metal respectively from its own production and the reclassification of perpetual securities eur 174 9 million at 31 december 2018 from equity to loans and borrowings 6 the net debt inclusive of the zinc metal prepay and perpetual securities at the end of 2018 was eur 1 771 million up 30 compared to the end of 2017 cash balance at the end of 2018 was eur 239 million compared to eur 68 million at the end of 2017 safety health and environment prevent harm is a core value of nyrstar the company is committed to maintaining safe operations and to proactively managing risks including with respect to people and the environment at nyrstar we work together to create a workplace where all risks are effectively identified and controlled and everyone goes home safe and healthy each day of their working life in 2018 we placed particular emphasis on the prevention of hand injuries which account for a large portion of our total injuries a dedicated hand injury prevention program entitled because some tools cannot be replaced was introduced at all operations with the purpose of eliminating unsafe conditions contributing to hand injuries improving tools and personal protective equipment and changing at risk behaviours relevant to hand injuries we also continued the implementation of the process safety management system launched in 2017 and strengthened controls related to hydrogen explosion risks at our smelters the group continued to make significant progress in safety performance no severe irreversible injuries occurred the frequency rate of cases with time lost or under restricted duties dart for the company achieved a new record low of 3 7 an improvement of 7 compared to a rate of 3 9 in 2017 the frequency rate of cases requiring at least a medical treatment rir was

higher energy prices in europe and australia during h2 2018 and the suspension of operations at port pirie in december 2018 partially offset by higher production of zinc copper silver and minor metals marginally stronger year over year gross profit up 1 at eur 863 million in 2018 was mainly driven by higher zinc prices up 1 compared to 2017 which were constrained by the zinc price collar hedging in place at that time and higher production volumes of zinc metal and by products largely offset by a 19 decrease in zinc and lead treatment charge income annual 2018 zinc benchmark treatment charge terms were settled during q2 2018 at approximately 15 below the 2017 terms at usd 147 per tonne of concentrate the total premium gross profit contributions were relatively flat compared to 2017 down 2 driven by marginally higher volumes and relatively flat average realised premia rates by product gross profit contributions were positively impacted by higher gold and sulphuric acid prices and higher production volumes of copper silver gold indium and sulphuric acid compared to 2017 after a fire in q4 2015 the indium plant was re built in 2016 and resumed production by the end of q1 2017 with 29 8 tonnes of indium metal produced in 2017 and a further ramped up production volume of 42 6 tonnes in 2018 direct operating costs increased in 2018 up 12 compared to 2017 at eur 727 million due to increased energy prices in europe and australia and higher production volumes of zinc metal and by products capital expenditure spend in 2018 decreased by 59 on 2017 in line with the revised lower capital expenditure guidance provided for 2018 eur 130 million to eur 140 million compared to 2017 eur 303 million the lower capital expenditure has been driven by the completion of the port pirie

tonnes of zinc metal in 2018 representing a 4 increase on 2017 the increase in zinc metal production year over year was despite the planned maintenance shuts at auby balen clarksville and hobart and was assisted by a lack of material unplanned outages which had impacted production volumes in 2016 and 2017 however zinc and lead metal production was impacted during q4 2018 by lower raw material inventory as a consequence of the company s liquidity constraints lead metal production at port pirie of 160kt was down 7 year over year due to a 38 day planned blast furnace maintenance outage in q2 2018 and a shut of the blast furnace for december 2018 during december 2018 the company chose not to operate the old sinter plant at port pirie in order to further support reducing lead in air emissions which ended the year below the defined limit in addition nyrstar also performed maintenance on the tsl furnace and blast furnace during december 2018 these maintenance shuts were to address

lower level of zinc in concentrate production has been largely due to disappointing production performance of the langlois and the middle tennessee mines and commercial production at the myra falls mine commencing slightly later than had been originally anticipated at the start of the year and the impact of the suspension of ore extraction at year end to address deficiencies identified in compliance orders from the ministry for energy mines petroleum resources in british columbia other developments port pirie redevelopment on 1 february 2019 nyrstar published an operational and financial update which included amongst other items a financial update with regards to the port pirie redevelopment the company provides the following additional clarification with regards to the latest port pirie redevelopment guidance the historic and normalised forecast pro forma underlying ebitda for port pirie hobart and australian metals processing is summarised in the table below pro forma underlying ebitda eurm 2016a 2017a 2018a 2019f 2020f port pirie 8 18 11 38 56 hobart 51 40 31 57 69 australian metals processing 59 58 20 95 125 the total pro forma underlying ebitda guidance of eur 95 million and eur 125 million for australian metals processing in fy 2019 and fy 2020 respectively is the aggregate of the total pro forma underlying ebitda contribution from both the port pirie and the hobart smelters under normalised liquidity and operating conditions this guidance is not incremental or uplift as was the case for the port pirie redevelopment guidance provided before 1 february 2019 and will be materially negatively impacted by the liquidity constraints that have been experienced by the group in q4 2018 and h1 2019 the normalised underlying ebitda guidance is the total pro forma ebitda contribution from the two australian smelters the main factors driving the negative pro forma underlying ebitda result for port pirie in 2018 were a combination of increased costs due to the continued ramp up of the tsl furnace with the parallel operation of the sinter plant and higher energy prices production outage in december 2018 and technical process bottlenecks which reduced the recovery of metal from the feed other macro factors such as lower lead treatment charges and metal prices also negatively impacted the pro forma underlying ebitda at port pirie the allocation of additional costs to residues between 2016 and 2018 has had an impact on the guided pro forma underlying ebitda contribution from the port pirie redevelopment in fy 2019 and to a lesser extent in fy 2020 as was disclosed in nyrstar s press release on 1 february 2019 the processing of historical inventory will provide a cash flow benefit of approximately eur 70 million in fy 2019 if there had not been costs allocated to these residues in 2016 to 2018 the underlying ebitda contribution from port pirie in fy 2019 would be approximately eur 70 million higher the other main reasons for the current lower but still material pro forma underlying ebitda contribution guidance from the port pirie redevelopment as compared to previous guidance are lower metal recovery assumptions as a result of technical process bottlenecks at port pirie which results in a reduction in free metal extracted from all feed processed by port pirie these bottlenecks primarily the slag fumer and copper plant at port pirie were identified in the preparation of the 5 year business plan for the capital structure review process and were incorporated in the pro forma underlying ebitda modelling for australian metals processing and the application of one year of actual operating data instead of the projected data which nyrstar previously needed to rely on as was indicated in the operational and financial update published on 1 february 2019 the metals processing segment profitability of both the australian sites are intrinsically linked by the raw material flows between the two sites and are only possible due to the port pirie redevelopment in the absence of the port pirie redevelopment the hobart and port pirie sites would both be non operational and would not contribute ebitda to the metals processing segment furthermore the pro forma underlying ebitda of the two sites individually but not of australian metal processing overall depends on the internal re charge arrangements between the two sites for internal residues that are used as feedstock at the sites for this reason to provide more clarity the company has decided to show the proforma underlying ebitda for australian metal processing with a breakdown of this figure to port pirie and hobart the total project cost for the port pirie redevelopment was approximately aud 714 million this is inclusive of the feasibility study costs and project management labour costs management changes in connection with the capital structure review process nyrstar announced on 18 january 2019 that mr martyn konig had taken up the role of executive chairman and that mr roman matej had been appointed to serve as interim chief financial officer mr michel abaza the former chief financial officer left the nyrstar group with immediate effect strategic foreign exchange hedges since 2016 nyrstar has entered into a series of 12 month rolling foreign exchange options to hedge the company s monthly exposure related to the direct operating costs denominated in australian dollars aud canadian dollars cad and in euro eur utilising put and call collar structures during the course of 2018 eur usd exposure was unhedged in h1 2018 and hedged on a fixed forward basis at 1 18 in h2 2018 for the aud usd transactional exposure various collars were executed resulting in a weighted average collar of 0 70 to 0 80 for approximately 100 of 2018 for the cad usd transactional exposure on langlois various collars were executed resulting in a weighted average collar of 1 32 to 1 36 for approximately 100 of 2018 transactional cad usd currency exposure for the mining segment was hedged with a fixed forward of 1 32 in 2019 in january and february 2019 nyrstar unwound all of its strategic forward foreign exchange hedges due to the loss of credit lines from the hedge counterparties strategic metal price hedges in h1 2018 nyrstar had in place zinc price collar hedges to protect 70 of total free metal produced at the zinc smelters and north american mines within a price range of usd 2 300 t and usd 3 094 t above and below these prices nyrstar s exposure was limited to 30 of the total free metal produced in h2 2018 nyrstar had in place zinc price collar hedges to protect 50 of total free metal produced at the zinc smelters and north american mines within a price range of usd 2 600 t and usd 3 842 t above and below these prices nyrstar s exposure was limited to 50 of the total free metal produced during 2018 nyrstar continued with its 12 month rolling hedging programme and had hedged the majority of its zinc free metal exposure 150kt for the mining segment at c usd 3 000 t zinc in concentrate production in 2020 was also partly hedged with approximately 16kt hedged at a zinc price of c usd 2 900 t in december 2018 nyrstar terminated all of its strategic metal hedges to provide additional liquidity to the business metal at risk hedging at any given time nyrstar holds metal either as work in progress or finished good inventory that has been priced in but not priced out as this metal remains exposed to fluctuations in the underlying metal price until it is priced out it is called metal at risk the actual metal at risk at any given point in time fluctuates with deliveries of raw materials and production levels as a risk mitigation process nyrstar has always consistently monitored its metal at risk on an ongoing basis and undertaken hedging to mitigate the metal price exposure in what nyrstar refers to as transactional hedging the price of placing these transactional hedges is dependent on whether future or forward prices are higher or lower than current or spot prices as indicated by the shape of the forward underlying metal price curve future prices can be either higher or lower than current prices depending on a range of factors and can change quite rapidly at times the hedges required to hedge nyrstar s metal at risk position are determined by whether the net position is positive meaning nyrstar has more metal priced in than is priced out or alternatively is negative meaning nyrstar has more metal priced out than is priced in as announced by nyrstar on 1 february 2019 it has been continuing to manage tightly its cash and inventory levels and has been evaluating additional measures to improve its liquidity position during the course of march 2019 nyrstar closed out all of its metal at risk hedge positions to release cash collateralized against the credit lines as a consequence of closing out these metal at risk hedges nyrstar realised a one off cash benefit of approximately usd 40 million and is now fully exposed to fluctuations in metal prices for its metal at risk cyber attack in january 2019 nyrstar was subject to a cyber attack certain it systems including email were impacted the cyber attack issue was subsequently contained and resolved the operational and financial impact of the cyber attack on nyrstar s

published monday 27 may 2019 print disqus by david haggith when the stock market s decade long bottom trend becomes its new top trend and then it can t even make it back up to that line as a top trend we re sloughing away now and it can be a long slide to the bottom or endless side winding of big ups and downs that go nowhere just as the market has now gone nowhere for fifteen months yes if you bought in january 2018 when i said the market would fall and held you have made nothing unless you did well on dividends if you continue to hold the odds are you will do worse than nothing but hey you did get to enjoy a heck of a roller coaster ride if on the other hand you sold in january of 2018 and put your money in cash you made 2 a year with worry free smooth sailing every day of the year here s the proof on stocks those who held in january 2018 are right back to where they started of course if you sold at every peak including the january 2018 peak and bought at the bottom of every trough you made a lot of money but that is easily figured out in hindsight hats off to you if you did i hope my predictions fir last year on when the selling points would hit helped you for me i just got out and avoided the turbulent ride to nowhere because i m not as good at knowing the bottoms as i am the tops and i ll let the dust settle one more time the cost of getting high on nothing but hopium a term i borrowed from david stockman as i described in two recent articles is that when the false hope clears the air and sober minds prevail the return to normal can be violent so get ready it s tin hats on and battening down the hatches for a fair bit of volatility for the next few months said tony cousins chief executive of pyrford international the global equities arm of bmo global asset management reuters the china syndrome is a meltdown trade talks now dominate the market in daily surges and tumbles that are increasingly more down than up as the reality that china is not in the least bit ready to cave in begins to chip its way through the denial that i ve been writing about as i said reality was likely soon to do the recent huawei stock dive was a prime example i m sure the trump administration wanted to look tough but they wound up retracting most of their huawei ban in less than three business days to postpone the full ban for 90 days because the stock market s micro chip micro panic was more than trump was willing to risk oops the market sighed relief tuesday when the ban was lifted but then went right back to settling again on wednesday and fell off a little bluff on thursday upward momentum is gone do you think wilbur ross s partial withdrawal of the huawei ban is going to put the market at ease long term or is the gravity of the trade war going to keep sinking in i think investors are just starting to fear the truth this is a long term war of attrition china has no intention of fading in fact president xi jinping gave his people a pep talk this week to remember the long march that the red army made because they are about to be called to another long march for the good of their nation moreover on thursday china s ministry of commerce said that the u s had to reverse its wrong actions before negotiations could continue barrons both the u s and china appear to be preparing for a prolonged period of trade conflict wrote analysts at nomura in a note on the standoff we think domestic pressures and constraints will drive both sides towards further escalation they warned without a clear way forward during an intensifying 2020 u s presidential election we see a rising risk that tariffs will remain in effect through end 2020 reuters remember china carried the global economy for years when the us couldn t china s economy was already a concern before the trade war hit because it has built too many uninhabited cities and roads to nowhere china s recent 200 billion boost to its economy barely evoked a sneeze so the world economy will get no help from china us companies will be hit hard if china retaliates in kind for the banning of huawei which is only on temporarily on ice goldman sachs says apples earnings would take a 29 hit if the chinese retaliate by banning the almighty apple in the same way the us just tried to ban huawei and why wouldn t they since huawei and apple are direct competitors in china of course china has already retaliated for tariffs with a trash ban which has american cities up to their armpits in recyclables they can not longer process according to jp morgan china is is no mood to deal with any of our in their view trashy business right now relations between the u s and china have become so strained that the chance of a chinese firm doing a deal in the u s are virtually nil according to the top tech banker at jpmorgan chase co if you re a chinese company there s no way in hell you re buying anything in the u s not even the trash can for the foreseeable future madhu namburi head of technology investment banking at the new york based bank said bloomberg what a difference now between how analysts were talking about hope for the trade war last week and just the opposite this week did you notice the total pivot the message here however has been consistent and didn t i just note that the level of utter lunacy in the hope a week or two ago meant that reality was likely to break through the nation s peak denial in a hurry trade war reality was better accounted for in these headlines this week than it has been by the mainstream media in past weeks we will beat america out of its wits china trade war song goes viral trader occam s razor on trade war leaves no choice but to be bearish stocks xi warns prepare for new long march as beijing braces for drawn out trade fight if you re still hopeful about trade talks since trump promised again on friday a deal could happen soon just note that even his treasury secretary steven mnuchin said this past week there are no scheduled talks with china on the calendar that hasn t changed the market is slow but is starting to catch on and is starting to price in the long wait markets are pricing in the harsh reality that trade tension is more likely to linger than quickly be resolved as had been the consensus expectation anchoring sentiment until late april in addition the fact that wednesday s fed minutes indicated no rush to cut rates isn t helping nor is seemingly endless brexit uncertainty marketwatch that repricing is likely to be a tidal shift because the market was strongly leaning the other way in pricing although in terms of flow money was leaving the stock market for weeks now pricing has to follow so i think stocks are now in for a rough ride held in the stockade having recovered from the stock plunge that was triggered by huawei s ban when the ban was given some reprieve the trump administration decided to kick the market in the knees again later in the week by banning another major chinese tech company hikvision the world s largest and most oddly named maker of video surveillance equipment after all why not double down on banning chinese high tech after huawei went over so well with the market and with getting china to the table i mentioned earlier this week one of the highlights in my first premium post which laid out the forces that would be driving the economy all year another one of those forces was the stock market while i did not at that time repeat a crash prediction like the one i scored last year i did say the market would bring a huge amount of economic turbulence all year taking stock in the year of the bear the stock markets of this world are only bits and pieces of that vast economic landscape over which these dry cold winds are starting to howl but what happens in the markets has a big impact on the overall economy so the two often are conflated 2018 closed as the worst year in stocks since the great recession with the worst december since the great depression with the s p sitting on the bear barrier and with the nasdaq and russel 2000 decidedly in bear country this has transformed the market s decadal dynamics from buy the dip to sell the rip while this article is about headwinds that face the economy as a whole the stock market itself is already positioned to be a source of major turmoil to the general economy twelve trillion dollars in global stock value has evaporated leaving the world to feel twelve trillion dollars less wealthy that effects the whole economy we are at a tipping point where any further erosion in stocks will start to damage banks which have been hit the hardest so far and other companies to where dominoes start to fall up and down chop is making the market feel woozy and the chop is being made worse by mysterious algorithms with their occulted self taught formulae running the trade this bear cub born out of the worst december since 1931 is already a storm rocking the economy prediction the cub is coming out of hibernation and is about to grow up the first quarter s entirely unmerited euphoric rise in stocks has paved the way for the second quarter s volatility because china trade problems and all the other global problems have not been properly weighted by the market which has chosen to believe a greater trade war will be averted the market is poised for another collapse may has morphed into the month in which the us market is repositioning itself to brace for the reality that the trade war will last longer than investors were originally willing to believe there is a lot of mistaken pricing to rearrange bloomberg reported on thursday that strategists at goldman sachs nomura and jpmorgan chase co are among those who have shifted a sino american trade war to baselineexpectation from just a possibility marketwatch you may recall that i spent the first part of this month pounding my point that the market s position on trade was insane in articles titled sequentially hopium floats and that s how the market got high on friday and market loses its hopium induced high falls four weeks straight i noted that when delirium in the market is that extreme reality is likely to crash in quickly and severely now goldman et al are catching on to how foolish the market really was you see you can read it here first or read it from the experts a week or two later in the mainstream press when they start to get it that is the way it has been since the lead up to the great recession even this friday showed evidence that denial is still strong though we see it breaking up when trump merely tweeted without offering a shred of reason that the trade war could end in a deal soon stocks shot up at the opening only to slumber away the day to lower levels as perhaps a little more sanity prevailed even one of the mainstream writers i like surprised me on friday by writing there has been no evidence of irrational exuberance in the markets i won t name him because he is generally right on but seriously how much more evidence could you ever find and what could be a greater peak of irrationality than bulls not seeing the market is irrational even as they are starting to fall off its summit trump was clearly just vainly talking the market up because he wears the market as his badge of success there was no basis for believing his statement a hundred times before he has been dead wrong about the trade war being easy but once again that didn t matter at all because the market heard what it wanted to hear that is the very definition of irrational to act on something because it is what you wanted to hear even though it has no basis in fact trump gave no reasons to back up his proffered hope insanity is doing the same thing you have done and that has failed over and over believing the results this time will be different the facts are trump s batting a thousand for being wrong about how soon a deal will come as noted in this article china stated many times this week that it won t be soon if they can help it trump has them really pissed off and they are not about to roll over and lose face they ve made that clear but the hopium addled market found trump more convincing because it wanted to even on friday chinese state media accused the u s of seeking to colonize global business with moves against huawei and other chinese technology companies there was no word from either side on progress at a daily briefing friday foreign ministry spokesman lu kang accused american politicians he didn t name of fabricating various lies based on subjective presumptions and trying to mislead the american people ap nevertheless the whole stock market did finally seem to be catching on this week the dow closed for its fifth consecutive down week while the other two major indices closed for their third consecutive weeks down for the dow this became the longest period of weekly losses since 2011 in the belly of the great recession numerous analysts wrote that this week s downward move happened because of repositioning toward the reality of the trade war and so the month of may is now shaping up to be the worst may in seven years again since the great recession the stumble for stocks across the globe comes as investors are placing bets that a u s china trade pact between the world s largest economies may take far longer than originally anticipated a view that is causing a more deliberate reassessment of prospects for corporate earnings and global economic growth marketwatch trade concerns weighed on appetite for stocks spurring demand for government paper gao feng spokesperson for china s ministry of commerce said trade talks could only continue if the u s corrected its actions and that the u s crackdown on chinese companies was threatening global supply chains marketwatch investors are still coming to grips with the idea that we re going to be living with some kind of tariffs and they definitely aren t pricing in 25 tariffs on all chinese goods he added so it is one step forward two steps back because the market is still trying to figure out the impact of all this recent weak economic data this week out of europe japan and the u s will prove a headwind for stock investors going forward wrote tom essaye president of the sevens report focus remains on the u s china trade conflict but global growth is the real concern and we need to see global and u s data stabilize and soon otherwise trade will no longer be the market s primary concern he wrote marketwatch yields across the board on us treasuries plummeted on thursday as more money fled from stocks to treasuries knocking the dow down another 400 points shortly after its open on thursday taking out its 200 day moving average as an important and now former line of support while the nasdaq plunged 2 intraday 157 points the dow tried near the end of the day to recover above its 200 day moving average but failed to make the grade back to bondage back in january when i wrote that premium post i noted that higher yields in treasuries had been sucking money out of stocks which was in turn creating some equilibrium by bringing yields down a little now money is pumping out of stocks like blood out of a broken artery because the market is getting its legs shot out from under it so often that the red china flow of money out of stocks is lowering bond yields again the ten year on thursday dropped to its lowest yield 2 322 in a year and a half causing a renewed inversion between three month treasuries and the ten year and bringing the much watched 2s over 10s down to its narrowest 16 basis point spread away from inversion concern became wide spread because all treasury yields from the 10 year down are now lower than the fed s most basic fed funds rate another form of inversion that has typically preceded major recessions as you can see the last times that happened was before the great recession and the dot com bust us stall speed not far off i noted in a previous article that while us gdp growth for the first quarter looked good in its headline number it was actually quite weak below the surface now deloiite touche offers a similar perspective the us government released its first estimate of economic growth in the first quarter and the headline number was very strong 1 but financial markets were not terribly impressed 2 why because despite a strong headline number the details of the report revealed weakness in the economy specifically the report showed that important components of the gdp such as consumer spending and business investment grew only modestly rather growth was driven by inventory accumulation deloitte insigths remember that i noted here last summer how gdp growth which had come in over 4 in the second quarter of 2018 would fall in the third quarter because the growth was due mostly to inventory building in the face of the tariffs then the third quarter came in just above 3 i had also said the third quarter would still get some help from inventory building because the first phase of tariffs was not implemented until partway through the third quarter so i said the next quarter would be notably worse predictably gdp in the fourth quarter dropped down into the pathetic 2 range there may again be some inventory building going on in other industries now that trump is talking seriously of imposing tariffs on all other industries that do business with china at much higher rates but that lift resulting in inventory builds does not represent true growth it just brings future sales that were going to happen anyway forward in order to save money on tariffs that will again result in a decline in later quarters from which that business has been drawn another prediction we re going to start seeing gdp growth fall away in a morose manner after the next phase of tariffs are in place remember that the first round of tariffs affected far fewer products and were priced at only 10 and were mostly not passed on to the consumer the next round affects everything from china at more than double the last tariffs 25 and will mostly be passed on to consumers while economists are predicting one a small decline in gdp based on numbers i predict a much larger one because economist are not factoring in the knock on effect all of this will have on business uncertainty resulting in holding off any expansion plans on stocks because investors hate uncertainty and the repercussion on the wealth effect when stocks fall and on consumer sentiment as a result of all of that confirmation a day after i wrote the above paragraph as i m working on this article over the course of a few days jp morgan revised its gdp forecast down from 2 25 growth to 1 0 which they explained as follows the april durable goods report was bad particularly the details relating to capital goods orders and shipments coming on the heels of last week s crummy april retail sales report it suggests second quarter activity growth is sharply downshifting from the first quarter pace the economists wrote cnbc meanwhile the atlanta fed has its estimate set at 1 3 thursday s ppi manufacturing and services data was also surprisingly weak the markit manufacturing purchasing managers survey that came out this week also fell to a nine and a half year low at 50 5 from 52 6 in april that is the lowest it has been since 2009 service industries which had been keeping things up as manufacturing dropped now also fell new orders declined for the first time since august 2009 due to weaker demand and hesitancy among clients both domestic and international to place orders according to ihs markit the fall in new business was only fractional but signaled a marked turnaround from the solid rise seen in april the firm concluded in a report as demand fell service companies which employ about four fifths of all u s workers also scaled back on hiring employment growth fell to a 25 month low companies are less optimistic of a rise in output over the coming 12 months with business expectations falling to their lowest measurement since july 2012 barrons new home sales also dropped 6 9 mom compared to an anticipated drop of 2 2 just as existing home sales had earlier this week however year on year new home sales were up though existing home sales were down year on year not only were home sales down 14 months in a row but they were expected to actually be up 3 because of interest rates that are now lowering again economists were wrong by a long stretch again the housing picture was slightly mixed this month but overall still a drag on the economy home depot growth slowed down because housing is doing poorly and so its stock fell a little home depot of course chose to blame wetter than usual weather alas weather never seems perfect enough for numbers to simply be what they are home depot also noted a 1 billion impact due to tariffs lowe s shares fell a lot 12 no doubt to be blamed of wet weather like home building stores kohl s shares sank 11 due to a fall in sales that was worse than expected and couldn t as easily be blamed on wet weather penny s was down again looking like it plans to join sears in a race to see who can bury their heads in the peat at the bottom of the swamp first the venerable nordstrom dumped 9 3 after reporting worse than already dismal expected earnings and declining sales ford announced additional layoffs 7 000 globally after the layoffs it already announced tesla of course is falling off the planet for its own internal reasons and has been downgraded by morgan stanley from their worst case scenario of 97 per share to ten bucks a share tesla doesn t matter they are simply the delorean s of the modern age blain wrote if you own one stick in a garage and wait tesla was good while it lasted his concern lies with the broader impact of tesla s failure have you ever watched a house of cards collapse sometimes a corner or a side comes down and it can be sort of fixed he said sometimes the whole thing just gets blown away marketwatch his point not that tesla could come down like a house of card but that tesla s demise could bring down the entire high tech house of cards because just like the house of cards that came down in the dot com crash high tech stock values are again built on the faulty premise that tech companies never have to make profits because they are just so sexy blain pointed out that the modern disruptive tech price model could ultimately be undone if one of its high profile companies like tesla implodes what s mdt he explained the thinking behind it with this quote we don t have to pay dividends or make profits because we are a disruptive company that s triggered a paradigm in demand and made ourselves a monopoly therefore it s all in our stock price the mdt model requires the stock to retain the confidence of the capital markets to keep it capitalised tesla has now lost that confidence he said adding that there will be massive consequences in the tech sector should mdt collapse in other words if when faith in mdt is lost the whole u s market which takes its cue from tech will feel the pain and that s when this will get very interesting us stocks almost hilariously are still being called a bull market by some truly unsavvy people yet this bull has bucked along to nowhere for 15 months now since its january 2018 plunge even factoring in its recent meteoric rise now falling again after it became a bear market in december all year we ve seen more money moving out of stocks than in if you like riding actual bulls in rodeos this is real fun when will the rally stop we can t take any more rallies like this they re killing us in death by a thousand stock certificate paper cuts don t worry it s over of course there is always the possibility of being saved soon by a war time economy while my recession by sometime this summer prediction at the start of the year could be premature we are certainly moving in a recessionary direction i knew that was a brazen prediction when i made it because no one else was making it but it still has wings to fly a brexit without an exit except for may brexit keeps getting uglier this week in particular and it is tearing britain apart as it has already torn prime minister theresa may apart who was forced to resign in tears and sobs on friday or get ripped out by her roots she staked her administration entirely on an endlessly failing attempt to create a brexit without an exit her government collapsed in pieces around her over the past week because her charade failed when her final attempt at getting a deal was shredded her latest and most significant defector leader of the house of commons andrea leadsom brought may s house down by writing in her resignation on thursday i do not believe we will be a truly sovereign united kingdom through the deal that is now proposed a second referendum would be dangerously divisive undermining our union there has been such a breakdown of government processes a complete breakdown of government t responsibility euro zoned out this week s brexit uproar played out fiercely in eu elections that were taking place in the uk at the same time brexiteer nigel farage s new brexit party and the hard right ukip united kingdom independence party surged into the lead across the uk it appears the eu government is about to take a turn toward a rise in power of nationalists fed up as electorates are with the imposed failures of globalists within the narrower eurozone germany s deutsche bank one of the world s largest and oldest banks and also the us presidential bank of choice is within a sneeze now of declaring bankruptcy share prices have declined over 40 in the past year and they were already low putting it in a state comparable to wamu washington mutual within days of that bank s collapse deutsche bank s stocks on thursday dropped to 7 07 a share which these days beats 7 37 max deutsche s ceo promised thursday to make painful cuts to keep the bank flying and keep his job as captain of the wobbly aircraft that is on a flight path to ground nothing to see here folks just the hindenburg bouncing around near pointy objects and torches the ifo institute for economic research s german business sentiment indicator fell while surveys of eurozone based purchasing managers underlined the lingering weakness in the manufacturing sector it would appear the eurozone is suffering from the deterioration of us china trade relations because those are hurting china economically they are hurting european exports to china one might have thought they would benefit european trade with china but not so far oil all slicked up with nowhere to go oil also hit a bad patch this week too skidding down into the high 50s per barrel oil took the sharpest one day plunge it has seen in months while the cause was due to a build in oil inventory the build was said to be due to a drop in demand not due to increased output the drop in demand was said to be related to the trade war and the global economy as i wrote in my premium post at the start of the year prices below 50 a barrel cause companies in the oil industry to collapse and jobs to be lost in those regions and stocks in all those companies to plummet and their bankers to shudder we ve just entered that danger zone where low oil can cause the economic engine to seize up one has to also consider the causeof falling oil prices this time around it is not due to opec over production in an attempt to shut out us shale drillers as it was last time but due to declining demand so the prices are indicative of what is already happening to the general economy which will begin to show up in gdp numbers though oil climbed out of that for awhile this year that has now proved spot price on barron s summarized the current oil price decline into the 50s as follows the escalated trade war and global economic slowdown have been raising concerns thatdemand could weaken which seem to have overshadowed the supply constraints caused by opec s production cuts and rising tensions in iran libya and venezuela west texas

the last ideological political and military confrontation was between the united states and the soviet union during the cold war years ending with the dissolution of the soviet union in 1991 since then the u s has been the sole remaining superpower with international politics transformed from a bipolar to a multipolar system in the last few decades there have been several reasons for american dominance in the world first since the collapse of the soviet union there has been no superpower with equal political economic and military footing to the u s america has showed itself an advocate of values such as democracy freedom and human rights which are to spread american dominance everywhere there are nations that see america needing to share or impose these values globally there are no other powers that dare to begin a face to face standoff against the u s in any way at least until the past couple of years however the last few decades have seen the u s losing these privileges since russia has mostly recovered from the collapsed heap of what was once the soviet union in addition china has evolved out of the ruins of internal strife the u s has been called a bullying hegemonic power by many countries due to its unwelcome america first policies moreover american influence and power in international structures such as the united nations the world bank and so on are seen as interference international organizations have long been used as strong american policy instruments toward other countries so as to spread its influence and power as an example there are many countries such as russia china turkey iran north korea and venezuela that have faced political economic and military sanctions what about the chinese position there have been many questions about china s future role in global politics the west is aware of chinese influence across the globe through the chinese economic agendas it is even claimed that there are hidden agendas in china s economic expansion such as the chinese debt trap policy for china to continue its expansion the growth of china s economic power plays a crucial role from asia to africa and to europe china has initiated its own style of international organizations such as the asian infrastructure investment bank billions in chinese economic assistance grants and loans have spread to countries such as cambodia sri lanka and sudan in return for chinese assistance countries that fail to return the loans may find other alternative ways to close their debts to china according to some experts these alternative ways create suspicion about the truth behind china s role in assisting developing countries and that chinese assistance should be more transparent therefore middle or smaller countries have been trying to find other ways to break american and chinese domination through other possible strategies such as alignment with opposing or emerging powers in this regard the u s russia china and japan have been alternative poles against each other s dominance while turkey saudi arabia and iran have been regional alternate countries in the middle east there have been times when the policies of the u s and china sometimes have bothered some regional and international nations the americans have had brushes against its allies such as turkey and some nations in the european union in addition the chinese have had problematic issues with some countries such as malaysia these troubling policies have been increased during the trump presidency the attitudes of trump in washington and xi jinping the assertive policies of xi in beijing is it possible to break the hegemonic bullying behaviors of big powers by creating new alliances i would like to explain turkey s situation against the u s and malaysia s case against china both turkey and malaysia are developing countries and have political and economic vulnerabilities however the way that turkey and malaysia have allied against or toward bigger powers may be a domino effect over the world in dealing with hegemonic or bullying or bigger countries but at a heavy price turkey s campaign through the use of diplomatic channels turkey has relayed its concerns to the united states in regard to its policies on a couple of issues including the gülenist terror group fetö and the terrorist pkk and its syrian wings the people s protection units ypg and the democratic union party pyd and the syrian crisis these issues are relevant to turkish national security turkey has the right to ask any means of assistance from its allies including the u s unfortunately the stance of the u s in regard to turkish security issues has frustrated turkey so turkey has turned to russia to secure turkish borders later a successful turkish military campaign operation olive branch eliminated terrorist groups including daesh from the syrian city of afrin additionally president trump continued his intimidating discourse against turkey in several incidents such as the incident involving the american pastor brunson and the conflict regarding the pkk ypg pyd president trump tweeted will devastate turkey economically if they hit kurds in response to trump s tweet the turkish presidential communications director fahrettin altun tweeted turkey is not the enemy of kurds but their protector turkey does not have any issue with the kurds our only issue is the pkk terror group and its extensions in syria the pyd and ypg are terror organizations in addition turkish presidential spokesman i̇brahim kalın emphasized the same remarks unfortunately the trump administration does not want to understand that turkey s fight is not with the kurds but against the terrorist foundations threatening its security along the syrian border the u s shows the world that it fights against global terrorism while at the same time ignoring turkey s worries about pkk affiliated terrorist groups that are attacking a nato ally turkey however these brushes with the u s cost turkey a heavy economic price due to the trump administration s unfair and open economic operations against the turkish economy for example the dollar had briefly climbed to over tl 7 a few months ago while there was a 60 loss in the turkish lira s value against the dollar in 2018 malaysian policy malaysia s previous barisan national bn government had close relations with china the latter investing billions of dollars in malaysia in addition china planned to undertake infrastructure projects worth billions of dollars in malaysia however the relationship with china has been placed under review by the new government in putrajaya pakatan harapan which came to power in 2018 the current malaysian government has shown discomfort with several chinese projects such as the 20 billion cost of the east coast rail link ecrl and the natural gas pipeline in sabah due to their excessive cost to the malaysian economy negotiations lasted for months despite china reducing its cost for the ercl due to malaysian discomfort in the end malaysia and china agreed that the project would cost rm 44 billion down rm 21 billion from the initial figure of rm 65 however these suspensions or cancellations of various chinese projects by malaysia resulted in negative effects toward the tourism sector which saw a slump of 35 in chinese travelers during their weeklong national day break in 2018 furthermore mahathir the prime minister of malaysia warned against a new version of colonialism through economic means during his visit to china in 2018 he said you don t want a situation where there s a new version of colonialism happening because poor countries are unable to compete with rich countries in terms of just open free trade these kinds of remarks by mahathir sparked controversy and some circles called him anti chinese however he denied those allegations in subsequent remarks consequently malaysia felt the need for an alternative country for its national interests hence malaysia under the leadership of mahathir has directed efforts toward japan in a political and economic sense as a new alternative to china in reducing the cost of the ercl by over 30 it seems malaysia has collected the fruits of this maneuvering policy in dealing with china additionally following the mutual beneficial deal on the ecrl it is expected that the number of chinese tourists coming to malaysia would be 3 5 million and 5 million in 2019 and 2020 respectively a rise from 3 million in 2018 relations between the two look on track after all moreover mahathir was one of the speakers at the belt and road initiative bri forum this year ph d candidate in international relations at the university of malaya malaysia

by david haggith when the stock market s decade long bottom trend becomes its new top trend and then it can t even make it back up to that line as a top trend we re sloughing away now and it can be a long slide to the bottom or endless side winding of big ups and downs that go nowhere just as the market has now gone nowhere for fifteen months yes if you bought in january 2018 when i said the market would fall and held you have made nothing unless you did well on dividends if you continue to hold the odds are you will do worse than nothing but hey you did get to enjoy a heck of a roller coaster ride if on the other hand you sold in january of 2018 and put your money in cash you made 2 a year with worry free smooth sailing every day of the year here s the proof on stocks those who held in january 2018 are right back to where they started of course if you sold at every peak including the january 2018 peak and bought at the bottom of every trough you made a lot of money but that is easily figured out in hindsight hats off to you if you did i hope my predictions fir last year on when the selling points would hit helped you for me i just got out and avoided the turbulent ride to nowhere because i m not as good at knowing the bottoms as i am the tops and i ll let the dust settle one more time the cost of getting high on nothing but hopium a term i borrowed from david stockman as i described in two recent articles is that when the false hope clears the air and sober minds prevail the return to normal can be violent so get ready it s tin hats on and battening down the hatches for a fair bit of volatility for the next few months said tony cousins chief executive of pyrford international the global equities arm of bmo global asset management reuters the china syndrome is a meltdown trade talks now dominate the market in daily surges and tumbles that are increasingly more down than up as the reality that china is not in the least bit ready to cave in begins to chip its way through the denial that i ve been writing about as i said reality was likely soon to do the recent huawei stock dive was a prime example i m sure the trump administration wanted to look tough but they wound up retracting most of their huawei ban in less than three business days to postpone the full ban for 90 days because the stock market s micro chip micro panic was more than trump was willing to risk oops the market sighed relief tuesday when the ban was lifted but then went right back to settling again on wednesday and fell off a little bluff on thursday upward momentum is gone do you think wilbur ross s partial withdrawal of the huawei ban is going to put the market at ease long term or is the gravity of the trade war going to keep sinking in i think investors are just starting to fear the truth this is a long term war of attrition china has no intention of fading in fact president xi jinping gave his people a pep talk this week to remember the long march that the red army made because they are about to be called to another long march for the good of their nation moreover on thursday china s ministry of commerce said that the u s had to reverse its wrong actions before negotiations could continue barrons both the u s and china appear to be preparing for a prolonged period of trade conflict wrote analysts at nomura in a note on the standoff we think domestic pressures and constraints will drive both sides towards further escalation they warned without a clear way forward during an intensifying 2020 u s presidential election we see a rising risk that tariffs will remain in effect through end 2020 reuters remember china carried the global economy for years when the us couldn t china s economy was already a concern before the trade war hit because it has built too many uninhabited cities and roads to nowhere china s recent 200 billion boost to its economy barely evoked a sneeze so the world economy will get no help from china us companies will be hit hard if china retaliates in kind for the banning of huawei which is only on temporarily on ice goldman sachs says apples earnings would take a 29 hit if the chinese retaliate by banning the almighty apple in the same way the us just tried to ban huawei and why wouldn t they since huawei and apple are direct competitors in china of course china has already retaliated for tariffs with a trash ban which has american cities up to their armpits in recyclables they can not longer process according to jp morgan china is is no mood to deal with any of our in their view trashy business right now relations between the u s and china have become so strained that the chance of a chinese firm doing a deal in the u s are virtually nil according to the top tech banker at jpmorgan chase co if you re a chinese company there s no way in hell you re buying anything in the u s not even the trash can for the foreseeable future madhu namburi head of technology investment banking at the new york based bank said bloomberg what a difference now between how analysts were talking about hope for the trade war last week and just the opposite this week did you notice the total pivot the message here however has been consistent and didn t i just note that the level of utter lunacy in the hope a week or two ago meant that reality was likely to break through the nation s peak denial in a hurry trade war reality was better accounted for in these headlines this week than it has been by the mainstream media in past weeks we will beat america out of its wits china trade war song goes viral trader occam s razor on trade war leaves no choice but to be bearish stocks xi warns prepare for new long march as beijing braces for drawn out trade fight if you re still hopeful about trade talks since trump promised again on friday a deal could happen soon just note that even his treasury secretary steven mnuchin said this past week there are no scheduled talks with china on the calendar that hasn t changed the market is slow but is starting to catch on and is starting to price in the long wait markets are pricing in the harsh reality that trade tension is more likely to linger than quickly be resolved as had been the consensus expectation anchoring sentiment until late april in addition the fact that wednesday s fed minutes indicated no rush to cut rates isn t helping nor is seemingly endless brexit uncertainty marketwatch that repricing is likely to be a tidal shift because the market was strongly leaning the other way in pricing although in terms of flow money was leaving the stock market for weeks now pricing has to follow so i think stocks are now in for a rough ride held in the stockade having recovered from the stock plunge that was triggered by huawei s ban when the ban was given some reprieve the trump administration decided to kick the market in the knees again later in the week by banning another major chinese tech company hikvision the world s largest and most oddly named maker of video surveillance equipment after all why not double down on banning chinese high tech after huawei went over so well with the market and with getting china to the table i mentioned earlier this week one of the highlights in my first premium post which laid out the forces that would be driving the economy all year another one of those forces was the stock market while i did not at that time repeat a crash prediction like the one i scored last year i did say the market would bring a huge amount of economic turbulence all year taking stock in the year of the bear the stock markets of this world are only bits and pieces of that vast economic landscape over which these dry cold winds are starting to howl but what happens in the markets has a big impact on the overall economy so the two often are conflated 2018 closed as the worst year in stocks since the great recession with the worst december since the great depression with the s p sitting on the bear barrier and with the nasdaq and russel 2000 decidedly in bear country this has transformed the market s decadal dynamics from buy the dip to sell the rip while this article is about headwinds that face the economy as a whole the stock market itself is already positioned to be a source of major turmoil to the general economy twelve trillion dollars in global stock value has evaporated leaving the world to feel twelve trillion dollars less wealthy that effects the whole economy we are at a tipping point where any further erosion in stocks will start to damage banks which have been hit the hardest so far and other companies to where dominoes start to fall up and down chop is making the market feel woozy and the chop is being made worse by mysterious algorithms with their occulted self taught formulae running the trade this bear cub born out of the worst december since 1931 is already a storm rocking the economy prediction the cub is coming out of hibernation and is about to grow up the first quarter s entirely unmerited euphoric rise in stocks has paved the way for the second quarter s volatility because china trade problems and all the other global problems have not been properly weighted by the market which has chosen to believe a greater trade war will be averted the market is poised for another collapse may has morphed into the month in which the us market is repositioning itself to brace for the reality that the trade war will last longer than investors were originally willing to believe there is a lot of mistaken pricing to rearrange bloomberg reported on thursday that strategists at goldman sachs nomura and jpmorgan chase co are among those who have shifted a sino american trade war to baseline expectation from just a possibility marketwatch you may recall that i spent the first part of this month pounding my point that the market s position on trade was insane in articles titled sequentially hopium floats and that s how the market got high on friday and market loses its hopium induced high falls four weeks straight i noted that when delirium in the market is that extreme reality is likely to crash in quickly and severely now goldman et al are catching on to how foolish the market really was you see you can read it here first or read it from the experts a week or two later in the mainstream press when they start to get it that is the way it has been since the lead up to the great recession even this friday showed evidence that denial is still strong though we see it breaking up when trump merely tweeted without offering a shred of reason that the trade war could end in a deal soon stocks shot up at the opening only to slumber away the day to lower levels as perhaps a little more sanity prevailed even one of the mainstream writers i like surprised me on friday by writing there has been no evidence of irrational exuberance in the markets i won t name him because he is generally right on but seriously how much more evidence could you ever find and what could be a greater peak of irrationality than bulls not seeing the market is irrational even as they are starting to fall off its summit trump was clearly just vainly talking the market up because he wears the market as his badge of success there was no basis for believing his statement a hundred times before he has been dead wrong about the trade war being easy but once again that didn t matter at all because the market heard what it wanted to hear that is the very definition of irrational to act on something because it is what you wanted to hear even though it has no basis in fact trump gave no reasons to back up his proffered hope insanity is doing the same thing you have done and that has failed over and over believing the results this time will be different the facts are trump s batting a thousand for being wrong about how soon a deal will come as noted in this article china stated many times this week that it won t be soon if they can help it trump has them really pissed off and they are not about to roll over and lose face they ve made that clear but the hopium addled market found trump more convincing because it wanted to even on friday chinese state media accused the u s of seeking to colonize global business with moves against huawei and other chinese technology companies there was no word from either side on progress at a daily briefing friday foreign ministry spokesman lu kang accused american politicians he didn t name of fabricating various lies based on subjective presumptions and trying to mislead the american people ap nevertheless the whole stock market did finally seem to be catching on this week the dow closed for its fifth consecutive down week while the other two major indices closed for their third consecutive weeks down for the dow this became the longest period of weekly losses since 2011 in the belly of the great recession numerous analysts wrote that this week s downward move happened because of repositioning toward the reality of the trade war and so the month of may is now shaping up to be the worst may in seven years again since the great recession we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us the stumble for stocks across the globe comes as investors are placing bets that a u s china trade pact between the world s largest economies may take far longer than originally anticipated a view that is causing a more deliberate reassessment of prospects for corporate earnings and global economic growth marketwatch trade concerns weighed on appetite for stocks spurring demand for government paper gao feng spokesperson for china s ministry of commerce said trade talks could only continue if the u s corrected its actions and that the u s crackdown on chinese companies was threatening global supply chains marketwatch investors are still coming to grips with the idea that we re going to be living with some kind of tariffs and they definitely aren t pricing in 25 tariffs on all chinese goods he added so it is one step forward two steps back because the market is still trying to figure out the impact of all this recent weak economic data this week out of europe japan and the u s will prove a headwind for stock investors going forward wrote tom essaye president of the sevens report focus remains on the u s china trade conflict but global growth is the real concern and we need to see global and u s data stabilize and soon otherwise trade will no longer be the market s primary concern he wrote marketwatch yields across the board on us treasuries plummeted on thursday as more money fled from stocks to treasuries knocking the dow down another 400 points shortly after its open on thursday taking out its 200 day moving average as an important and now former line of support while the nasdaq plunged 2 intraday 157 points the dow tried near the end of the day to recover above its 200 day moving average but failed to make the grade back to bondage back in january when i wrote that premium post i noted that higher yields in treasuries had been sucking money out of stocks which was in turn creating some equilibrium by bringing yields down a little now money is pumping out of stocks like blood out of a broken artery because the market is getting its legs shot out from under it so often that the red china flow of money out of stocks is lowering bond yields again the ten year on thursday dropped to its lowest yield 2 322 in a year and a half causing a renewed inversion between three month treasuries and the ten year and bringing the much watched 2s over 10s down to its narrowest 16 basis point spread away from inversion concern became wide spread because all treasury yields from the 10 year down are now lower than the fed s most basic fed funds rate another form of inversion that has typically preceded major recessions as you can see the last times that happened was before the great recession and the dot com bust us stall speed not far off i noted in a previous article that while us gdp growth for the first quarter looked good in its headline number it was actually quite weak below the surface now deloiite touche offers a similar perspective the us government released its first estimate of economic growth in the first quarter and the headline number was very strong 1 but financial markets were not terribly impressed 2 why because despite a strong headline number the details of the report revealed weakness in the economy specifically the report showed that important components of the gdp such as consumer spending and business investment grew only modestly rather growth was driven by inventory accumulation deloitte insigths remember that i noted here last summer how gdp growth which had come in over 4 in the second quarter of 2018 would fall in the third quarter because the growth was due mostly to inventory building in the face of the tariffs then the third quarter came in just above 3 i had also said the third quarter would still get some help from inventory building because the first phase of tariffs was not implemented until partway through the third quarter so i said the next quarter would be notably worse predictably gdp in the fourth quarter dropped down into the pathetic 2 range there may again be some inventory building going on in other industries now that trump is talking seriously of imposing tariffs on all other industries that do business with china at much higher rates but that lift resulting in inventory builds does not represent true growth it just brings future sales that were going to happen anyway forward in order to save money on tariffs that will again result in a decline in later quarters from which that business has been drawn another prediction we re going to start seeing gdp growth fall away in a morose manner after the next phase of tariffs are in place remember that the first round of tariffs affected far fewer products and were priced at only 10 and were mostly not passed on to the consumer the next round affects everything from china at more than double the last tariffs 25 and will mostly be passed on to consumers while economists are predicting one a small decline in gdp based on numbers i predict a much larger one because economist are not factoring in the knock on effect all of this will have on business uncertainty resulting in holding off any expansion plans on stocks because investors hate uncertainty and the repercussion on the wealth effect when stocks fall and on consumer sentiment as a result of all of that confirmation a day after i wrote the above paragraph as i m working on this article over the course of a few days jp morgan revised its gdp forecast down from 2 25 growth to 1 0 which they explained as follows the april durable goods report was bad particularly the details relating to capital goods orders and shipments coming on the heels of last week s crummy april retail sales report it suggests second quarter activity growth is sharply downshifting from the first quarter pace the economists wrote cnbc meanwhile the atlanta fed has its estimate set at 1 3 thursday s ppi manufacturing and services data was also surprisingly weak the markit manufacturing purchasing managers survey that came out this week also fell to a nine and a half year low at 50 5 from 52 6 in april that is the lowest it has been since 2009 service industries which had been keeping things up as manufacturing dropped now also fell new orders declined for the first time since august 2009 due to weaker demand and hesitancy among clients both domestic and international to place orders according to ihs markit the fall in new business was only fractional but signaled a marked turnaround from the solid rise seen in april the firm concluded in a report as demand fell service companies which employ about four fifths of all u s workers also scaled back on hiring employment growth fell to a 25 month low companies are less optimistic of a rise in output over the coming 12 months with business expectations falling to their lowest measurement since july 2012 barrons new home sales also dropped 6 9 mom compared to an anticipated drop of 2 2 just as existing home sales had earlier this week however year on year new home sales were up though existing home sales were down year on year not only were home sales down 14 months in a row but they were expected to actually be up 3 because of interest rates that are now lowering again economists were wrong by a long stretch again the housing picture was slightly mixed this month but overall still a drag on the economy home depot growth slowed down because housing is doing poorly and so its stock fell a little home depot of course chose to blame wetter than usual weather alas weather never seems perfect enough for numbers to simply be what they are home depot also noted a 1 billion impact due to tariffs lowe s shares fell a lot 12 no doubt to be blamed of wet weather like home building stores kohl s shares sank 11 due to a fall in sales that was worse than expected and couldn t as easily be blamed on wet weather penny s was down again looking like it plans to join sears in a race to see who can bury their heads in the peat at the bottom of the swamp first the venerable nordstrom dumped 9 3 after reporting worse than already dismal expected earnings and declining sales ford announced additional layoffs 7 000 globally after the layoffs it already announced tesla of course is falling off the planet for its own internal reasons and has been downgraded by morgan stanley from their worst case scenario of 97 per share to ten bucks a share tesla doesn t matter they are simply the delorean s of the modern age blain wrote if you own one stick in a garage and wait tesla was good while it lasted his concern lies with the broader impact of tesla s failure have you ever watched a house of cards collapse sometimes a corner or a side comes down and it can be sort of fixed he said sometimes the whole thing just gets blown away marketwatch his point not that tesla could come down like a house of card but that tesla s demise could bring down the entire high tech house of cards because just like the house of cards that came down in the dot com crash high tech stock values are again built on the faulty premise that tech companies never have to make profits because they are just so sexy blain pointed out that the modern disruptive tech price model could ultimately be undone if one of its high profile companies like tesla implodes what s mdt he explained the thinking behind it with this quote we don t have to pay dividends or make profits because we are a disruptive company that s triggered a paradigm in demand and made ourselves a monopoly therefore it s all in our stock price the mdt model requires the stock to retain the confidence of the capital markets to keep it capitalised tesla has now lost that confidence he said adding that there will be massive consequences in the tech sector should mdt collapse in other words if when faith in mdt is lost the whole u s market which takes its cue from tech will feel the pain and that s when this will get very interesting us stocks almost hilariously are still being called a bull market by some truly unsavvy people yet this bull has bucked along to nowhere for 15 months now since its january 2018 plunge even factoring in its recent meteoric rise now falling again after it became a bear market in december all year we ve seen more money moving out of stocks than in if you like riding actual bulls in rodeos this is real fun when will the rally stop we can t take any more rallies like this they re killing us in death by a thousand stock certificate paper cuts don t worry it s over of course there is always the possibility of being saved soon by a war time economy while my recession by sometime this summer prediction at the start of the year could be premature we are certainly moving in a recessionary direction i knew that was a brazen prediction when i made it because no one else was making it but it still has wings to fly a brexit without an exit except for may brexit keeps getting uglier this week in particular and it is tearing britain apart as it has already torn prime minister theresa may apart who was forced to resign in tears and sobs on friday or get ripped out by her roots she staked her administration entirely on an endlessly failing attempt to create a brexit without an exit her government collapsed in pieces around her over the past week because her charade failed when her final attempt at getting a deal was shredded her latest and most significant defector leader of the house of commons andrea leadsom brought may s house down by writing in her resignation on thursday i do not believe we will be a truly sovereign united kingdom through the deal that is now proposed a second referendum would be dangerously divisive undermining our union there has been such a breakdown of government processes a complete breakdown of government t responsibility euro zoned out this week s brexit uproar played out fiercely in eu elections that were taking place in the uk at the same time brexiteer nigel farage s new brexit party and the hard right ukip united kingdom independence party surged into the lead across the uk it appears the eu government is about to take a turn toward a rise in power of nationalists fed up as electorates are with the imposed failures of globalists within the narrower eurozone germany s deutsche bank one of the world s largest and oldest banks and also the us presidential bank of choice is within a sneeze now of declaring bankruptcy share prices have declined over 40 in the past year and they were already low putting it in a state comparable to wamu washington mutual within days of that bank s collapse deutsche bank s stocks on thursday dropped to 7 07 a share which these days beats 7 37 max deutsche s ceo promised thursday to make painful cuts to keep the bank flying and keep his job as captain of the wobbly aircraft that is on a flight path to ground nothing to see here folks just the hindenburg bouncing around near pointy objects and torches dark towers the inside story of the world s most destructive bank the ifo institute for economic research s german business sentiment indicator fell while surveys of eurozone based purchasing managers underlined the lingering weakness in the manufacturing sector it would appear the eurozone is suffering from the deterioration of us china trade relations because those are hurting china economically they are hurting european exports to china one might have thought they would benefit european trade with china but not so far oil all slicked up with nowhere to go oil also hit a bad patch this week too skidding down into the high 50s per barrel oil took the sharpest one day plunge it has seen in months while the cause was due to a build in oil inventory the build was said to be due to a drop in demand not due to increased output the drop in demand was said to be related to the trade war and the global economy as i wrote in my premium post at the start of the year prices below 50 a barrel cause companies in the oil industry to collapse and jobs to be lost in those regions and stocks in all those companies to plummet and their bankers to shudder we ve just entered that danger zone where low oil can cause the economic engine to seize up one has to also consider the causeof falling oil prices this time around it is not due to opec over production in an attempt to shut out us shale drillers as it was last time but due to declining demand so the prices are indicative of what is already happening to the general economy which will begin to show up in gdp numbers though oil climbed out of that for awhile this year that has now proved spot price on barron s summarized the current oil price decline into the 50s as follows the escalated trade war and global economic slowdown have been raising concerns that demand could weaken which seem to have overshadowed the supply constraints caused by opec s production cuts and rising tensions in iran libya and venezuela west texas intermediate crude futures registered its largest one day decline in 2019 falling 5 7 to settle at 57 91 per barrel barrons so everything is sliding now in the direction i ve said it would be in my first premium post of the year and the velocity of the avalanche is growing daily
the comparisons were too difficult to ignore even for donald trump within a day of scott morrison s stunning election victory the us president rang to congratulate him noting his surprise win was in a similar vein to his own before switching to his preferred communication vehicle twitter congratulations to scott on a great win he tweeted but that s where the bonhomie may well end for the increasingly hostile contest that has become global trade in recent months has begun to impact not just financial markets but the global economy in april the international monetary fund cut its global growth forecast to 3 3 per cent the slowest pace since the global financial crisis and down from january s prediction of 3 5 per cent last tuesday the organisation for economic co operation and development cut its forecast to 3 2 per cent as tensions flared between the two economic superpowers wall street shuddered again last week finishing lower for the fifth week in succession the longest losing streak since 2011 oil prices slumped on thursday as investment banks cast further doubts on the global economy the us china trade war hasn t hurt australia yet reuters jonathan ernst none of this bodes well for the newly installed morrison government adding to a raft of domestic challenges that saw little coverage during the election campaign for the moment the escalating battle between the pair has had little impact in australia but as one of the world s most trade exposed nations any us slowdown will hurt us the fact that the target for us action is our biggest trading partner only adds to that potential outcome winners and losers mr trump puts a great deal of store in winning so far he believes he s in front on the china conflict after whacking tariffs on us200 billion 288 billion worth of chinese imports and threatening to hit another us325 billion china has retaliated with tariffs on us110 billion worth of american goods the reason for that difference is precisely what mr trump complains of america imports far more from china than it exports but while the president boasts about the billions of extra revenue dollars flowing in from the tariffs the new york federal reserve last week crunched the numbers and concluded that american consumers were bearing the brunt of the tariffs to the tune of about us100 billion a year that s because tariffs essentially are a tax and while they are levied on goods when they enter the country it is consumers ultimately who pay from america s perspective while the tariffs are small in comparison to the size of the economy they hit poorer citizens the hardest who tend to cut spending elsewhere where they become particularly dangerous is where retaliatory action is taken just as china has done with hits to us agricultural products like soybeans the great american isolation there s an influential and growing school of thought that mr trump s tariff tirade has been a long time coming china may have been accepted into the international trade club but it hasn t played by the rules the argument goes and it s time it was pulled into line the president even has support at home from leading democrats like senate majority leader chuck schumer that argument may hold sway if the president was targeting china and china alone but he isn t mr morrison may face some tough choices unless mr trump and president xi can reach a trade compromise ap martinez monsivais rather than marshalling support from his closest allies to help discipline the middle kingdom mr trump has systematically set about alienating those with which america has relied upon for diplomatic and defence support early on in his tenure he slapped penalties on canadian steel threatened the european union and germany in particular over car imports and defence budgets and went head to head with mexico just this weekend on a trip to japan he made his displeasure known about japan s trade surplus there often are legitimate reasons for trade imbalances a subtlety that appears lost on the president as he threatens friends and foes alike all of this points to an american retreat from global trade and a diminished if not destabilising role in world affairs will china capitulate not likely at least not yet last week this little ditty popped up on chinese social media platform wechat loading youtube content supposedly written by a retired government official the song trade war set to the tune of an anti japanese song from a 60s film called tunnel warfare went viral across china its release coincided with direct threats from washington to ban chinese telco huawei clearly beijing sees the escalating tensions both as worrisome and an opportunity to milk some jingoistic fervour against a common enemy this is where things could get sticky for australia while there could be benefits for us as various trade items are diverted with for example australian rare earths producer lynas potentially opening up new markets in the us if china refuses supply but a weaker china will hit our export earnings and our revenues china s growth is the slowest in almost three decades hit by a combination punch of a slump in domestic demand and slower exports courtesy of mr trump chinese car manufacturers in western china have laid off vast numbers of workers since late last year to counter beijing has kicked in an extra us300 billion stimulus package that only adds to its already mountainous debt the promise for australia the timing for all this couldn t be worse for the morrison government which is confronting mounting evidence of a far weaker economy than portrayed during last month s federal budget just two days after the election reserve bank governor philip lowe performed the previously unthinkable bluntly declaring at a televised event that the rba board would consider cutting rates at its next meeting clearly concerned by a combination of declining housing prices an uptick in arrears a rising trend of negative equity from recent home buyers and a sudden lift in unemployment his declaration was accompanied by a loosening in home lending restrictions by the banking regulator mr lowe also called on governments both state and federal to lift infrastructure spending to boost employment among the flagging construction sector that could be expensive financially and politically in the face of a slowing global economy however the new government may face some tough choices unless mr trump and president xi reach a lasting compromise it may well be that next financial year s planned surplus will have to be sacrificed just to keep the economy ticking along
opinion there s no question that many farmers are struggling this year with incomes down and bankruptcies up though some of the more dire reports on the farm sector recorded in the media are exaggerated what is indisputable is that prices for major commodities such as corn are on a downward trend and are significantly lower than they were less than a decade ago when prices were at or near record highs it s natural to blame any declines in the farm economy on the tariff war with china the trade dispute has certainly hurt the farm sector as the higher chinese tariffs on american agriculture has reduced demand for their crops especially the farm belt states of the midwest even president trump himself has admitted that the trade war has hurt farmers which is why he wants to send some of the money raised by his tariffs to the farmers directly but something else is going on here that is negatively impacting the farm states that existed before any trade war the daily headlines of a tariff war has overshadowed what might be an even bigger and longer term problem for farmers tight monetary policy at the federal reserve which has squeezed commodity prices across the board over the past year an index of all commodity prices including everything from oil to copper to timber to soybeans has recorded a price reduction of roughly 10 percent eight of the 10 major agriculture commodities have been falling in price why is that happening it isn t good weather or bumper crops because the losses are being felt across regions and hitting almost all the major crops one explanation for the farmers woes is tight money we know from historical experience that when money is loose and the printing presses shower the economy with cheap dollars commodity prices soar as in the 1970s when grocery bills soared when money is excessively tight as it is now commodity prices fall when almost all of the commodities from corn to copper to timber start to fall in price at the same time it is a pretty good signal that our monetary system is out of whack farmers are often the frontline victims of commodity deflation the extreme example of course was the great depression when farm bankruptcies skyrocketed with thin profit margins to begin with in a highly competitive global food market many farmers are being unnecessarily hurt by having to swallow an 8 percent reduction in prices following a similar decline last year of course free markets not government subsidies or fed monetary policy should determine which farmers should stay in business and which will fail the way to reduce artificial price fluctuations in the agricultural sector of our economy and get quick relief for our farmers is for the fed to increase dollar liquidity into our high flying american economy this would be an effective and overdue way for our nation s farmers to experience greater profits this reflation policy makes sense now given that the threat of economy wide inflation at this stage is minimal to non existent the dollar is strong thanks to world demand for dollars and the growth in output due to tax cuts and deregulation are pushing out the supply of goods and services which is deflationary not inflationary there isn t a whiff of inflation in consumer prices except for education and health care the wall street journal reports that the fed has undershot its inflation target 2 percent growth in the consumer price index for four months running the fed is hesitant to cut interest rates because it believes wrongly that a booming economy causes inflation which is a long ago dead keynesian idea a modest reflation would put some extra juice into the farm sector this would put added pressure on the chinese to make a deal with the trump administration that deal would press for the elimination of china s punitive tariffs on our farm products and open up markets to other made in america products this would also counter the brazen chinese strategy of meddling in american elections by intentionally targeting tariffs on farm products produced by rural voters in key battle ground states in the 2020 elections america has the most productive farmers in the world so a trade agreement which ratchets down tariffs on both sides of the pacific would greatly benefit the farm belt combine that with a monetary policy by the fed that allows the economy to continue to grow without inflation would help our farmers and workers across all industries and without one dime of taxpayer assistance stephen moore a columnist for the washington times is an economic consultant with freedomworks and was a senior economic adviser to the trump campaign his latest book co authored with arthur laffer is trumponomics inside the america first plan to revive our economy
capitalism works ravenous capitalism doesnâ t for more than a century capitalism has proven to be successful in expanding the efficient manufacture of goods and agricultural products increasing jobs and incomes promoting technological innovation decreasing poverty and improving the general welfare of humans globally by contrast socialism and communism with its centrally planned economy and collectivism historically have produced misery war need and poverty through oppressive totalitarian governments super hedge fund manager ray dalio the president of bridgewater associates the very successful and largest hedge fund in america recently released a thoughtful and timely report stating that capitalism is broken pointing to among other things the gross income disparity between high and low earners ray dalio s judgment of broken capitalism relates to his observation that the vast majority of wages going to the top 5 wage earners does not benefit the overall economy destabilizes society and is destructive to capitalism the fact that a true blue capitalist wrote the article should alert industrialists globalists bankers and all capitalists that perhaps capitalism with american characteristics has veered off its previously successful course capitalism does work but ravenous capitalism is indeed self destructive the bounty of capitalism must be shared not only with its owners or investors but also with its other significant partners the nation s workers democracy and capitalism have expanded in the 20th century largely due to america s successful example and its persistent replacement of socialist or left wing rulers in countries around the globe installing democratic governments and promoting market concepts communism during this same time period has withered to the point of extinction while socialism surprisingly appears to have grown significantly among democratic and capitalist nations part of the problem in understanding the ebb and flow of these economic systems is related to the changing definition of words for example communism was the end point of socialism with all the means of production owned by the centrally controlled totalitarian state today hardly anyone in the world would propose that the socialism of the day will end in such communism so the definition of these words and the systems themselves have changed and they keep evolving today for a more comprehensive view of capitalism and socialism see subversion and constructive synthesis of capitalism and socialism president trump at his 2019 state of the union message stated that america would never become a socialist nation that of course depends on the definition of this word when president roosevelt created the social security system and large national infrastructure programs such as building a national water dam and electric generation system and started welfare programs by a strict definition of the word of that time america was already on its way to becoming a socialist country president trump and most people today have a different understanding of socialism however it is clear that never before has socialism had so much support from our younger generation and never before have there been so many convinced socialists in congress in this context president trump s comments are sounding an important alarm similar to that provided by paul revere s ride at the time of america s revolution this article highlights the reasons why capitalism with american characteristics is in trouble and why ravenous capitalism is self destructive an approach is suggested which can return capitalism to its healthier days an approach which does not penalize companies nor government a less ravenous and more humane capitalism would increase the well being of our citizens reduce socialist demands and build a stronger more secure america corporate profit one effective way to measure the success of capitalism is to track the rise of corporate profits over a period of time the following table shows after tax profits for corporations filing with federal reserve economic data base what we can see from the preceding graph is that with the exception of a dramatic decline in earnings in the 2007 2009 period and some periods of relatively flat earnings 1995 2001 and 2012 2018 that corporate profits have grown steadfastly over time corporate earnings over 2012 2018 period hovered around 1 8 trillion annually dividends to shareholders a measure of a corporations comfort level with respect to its continuing earnings power and its ability to have necessary capital for future operations is determined by the amount its directors are willing to pay to shareholders as dividends a young faster growing company may pay no dividends to shareholders at all since its capital can be effectively used in building its business by contrast a more mature company with all the production capacity needed already in place will pay out a significant portion of its earnings to shareholders in the form of a cash dividend in the marketplace the stock of a younger company will appreciate even without paying any dividends because it is growing faster and expanding its market as a company matures and slows its growth its stock price appreciation will slow but the payment of increasing dividends adds to the total return of the investor to make an attractive long term investment the following chart shows a rising growth of dividends to shareholders over decades note the similarities of two charts showing a reduction in dividend payments during the 2012 2118 period when earnings declined however dividend payments have persistently increased over time during the 2012 2018 period annual dividends increased to average about 1 1 trillion but rose to over 1 2 trillion in 2018 indicating a dividend payout ratio to earnings of about 67 traditionally corporations have paid out 33 50 of earnings as dividends with the balance being retained to increase capital a high dividend payout ratio indicates that a company has more than sufficient capital for its ongoing business needs corporate share repurchases in recent years america s corporations have repurchased their own stock in the marketplace by record amounts of course managements and directors are easily influenced by investment bankers to repurchase stock since it will invariably initially increase the market price of any company announcing or implementing such a program company directors management and employees owning shares and options would all benefit some companies will even borrow funds to finance a repurchase program whether a company s own funds or financing is used to implement a stock repurchase program it is also a strong indicator that a company has too much capital for its own operations stock repurchases once were disallowed as they were deemed to manipulate the market but industry attempts to deregulate reversed this rule in 1982 the following chart courtesy of birinyi associates and goldman sachs shows the amount in dollars used for stock repurchases in recent years it appears that since 2012 corporate share buybacks have averaged about 600 billion per year while data from the previous chart shows that approximately 1 1 trillion was paid out in dividends the total of these two numbers is close to the 1 8 trillion total earnings of corporations companies such as apple exxon sears and general electric have previously implemented share repurchase programs over years share repurchase programs can and do encounter problems since markets can decline independently or despite a large purchase of stock as just one example general electric once considered a highly rated one decision almost an heirloom stock expended 40 billion to repurchase stock about two to four years ago which is now trading at about one fourth its repurchase prices with hindsight that money could have been spent more effectively wage history of the american worker it is already a well worn statistic that the american wage earner has not seen his inflation adjusted wages increase since the early 1970s during this long time period industrial productivity has increased dramatically as corroborated by the impressive increase in earnings over this period the following table produced by the pew research center shows that inflation adjusted wages since 1972 and today are essentially unchanged given the dramatic increases in production efficiencies and corporate offshoring of jobs reduction in pension guarantees to employees over these many decades confirms that corporations are not sharing equitably their great and growing prosperity with employees avoidance in sharing this corporate prosperity with workers is shortsighted wages of capitalism should be high such that workers can afford to individually build enough savings for their independent health care and retirement wages also must be high enough so that this economic system s workers can afford to purchase all the products it produces which insures the capitalist system s continuing success today the financial frailty of today s common worker is such that he fears for having or keeping a stable living wage job is justly suspicious that neither a corporate pension nor social security will be able to provide adequately for retirement as historically low interest rates detract from savings accumulation and pension fund viability while continued expansion of fiat money reduces future purchasing value we propose that it has been the lack of adequate wage increases failure of the bretton woods monetary system after 1971 and subsequent federal reserve s pervasive and persistent monetary inflation which diminished the effective income of the american family s breadwinner that required women to join the workforce led families to resort to devastating credit card debt and to borrow against their home equity which has shoved those exposed families over an economic cliff it has created this huge chasm between financially comfortable the top 30 of wage earners and the bottom 70 the disparity between this lower 70 of wage earners and the top 1 5 is now so wide as to create a realistic risk of violent revolt as we are witnessing already today in france with the yellow vests the following chart constructed by dent research from data of the st louis federal reserve demonstrates that as the rate of corporate profits has been rising relative to gdp the rate of wages relative to gdp has been declining note that the decline of wages as a fraction of gdp has been steady since 1971 while earnings fluctuate much more year to year it is also clearly visible that earnings as a fraction of gdp has been steadily increasing the average u s gdp of the last five years is 18 9 trillion applying an average rate of 9 5 from the chart to the gdp number yields earnings of 1 8 trillion contrariwise applying a 9 25 rate to the 2018 gdp of 20 5 trillion yields profits of 1 9 trillion so the profit to gdp numbers of this chart confirm the numbers of our previous corporate profits chart if we now apply the wages and salaries ratio from the above chart we get a good estimate of wages and salaries applying a 43 rate from the chart to the 2018 gdp yields the estimate of wages and salaries of 8 8 trillion these numbers do not require decimal point precision to prove a concept so this number is precise enough evolving socialism changing capitalism communism and socialism originally took hold because the common people were dirt poor and revolutionaries simply promised them more a better future however having little by itself would not be able to create the animus for armed revolution it took realization that country leaders lived lives of unimaginable riches in comparison to common citizens as serfs in order to rise up against their oligarchs today s american citizen may have a cell phone computer television an automobile and even a house so it appears difficult to characterize this person as being dirt poor however these items are ubiquitous even among the less prosperous in our society today and represent relatively inexpensive technologies which didn t exit a hundred years ago but when the homeowner is without a stable or full time job has built up a large credit balance which based on his income is not repayable while he doesn t know how to make the next payment on his mortgageor or his auto loan and no more reductions in expenses even in the purchase of food supply can be made the gap between today s common citizen and the top one percenters is for practical purposes as vast a gulf as that between the peasant and the king of a century ago so the danger of violent revolution is becoming real particularly as the internet is making these income disparities known to everyone who has a computer or smart phone both capitalism and socialism have changed over decades there is no support among common folk for communism and its totalitarian despotic rule socialism has many forms as demonstrated by that practiced in sweden venezuela china and europe perhaps the most interesting of these is that now practiced in china it self professes to be socialism with chinese characteristics china is really practicing state led capitalism an amalgam of communist political rule and government supported capitalism it has private ownership of means of production rich people and managers figuring out how to improve profit margins and gain market share in building their new silk road the belt and road initiative or in its business development in africa or latin america no proselytization of communism or socialism has been observed that represents an amazing communist socialist evolution europe immediately after wwii through today has had large political influence from socialist parties that influence over the last half century has been exercised in promoting attractive living wages to europe s citizens rather than the classical uprising to overthrow traditional government by force its socialist welfare has promoted wages which rise with profits and programs for health education and retirement few citizens from sweden norway or germany could be convinced to claim that their welfare program is destructive to their capitalist economies indeed it would be more precise to observe that sweden norway and germany are capitalist nations which simply subordinate maximum profits to providing adequate wage income such that the high tax rates they do pay can provide a financial safety net to all working citizens sweden has constantly been cited as an example of successful socialism given that sweden is a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary democracy has a stock exchange private ownership of property does not have a despotic central government and no impediments for disgruntled citizens to move out perhaps sweden has been grossly mischaracterized could it not more accurately be considered as an example of successful capitalism capital with humanistic caring and compassion or capital humanism does it really matter whether sweden s government and economic system is characterized as socialism with swedish characteristics capitalism with swedish characteristics humane capitalism non totalitarian socialism or anything else the system works in that people have a real voice in its government and vote for the benefits it wants for its people the country consistently ranks high when measured for comparable global citizen happiness capitalism as it is practiced in south korea japan and latin america is also distinguished from that practiced in america the important observation to be made is that capitalism with american characteristics is now killing the goose that lays the golden eggs for their capitalists a federal reserve study indicating that one third of our middle class cannot afford a 400 emergency expenditure or that half of americans are just one paycheck away from financial hardship or disaster in the wealthiest nation in world history should ring some alarm bells indicating that something in its economic system is broken record level homelessness is another symptom of a severe economic or social malaise an over indebted consumer who has questionable job security with income lagging behind asset inflation cannot long support capitalism repairing capitalism as we reward company owners with shareholder dividends we should reward also our other significant partners company employees by paying to them a bonus out of after shareholder dividend earnings of the company this is done by a company first reporting its normal financial results in terms of earnings and dividends to shareholders unchanged from current practices then the company declares a special variable annual bonus to employees out of the remaining after tax earnings of the corporation to provide an added incentive for corporations to pay this bonus that portion of earnings to be paid out to workers is not previously taxed to the corporation this action is attractive to the corporation in that it allows it to report marginally higher earnings and is revenue neutral to the government since this income tax will be paid by the income earner indeed the government may gain moderately as individual income tax rates are higher than corporate rates stock repurchases do affect markets but often that money is simply wasted since after a stock repurchase program the stock can still decline below the repurchase price since stock repurchase is an indication of over abundant capital and a stock repurchase program does manipulate the market at the time of repurchase we should go back to the rule that stock repurchases are not legal such funds are better spent by paying them out in a normalized annual amount of a presumed stock repurchase plan spread out over several years as a special annual bonus to company employees such payments of variable annual bonuses to company employees does not penalize companies which demonstrably have an over abundance of capital yet such added income to employees would have a meaningful effect to their financial stability would improve overall economic activity and would do a lot for repairing capitalism recall that wages and salaries of workers currently is about 8 8 trillion note that corporate repurchases have recently averaged about 600 billion per year then consider that dividends have averaged 1 1 trillion out of corporate earnings of 1 8 trillion reflecting a higher than historically normal dividend payout ratio as earnings continue to grow the dividend payout ratio can be brought down to historic norms providing even more potential funds for employee bonuses it appears that the current level of 8 8 trillion in wages and salaries could be increased anywhere from 0 7 1 5 trillion 8 0 17 0 at a 50 dividend payout ratio on current earnings that large increase in worker wages and salaries would create a quick leap to a higher earnings plateau improve cash flow to workers and rehabilitate capitalism quickly the present federal reserve policy towards low interest rates accommodates our profligate government spending for the global hegemon this policy extends the period of time our government doesn t have to declare bankruptcy but perversely it destroys accumulation of individual savings and underfunds all existing pension funds severely endangering our capitalist economic system if the federal reserve would raise interest rates by favoring america s citizens instead of its government such that workers can accumulate meaningful interest to savings and corporations investment managers and insurance companies can partially rehabilitate their vastly underfunded pension plans then american capitalism would be back on the right track perhaps we could become again that exceptional nation financial markets would respond positively to such changes because it would be recognized as an overall boost to our economy middle class workers with increased earnings and savings also would be able to invest some funds in the markets helping maintain or expanding current price earnings multiples conclusions american capitalism in its solitary decades long quest to increase corporate earnings has eviscerated the country s middle class citizens as wages have not increased with corporate profitability while there are many other issues to address as well income inequality is the major issue in this report we have shown that the dramatic rise in corporate profits since the 1970s has been partially at the expense of their industrial partners the wage earning worker over decades this gradual shift has increased worker wages at rate that has been insufficient for people to prosper and created unintended or undesirable consequences to previously successful capitalism this approach to capitalism is failing creating many economic and social distortions and is thereby has been self destructive to capitalism ray dalios words capitalism is broken is insightful and correct redirecting over abundant corporate capital away from stock repurchases and using such funds to increase worker wages via a bonus is one possible way after the payment of corporate dividends to shareholders utilizing a portion of the remaining corporate earnings to pay a variable bonus to workers is another component tax law adjustments can make such payouts attractive to both corporations and government the payouts themselves are attractive and necessary to the nation s workers and fundamental to rehabilitate capitalism with american characteristics and to have capitalism survive raymond matison mr matison was an institutional investor

at last count china held slightly more than 1 trillion in u s treasury securities one fear has been that should china and the united states engage in an economic war as they clearly are now those dollars could become a weapon against us the chinese would sell dollars in foreign exchange markets raising u s interest rates and perhaps triggering a serious american recession that might spread elsewhere is this possible well yes but it s a long shot let s see how a dollar dump might work china would sell a huge portion of its treasury stake this in turn would reduce the price of treasurys which like stocks are traded on the open market and raise their interest rates consider a simplified example to see how this works assume a 1 000 bond with a 5 percent interest rate it guarantees a payment of 50 a year but if the bond s price has fallen to 800 that same promised 50 produces an interest rate of 6 25 percent advertisement higher interest rates would then percolate through the u s economy affecting consumer and business spending if the reaction were powerful a recession might result spending would weaken unemployment would rise and confidence would fall china s dumping of treasurys would escalate the economic conflict between the two countries it would signal a second fundamental break with the post world war ii global economic system with the first being president trump s aggressive use of tariffs but two practical caveats arise first the chinese might be victims of their own policies a global recession would reduce exports compounding the effect of the 25 percent u s tariffs on 200 billion of chinese exports the dollar s exchange rate might fall while china s renminbi might rise the shift in exchange rates would weaken china s competitive position china s sale of some u s treasurys would also reduce the value of the treasurys that aren t sold advertisement why would the chinese inflict these costs on themselves good question selling treasurys is perhaps the least potent weapon in its arsenal of potential retaliatory strikes against u s trade sanctions says economist eswar s prasad of cornell university he doubts that china will do it the second caveat is the opposite of the first it is that china might sell lots of treasurys and very little would happen interest rates would hardly budge already china s current account surplus a broad measure of trade has been shrinking and this implies that china is accumulating fewer dollars than before but that hasn t sent interest rates soaring they remain historically low the rate on 10 year treasurys is less than 2 5 percent one explanation is that the world seems to have a huge appetite for u s treasury securities which are called safe assets by financial experts this means that despite all of the united states economic and political problems investors don t believe the united states would default on its government debt treasurys are a good place to leave idle funds advertisement the various possible consequences have led many observers to doubt that china would deliberately try to undermine the u s treasury market this is how capital economics a forecasting firm judged the prospects share this article share it wouldn t be sensible if such a fire sale drove up their yields china would lose money on its remaining holdings it might also lead to greater instability in emerging financial markets this includes china which the authorities there want to avoid david smick editor of the international economy magazine echoes this appraisal dumping treasurys poses too many risks including a global recession it s a declaration of war not just against the united states but the world he says i don t think the chinese are going to do that advertisement whatever happens the china story is undergoing significant revision not so long ago its economy was growing at a rate of 10 percent a year now that s slipped to about 6 percent and many economists expect it to decline further derek scissors of the american enterprise institute thinks it could drop to 4 5 percent this year and as low as 1 percent to 2 percent within a decade there are many obstacles to faster growth debt is one although it spurred growth in the past borrowing in china has now reached levels that look increasingly unsustainable from 2005 to 2018 loans to chinese nonfinancial corporations went from 112 percent of gross domestic product to 152 percent of gdp reports the institute of international finance an industry research and advocacy group the resolution of this struggle is unclear but if nothing else the collision between the trump administration and beijing heralds a new era in u s china relations both countries are caught in contradiction being in conflict and dependent on each other at the same time
an in depth look at ways to redistribute wealth to end the u s s multigenerational legacy of white supremacy fact the 147 000 median wealth of a white household is 41 times the 3 600 median wealth of a black family many americans may believe that in the wake of the country s first black president we had moved past race based inequality many others may see the divide as the result of individual behavior choices like getting an education or saving carefully as co authors of the report ten solutions to bridge the racial wealth divide we disagree our research points to a multigenerational legacy of white supremacy in asset building and wealth concentration a history that includes the african slave trade jim crow and systematic discrimination in wealth building opportunities right on up to the present that trend is getting worse not better between 1983 and 2016 the median net worth for black americans actually went down by 50 percent paired with a growing latinx population that also lags far behind whites in household wealth the u s s overall median wealth trended downward over those decades even as median white wealth increased these trends go hand in hand with the rigging of the overall economy over the last 30 years the wealthiest 20 percent of households have captured almost 97 4 percent of all increases in wealth leaving only scraps for the rest to repair these breaches between black and white as well as between the rich and the rest we must restore the wealth of communities that were literally used as a foundation of the nation s wealth while being prohibited from building their own as ta nehisi coates wrote in his groundbreaking case for reparations in the atlantic reparations are the price we must pay to see ourselves squarely it won t be an easy task but it s by no means insurmountable historical precedent even though it s hard to imagine a thoughtful discourse about reparations in the u s today there are actually several useful precedents in our own history a major reason for the growing wealth divide isn t that white people worked harder it s that the government worked harder for them in 1988 president ronald reagan formally apologized for the u s internment of japanese americans during world war ii and under the civil liberties act paid 20 000 in reparations each to over 800 000 victims over 1 1 billion was initially allocated with additional appropriations later in 1995 florida provided restitution for a violent 1923 pogrom against black residents of rosewood florida which included compensation and university scholarships for rosewood descendants at the international level germany has paid over 89 billion in reparations to victims of the holocaust german officials continue to meet with groups of survivors and their advocates to revisit guidelines and ensure that survivors receive the benefits there s no reason to believe a similarly viable program couldn t be designed for americans living with the ongoing effects of slavery violence and discrimination or we should add genocide we believe there s a similarly compelling case for reparations to america s first nations that deserves its own treatment understanding white affirmative action for white people to understand the racial wealth divide requires some demythologizing of the dominant narrative of wealth creation in 1965 a century after the emancipation proclamation african americans were still largely excluded from programs that helped build middle class wealth in the decades following world war ii the u s made unprecedented public investments to subsidize debt free college education and low cost mortgages these wealth building measures benefited millions of households nearly all of whom were white and virtually none of whom were black immigrants with european heritage directly and indirectly benefited from this foundation of social wealth and white supremacy during these same years people of color faced overt discrimination in mortgage lending and separate and unequal school systems throughout the united states barred from traditional forms of credit african americans were pushed into wealth stripping scams like contract for deed mortgages where a missed payment would lead to eviction and loss of all equity so while many whites were able to board an express train to middle class wealth between 1945 and 1975 people of color were left waiting for a train that never showed up as a result of government subsidies white homeownership rates steadily rose to as high as 75 percent in 2005 while black rates peaked at 46 percent the same year a 30 point gap that persists to this day since then subsequent generations of white families have been able to help their children buy homes and go to college through what sociologists call the intergenerational transmission of advantage while black families lacked the financial stability to do the same a major reason for the growing wealth divide then isn t that white people worked harder it s that the government worked harder for them who pays still prosperity is hardly shared uniformly by white americans many white people with little in the bank to show for their racial advantage may not support the concept of reparations if they never owned slaves and neither did their ancestors why should they as taxpayers have to pay the key point is that unpaid labor by millions of people of african heritage was a foundation of the social wealth in the united states immigrants with european heritage directly and indirectly benefited from this foundation of social wealth and white supremacy even if they never had anything to do with slavery but that doesn t mean all white people would bear equal responsibility for paying out indeed the reparations discussion today is taking place in the context of four decades of growing inequality real wages have been stagnant for over half the population of any race as wealth has concentrated in fewer hands who use that wealth to buy political power tax cuts and regulatory favors that increase their wealth even further today the wealthiest 400 billionaires in the u s have as much wealth as the entire african american population and over a quarter of all latinx households combined these same trends have eroded economic security for millions of white households too we have the method and the means to fund a reparations program only the political will is missing the bill for reparations then can go first to the mostly white ultra wealthy americans who ve benefited most from this inequality with that in mind we propose several concrete mechanisms to fund a national reparations trust fund the first is a graduated tax on wealth and inherited assets sen elizabeth warren for instance has proposed a 2 percent annual tax on wealth over 50 million with the rate rising to 3 percent on wealth over 1 billion such a proposal would generate an estimated 2 75 trillion over the next decade a progressive tax on inheritances over 10 million meanwhile would also generate substantial revenue almost entirely from extremely wealthy families that have benefited from generations of white advantage in wealth building second we propose hefty penalties on wealthy individuals and corporations that hide their wealth offshore or in complicated trusts to avoid taxation part of the austerity many of our communities face is the result of the estimated 8 to 10 percent of all global wealth that s now hidden offshore a tax on wealth and stiffer penalties on tax dodging would have beneficial impacts on the larger economy for all workers not just those who face racial exclusion a third source of financing would be to redesign existing wealth building subsidies the current u s tax code provides over 600 billion a year in tax subsidies such as homeownership subsidies and retirement savings programs that are skewed dramatically to the wealthiest households shifting these expenditures toward wealth building programs for low wealth people particularly those of color would have a monumental impact in short we have the method and the means to fund a reparations program only the political will is missing the road to reparations the first political step toward reparations would be for congress to create a national commission to wrestle with the legacy of slavery and propose a program of reparations and reconciliation year after year starting in 1989 rep john conyers d michigan filed legislation to create this commission hr40 but it was never voted out of committee the bill s name alludes to unfulfilled promises of 40 acres and a mule made to formerly enslaved africans in the late 1800s rep sheila jackson lee d texas has carried on as the new lead sponsor since representative conyers s retirement the commission could investigate many different forms of reparations in his book the debt what america owes to blacks randall robinson talks about a wide range of ways that reparations could be used including the funding of cultural institutions community initiatives direct cash grants and targeted wealth building programs the commission could also determine eligibility scholars like william darity jr argue that eligibility should be tied to those who can demonstrate they have ancestors who suffered from forced migration exterminationist policies and slavery not those who came to the u s voluntarily for those who do qualify the money could be paid in a lump sum a reparations trust fund could also generate funds for specific wealth building initiatives some options include baby bonds and stakeholder funds baby bonds a mechanism to rebalance the historical injustices in family wealth are federally managed accounts set up at birth for children and endowed by the federal government with assets that will grow over time one study suggested that had the u s implemented a universal children s savings account program in 1979 the white black wealth divide would have shrunk by 82 percent for young adult households these funds can be used to establish stakeholder funds when children reach adulthood to get an education purchase a home or start a business additional funds could be targeted for matching savings programs homeownership business start ups and other wealth building opportunities sen cory booker d new jersey introduced a 2018 baby bonds bill titled the american opportunity accounts act senator booker s program would be universal with every child receiving at least 1 000 at birth after that up to 2 000 per year would be added to the account based on family income with lower income families receiving larger deposits a recent analysis of a similar proposal by columbia s center on poverty and social policy suggested the policy could reduce the wealth gap between young white households and young black households more than tenfold affordable housing and homeownership homeownership rates are heavily skewed by race with 73 percent of white households owning their home in 2018 compared to 42 percent of black households three out of four neighborhoods that were redlined in the 20th century are still low income showing the long term effect of residential segregation policies on cities a comprehensive approach like the american housing and economic mobility act introduced by sen elizabeth warren d massachusetts would ameliorate these historical injustices and address the current crisis of affordable housing among other things it would provide down payment assistance to first time homebuyers living in formerly redlined or otherwise officially segregated areas these loans could be similar to the subsidized home mortgages that built the white middle class after world war ii but targeted to those excluded or preyed upon by predatory lending universal public policies in addition to investments targeting the african american community broader progressive policies to empower the working and middle classes would also have the impact of reducing the racial wealth divide these are just a few of the increasingly popular ideas we studied guaranteed employment and significantly raising the minimum wage black and latinx workers are twice as likely as white workers to be among the working poor meaning they have a job but that job doesn t pay enough to cover basic living expenses what s required isn t just more jobs but more good jobs that pay a living wage a federal jobs guarantee would ensure universal job coverage for all adult americans and eliminate involuntary unemployment it would offer existing workers a viable alternative to jobs with low wages inadequate benefits and undesirable working conditions like the depression era works progress administration and civilian conservation corps the work would be directed to create and improve our nation s physical and human public infrastructure increases in income alone won t bridge the racial wealth divide but they would help plus the income from a federal job guarantee would limit the racially disproportionate exposure to predatory finance resulting from low paychecks and unemployment medicare for all poor health outcomes are inextricably tied to race in the united states as the leading cause of bankruptcy the high cost of health care continues to put low wealth families at risk especially the people of color who account for more than half of the 32 million non elderly americans without health insurance medicare for all removes this burden at the point of delivery postal banking about 10 million u s families lack bank accounts people of color are particularly vulnerable to being unbanked as are rural populations the very young and the elderly the postal service is uniquely positioned to provide essential low cost financial services to these families sparing them from exposure to predatory lenders institution building solutions many reparations proposals include funds for institutions that educate and commemorate those who struggled against oppression these are just a few of many possible ideas to institutionalize cultural knowledge about violence and discrimination toward african americans throughout u s history endowments for historical and cultural institutions reparations funds could provide one time capital endowments to create and sustain museums and exhibits that teach the history of slavery and its aftermath such as the national museum of african american history and culture and the national museum of the american indian both operated by the smithsonian institution national history education programs alongside germany s reparations to families impacted by the holocaust there have been significant investments in education about the history of the holocaust the facing history and ourselves curriculum is now used in thousands of u s high schools a similar investment should be made to disseminate the history of african americans to all segments of society historical monuments and markers throughout germany there are historical markers informing people about the legacy of the holocaust over 30 000 commemorative bricks have been installed outside homes where jews lgbtq people roma and other targets of the nazi regime lived prior to their deportation to death camps german residents have daily reminders of this history through what are called stolperstein or stumbling stones in the u s the national park service has a designated site for the trail of tears marking the 1838 forced eviction of the cherokee from their homelands similar markers and exhibits could illuminate other hidden history for instance the recently opened national memorial for peace and justice in alabama commemorates the 4 400 victims of lynching and mob violence between 1877 and the 1950s other historical markers could mark buildings such as the u s capitol built with enslaved labor sites of lynchings and organized pogroms and riots such as the 1924 attack on a black business district in tulsa oklahoma this would be particularly important for the broader education of those who were privileged by racially discriminatory policies toward a deep process we as a society have yet to address apologize and atone for the original sin of slavery and the continuing legacy of racism in this country nor we should say again for the genocide of native americans to continue to ignore the legacy of slavery and discrimination requires a debilitating denial even for white people whose ancestors arrived from other lands in more recent times and especially for those at the top of the wealth pyramid the idea that we can simply forgive and forget is impossible given the deep and pervasive ways that racism permeates all aspects of our economy and society for centuries economic rewards have been allocated based on the level of melanin in our skin we ll never repair this legacy without a deep process that includes material reparations before you go truthout

the currency markets find the pound sterling unscathed from last night s eu election results with the pound to dollar exchange rate a little stronger on the day quoted at 1 27412 with uk and us bank holidays limited currency movements are likely our guest analyst marshall gittler chief strategist head of education at acls global brings you his weekly outlook the currency markets week in review same old same old there s an old joke about people in prison a new guy goes into prison it s his first day inside he s in the cafeteria eating lunch someone stands up and shouts 45 everyone laughs a little later someone else stands up and shouts 32 everyone laughs he asks the guy next to him what s going on the guy explains well we ve all been in here so long we ve all heard each other s jokes so we just numbered them and refer to them by number the guy thinks for a moment and then decides to try his hand he stands up and shouts 87 nobody laughs he asks the guy next to him what happened what did i do wrong the guy looks at him and says well some people can tell a joke and some people can t i often think about that joke nowadays we could probably just number the market patterns trading day 1 and trading day 2 on day 1 something is announced that makes it seem like the us china trade dispute could be resolved and stocks go up bond yields go up aud and nzd go up maybe cad too and jpy and chf go down on day 2 there s a further setback on the talks and the market action is reversed that s basically what happened this past week the us china trade dispute worsened all around with both sides digging in their heels as a result stock markets plunged us bond yields hit the lowest levels since 2017 commodity prices were down most of the commodity currencies were down and the safe haven jpy and chf were up advertisement indeed most commodities have been down over the last week except for a few agricultural commodities that were up because of the weather in particular a wet planting season for corn in the us midwest i say most of the commodity currencies were down because aud managed to gain that s due in the first instance to the surprise result of last sunday s federal election which resulted in the surprise victory by the incumbent center right liberal national coalition government monday s opening turned out to be the high for the week in aud usd it was mostly downhill after that until thursday morning in new york time when aud began recovering probably due to rising iron ore prices the price has more to do with the outlook for brazilian supply rather than china demand in any event australian iron ore for export hit its highest price since 2014 that s good news for the australian government as every 10 rise in the price of a tonne of iron ore translates to around aud 1bn more in tax receipts but as you can see the hitherto strong link between iron ore prices and aud usd broke down in the middle of last year the outlook for monetary policy is now probably more important and that s still negative for aud the biggest loser of the week was gbp this too comes as no surprise we should just assign gbp its own number maybe trading day 3 for when there s bad news out about brexit we don t really need a trading day 4 for when there s good news because there never is any it may be hard to imagine things getting worse but they are about to pm may gave up her attempt to publish another version of her failed withdrawal agreement and probably will abandon plans to put it to a fourth vote sometime in early june i m not going to go into why this is too long and complicated with her plan a rejected and no plan b there s little point in her staying in her job she s apparently planning on announcing her departure onto the dustheap of history on friday the problem is most of the people who want her job are even less commited to keeping britain in the eu than she is on the contrary they are astonishingly insoucient even welcoming in the face of crashing out without an agreement that s decidedly gbp negative the fact is though that no matter what the leave supporters claim liberating britain from eu regulations will not somehow unleash a new wave of freedom to trade with the rest of the world on the contrary as the ft s martin wolf pointed out recently countries tend to trade with other countries that are close to it a thorough analysis of 1 467 estimates from 103 scholarly papers concluded on average a 10 per cent increase in distance lowers bilateral trade by about 9 per cent distance matters big time he wrote britain sends 49 of its exports to the eu if it can t sell those goods to its nearest neighbor where does it plan on selling them and if the country s intractable trade deficit widens even further how does it plan on funding it unless the pound falls to such a level as to make british assets seem cheap we may yet get the long awaited pound dollar parity party that narrowly escaped our grasp in 1984 the coming week bank of canada us pce german japanese inflation although maybe i speak too soon according to the data from eurostat if you look at overall trade invisibles as well as visibles the uk has a wider trade deficit with the eu than it does with non eu countries perhaps less trade with the eu would be beneficial for the country s current account deficit i m not serious the coming week starts off slowly the us and britain are on holiday monday and there are no major statistics coming out tuesday is hardly more exciting wednesday though the bank of canada holds its rate setting meeting the meeting is expected to be relatively boring the market looks for no move in rates either way this year at their last meeting they took an easing bias and said an accommodative policy interest rate continues to be warranted in particular we are monitoring developments in household spending oil markets and global trade policy to gauge the extent to which the factors weighing on growth and the inflation outlook are dissipating they said since then household spending figures have been positive and trade policy between the us and canada has improved but global trade policy i e including us china trade has worsened and the oil markets have turned down sharply in recent days they might take a somewhat more optimistic tone on the economy but i would expect them to retain their dovish bias as such the meeting could be mildly cad bullish but not greatly the rest of the week will be dominated by friday s inflation figures from the us germany and japan for the us we get the us personal consumption expenditure pce deflator and its sub index the core pce deflator the fomc stated back in january 2012 that the pce deflator was most consistent over the longer run with the federal reserve s statutory mandate they didn t spell out that they focus on the core pce deflator but it s widely assumed in any case the deflators are both expected to come in at the same rate of change as in the previous month that would show inflation still running below target but not decelerating further so probably it would mean no immediate change to the fomc s patient stance but it might intensify the calls for a change or at least embolden the doves on the fomc and encourage those market participants who still expect a cut in rates this year that would make it usd negative german inflation is expected to slow somewhat this however is well within the existing view of the ecb president draghi said at his april 10 press conference that on the basis of current futures prices for oil headline inflation is likely to decline over the coming months the slower rate of inflation in germany is therefore not likely to result in a change in stance and therefore is likely to be neutral for the euro tokyo inflation is also expected to slow a bit this too is not likely to result in any move by the bank of japan which has in fact given up its quest for 2 inflation although it can t admit it this week s figures are expected to show stable inflation in the us and slowing inflation in germany and japan has inflation peaked globally it had been rising in most of the g10 countries q1 inflation in australia and new zealand were the outliers as well as norway which i don t really follow but in the developing world inflation has generally been coming down it appears perhaps that trend is starting to spread to the industrial nations as well if so that would probably mean usd strength because with policy on hold it will probably take a lot to convince the fomc to cut rates but other countries that have a neutral bias will probably be willing to move to an easing bias while those with an easing bias may well cut rates
the consumer council of zimbabwe ccz expects prices of basic commodities and services to skyrocket following the near 50 increase in fuel prices last tuesday by tatira zwinoira the consumer council of zimbabwe ccz expects prices of basic commodities and services to skyrocket following the near 50 increase in fuel prices last tuesday in the costing models that have been done in the past fuel has always caused an increase though not major but depending on what type of business you are running it has a cost build up in the cost structures ccz chairman philip bvumbe told standardbusiness last week the reserve bank of zimbabwe cancelled fuel subsidies and instructed oil operators to source their foreign currency from the interbank market this resulted in a near 34 jump in the forex rates on the interbank market and later a 50 increase in the price of fuel as such the pump price per litre of diesel and petrol sold rose nearly 51 9 to rtgs 4 89 and 48 to rtgs 4 97 respectively compared to last monday prices in a snap survey to gauge the cost of basic commodities conducted by standardbusiness prices of selected goods were now significantly higher than what they were in the first week of the month at tm pick n pay ok zimbabwe and spar zimbabwe stores in harare s central business district prices of margarine had gone up by 36 93 to an average of rtgs 8 75 8 to rtgs 5 28 for 2kg of brown sugar and 115 2 to rtgs 2 69 for a 125 gram packet of tea leaves cooking oil was up 7 41 to an average of rtgs 14 49 17 12 to rtgs 7 32 for a 2kg pack of rice 161 08 to rtgs 4 83 for a kg of tomatoes 262 7 to rtgs 6 71 per kg of onions and 10 05 to rtgs 2 19 for bathing soap there were also increases in the prices of washing powder of 10 to an average of rtgs 14 66 per kg and 12 to rtgs 3 64 for a bar of laundry soap it is tight most families are now living on one meal a day even less than one meal a day when you look at the austerity measures that were put in place are there social safety nets for the ordinary person for the poor person who is suffering on the road bvumbe asked there are no social safety nets that were put in place to ensure that basic commodities are then affordable to the ordinary person the government needs to put social safety nets to ensure those who are not even affording a meal a day can get something to eat which is a basic human rights issue according to industry insiders manufacturers are currently in the process of including the near 50 increase in fuel in their costing structures which will result in further price increases it is normal that they do that rational actually it differs from manufacturer to manufacturer because some do not have wider networks of distribution of the product so in those cases there are fewer costs in transport but those who have large distribution networks like those in the baking industry have a higher transport cost the industry insider who asked to remain anonymous said for retailers they have already implemented the fuel cost into their pricing labour and economic development research institute of zimbabwe director godfrey kanyenze said his organisation was working on a paper to analyse the impact of the fuel price increases fuel increases cascade to the rest of the economy because of the linkages he said even government itself has admitted like i think finance permanent secretary ministry george guvamatanga indicated that they were now using the social protection framework through the reduction in the fuel duty kanyeze however warned that the government intervention did not go far to protect consumers against price increases it is already clear that the consumer is the biggest loser because already inflation is going up and the consumer has already lost he said income is lagging behind price adjustments and it is already clear also that this fuel price increase is going to exacerbate an already difficult situation for the consumer apart from the prices of basic commodities increasing transport fares had also increased according to the greater harare association of commuter omnibus operators ghacoo transport fares are pegged at rtgs 2 50 per 10km travelled rtgs 3 per 20km and rtgs 3 50 for 30km however ghacoo secretary eneral ngoni katsvairo said the fares were too low as they could not break even he said they needed to charge rtgs 3 20 per 10km rtgs 5 50 per 20km and rtgs 8 per 30km for them to remain viable the increase in fares is basically informed by the 50 increase in fuel prices which happened recently and also the rates that are going up in terms of foreign currency katsvairo said we buy all our spares using united states dollars as there is no shop that is taking bond notes katsvairo said fuel costs represented 30 of their expenses and spare parts took 40
grain and rede social de justiça e direitos humanos 6 september 2018 harvard s billion dollar farmland fiasco one of the world s major buyers of farmland is under fire for their involvement in land conflicts environmental destruction and risky investments a new report by grain and rede social de justiça e direitos humanos presents for the first time a comprehensive analysis of harvard university s controversial investments in global farmland the report finds that harvard s endowment fund has spent around 1 billion to acquire control of an estimated 850 000 hectares of farmland around the world making the university one of the world s largest and most geographically diverse farmland investors harvard s farmland acquisitions were undertaken without proper due diligence and have contributed to the displacement and harassment of traditional communities environmental destruction and conflicts over water the consequences of these deals are particularly dire in brazil where harvard s endowment fund has acquired nearly 300 000 hectares of land in the cerrado the world s most biodiverse savannah harvard s opaque farmland investments resulted in windfall remunerations for its fund managers and business partners but have failed as an investment strategy for the university the report urges harvard s students faculty and alumni to demand that the university s endowment fund ceases all its investments in farmland take immediate measures to resolve all land conflicts associated with its current land holdings and ensure that affected communities are adequately compensated for damages palmerina ferreira lima outside her home in the village of melancias piauí brazil photo rosilene miliotti fase water it s finished palmerina ferreira lima is a 77 year old woman from the village of melancias which sits on the banks of the river uruçuí preto in the brazilian state of piauí for over 100 years her community lived well on the fertile lands lush savannahs and abundant waters that make up the northern part of brazil s biodiverse cerrado region but those good days are now a distant memory a few years ago powerful businessmen fenced off the lands surrounding the village and erected massive industrial soy plantations palmerina s community was cut off from the lands they had depended upon for generations to feed their families and started suffering from new health problems caused by pesticides that have been aerially sprayed onto the farms and blown into homes the pesticides also destroy their crops and pollute local water sources which now means that rivers and springs once abundant with fish are now drying up because of deforestation and irrigation on the plantations water it s finished there is very little left we are here afraid of dying of thirst if only these projects would stop water would come back but they don t stop no they will probably stop when the river is all dried up says palmerina unbeknown to the people of melancias one of the farms inflicting damage upon them is owned by harvard university harvard s involvement is not obvious because the ivy league university s ownership is concealed behind a company managed by its local associates harvard contracted these businessmen to acquire the lands in brazil and run the farm on its behalf few people also know that this same brazilian business group acquired at least five other farms for harvard in this area with similar consequences for local people as in melancias harvard has worked with a total of three brazilian business groups to acquire nearly 300 000 hectares of farmland in the northeast region of the brazilian cerrado between 2008 and 2016 making the university one of the biggest foreign owners of farmland in the country harvard s brazilian farmland holdings are just one piece of a much larger puzzle that is hidden behind an opaque web of companies buying up farmland on behalf of the university around the world our investigations revealed that over the past decade harvard used multiple company structures to acquire vast farmland in brazil south africa russia the ukraine new zealand australia and the united states shielded from public scrutiny the university s endowment fund quietly accumulated into one of the largest farmland portfolios of any financial company in the world in less than a decade harvard s splurge on global farmlands harvard university began buying farmlands in the immediate aftermath of the financial and food price crises of 2007 and 2008 it was one of several endowments pension funds and other institutional investors that started to acquire farmland in the wake of the subprime crisis and the collapse of the housing market in the united states and europe while new york based teachers insurance and annuity association tiaa took the lead in farmland acquisitions among pension funds harvard with its 37 1 billion endowment fund quickly established itself as the leading farmland buyer among universities see table 1 table 1 top us university endowment funds investing in farmland endowment assets under management bn current allocation to natural resources mn farmland

642 unknown university of pennsylvania endowment 10 7 642 unknown source perqin august 2017 harvard had already made major moves into the acquisition of global timberlands so farmland was not an entirely new investment for the endowment and could fit in easily amongst its natural resources portfolio the timber investments also provided contacts around the world and a land investment model of offshore shell companies and obscure subsidiaries that could be replicated the university began by buying farmland in brazil south africa and new zealand in 2008 then came a major investment in russia and ukraine followed by several farm purchases in australia and the united states by june 2017 harvard had injected over us 930 million into its various farmland subsidiaries and had acquired control of over 850 000 hectares of farmland around the world making the university one of the world s top farmland buyers an opaque corporate structure figure 1 global farmland acquisitions by harvard endowment fund harvard s farmland acquisitions are channeled through complex company structures making it difficult to ascertain its specific farmland holdings even the fund s own board of overseers does not have a clear understanding of the farmland that the fund owns and manages at the top of each farmland investment structure is one of the boston based tax exempt subsidiaries that manage different parts of the endowment s investments those subsidiaries involved in farmland acquisitions are blue marble holdings phemus demeter and harvard private capital realty information contained in the tax filings of these boston subsidiaries shows that harvard channeled money for farmland investment through these companies to other subsidiaries registered in tax havens such as the us state of delaware or the cayman islands and with obscure names such as guara llc or granary investments from these tax haven companies the money then flowed to subsidiaries in the target countries which are managed by various local operators active in agribusiness and land acquisitions these local business groups identified the lands made the purchases and managed the farms harvard paid them millions of us dollars in fees for their services see box harvard s nebulous farmland network conflict and controversy harvard followed the path of other institutional investors that have acquired farmland focussing on countries seen as less risky but with the potential for high returns this did not however keep the university s investments free of conflict or risks in australia a report by the office of environment and heritage found that in 2015 harvard s subsidiary had destroyed aboriginal burial sites and removed native vegetation without a permit on farmland it acquired in new south wales the harvard owned farm company reportedly failed to carry out an aboriginal cultural survey before ploughing up the fields despite the existence of dozens of sensitive sites being evident in south africa harvard acquired farms where the former black workers and their families had been granted rights of occupation under the post apartheid land reform conflicts with the local communities are detailed in a report by a researcher who worked with harvard s south african farm manager russellstone according to his report once harvard took over these farms in 2011 the managers moved to restrict the land use rights of these families including for grazing their cattle and accessing family burial sites harvard s farm managers are said to have pressured the families to sign a code of conduct and to have imposed a system of rules and penalties that could lead to the expulsion of a family if not adhered to tensions on the farm are reported to have escalated thereafter to the point where harvard was worried that it might cause unwanted international attention according to the same report harvard insisted that russellstone find a mediated solution despite russellstone s assurances that such tensions with occupant families were a normal part of large scale farming in south africa the university sent a mediator to offer to relocate the families to other lands but the families rejected the offer saying the lands offered were of poor quality and far from essential services frustrated with the situation and wary of the repercussions for its international image the university is reported to have directed russellstone in 2014 to sell all of its farmland holdings on which there were occupant families harvard has also waded into conflicts with its us farmland deals according to its tax filings since 2012 the university has invested over us 115 million into acquiring land in california and establishing vineyards these farms in the paso robles region and cuyama valley are located in areas where water shortages are threatening the viability of agriculture local residents and farmers worry that harvard s vineyard projects will jeopardise their access to water and accuse harvard of using devious tactics to make a financial play on control over the remaining water resources cindy steinbeck whose family has farmed wine grapes in the area for decades is leading an effort by several hundred other landowners in the area to secure their access to groundwater in a letter to the ceo of the harvard management company in march 2016 she wrote the local perception right or wrong is that harvard has been doing the following making purchases using multiple layers of disregarded entities such that it would be difficult for the layperson to trace the purchase back to harvard using agents to push for formation of a local water district that would allow harvard s properties to ultimately benefit from government grants and taxpayer funds inducing certain property owners to sell with offers that are many times the going market rates and using this method to acquire properties that contain public water infrastructure and generally not being forthcoming with the local populace about how these investments could affect the most vital of resources all in the name of returns on investment harvard s land grabs in brazil s cerrado two women from the village of santa fé in the municipality of santa filomena display their land certificates september 2017 the people of santa fé have lived in this part of the brazilian state of piauí for over 200 years but are now affected by a recent wave of land grabbing in the area led by brazilian businessmen and financed by foreign companies such as harvard s endowment fund and the us based pension fund manager tiaa photo rosilene miliotti fase but over the past couple of decades this part of the cerrado has been heavily deforested and ploughed up for one of the largest expansions of commodity crop production in recent history the expansion began to the south and then roughly ten years ago began moving aggressively towards the northeast into the states of tocantins maranhão bahia and piauí harvard s most conflict ridden farmland acquisitions occurred in brazil the university is one of several foreign financial companies from north america europe and japan that have acquired lands in the northeast of brazil s cerrado region over the past decade this savannah biome which contains 5 of the planet s biodiversity is critical to the preservation of the amazon and a major water source for brazil s most important water basins it is also home to over 80 indigenous ethnic groups as well as a variety of traditional peoples whose status is recognised under brazilian law such as the afro brazilian quilombola communities this new frontier for the production of soybeans sugarcane and other agricultural commodities is where harvard and other foreign financial companies are targeting their investments they are drawn to the area because of the relatively low price of farmland and the potential for it to increase in market value aside from harvard some of the main foreign companies acquiring land in this area include tiaa of the united states abp of the netherlands sojitz of japan and valiance asset management of the united kingdom all of these companies operate through partnerships with local companies that handle the land acquisitions and farming operations the surge in speculation on farmland by foreign companies has exacerbated land conflicts in the area the world bank while not citing any specific companies says that with the rapid expansion of plantation agriculture into this part of the cerrado the disorderly and illegal occupation of rural land grilagem is common grilagem is a particular form of land grabbing that is widespread in the northeast part of the cerrado in which land titles are falsified to legitimise the illegal occupation of public lands the lands are fenced to give the appearance of a farm and the fraudulent titles are then sold at a huge profit to other companies which are often connected to foreign investors these public lands are not vacant as is typically claimed by the land grabbers grileiros for generations the land has been home to local communities such as in the case of the lowland areas or used collectively by these communities for hunting grazing collecting firewood and harvesting fruit and medicinal plants this is why the grileiros so often resort to violence and intimidation to displace the local people and prevent them from accessing the lands harvard has channeled its funds for farmland acquisitions in the northeast of the cerrado through three different local business groups see box harvard s nebulous farmland network under the cover of these operators the university quietly acquired around 300 000 hectares of land an area larger than luxembourg in parts of the states of piauí and bahia where land conflicts are rife recent reports have exposed how one of harvard s business partners in brazil the granflor group arranged for a harvard owned subsidiary to acquire over 120 000 hectares of land in the state of bahia from a businessman who is a well known grileiro in the state granflor pursued the acquisition of these lands despite having been warned by local residents that they were the subject of serious conflicts according to a 2014 report by a bahia state commission the titles to the lands that harvard s subsidiary would subsequently acquire were derived through a festival of irregular and illegal procedures which resulted in usurpation of public lands and involved the violent displacement of numerous local families that had traditionally occupied and used these public lands it also appears that harvard s land acquisitions in the area are in violation of brazilian restrictions on foreign ownership which limit the amount of land that a foreign company can acquire within a municipality the prosecutor s office in the state of bahia is now considering whether to sue harvard s subsidiary and cancel the titles there is similar evidence of grilagem undertaken by one of harvard s other brazilian business partners to acquire lands in the neighbouring state of piauí the insolo group facilitated harvard s acquisition of at least six farms covering over 116 000 hectares in the state of piauí through several harvard owned brazilian subsidiaries managed by the insolo group fazenda ipê is a massive 58 000 hectare farm that harvard purchased through the insolo group by way of several different brazilian based harvard subsidiaries in a decision handed down on 16 may 2018 the agrarian court judge of piauí stated that one of these subsidiaries sorotivo agroindustrial ltda had used the practice of grilagem to acquire around 27 000 hectares of land within fazenda ipê that were previously public lands according to the judgement in piauí land grabbing grilagem is one of the main causes of deforestation and land conflicts as real estate transactions in the rural market happen outside of compliance with the rules regarding civil environmental and agrarian legislation making it impossible to hold those involved accountable this discredited practice of grilagem is what was practiced by in acquiring its land titles aerial spraying of pesticides on a soybean plantation in piauí brazil photo josé cícero silva agência pública near to fazenda ipê the people from the community of baixão fechado claim that they were pushed off of lands they traditionally used to forage raise livestock and hunt by another harvard owned farm managed by the same insolo group the fazenda fortaleza which covers about 11 000 hectares is situated next to a large farm owned by the us pension fund manager tiaa which is named fazenda ludmilla the residents of baixão fechado say that the deforestation caused by both farms and the large amounts of water the farms use for irrigation have badly affected their access to water which was previously plentiful and of good quality the situation has become so bad that the village has had to start bringing in water by trucks the villagers also say that pollution from the pesticides sprayed on the farms is behind the increase in health symptoms like coughing dizziness stomach aches and low blood pressure that have been witnessed in the community as well as a rise in cases of cancer pesticides used on these farms also have decimated the community s fishing grounds and caused the destruction of their crops they use pesticides such as roundup it destroys all of our crops including the broad bean crop we used to be a top producer of broad beans in the region now we are losing all of our broad beans they spray that poison from their airplanes and it contaminates everything a bunch of pests appear like the whitefly which we can t kill and they destroy everything says josé branco a resident of the baixão fechado community through its third business partner in brazil the gordian bioenergy group gbe harvard financed the acquisition of several more areas of farmland in piauí which were part of a massive agribusiness project that gbe has been pursuing in the district of guadalupe since 2012 the gbe project however is still struggling to obtain the finances it needs to move into the implementation phase and according to bloomberg news harvard is now trying to exit from the project but these are not the only farmland deals that gbe orchestrated for harvard in the district of barra in the state of bahia harvard acquired a farm called fazenda boqueirão through a gbe managed harvard subsidiary the lands were acquired from the brazilian company pro flora agroflorestal ltda which is owned by a wealthy brazilian business family from the state of minas gerais fazenda boqueirão is at the centre of a land conflict between the owners of pro flora and about 400 families living in the area after the owners of pro flora acquired fazenda boqueirão in 2004 they moved to claim rights over an expanded 70 000 hectares area of land which covered lands that the peasant families have collectively grazed their cattle on since at least 1935 the families refused to give up their lands and tensions between the two sides escalated finally in 2011 the bahia state authority stepped in and agreed with the families that the company s claims to the lands were invalid however in a concession to the company it decided to provide pro flora with a private title to a 27 800 hectare parcel that the communities were said not to be using this private title was formalised in 2014 by which time pro flora had already sold fazenda boqueirão to harvard s local gbe subsidiary for us 3 million meanwhile cloves dos santos araujo a lawyer with the rural workers lawyers association aatr of bahia says that the state has still not formalised titles for the families covering the remaining 42 000 hectares leaving them vulnerable to a new round of land grabbing by fazenda boqueirão s owners indeed in june 2017 the lawyer representing pro flora initiated a petition with the state for the recognition of the company s rights to the full 70 000 hectares area brazil s pastoral land commission comissão pastoral da terra cpt is closely following the case and supporting the communities to defend their traditional lands it argues that the agreement giving pro flora and subsequently harvard a private title to the 27 800 hectares of land is unconstitutional and in violation of brazil s agrarian reform policies for the cpt it s another unfortunate incidence of the government putting the interests of big agribusiness above those of local people a dismal harvest harvard s decade of farmland deals has generated many casualties from brazilian peasants to south african farm workers to rural californians the students and faculty of harvard could also be viewed as casualties of these investments the endowment fund s investments are meant to support the educational and research goals of the university but its billion dollar farmland deals have performed badly last year the endowment s new chief n p narv narvekar re evaluated the fund s investments in timber and farmland which led to the entire natural resources portfolio being written down from 4 billion to 2 9 billion in brazil where harvard made its most ambitious and costly farmland investments much of the 300 000 hectares that the fund acquired is in partial production or not in production at all the gbe project in piauí is on the verge of collapse without having planted a single crop the 124 000 hectares of land of caracol s campo largo are mostly lying idle and there is barely anything planted on several of the large farms acquired through the insolo group in piauí such as fazenda nazaré fazenda galileia and fazenda fortaleza the boston based fund managers that orchestrated the university s controversial move into global farmland have all recently exited from the endowment during their time at the fund the top fund managers amassed hundreds of millions of dollars in compensation payments a stunning us 242 million between 2010 to 2014 as noted by institutional investment analyst charles skorina the compensation payments for the managers of the natural resources portfolio were largely based on valuations for farmlands and timberlands that were controlled by the managers themselves according to skorina the recent write down in the value of these assets indicates that those valuations were inflated in ways that benefitted these managers several of these former harvard managers have recently founded a new company called folium capital where they are once again raising funds from institutional investors to acquire farmland in south america seu juarez from the village of melancias examining a local stream affected by harvard s fazenda galileia in the municipality of baixa grande do ribeiro piauí brazil foto josé cícero silva agência pública harvard cannot plead ignorance it pursued these investments in farmland despite years of public criticism and demands for greater due diligence some of this criticism was internal on 22 may 2018 one of the overseers of the harvard endowment fund kat taylor resigned in protest over the fund s opaque investments in unethical activities including land purchases that may not respect indigenous rights water holdings that threaten the human right to water after six years of harvard s inaction during my tenure and many more that preceded my participation as an overseer i am today speaking publicly about our failure to act we have neither a moral nor a financial narrative to stand behind she wrote over the last decade harvard s endowment has severely underperformed financially compared to its peers even as we have continued to invest in activities and products that undermine the well being of our communities nation and planet taylor says that even as a member of the board of overseers she was unable to know definitively what the endowment was invested in and only had some indication that the fund held african land amazon river delta properties and potentially water resource assets all three of those suggest that we should be aware of whether those holdings are respectful of indigenous rights the possibility of land ownership that s not traditionally documented assets that are particularly sensitive from a climate standpoint and the possibility of water rights being sold out of market to the detriment of local ecologies and local economies she said in an interview with the specialised news outlet agri investor our investigations of harvard s farmland deals in brazil suggest that the university did not proceed with the necessary level of due diligence to ensure that the lands it purchased were free of land conflict nor based on clear legal titles given that it was investing hundreds of millions of us dollars to acquire farmland in an area well known for land conflicts and land grabbing it should have exercised much greater vigilance making amends harvard s farmland deals should be a cautionary tale for institutional investors currently contemplating getting involved in the sector the risks harvard s fund managers took have not paid off financially for the university and have instead left it with a legacy of land and water conflicts to deal with while harvard has been rethinking its farmland investment strategy over the past year and trying to sell off some of its farms the university has yet to announce any moves to restrict future farmland deals nor to introduce new internal rules guidelines or systems of oversight for such investments the priority that it continues to place on its controversial farmland investments in brazil is further demonstrated by the fund s hiring of the architect of tiaa s brazilian farmland investments to head its natural resources portfolio in august 2016 harvard s students faculty and alumni should demand a full independent assessment of harvard s global farmland acquisitions this should include an accounting of how much was spent acquiring the land including the payments to fund managers and business associates and how much has been returned to the fund through on farm production and farm sales it should also involve an inventory of the damages caused to local communities through displacement conflicts chemical pollution and environmental destruction as well as clear recommendations for how harvard can best compensate these communities harvard should not be allowed to relinquish its responsibilities by simply selling off its farmlands to another company or outsourcing its farmland acquisitions to external managers harvard was one of a small number of institutional investors that pioneered the move into global farmland investing after the 2008 financial crash these corporations more than any other are responsible for having made farmland a new asset class for financial investors who are eager to find real assets or so called alternatives that they can buy to hedge against volatility in the stock markets with real estate and stock markets once again at highly inflated levels the same tendencies we saw post 2008 could reappear generating a new rush of risky farmland investments by institutional funds and another spike in land conflicts harvard university can help make amends by declaring an end to its global farmland acquisitions box harvard s nebulous farmland network in the case of south africa harvard s farm acquisitions were handled by the russellstone group a privately owned pretoria based investment house that entered the business of acquiring farms in southern africa for foreign investors in 2008 aside from its dealing with harvard russellstone also managed a controversial farmland acquisition for vanderbilt university in mozambique between june 2008 and june 2016 harvard transferred us 73 5 million via a mauritius based subsidiary to a south african subsidiary managed by russellstone with these funds russellstone acquired several farm properties in the south african provinces of kwazulu natal mpumalanga limpopo free state and gauteng over these years russellstone received at least us 5 1 million from harvard for investment management services harvard turned to a similar investment house for its farmland purchases in australia a company called wealthcheck that sources opportunities to invest in the australian agricultural property sector in eastern europe harvard partnered with nch capital a new york based company specialising in the privatisation of assets in the former soviet block nch s strategy is to acquire rights to thousands of small plots of land mainly in russia and ukraine and to amalgamate these into large scale operations through a cayman islands subsidiary harvard spent over us 150 million between june 2009 and june 2016 to take a 59 stake in nch s first farmland fund which nch used to establish 58 large scale farms covering around 490 000 hectares in russia and ukraine harvard paid nch us 12 9 million for investment services over this period in brazil harvard s farmland deals were orchestrated through three different structures involving three local operators 1 the ioschpes brazilian autoparts magnate ivoncy ioschpe is said to have learned about the potential for making money from agriculture in the cerrado in 2000 he soon started acquiring farmland in the northern state of piauí and contracted a group of local agronomists who had formed a company called insolo to convert these lands into massive soybean and cotton plantations in 2008 ioschpe took over insolo placed his son salomão in charge and remade the company into a vehicle for channelling money from harvard s endowment fund into the acquisition of large areas of farmland in piauí this company now named insolo agroindustrial s a is 95 8 owned by harvard by way of its fund management company phemus corp and several subsidiaries in delaware and brazil between june 2008 and june 2016 harvard injected at least us 138 7 million into insolo agroindustrial s a which then acquired at least six farms covering over 115 000 hectares in piauí harvard also paid a company connected to the ioschpe group us 3 million a year in consultancy fees for investment services from june 2009 to june 2017 2 gordian bioenergy gordian bioenergy known as gbe is a private equity company run in part by greek brazilian businessman diomedes christodoulou the former ceo of enron s south american operations as well as several of his former enron colleagues roberto hukai john novak and steven madrid in 2007 christodoulou and his team went looking for us and european investors to back a us 150 million sugarcane plantation and ethanol refinery project they were planning to build in brazil they connected with the harvard endowment and the two sides set up a corporate structure running through a cayman islands company to channel money from harvard into the venture gbe then set about to acquire farmland in and around the town of guadalupe in piauí where it proposed to build its sugarcane operations as well as a large scale tomato farm lands were also acquired in neighbouring states for reasons that are not apparent one of the companies working with gbe in acquiring the lands for harvard was pro flora agroflorestal ltda a company owned by brazilian businessman antônio pontes da fonseca one of the largest farmland owners in the state of minas gerais between june 2008 and june 2015 harvard transferred over us 246 million to gbe for farmland acquisitions how much of this was provided to gbe for investment management and other services is unclear 3 granflor harvard s entry into brazilian agriculture was preceded by investments in timber some of these deals were orchestrated by two brazilian businessmen from the forestry sector romualdo maestri and victor hugo silveira boff who are the co founders of the company granflor agroflorestal in 2008 harvard and these two businessmen established a company in the brazilian city of porto alegre called caracol agropecuaria this company 100 owned by harvard through a set of delaware registered subsidiaries received over us 60 million from harvard s fund management company blue marble holdings between june 2008 and june 2016 for the acquisition of farmland primarily in the state of bahia during this same period harvard appears to have paid maestri and silveira boff over us 10 million for investment services through their company

the three m s of hyperinflation milosevic mugabe and maduro what do slobodan milosevic robert mugabe and nicolás maduro have in common other than being leaders who kept the communist manifesto at their bedside all three ushered in devastating hyperinflations hyperinflations are rare they have only occurred when the supply of money has been governed by discretionary paper money standards no hyperinflation has ever been recorded when money has been commodity based or when paper money has been convertible into a commodity the first hyperinflation occurred during the french revolution 1789 96 when the mandat collapsed and the monthly inflation rate peaked at 143 in december of 1795 more than a century elapsed before another episode of hyperinflation occurred not coincidentally this period of currency tranquility occurred during the heyday of the gold standard with the emergence and adoption of fiat currencies the 20th century ushered in currency instability and inflation indeed since 1900 there have been 57 episodes of hyperinflation and five of those episodes can be claimed by yugoslavia zimbabwe and venezuela all are featured in the hanke krus world hyperinflation table below which first appeared in the routledge handbook of major events in economic history 2013 the hanke krus world hyperinflation table abbreviated milosevic and yugoslavia slobodan milosevic was in the saddle when inflation last gutted the rump yugoslavia the first of his many monetary shenanigans was uncovered on january 7 1991 when i served as an adviser in the ante marković reform government it was then that we discovered on december 28 1990 the milosevic controlled serbian parliament had secretly ordered the serbian national bank a regional central bank to issue some 1 4 billion in credits to friends of milosevic that illegal plunder equaled more than half of all the new money the national bank of yugoslavia had planned to emit in 1991 the heist sabotaged the markovic government s teetering plans for economic reform and hardened the resolve of leaders in croatia and slovenia to break away from belgrade without the croats and slovenes to fleece milosevic turned on his own people with a vengeance starting in january 1992 what was left of yugoslavia endured what was at the time the second highest hyperinflation in world history it peaked in january 1994 when i measured the monthly inflation rate at 313 000 000 the yugoslav hyperinflation episode lasted 24 long months nonetheless milosevic retained his grip on what was left of yugoslavia for another six years during the 24 month episode per capita income plunged by more than 50 ordinary people were forced to deplete their hard currency savings people couldn t afford to buy food in the free market they kept from starving by either waiting in long lines at state stores for irregularly supplied rations of low quality staples or by relying on relatives who lived in the countryside for long periods all of belgrade s gas stations were closed with the exception of one that catered to foreigners and embassy personnel people also spent an inordinate amount of time at the foreign exchange black markets where they exchanged huge piles of near worthless dinars into a single german mark or u s dollar note milosevic s monetary madness had destroyed the economy mugabe and zimbabwe fast forward to march of 2007 when robert mugabe was in his 19th year as president of zimbabwe the african country was experiencing an episode of hyperinflation that was destroying the economy pushing more of its inhabitants into poverty and forcing millions of zimbabweans to emigrate in the 1997 2007 period living standards as measured by real gross domestic product per capita fell by a stunning 38 the episode which peaked at an annual inflation rate of 89 7 sextillion percent that is 89 7 followed by 20 zeros in november of 2008 had robbed people of their savings and financial institutions of their capital through real inflation adjusted interest rates that were actually negative this form of theft occurred in large part due to laws and regulations governing financial institutions pensions funds insurance companies building societies and banks that forced them to either purchase government treasury bills that yielded only a small fraction of the current inflation rate or make deposits at the reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz that paid no interest so what was the cause of this economic meltdown the blame lay at the doorstep of the zimbabwean government whose policies forced the rbz to print money from january 2005 to may 2007 the rbz issued currency at a rate that exceeded that of germany s central bank from january 1921 to may 1923 the ramp up phase of the great german hyperinflation currency in circulation during this period the rbz more than doubled its staff from 618 to 1 360 employees despite this 120 increase in staff the rbz staff was incapable of producing accurate and timely data even the most standard economic and financial statistics arrived months late if at all with the help of alex kwok and my research assistants at the johns hopkins cato institute trouble currencies project i was able to fill the gap left by the rbz and accurately measure zimbabwe s first hyperinflation episode by my measurement the monthly inflation rate peaked at 79 6 billion percent in november of 2008 taking over the rank of second and pushing the yugoslavia episode to the third most severe episode of hyperinflation despite this astronomical figure mugabe was able to remain in office for another 9 years this was due in part to the fact that in early 2009 zimbabwe dumped the zimbabwe dollar and officially dollarized but mugabe never learned the lessons of 2008 when his party zanu pf regained full control of zimbabwe in 2013 government spending and public debt surged to finance its ballooning deficits the government abandoned full dollarization and started to issue its own currency in enormous amounts the new zim dollar was issued at par to the u s dollar but traded at a significant discount the money supply as a result of the new zim dollar issuance exploded and so did inflation as night follows day zimbabwe experienced its second episode of hyperinflation in less than ten years starting in september of 2017 and peaking at a monthly inflation rate of 185 mugabe had been in the saddle just shy of 30 years but this was the straw that broke the camel s back zimbabwe s second episode of hyperinflation opened the door to mugabe s ouster in a november 2017 coup d etat by the zimbabwe defense forces maduro and venezuela at present there is the only one country that is suffering from the ravages of hyperinflation venezuela but venezuela s ongoing episode of hyperinflation did not occur overnight i observed some of venezuela s economic dysfunction first hand during the 1995 96 period when i acted as president rafael caldera s adviser but it wasn t until 1999 when hugo chavez was installed as president that the socialist seeds of venezuela s current meltdown started to be planted with chavez s ascendancy fiscal and monetary discipline deteriorated and inflation ratcheted up by the time president nicolas maduro arrived in early 2013 annual inflation was rising into the triple digits and venezuela was entering an economic death spiral venezuela s annual inflation rate was the highest in the world in 2018 reaching 80 0000 at year end and climbing to 165 382 at the end of february 2019 and although by hyperinflation standards venezuela s rate of inflation has been modest the longevity of venezuela s episode has been quite extended to date venezuela s episode has lasted 30 months and counting ranking it the fifth longest episode of hyperinflation in history durations of hyperinflation episodes while hyperinflation is not a recipe for building a politician s popular support it is not a certain death knell either the three ms

menafn jordan times washington dc not content with its trade war against china us president donald trump s administration has also opened bilateral trade negotiations with japan yet whatever trump hopes to achieve with japan it will be far less than what he threw away when he abandoned the trans pacific partnership tpp in early 2017 during the 2016 us presidential campaign trump promised americans that he would negotiate so many great deals on their behalf that they would get tired of winning now that he has imposed heavy costs on us farmers consumers and the overall economy through tariffs on chinese imports americans are probably growing quite tired indeed trump s withdrawal from the tpp is the canonical example of his trade policy recklessness signed in 2016 by the united states and 11 other pacific rim countries the treaty would have governed around 40 per cent of all trade covered by world trade organisation rules it was a twenty first century agreement that included not just tariff reductions but also provisions to liberalise retail communications entertainment and financial services it would have strengthened labour and environmental standards established a new dispute resolution mechanism and created a framework for managing e commerce cyber security intellectual property rights data mobility and more when the us withdrew from the tpp many assumed the agreement was dead but the remaining signatories led by japanese prime minister shinzo abe quickly agreed on a replacement the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership cptpp which retains around 200 of the tpp s 220 odd provisions the 20 that were left out were those for which the us pushed and can be reinstated should the country wish to join the pact at a later date now that the cptpp has entered into force australia brunei canada chile japan malaysia mexico new zealand peru singapore and vietnam enjoy preferential access to each other s markets as tariffs are phased out us suppliers in those markets are finding themselves at a growing disadvantage while the japanese tariff on american beef imports has remained at 38 5 per cent the levy on beef from fellow cptpp countries has fallen to 27 5 per cent and eventually will reach just 9 per cent as a result american beef and wheat entering japan or any other cptpp country now face a higher tariff than beef and wheat from australia canada or new zealand still abe has worked hard to maintain good relations with the us taking much political heat at home for it japan was one of the few us trading partners not to retaliate when the trump administration imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum and while affirming japan s preference for regional and multilateral arrangements abe has nonetheless agreed to bilateral bargaining with the us with a japanese parliamentary election coming this summer bilateral talks are not likely to go anywhere until later in the year when they do happen japan will benefit from having already entered into a free trade agreement fta with the european union as of this past february more than 90 per cent soon to be 97 per cent of eu exports to japan are duty free and after a brief phase out period the same will apply to 85 per cent of agri food products while wine from the us faces a 15 per cent tariff wine from the eu as well as from cptpp countries such as chile now enters japan duty free as do european cars which are subject to common safety standards not for nothing did abe tout the eu deal as proof of the unshaken political will of japan and the eu to lead the world as the champions of free trade at a time when protectionism has spread for its part the trump administration wants japan to remove barriers to us agricultural and auto exports and reduce its bilateral trade surplus which stood at 58 billion in goods in 2018 but while trump often complains that us goods face trade discrimination in japan he has only himself to blame it is only natural that us exporters would lose market share to their counterparts in europe and the cptpp countries with japan s new ftas in place the us trade deficit with japan is likely to grow even wider so much for trump s art of the deal the supposedly brilliant negotiator has left us exporters at a severe disadvantage in markets spanning the pacific rim and europe worse china is now pushing for a mega fta among 16 countries under the regional comprehensive economic partnership rcep negotiations for which are ongoing although many china experts do not expect an agreement to be reached anytime soon here it is worth remembering that the tpp would have excluded china and locked in a us led trade bloc in asia for the long term no deal that the trump administration makes with japan can possibly make up for what the us would have had under the tpp at best the us will salvage the tpp terms concerning japan alone rather than all 11 original signatories though abe has declared his willingness to negotiate bilaterally with trump he cannot possibly grant the us better terms than those given to japan s cptpp partners we have seen this movie before with each trumpian negotiation the us issues its demands offers little in return and threatens punishment through tariffs if it doesn t get its way like the thief who says your money or your life there is no actual negotiation to speak of by acting like an insecure bully trump has left the us increasingly isolated in the global economy american producers and consumers are already paying the price the only question is how much more winning they

trade and the economy have become the new roller coaster for markets trade headlines could be a big factor for markets in the week ahead but investors will also be attuned to fresh inflation data and moves in the bond market which is flashing new worries about the economy stocks were on a roller coaster ride in the past week as markets reacted to worsening trade tensions and concerns that negotiations could be prolonged causing pain for the global economy but the bond market s move was perhaps even more dramatic as yields fell to levels last seen in 2017 and the futures market began to price in three federal reserve interest rate cuts by the end of next year there s not a lot of economic data next week so events hang over us said marc chandler chief global strategist at bannockburn global forex it s more about the evolution of old issues than new issues like trade and brexit brexit will continue to be a focus in global markets u k prime minister theresa may stepped aside friday after failing to get agreement on a plan for the u k to leave the european union chandler said investors will be watching the jockeying among candidates hoping to succeed may with hard line brexit proponent boris johnson expected to seek the job among others as for trade chandler said it s possible that president donald trump s comments that huawei could be part of a trade deal may be the start of a new approach by the administration to tone down its rhetoric the telecom giant has been blacklisted by the u s and is expected to be denied access to u s components for its equipment in some ways it s a headline problem we think of it more as event risk said nadine terman ceo and cio at solstein capital china thinks in dynasties and u s investors seem to think in durations of days and months so i think we are misunderstanding the duration of their negotiating strategy she said the issues between the two countries go way beyond trade and extend to china s military aspirations in the south china sea and its global campaign of influence through the belt and road initiative chinese president xi jinping s signature program it s now become more nationalistic emotional to say we re going against the u s and we ve got to be in it for the long haul i don t think you have the same emotion here in the u s you don t have the same nationalistic pride to say we have to fight china at all cost she said in the past week wall street increasingly began to expect the trump administration to turn up the pressure on china with another wave of 25 tariffs on the 300 billion or so in goods remaining that have no tariffs those tariffs would directly hit american consumer goods and are expected to take a bigger bite out of the economy fears of a trade war hurting global growth and

markets have right now are that we re moving towards a worst case scenario and that could persist for quite some time said mark cabana head of u s short rate strategy at bank of america merrill lynch if that s the case then the market is believing economic data and the fed will likely need to respond to that by trying to offset and prevent a recession the most important data point in the coming week will be friday s personal consumption expenditures which includes the pce deflator inflation data that the fed monitors it was at 1 6 year over year last month and is expected to be the same for april well below the fed s target of 2 inflation inflation has become a key focus on wall street particularly after fed chairman jerome powell said low inflation appears to be transitory and not enough of a concern to make the fed cut interest rates powell and other fed officials have stressed the fed is pausing in its rate hiking cycle is monitoring the economy and does not yet know which way it will move next solstein capital s terman said she is watching the pce inflation report to see if it confirms her view that inflation and the economy will be weaker this summer she also expects

new orders for u s made capital goods fell more than expected in april further evidence that the economy was slowing after a growth spurt in the first quarter that was driven by exports and a buildup of inventories the report from the commerce department on friday also showed orders for these goods were not as strong as previously thought in march and shipments were weak over the last two months indicating that manufacturing was fast losing ground the sector which accounts for about 12 of the economy is being squeezed by businesses placing fewer orders while working off stockpiles of unsold goods in warehouses the inventory overhang is concentrated in the automotive sector which is experiencing slow sales boeing s move to cut production of its troubled 737 max aircraft is also hurting manufacturing the loss of momentum came even before a recent escalation in the trade war between the united states and china leading economists to expect demand for capital goods to remain soft the renewed trade tensions between washington and beijing have roiled the u s stock market data on thursday showed a measure of factory activity hit an almost 10 year low in may we can t sugar coat today s news said chris rupkey chief economist at mufg in new york business investment is absolutely critical for the economy to move forward and investment is normally the swing factor that pumps up growth or pulls out the support from the economy orders for non defence capital goods excluding aircraft a closely watched proxy for business spending plans dropped 0 9 last month as demand softened almost across the board these so called core capital goods orders rose 0 3 in march instead of 1 0 as previously reported economists polled by reuters had forecast core capital goods orders falling 0 3 in april shipments of core capital goods were unchanged last month after a downwardly revised 0 6 decline in the prior month core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government s gross domestic product measurement they were previously reported to have slipped 0 1 in march friday s report followed data this month showing weak retail sales industrial production and home sales that prompted economists to slash gdp growth forecasts for the second quarter the economy grew at a 3 2 annualised rate in the first quarter but the downward revision to march core capital goods shipments suggests business spending on equipment was even weaker than initially estimated during the quarter that could result in the january march gdp growth estimate being trimmed when the government publishes its revision next week jpmorgan on friday cut its second quarter growth estimate to a 1 0 rate from a 2 25 pace growth is mostly slowing as last year s massive stimulus from the trump administration s tax cuts and spending increases fades the dollar slipped against a basket on currencies in thin pre holiday trade u s treasury prices dipped while stocks on wall street were trading higher u s markets are closed on monday for the memorial day holiday weak data economists said the raft of weak data uncertainty over the trade war and sluggish global growth could force the federal reserve to cut interest rates the u s central bank recently suspended its three year interest rate hiking campaign and last month showed little desire to alter its monetary policy stance we had previously expected the next move from the fed would be a hike albeit at the very end of our forecast horizon in late 2020 said michael feroli an economist at jpmorgan in new york we now see the risks of the next move as about evenly distributed between a hike and a cut overall orders for durable goods items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more tumbled 2 1 in april after increasing 1 7 in the prior month orders for transportation equipment dropped 5 9 after rising 5 9 in march orders for motor vehicles and parts decreased 3 4 last month the most since may 2018 orders for non defence aircraft plunged 25 1 after rising 7 8 in march boeing reported receiving only four aircraft orders in april down from 44 in march all of the orders last month were for the company s fastest selling max 737 jetliner which was grounded in march after two fatal plane crashes in five months boeing has also suspended deliveries of the aircraft overall durable goods shipments fell 1 6 in april the most since december 2015 with civilian aircraft shipments tumbling 16 0 last month motor vehicle shipments dropped 3 4 durable goods inventories rose 0 4 last month boosted by stocks of motor vehicle and aircraft order books at factories also slipped in april that does not bode well for future production said joel naroff chief economist at naroff economic advisors in holland pennsylvania it is becoming clear that whatever boom the tax cuts may have created if they did much at all is largely gone source reuters reporting by lucia mutikani editing by andrea ricci
to the big time buysiders those investors more likely to check their portfolio by the season than the session it was just another week the s p 500 still shows a big green number for 2019 after all ditto the quants with their multiyear horizons and programmed strategies and hedge funds whose nerves have been on a show for a while now but for a host of investors traders and analysts this was the week markets finally woke up to a world of hurt president donald trump lit the touchpaper days before signing an order effectively curbing huawei technologies co s access to the american market the reaction was a slow burn but by monday us stocks were extending declines as major chipmakers prepared to cease business with the chinese giant tuesday s respite thanks to a partial walk back of the ban was brief by wednesday more companies were in trump s sights and more losses ensued thursday was a sea of red as the asian nation hardened its own rhetoric friday s bounce wasn t enough to prevent a fifth straight weekly drop for the dow jones industrial average the longest slump since 2011 the move against huawei a metaphorical hand grenade in the heart of global tech has forced market participants to ditch the rose tinted glasses now that they have not only does the prospect of a prolonged trade war confront them but a heap of other stuff too simmering tensions in the middle east a looming change in the uk government impeachment clamor in washington some familiar flash points in emerging markets that s an awful lot of risk at a time when many assets still look relatively expensive the market needed an excuse to correct and the trade war headlines were the trigger but the underlying weakness is much more complex than that said alberto tocchio the chief of heron asset management a switzerland based family office with 2 5 billion swiss francs 2 5 billion under management a continuous deterioration of the macro environment high valuations and political geopolitical uncertainty are also importantly weighing on markets viewed from afar the us stock picture doesn t look bad the s p 500 is about 4 per cent from a record peak still up 13 per cent in 2019 and price swings as measured by the cboe volatility index are higher than a month ago but still at about the one year average but look closer and the flaws and imperfections become clearer and the biggest blemish is arguably the tech sector the philadelphia stock exchange semiconductor index dropped 6 per cent this week on track for the worst month since the financial crisis the nasdaq 100 index is off almost 7 per cent from its all time peak at the start of the month a gauge of the fangs facebook inc amazon com inc netflix inc and alphabet inc has fallen faster still that s all vital because the phenomenal performance of tech shares has underpinned the decade long bull market from trough to peak the nasdaq 100 gained about twice as much as the s p 500 tech communications and consumer discretionary look to me to be the three areas to avoid now said david holohan head of equity strategy at mediolanum asset management in dublin the outlook has certainly deteriorated because of supply chain worries particularly on the semiconductor side and they re only going to get worse nor is the pain limited to american shares the three biggest stocks on the msci emerging markets index tencent holdings ltd alibaba group holding ltd and taiwan semiconductor manufacturing co are having a miserable month the developing world is another of those ugly marks in global markets just now alongside a crisis of confidence for foreign investors in turkey the rhetoric between the us and iran has been ratcheting up money has been fleeing the most actively traded emerging market etf the doubts about tech have fed into a broader pessimism on wall street short interest as a percentage of shares outstanding on the largest s p 500 etf jumped as high as 7 per cent this week according to data from ihs markit ltd that s the highest level since 2015 part of the trigger back then was the prospect of interest rates rising for the first time in almost a decade the federal reserve played its part in the market wake up call this week with minutes from the latest meeting showing policymakers in no rush toward easier policy even as markets price in rate cuts there are many who argue moves in the stock market are largely decided by moves in the rates market since they both react to the same macro catalysts it s hard to prove or disprove but a chart of the s p 500 and the yield on 10 year treasuries for thursday lays bare the close relationship bond yields are marching lower amid increasing conviction that this tightening cycle is over and the 10 year yield hit the lowest since 2017 in the week the heart of all this is not the trade war itself but its potential impact on global economic growth a slew of economists at wall street s biggest firms and beyond took a bearish lurch this week with the likes of goldman sachs group inc and jpmorgan chase co rewriting forecasts for how bad the protectionist showdown will get we will need to get used to the idea that the chances of a good trade

critics have been having a bit of a hard time since last month when the international monetary fund imf upgraded china s growth forecast for 2019 in the world economic outlook report the global lender revised its estimate for china s growth for the year to 6 3 percent the highest among the five major economies of the world the imf is not alone in sharing the positive outlook international financial institutions like j p morgan chase co hsbc and citibank have all revised china s growth to a higher estimate this has triggered thought and debate among china watchers who are trying to decipher the reasons why china is still going strong in 2019 despite a gloomier global outlook foremost is the improved stability of the economy for the last two consecutive months the official manufacturing pmi remained above the neutral value of 50 the pmi or purchasing managers index is an attribute which highlights the direction of trends in the manufacturing and service sectors its consistency depicts resilience in these two sectors and translates into stability at the national level another evidence of stability comes from a research note by the asian financial service group nomura earlier this month the group stated that china s headline consumer price index cpi might rise in the coming months but at the same time it predicted that the annual inflation figure will likely be around 2 5 comfortably below the government s target of 3 the government s steady focus on improving the quality of its development process has also contributed to the revision by the imf there has been increased investment in industries that deal with high tech production whereas investment in manufacturing and services has added the qualitative element china s economic structure is also being upgraded through its efforts to embrace innovation according to government guidelines china has to work towards becoming an innovative nation by next year an objective that is being pursued by focusing more on science and technology as china transforms its economy taking the cue from the government the private sector has also carried out its own innovative adaptations it is upgrading its production lines and designs to meet the demands of modern consumers and compete with international standards the private public push towards innovation is thus improving the quality of china s growth the central economic work conference cewc a meeting of the chinese authorities top political and finance officials held its annual session in december last year and vowed to keep china s prudent monetary policy neither too tight nor too loose market liquidity was meanwhile to be maintained at a reasonably ample level these decisions promised stimulation of a growth in credit and social financing and have since had a pronounced effect on national activity a policy stimulus by the government introduced at the start of 2019 also aimed at augmenting the private economy in addition to other areas it focused on developing small and medium sized enterprises a segment that is considered a significant economic driver moreover a corporate tax cut plan of up to 2 trillion yuan per year was released by the state council along with the central bank s continuous reduction of reserve requirement ratios rrrs to allow for increased fiscal spending multiple indicators also show the effectiveness of these policies the industrial sector is making a remarkable comeback with profits of leading firms surging the property sector is becoming fairly stable and the consumption of luxury items is rising the domestic consumer too is emerging as a strong force adding to the profits from foreign markets perhaps the most noteworthy engine of china s economy has been the belt and road initiative bri the infrastructure project spans multiple continents and contributes to the prosperity of participating nations china included this year the bri has led to china s impressive trade performance customs data reveal that the volume of china s exports and imports was up 4 3 year on year while trade with bri members remained higher than one fourth of the total foreign trade surveys were recently conducted at the american chamber of commerce in china and the european union chamber of commerce in china they respectively found china to be a major investment destination and the next harbor of their businesses expansion official estimates of economists confidence have likewise been encouraging as the evaluation index of the first quarter of 2019 rose sharply from that of the previous year observers have showed a positive view of china s economic growth despite their less optimistic view of global growth the second largest economy has learned to adjust itself to adapt to

first there was tether a controversial dollar backed cryptocurrency by crypto exchange firm bitfinex then came petro the industry s first oil backed crypto issued by the venezuelan government last year and now we might be about to see the first gold backed cryptocurrency by a central bank no less according to russian news agency tass russia s central bank the bank of russia will consider issuing gold backed cryptocurrencies a rather strange move considering how cryptocurrencies are generally anathema to central banks shot in the arm but before crypto bugs can start doing a round of high fives the head of the bank of russia elvira nabiullina has revealed that the cryptocurrencies are not meant for retail use but rather for conducting big mutual settlements for entities with global jurisdictions in other words only the heavyweights will get to lay their hands on them further she says that she still believes that it s better for countries to develop international settlement systems such as the eurasian economic union eaeu framework that use their own national currencies noting the said framework has demonstrated good dynamics finally she admonishes that the latest twist should not be interpreted to mean that the bank supports a scenario where cryptocurrencies eventually replace fiat in the monetary system the bank of russia s latest move is a belated concession that cryptocurrencies do have a place in the modern monetary system whether banks and financial institutions like it or not it s a big shot in the arm for an industry that has endured so much unmerited criticism animus and outright rejection last month the bank of russia released a policy brief outlining the potential benefits of cbdcs central bank digital currencies including being less risky than existing systems and a more liquid asset that can lower transaction costs it s worth noting that the bank cited lack of anonymity as the only major drawback of cbdcs and possibly cryptos by extension russia s largest bank is not the only one to endorse cryptos though it s the only central bank to date to expressly say it s seriously considering launching one a couple of days ago the european central bank ecb declared that cryptocurrencies are not a threat to the region s financial stability closer home jpmorgan launched jpm coin in february a stablecoin meant for clients of its wholesale payments business each jpm coin is pegged to a dollar finally last year a banking consortium launched we trade a challenger to ripple the cryptocurrency that facilitates interbank transfers commodity backed cryptos survive recently cointelegraph reported that bank of russia was discussing mutual settlements with venezuela in petro and the russian ruble that will certainly mark a major milestone for maduro s infantile cryptocurrency related is this the world s first truly democratic stock exchange when president maduro s beleaguered government launched petro last year we dismissed it arguing it was destined to fail due to lack of trust from the community with commodity backed cryptos having their fair share of scandals what we failed to anticipate was the brutal determination by the venezuelan government in making sure it s brainchild not only survives but thrives since then maduro has elevated petro to an alternate official currency while using underhand tactics such as converting pensioners payments to the cryptocurrency without their consent in a bid to make it go mainstream popular crypto blog ccn reported in january that petro seems to be alive and well despite lack of evidence for the oil stockpiles that are supposed to back it up and also being user unfriendly and now venezuela s petro is about to get a new lease on life after teaming up with another renegade both countries eschew the dollar viewing it as being too dominant and hope the new cryptocurrency will help them ditch the american currency yet another stablecoin the dollar backed tether seems to be doing well too despite its share of controversies a month ago new york ag charged bitfinex with dipping into its tether cash reserves to cover up internal losses the fact that many commodity backed cryptos seem to be surviving major trust issues is almost a validation of the whole idea of having a physical commodity back stopping a digital currency the new ones by russia s central bank will have a much lower hurdle to clear by alex kimani for safehaven com more top reads from safehaven com

the twelve months ended 31 december 2018 full year results 2018 were rescheduled to 24 may 2019 due to the need to complete the comprehensive capital structure review of the group as was announced by the company on 15 april 2019 nyrstar initiated a review of its capital structure the capital structure review in october 2018 in response to the challenging financial and operating conditions being faced by the group as previously announced these conditions included substantial working capital and liquidity outflows experienced during the fourth quarter of 2018 and first quarter of 2019 necessitating the raising of urgent short term funding combined with the group s materially reduced underlying ebitda performance in 2018 and the maturity of certain liabilities during 2019 these factors resulted in the need to reconsider the group s capital structure the capital structure review identified a very substantial additional funding requirement that the group is unable to meet without a material reduction of the group s indebtedness as a consequence the capital structure review has necessitated negotiations between the group s financial creditors in order to develop a deleveraging and funding plan as part of a comprehensive balance sheet recapitalisation alternatives to such a recapitalisation would place the future of the group and its stakeholders at severe risk as at the date of this announcement the company is in the process of implementing the recapitalision the company has received from its auditor and is publishing today an opinion issued in accordance with article 143 2 of the belgian company code non compliance opinion on the basis that certain information requested from the company was not timely delivered the company is working hard to deliver such information to its auditor with the intention that the auditor will issue its audit opinion once it has audited such information the full year results that are published today will then again be published to the market together with the audit opinion that the auditor will then issue group financial overview group gross profit for 2018 of eur 1 118 million was up 4 on 2017 driven by higher zinc production volumes in mining and metals processing and marginally higher zinc and gold prices which were both up 1 partially offset by deteriorating benchmark zinc treatment charge terms and a weaker us dollar against the euro direct operating costs for 2018 of eur 1 014 million increased 16 on 2017 due to higher zinc production volumes in mining and metals processing higher electricity prices at the smelters increased mining costs as a result of the restart of operations at myra falls and the ramp up of mining operations at middle tennessee group underlying ebitda of eur 99 million in 2018 a decrease of 52 on 2017 due to a weakening of the us dollar against the euro lower lead and silver prices a 15 reduction in the benchmark zinc treatment charge higher direct operating costs per tonne of zinc in both mining and metals processing underlying adjustments in 2018 were a total of eur 49 million comprising eur 2 million of embedded derivatives eur 22 million of restructuring expense eur 1 million of m a related transaction expense and eur 30 million of other expenditure relating primarily to the write off of payments that were connected with the divestment of the el toqui mine in chile depreciation depletion and amortisation expense for 2018 of eur 162 million was up 4 year on year in 2018 the company recognised a non cash pre tax impairment loss of eur 99 million 2017 impairment gain of eur 126 million this impairment loss 2017 impairment gain relates fully to pre tax impairment losses on nyrstar s mining assets eur 85 9 million at langlois and myra falls and specific asset write offs in metals processing eur 11 4 million net finance expense including foreign exchange for 2018 of eur 151 million eur 207 million in 2017 primarily due to a net foreign exchange gain of eur 6 5 million in 2018 compared to a loss of eur 59 9 million in 2017 the interest expense in 2018 of eur 128 3 million was higher than in 2017 eur 104 4 million nyrstar recognised an income tax expense for the year ended 31 december 2018 of eur 250 million 2017 income tax benefit of eur 37 million representing an effective income tax rate of 68 9 for the year ended 31 december 2017 481 3 the tax rate is impacted by non recognition of current year losses and by the de recognition of previous losses relating mainly to nyrstar sales marketing ag the us group and the canadian group given it is not probable that these tax losses will be used in the future considering forecast profit projections loss after tax of eur 618 million in 2018 compared to a net profit of eur 47 million in 2017 mainly as a result of the impairment charges related to the write down of the carrying value of the langlois and myra falls mines the partial de recognition of nyrstar sales marketing ag and nyrstar us deferred tax assets due to reduced expected recoverability and the operational losses incurred in 2018 and change of control impacts capital expenditure was eur 229 million in 2018 representing a decrease of 37 year on year driven by a substantial reduction in metals processing from eur 303 million in 2017 to eur 126 million in 2018 with the completion of the port pirie redevelopment and a eur 45 million increase in mining with the restart of the myra falls mine net debt at the end of 2018 at eur 1 643 million excluding the zinc metal prepay was 49 higher compared to the end of 2017 eur 1 102 million at the end of 2017 predominantly due to substantial working capital outflow during q4 2018 due to higher commodity prices no new silver prepays in h2 2018 reduction in non committed letter of credit lines from banking counterparties tightened credit terms with a number of suppliers the reclassification of eur 82 5 million and eur 50 7 million of prepayments for deliveries of silver metal and zinc metal respectively from deferred income to loans and borrowing at 31 december 2018 as the group had no ability to settle by physical delivery of silver metal and zinc metal respectively from its own production and the reclassification of perpetual securities eur 174 9 million at 31 december 2018 from equity to loans and borrowings 6 the net debt inclusive of the zinc metal prepay and perpetual securities at the end of 2018 was eur 1 771 million up 30 compared to the end of 2017 cash balance at the end of 2018 was eur 239 million compared to eur 68 million at the end of 2017 safety health and environment prevent harm is a core value of nyrstar the company is committed to maintaining safe operations and to proactively managing risks including with respect to people and the environment at nyrstar we work together to create a workplace where all risks are effectively identified and controlled and everyone goes home safe and healthy each day of their working life in 2018 we placed particular emphasis on the prevention of hand injuries which account for a large portion of our total injuries a dedicated hand injury prevention program entitled because some tools cannot be replaced was introduced at all operations with the purpose of eliminating unsafe conditions contributing to hand injuries improving tools and personal protective equipment and changing at risk behaviours relevant to hand injuries we also continued the implementation of the process safety management system launched in 2017 and strengthened controls related to hydrogen explosion risks at our smelters the group continued to make significant progress in safety performance no severe irreversible injuries occurred the frequency rate of cases with time lost or under

higher energy prices in europe and australia during h2 2018 and the suspension of operations at port pirie in december 2018 partially offset by higher production of zinc copper silver and minor metals marginally stronger year over year gross profit up 1 at eur 863 million in 2018 was mainly driven by higher zinc prices up 1 compared to 2017 which were constrained by the zinc price collar hedging in place at that time and higher production volumes of zinc metal and by products largely offset by a 19 decrease in zinc and lead treatment charge income annual 2018 zinc benchmark treatment charge terms were settled during q2 2018 at approximately 15 below the 2017 terms at usd 147 per tonne of concentrate the total premium gross profit contributions were relatively flat compared to 2017 down 2 driven by marginally higher volumes and relatively flat average realised premia rates by product gross profit contributions were positively impacted by higher gold and sulphuric acid prices and higher production volumes of copper silver gold indium and sulphuric acid compared to 2017 after a fire in q4 2015 the indium plant was re built in 2016 and resumed production by the end of q1 2017 with 29 8 tonnes of indium metal produced in 2017 and a further ramped up production volume of 42 6 tonnes in 2018 direct operating costs increased in 2018 up 12 compared to 2017 at eur 727 million due to

capital expenditure guidance provided for 2018 eur 130 million to eur 140 million compared to 2017 eur 303 million the lower capital expenditure has been driven by the completion of the port pirie

tonnes of zinc metal in 2018 representing a 4 increase on 2017 the increase in zinc metal production year over year was despite the planned maintenance shuts at auby balen clarksville and hobart and was assisted by a lack of material unplanned outages which had impacted production volumes in 2016 and 2017 however zinc and lead metal production was impacted during q4 2018 by lower raw material inventory as a consequence of the company s liquidity constraints lead metal production at port pirie of 160kt was down 7 year over year due to a 38 day planned blast furnace maintenance outage in q2 2018 and a shut of the blast furnace for december 2018 during december 2018 the company chose not to operate the old sinter plant at port pirie in order to further support reducing lead in air emissions which ended the year below the defined limit in addition nyrstar also performed maintenance on the tsl furnace and blast furnace during december 2018 these maintenance shuts were to address

lower level of zinc in concentrate production has been largely due to disappointing production performance of the langlois and the middle tennessee mines and commercial production at the myra falls mine commencing slightly later than had been originally anticipated at the start of the year and the impact of the suspension of ore extraction at year end to address deficiencies identified in compliance orders from the ministry for energy mines petroleum resources in british columbia other developments port pirie redevelopment on 1 february 2019 nyrstar published an operational and financial update which included amongst other items a financial update with regards to the port pirie redevelopment the company provides the following additional clarification with regards to the latest port pirie redevelopment guidance the historic and normalised forecast pro forma underlying ebitda for port pirie hobart and australian metals processing is summarised in the table below pro forma underlying ebitda eurm 2016a 2017a 2018a 2019f 2020f port pirie 8 18 11 38 56 hobart 51 40 31 57 69 australian metals processing 59 58 20 95 125 the total pro forma underlying ebitda guidance of eur 95 million and eur 125 million for australian metals processing in fy 2019 and fy 2020 respectively is the aggregate of the total pro forma underlying ebitda contribution from both the port pirie and the hobart smelters under normalised liquidity and operating conditions this guidance is not incremental or uplift as was the case for the port pirie redevelopment guidance provided before 1 february 2019 and will be materially negatively impacted by the liquidity constraints that have been experienced by the group in q4 2018 and h1 2019 the normalised underlying ebitda guidance is the total pro forma ebitda contribution from the two australian smelters the main factors driving the negative pro forma underlying ebitda result for port pirie in 2018 were a combination of increased costs due to the continued ramp up of the tsl furnace with the parallel operation of the sinter plant and higher energy prices production outage in december 2018 and technical process bottlenecks which reduced the recovery of metal from the feed other macro factors such as lower lead treatment charges and metal prices also negatively impacted the pro forma underlying ebitda at port pirie the allocation of additional costs to residues between 2016 and 2018 has had an impact on the guided pro forma underlying ebitda contribution from the port pirie redevelopment in fy 2019 and to a lesser extent in fy 2020 as was disclosed in nyrstar s press release on 1 february 2019 the processing of historical inventory will provide a cash flow benefit of approximately eur 70 million in fy 2019 if there had not been costs allocated to these residues in 2016 to 2018 the underlying ebitda contribution from port pirie in fy 2019 would be approximately eur 70 million higher the other main reasons for the current lower but still material pro forma underlying ebitda contribution guidance from the port pirie redevelopment as compared to previous guidance are lower metal recovery assumptions as a result of technical process bottlenecks at port pirie which results in a reduction in free metal extracted from all feed processed by port pirie these bottlenecks primarily the slag fumer and copper plant at port pirie were identified in the preparation of the 5 year business plan for the capital structure review process and were incorporated in the pro forma underlying ebitda modelling for australian metals processing and the application of one year of actual operating data instead of the projected data which nyrstar previously needed to rely on as was indicated in the operational and financial update published on 1 february 2019 the metals processing segment profitability of both the australian sites are intrinsically linked by the raw material flows between the two sites and are only possible due to the port pirie redevelopment in the absence of the port pirie redevelopment the hobart and port pirie sites would both be non operational and would not contribute ebitda to the metals processing segment furthermore the pro forma underlying ebitda of the two sites individually but not of australian metal processing overall depends on the internal re charge arrangements between the two sites for internal residues that are used as feedstock at the sites for this reason to provide more clarity the company has decided to show the proforma underlying ebitda for australian metal processing with a breakdown of this figure to port pirie and hobart the total project cost for the port pirie redevelopment was approximately aud 714 million this is inclusive of the feasibility study costs and project management labour costs management changes in connection with the capital structure review process nyrstar announced on 18 january 2019 that mr martyn konig had taken up the role of executive chairman and that mr roman matej had been appointed to serve as interim chief financial officer mr michel abaza the former chief financial officer left the nyrstar group with immediate effect strategic foreign exchange hedges since 2016 nyrstar has entered into a series of 12 month rolling foreign exchange options to hedge the company s monthly exposure related to the direct operating costs denominated in australian dollars aud canadian dollars cad and in euro eur utilising put and call collar structures during the course of 2018 eur usd exposure was unhedged in h1 2018 and hedged on a fixed forward basis at 1 18 in h2 2018 for the aud usd transactional exposure various collars were executed resulting in a weighted average collar of 0 70 to 0 80 for approximately 100 of 2018 for the cad usd transactional exposure on langlois various collars were executed resulting in a weighted average collar of 1 32 to 1 36 for approximately 100 of 2018 transactional cad usd currency exposure for the mining segment was hedged with a fixed forward of 1 32 in 2019 in january and february 2019 nyrstar unwound all of its strategic forward foreign exchange hedges due to the loss of credit lines from the hedge counterparties strategic metal price hedges in h1 2018 nyrstar had in place zinc price collar hedges to protect 70 of total free metal produced at the zinc smelters and north american mines within a price range of usd 2 300 t and usd 3 094 t above and below these prices nyrstar s exposure was limited to 30 of the total free metal produced in h2 2018 nyrstar had in place zinc price collar hedges to protect 50 of total free metal produced at the zinc smelters and north american mines within a price range of usd 2 600 t and usd 3 842 t above and below these prices nyrstar s exposure was limited to 50 of the total free metal produced during 2018 nyrstar continued with its 12 month rolling hedging programme and had hedged the majority of its zinc free metal exposure 150kt for the mining segment at c usd 3 000 t zinc in concentrate production in 2020 was also partly hedged with approximately 16kt hedged at a zinc price of c usd 2 900 t in december 2018 nyrstar terminated all of its strategic metal hedges to provide additional liquidity to the business metal at risk hedging at any given time nyrstar holds metal either as work in progress or finished good inventory that has been priced in but not priced out as this metal remains exposed to fluctuations in the underlying metal price until it is priced out it is called metal at risk the actual metal at risk at any given point in time fluctuates with deliveries of raw materials and production levels as a risk mitigation process nyrstar has always consistently monitored its metal at risk on an ongoing basis and undertaken hedging to mitigate the metal price exposure in what nyrstar refers to as transactional hedging the price of placing these transactional hedges is dependent on whether future or forward prices are higher or lower than current or spot prices as indicated by the shape of the forward underlying metal price curve future prices can be either higher or lower than current prices depending on a range of factors and can change quite rapidly at times the hedges required to hedge nyrstar s metal at risk position are determined by whether the net position is positive meaning nyrstar has more metal priced in than is priced out or alternatively is negative meaning nyrstar has more metal priced out than is priced in as announced by nyrstar on 1 february 2019 it has been continuing to manage tightly its cash and inventory levels and has been evaluating additional measures to improve its liquidity position during the course of march 2019 nyrstar closed out all of its metal at risk hedge positions to release cash collateralized against the credit lines as a consequence of closing out these metal at risk hedges nyrstar realised a one off cash benefit of approximately usd 40 million and is now fully exposed to fluctuations in metal prices for its metal at risk cyber attack in january 2019 nyrstar was subject to a cyber attack certain it systems including email were impacted the cyber attack issue was subsequently contained and resolved the operational and financial impact of the cyber attack on nyrstar s metals processing and mining operations was not significant perpetual securities distribution amount on 29 april 2019 nyrstar port pirie pty ltd notified the holder of the perpetual securities that it elected to cash pay all of the distribution amount interest fees on the perpetual securities for the period 27 november 2018 to 27 may 2019 being aud 13 2 million and also that it would redeem 29 125

this is an excerpt from regional security in the middle east sectors variables and issues get your free copy here science and technology enhance the capabilities of states and societies to obtain and transform resources necessary for their development and advancement on the other hand lack of scientific knowledge and access to technology not only affects a country s level of development but also jeopardises its national security in an anarchic international system security interdependence implies that the security of a state is closely tied to the security of the other states and especially its neighbours since national securities are interdependent the security or insecurity of a state may have a considerable impact not only on the security of its immediate neighbours but also on the security of the whole region in which it is geographically embedded regional security technology as a factor affecting national security is closely related to population growth the greater the population growth and the greater the pace of the technological development of a country the greater the likelihood its activities and interests beyond its borders will expand the greater the demographic growth and the less rapid the technological development of a country the greater the likelihood it will face significant socio economic problems and instability choucri 2002 98 in other words unevenness in the interactive growth and development within and across the societies contributes to unevenness in the size development and capabilities of such societies to differential capabilities among them and to competitions conflicts and violence choucri 1984 as an engine of growth the potential of technology is still largely untapped in the middle east where states not only lack adequate skilled labour and capital but also use these factors less efficiently therefore the purpose of this chapter is to investigate the impact of science and technology on national and regional security in the middle east in doing so the chapter is divided into six sections the first section discusses the relationship between technology and development while the second section explores the relevance of science and technology to security drawing on a historical analysis the third section examines the reasons science and technology have not so far played an effective role in the development of middle eastern states and societies the next section identifies and discusses the instruments and patterns of technological development in the contemporary middle east the last section of the paper offers a sectoral analysis of the relationship between science and technology on the one hand and security national and regional in the middle east on the other the technology development relationship the commonly held view is that technology and development are strongly linked with development driven by technology and technology serving as a key indicator of national development in reality however technological change is often highly problematic with respect to its socio economic and environmental implications as it may exacerbate inequality uneven development ecological degradation and or social exclusion murphy 2017 1 a critical understanding of the drivers dynamics implications and geographically uneven distributions of technology and technological change is thus an important component of development studies and practice murphy 2017 1 generally speaking technology is the branch of knowledge that deals with the creation and use of technical means and their interrelation with life society and the environment drawing upon such subjects as industrial arts engineering sciences and applied sciences in this sense technology is embedded deeply in social cultural economic and political systems due to its spatial diffusion technology has uneven geographies of use significance and impact murphy 2017 1 with respect to development technology is seen as an essential driver and determinant of socioeconomic cultural environmental and political change economically technology can increase national productivity through improvements to the efficiency of production and logistics while encouraging and enhancing innovation and knowledge creation alternatively technology can exacerbate socioeconomic differences and create uneven development within and between countries and regions culturally technology has a profound effect on the norms and identities that help to constitute particular social groups environmentally technology can contribute in significant ways to greener and more sustainable societies or exacerbate ecological degradation through intensified or expanded impacts locally and globally politically technology can have democratising effects e g the facebook revolutions in the middle east or it can facilitate enhanced forms of repression or surveillance by state authorities hanska 2016 32 science and technology are key drivers of development this is because technological and scientific revolutions and innovations underpin economic advances and contribute to improvements in health systems education and infrastructure thus developments in science and technology have profound effects on economic and social development apart from constituting a salient political issue access to and application of technology are critical to a country s development by the same token access to high quality education especially higher education is essential for the creation of scientific knowledge science and technology are the differentiating factors among countries separating those that are able to tackle poverty effectively by growing and developing their economies and those that are not the level of countries economic development depends to a large extent on their ability to grasp and apply insights from science and technology and use them creatively to promote technological advances developing countries need to invest in quality education for youth continuous skills training for workers and managers as well as to ensure that knowledge is shared as widely as possible across society moreover adopting appropriate technologies leads directly to higher productivity which is the key to growth creativity and technological innovation emerge naturally in societies that have large stocks and flows of knowledge in sharp contrast in societies with limited stocks of knowledge creative people feel constrained and migrate to other countries thereby causing brain drain to their own countries and societies such societies are prone to remain in poverty and dependency hence in the presence of many social economic and defence needs and demands access to quality education as well as the adoption and application of appropriate technologies do not only constitute a policy question but also a question of policy priorities moreover both of these questions are tied to a country s political development science technology and security it has been suggested stivachtis 2011 397 422 that development and security are interrelated indeed the end of the cold war allowed the identification of development with human security undp 1993 2 for instance the declaration on the right to development 1986 2 asserts that all human beings have a human right to development and that development has been consequently subdivided into several sectors such as political development economic development and socio cultural development in addition development and the environment are inextricably linked undp 1994 24 40 moreover it has been shown stivachtis 2011 414 that there is a close relationship between development sectors and security sectors in the sense that the absence or presence of development in a particular sector impacts security and vice versa for example political development is related to political security while economic development is related to economic security as a result lack of political development has the potential of enhancing political insecurity yet as in the case of security problems in one development sector may affect other development sectors and as an extension the corresponding security sectors for instance political underdevelopment may affect economic development and therefore a state s economic security this means that security and development can to a great extent be operationalised in the same way mittleman 1988 22 yet it has been argued stivachtis 2011 415 that national security becomes inextricably connected to national development this means that neither development can be achieved without security nor security without development one of the most important questions in the field of security and development studies is whether a particular security or development sector is so significant that policy priority should be given to it the expectation is that if problems threats in this sector are addressed this would have positive effects on the other sectors addressing this question political scientists stress the political prerequisites for economic development political order and stability implying the presence and function of viable institutions and enforceable rules almond and coleman 1960 almond and powell 1966 for example whether political instability in a country may result from the inability of the national government to promote economic development and create sustainable and effective welfare mechanisms or from its inability to manage social and political change in a period of rapid economic growth political development appears to be fundamental as far as the last point is concerned the record contradicts the conventional wisdom that the way to avoid political instability is to stimulate economic development and industrialisation olsen 1963 empirical research shows that whatever the long term benefits of modernisation its short term impact tends to be more instability and sometimes violence skocpol 1994 feierabend et al 1966 thus discussion about development has emphasised political development meaning the need to establish institutions capable of managing socio political tensions and preventing their escalation into violence that may threaten the security of the state and its citizens however since developing states have widely divergent social economic and political attributes this diversity implies the absence of a unique policy formula that could apply without distinction to any developing state development enhances state power and capabilities and enhances national security on the other hand security provides the fertile ground for development while any threats to security ultimately affect development underdevelopment on the other hand increases the vulnerability of the state thereby enhancing its insecurity science and technology are key drivers of development and therefore central not only to a country s socio economic development but also its national security science technology and development in the middle east a historical account over the centuries scientific and technological advances have repeatedly enabled foreign powers to interfere with the functioning of middle eastern economies as well as to undermine the security of the less advanced countries of the region this section will discuss some of the main technology related events that led to this situation which continues today following the rise of islam in the seventh century science and technology flourished in the islamic world to a far greater extent than in the west muslim rulers promoted the translation of greek philosophy and science and then encouraged further scientific exploration in numerous fields including mathematics astronomy medicine pharmacology optics chemistry and physics much of the knowledge developed by the muslims and transmitted to the europeans enabled europe to emerge from the dark ages into the renaissance saliba 2011 until the sixteenth century the arab world was connected by a unique system of trade and transport that unified its large population scattered over vast areas of land and sea the system sustained the economy of each arab state underpinned trade with europe and fed into the various international trading systems bahlan 1999 261 in fact the arabs had developed an effective transnational trading system which reached its peak in the eighth to sixteenth centuries and which was based on local technological inputs such as skilled merchants and caravan managers navigators with extensive geographic knowledge efficiently operated ports and trading emporia scientifically bred camels and seaworthy dhows bahlan 1999 262 trust and mutual dependence among closely knit social groups prevailed the socioeconomic support of the transport and trading system enhanced regional harmony and the stability of local communities the mechanics of the arab trading system were so flexible that traders could move their business readily from place to place in response to changes in supply and demand or in order to avoid ruthless rulers or areas of conflict bahlan 1999 263 since trade brought prosperity and employment local governments sought to attract traders and provide security and support facilities to ease the process of trade and the life of the traveller the arab transport system was responsible for the large scale circulation of people and information this included the diffusion of agricultural products inventions and all types of knowledge thus the trade and transport system had a powerful economic social and cultural impact it also integrated the economies of arab countries with each other and with those of asia the mediterranean and africa according to antoine zahlan 1999 there are three main reasons middle eastern countries lag behind in terms of technology and scientific knowledge their loss of trade and transportation systems the effects of the industrial revolution on arab economies and the political and economic effects of the colonisation and neo colonisation processes the collapse of the arab trade and transport systems the collapse of the arab trade and transportation systems was induced by portuguese technological advances in ship design navigation and naval warfare guilmartin 1974 the strategic breakthrough was the invention of transoceanic ships these ships could carry a large number of guns and could navigate the high seas the arabs failed to acquire or develop the necessary technological capabilities to match portuguese naval vessels the small but powerful portuguese fleet interfered violently with trade between the arab world asia and africa guilmartin 1974 the portuguese used their superior naval force to harass and interfere with shipping attack coastal towns loot ships and pillage coastal towns ottoman technical assistance to the cities of the arabian peninsula ultimately saved the people of the arab coastal towns from outright massacre by the portuguese for the next three centuries the forces of the ottoman empire protected the region from european devastation however the ottomans themselves were unable to cope with european technological challenges and their empire eventually collapsed portugal s naval technology diffused to the european atlantic states by the early seventeenth century the british the dutch and the french had displaced the portuguese from the indian ocean between 1620 and 1670 these three countries introduced a new innovation the east india company which controlled fleets marketing systems finances storage space and armies platt 1977 while arab trade depended on the efforts of a very large number of traders operating in a small scale and each working on their own the east india company was centrally managed possessing the financial resources necessary to exercise monopolistic behaviour and thus control markets consequently the east india company quickly managed to eliminate arab long distance trade platt 1977 by the eighteenth century trade routes throughout the middle east were being reoriented toward coastal towns and european trade and transport whereas the arab international trading system had been heavily land based and internal the new system was heavily dependent on european shipping and trade bahlan 1996 264 this loss was soon followed by the progressive displacement of internal land based long distance travel services by european shipping no serious arab competition arose to challenge the rapid development of european mediterranean shipping firms headrick 1981 when in 1832 the french occupied algeria and later tunisia and morocco they sought to close all trans saharan routes which were being used by resistance movements and by clandestine trade bahlan 1999 265 thus by the early twentieth century the complex and rich system of internal trans saharan transport had been dismantled two further technological developments accelerated the dismantling of regional and local trade and transport systems the construction and operation of railway systems by foreign firms and the construction of the suez canal headrick 1981 by the latter part of the nineteenth century the national systems of trade and transport had disintegrated to the level where they were replaced by totally imported systems with very little local participation zahlan and zahlan 1978 the displacement of camel based transport technology with railway and steamship technologies without the transfer of mechanical and new naval technologies meant that the arabs lost the employment generated by operating their system of transport headrick 1981 even today arab countries remain unable to acquire the employment derived from operating and maintaining their extensive transport systems the strength of the arab and muslim worlds was based on a common market and not on political unity although many arab countries were in conflict this did not eliminate trade and cultural exchanges between them but as the arabs were unable to acquire adopt or develop alternative technologies to contain technological challenges which eventually led to the collapse of the transnational arab trading system the forces that bound the arab communities to each other were loosened and the cohesiveness of the arab world began to weaken industrial revolution the second phase of technology dismantling was induced by the industrial revolution which undermined the traditional textile industries that were firmly based in arab countries steam power machine production chemical sciences and technology electrification petroleum production and refining communication technologies radio electric power and engineering and countless advances in medical science construction technologies city planning and management systems all had dramatic consequences for the arab world every technological advance in europe contributed to the continuing decline of inter arab cohesiveness zahlan and zahaln 1997 the acquisition of western military technologies beginning with the ottomans and muhammad ali led to the progressive divorce of military institutions from their local environment and to their progressive integration into the military industrial intelligence complexes of western powers new technology was imported in a dependent mode and packaged with its consultants contractors operators and financiers and without any effort being made to develop new technologies at home zahlan and zahlan 1991 the cost of this dependency was enormous as were the resulting economic and political consequences of the egyptian and ottoman debts the occupation of egypt in 1882 and the collapse of the economy of the ottoman empire colonisation and independence the third phase of technology dismantling began with the direct occupation of arab countries when practically every single important decision was made by the emissaries of the colonial powers colonialism affected all aspects of life in the middle east the net result was the further divorce of the elites the culture and the economy of the region from technical matters zahlan 1999 267 the fourth phase was induced by political independence when independence was achieved the rulers and elites of the new states had little knowledge of contemporary developments in science and technology which had become so central to the industrialised world in the late twentieth century not only did all equipment industrial supplies and maintenance services have to be imported but also arab countries depended completely on foreign consulting and contracting services helie 1973 the new leaders sought to develop their countries through the rapid expansion of educational systems and investment in new industries cultural distortions and alienation were intensified by the accelerated programs adopted at this time beblawi and luciani 1987 because they wished to accelerate the process of development the new national elites unknowingly adopted methods that ultimately led to even greater technological dependence as a result foreign consulting firms conceived and designed enormous projects foreign accounting and law firms monitored them and an army of foreign contractors and foreign labour implemented them zahlan and zahlan 1978 although major things were built such as power and desalination plants hospitals irrigation schemes enormous dams transport systems and airports locals contributed little to the process beblawi and luciani 1987 however those who mediated these contracts earned enormous commissions and well placed people accumulated personal fortunes in the billions of dollars zahlan and zahlan 1984 meanwhile the gap between the arab world and industrial countries has continued to grow and arab economies still suffer from chronic stagnation and low productivity components and instruments of technology systems the major instruments of national technological development are university education systems research and development r d national consulting and contracting firms relevant economic and financial institutions to support technological development and science policy zahlan 1996 269 there has been a significant and dramatic expansion of the proportion of people in the middle east who have completed four or more years of higher education the number of universities has also increased including a significant number of foreign universities kjerfve 2014 yet the quality of higher education in the middle east is among the lowest in the world only two or three arab universities are in the list of the top 500 universities in the world and none is in the top 200 employers in the region complain that university graduates lack the skills needed to work in the global marketplace many are not well trained in science mathematics engineering and other technical subjects where the jobs are furthermore these graduates lack the soft skills including creativity and teamwork partly because their training has emphasised memorisation and rote learning devarajan 2016 much of the emphasis of arab foreign education has been in science and engineering qasem 1998 doctoral level knowledge producing education however is still highly underdeveloped in the region and therefore specialisation is pursued abroad dini et al 2015 arab universities have been the leading centres for both basic and applied research in science and technology the number of professors in arab universities has increased with the majority of them associated with science and technology zahlan 2012 the number of research and development centres also increased with half of them engaging in research in agriculture nutrition water and irrigation marine sciences and the biological science the rest focus on oil and petrochemicals ecology basic sciences and computer science lightfoot 2018 research activity in arab countries is thus highly focused on applied subjects with a priority in medicine and agriculture despite the valiant efforts of a number of scientists basic research is on such a small scale that it is virtually non existent zahlan 2012 r d organisations play a major role in successful planning design and operation of economic installations however because the consulting and contracting services utilised in establishing industrial plants are generally imported on a turnkey basis the demand for local r d services is still limited sehnaoui 2017 technological dependence severely constrains the development of the requisite r d capabilities to support and service the various economic sectors zahlan 2014 arab science and technology related human resources are more than adequate and could in principle constitute an integrative social factor but in the absence of rational and appropriate science policies and adequate financial resources the potential of this human resource is dissipated zahlan 2012 the reason for such a low figure is the lack of resources and the absence of demand for services by nationals both the public and private sectors depend nearly exclusively on foreign firms for technical services zahlan 2014 arab countries are near the top of the developing world level of activity but far below the levels of industrial countries thus although the output may be comparable the application of scientific findings is more constrained than in other large developing countries where there are no political or economic barriers to the circulation of ideas and expertise segal 2018 the arab world provides a large market for technology products and services this can be seen from the large number of identical contracts for the same technology that are awarded repeatedly over short periods of time in a number of technological fields such a market provides excellent opportunities for technology transfer because technology is best acquired as part of the repeated undertaking of similar projects zahlan 2012 the absence of adequate financial and insurance services to support national consulting and contracting firms combined with the absence of adequate technology policies are the main reasons for the slow pace at which technology trickles into the region zahlan 1984 contracts with foreign consulting and contracting firms are in agricultural development construction transport systems industry educational technologies aviation communication and so on emery et al 1986 zahlan and zahlan 1991 since the national markets for sophisticated technological services of each arab state are small any serious effort to transfer technology has to involve substantial arab economic cooperation there has been no significant effort to date to implement inter arab cooperation in technology moreover the subject of technology transfer to the arab world has become synonymous with trade emery et al 1986 ilgen and pempel 1987 in this type of analysis arabs are not seen as participant in a process of technological development the main focus of this approach is on the suppliers of technology rather than the consumers in addition emphasis is often placed on the competition among the various industrial powers for the lucrative arab markets the behaviour of the arab trading parties tends to be of minor interest this is mainly due to the fact that much of the planning and decision making is done by foreign institutions the leading arab development institutions as well as the arab governments utilise foreign consulting firms almost exclusively zahlan 2014 in the presence of foreign skills and know how the construction of petrochemical plants refineries and water desalination plants is well within the capabilities of arab organisations arab firms lack neither the technical expertise nor the natural financial or human resources to undertake such projects what is missing is a variety of other inputs such as financial legal and technical support services that arab governments do not make available to their national organisations finally the weakness of arab science and technology systems in conjunction with the absence of effective science policies in the arab world have made the economic integration of technological activity very difficult zahlan and zahlan 1980 the inability to formulate and adopt sensible technology policies has contributed to the continuing disintegration of arab society and culture beblawi and luciani 1987 27 unemployment alienation marginalisation and the intensification of civil unrest and violence are all direct or indirect indicators of the absence of an integrated science policy and of the impact of that absence on the economic life of the arab world bizri 2017 science technology and security sectors in the military sector the referent object of security is mainly the state military action usually threatens the state s physical base territory and population and institutions buzan 1991 116 117 the relevance of science and technology to military security is highlighted by the need of states to produce weapons systems necessary for national defence it is not by accident that due to current conflicts in the region the major focus of many middle eastern states is access to military related technologies states that have the necessary technology to produce their own weapons systems find themselves in a better position than those that have to import weapons this is not only for economic reasons i e impact on trade balance but also because they can be less politically dependent on weapon supply countries when it comes to achieving military self reliance in the middle east technology transfer and the expansion of local production for international export are common objectives of regional countries singer 2009 indeed in their contacts with the major western producers of military equipment some middle eastern states have made it clear that if western providers of military equipment want to work with local arab companies they will have to transfer their technical knowledge to the ones that are part of a rising indigenous defence sector mouchantaf 2018 however some analysts are sceptical of this attitude because regional states lack the capability to absorb military technology not only due to the shortage of nationals in the defence industry but also because of the limited access to science engineering and mathematics graduates mouchantaf 2018 in the political sector the referent object of security can be the government or the citizens threats may arise as a result of peoples dissatisfaction with governmental policies or from the attempts of governments to exercise tight control over their citizens in their effort to maintain power surveillance and other control related technologies in the hands of governments such as control over the mass media and press show the relevance of technology to political security on the other hand the recent arab uprisings demonstrated that communication technologies such as the internet facebook and cell phones can be effectively used to organise and coordinate popular resistance to the government berman 2017 specifically although text messaging was used extensively in the arab spring it had a limited effect and did not lead to direct political change brown 2012 as a tool it helped individuals to communicate and coordinate but this impact was indirect satellite tv also had more subtle and varying effects what made the big difference was the use of cell phones which provided a ubiquitous image and video capture device ellis 2011 anyone possessing a cell phone could document and transmit footage instantly without camera phones the only actors capable of documenting the 2011 uprisings would have been professional journalists whose coverage is usually lacking in dynamic situations such as the arab spring cell phone technology also helped to include citizens who were watching events unfold as they were seeing video and images captured by regular citizens this mobilised individuals who felt like they too could take part in the protests and have a political voice social media and the internet also had a significant impact on the outcome of the arab uprisings as they offered the protestors a space to express and develop political viewpoints unhindered by regimes this is because social networking sites like facebook have structural features that promote participation and mobilisation hanska 2016 29 30 on the other hand the arab spring demonstrated that it is quite dangerous to be friends with regime critics on facebook for example the syrian electronic army sea was established to wage online war against assad opponents as a result sea has attacked domestic sites as well as international targets such as the associated press twitter account ellis 2011 technology however has a long history of being used in revolutionary movements in the middle east for example during the iranian revolution ayatollah khomeini produced and distributed tapes of sermons denouncing the shah helping to grow dissent in the country parallels can also be drawn with the cedar revolution of 2005 in lebanon where protests occurred after the lebanese prime minister was killed citizens demanded an investigation and the withdrawal of syrian troops from the country ellis 2011 a final aspect of the impact of the internet on the middle east conflicts involves the utilisation of social media for jihadist recruitment the phenomenon is particularly relevant in cases of so called self radicalisation where individuals succumb to the lure of extremist propaganda produced in middle east sites pulled into isis circles some cyber recruits carry out violent acts as lone wolves while others travel to the middle east in order to fight for the caliphate in the societal sector the referent object of security is collective identities such as religious or national identities buzan 1991 122 123 as in the political sector surveillance and other control related technologies can serve as instruments of power in the hands of governments that aim at controlling particular religious and ethnic groups this is the reason societal threats can be difficult to disentangle from political ones on the other hand targeted social groups may use communication technologies to raise support for their cause or invite external involvement for protection purposes in the economic sector national security issues can emerge involving linkages between economic capability on the one hand and military capability power and socio political stability on the other buzan 1991 126 due to its connection to economic development science and technology become central to economic considerations chambers 2015 ahmed 2018 moreover a state s military capability rests at least partly on the possession of an industrial base capable of supporting the armed forces the absence or the economic decline of basic industries can therefore raise questions about the ability of the state to support independent military production buzan and sen 1990 for example the desire of several middle eastern states to maintain or acquire production capability in key militarily related industries has inserted a national security requirement into the management of the national economy on the other hand the pursuit of military research and development has prevented some middle eastern states from investing in their civil economy yet when technology cannot support economic development economic threats may also enhance domestic instability the link between economic and political stability generates a set of questions about development which can easily be seen as national security issues for example some middle eastern states that are not efficient producers find themselves locked into a cycle of poverty and underdevelopment from which there is no obvious escape hence the governments of those states find themselves having to choose between investing in new technologies and knowledge creation at the expense of lowering the already very low living standards information and communication technologies ict constitute one of the fastest growing sectors in the middle east nevertheless most of the countries in the middle east have shown no signs of impending information revolutions irs the proliferation and ever more sophisticated employment of icts are critically dependent upon economic factors as well as the nature of the government and its role in ict development except for israel and turkey every other country in the region is deficient in necessary economic factors or government participation burkhart 2003 thus it has been argued that despite having high mobile penetration rates the middle east lags behind other areas in terms of technological advancement and regional states need to improve technology education and the regulatory framework saadi 2017 moreover governments need to address information related security vulnerabilities that threaten the operation of both the private and public sectors and impact national economies in the environmental sector science and technology become extremely relevant due to the need to have an efficient use of natural resources and to protect the environment the overall aridity of the middle east has motivated some of the richer countries to search for technological solutions to their water requirements through sustained investment in research they have become experts in water desalination water recycling and solar energy the region s oil poor countries however cannot afford such advanced technologies and remain dependent on more traditional water resources yet the need to secure access to water has led to the utilisation of construction related technology to create water dams unfortunately while these dams regulate the water flow to cropland generate vital electricity and supply potable water they also introduce environmental problems that have cast a shadow on their overall success since the region s major rivers no longer flood to produce natural fertilisers farmers downstream are forced to use massive amounts of artificial fertilisers which in turn pollute the regional rivers conclusion the technological dependence of arab countries has enhanced their vulnerability to outside interference and reduced their internal national integration national integration depends on economic exchanges within society dependent technology policies reduce such exchanges instead economic exchanges take place with foreign countries without involving the national population the counterpart of weak internal cohesiveness is a high degree of dependence on imports in general the extent of arab dependence on imports for all necessities of life is striking on the positive side middle eastern countries possess enormous human strategic and natural resources which if efficiently managed and put to effective use could induce a rapid economic change but those resources cannot be put to socioeconomic use because of the underdeveloped state of their national and regional institutions in other words socioeconomic development is difficult to achieve in the absence of an adequate level of political development this situation is a direct consequence of the strength and stability of the prevailing rentier political economy beblawi and luciani 1987 therefore middle east governments need to strengthen their political legal and institutional systems adopt a performance oriented political economy and introduce an appropriate science and technology policy today arab countries face three major challenges population pressures global increase of oil and gas sources and declining arab labour productivity mounting population pressures will decrease the resources available for undertaking economic reforms by the year 2050 an expected increase of some 400 million inhabitants will bring the total population to some 700 million half of these will be below the age of 18 this young population could be an important force for positive and creative change if provided with proper education and training the absence of appropriate technology policies however could transform this abundant and youthful population into a disruptive and destabilising force to this one may add the fact that the expanding number of gas and oil sources worldwide have combined to reduce arab income and increase the cost of imports in addition increasing labour productivity in the newly industrialising countries is reducing the attractiveness of arab countries for foreign direct investment most of the subcontracting to the arab states now is for low value added and low technology activities in other words internal and external factors are not favourable to promoting technological development in the middle east however it is imperative the future of any country is contingent on its capacity to produce the goods and services in demand the major tool in achieving this goal is science and technology the middle east has remained outside this competition because arab states have not sought to acquire the requisite political economy however people in the region retain the capacity to alter their future thus a positive response to global technological challenges would require the adoption of a successful program of technology transfer in order to narrow or close the technology gap technology transfer takes place over a substantial period of time and is a cumulative and systemic process transfer however involves changes in a country s political culture the legal system the economy social organisation and management to promote technological advances middle eastern governments should invest in quality education for youth continuous skills training for workers and managers and should ensure that knowledge is shared as widely as possible across society yet particular attention should be given to improving the investment climate which is crucial as are the right incentive structures to guide the allocation of resources and to encourage research and development successful countries have grown their ability to innovate by investing public funding to help finance research and development in critical areas the benefits to flow from technological revolution in an increasingly connected and knowledge intensive world will be seized by those countries that are sensitive and responsive to the rapidly changing environment and nimble enough to take advantage of the opportunities those who succeed will make substantial advances in reducing poverty and inequality those who do not will face enormous internal insecurity and will transform themselves into a threat

this is an excerpt from regional security in the middle east sectors variables and issues get your free copy here science and technology enhance the capabilities of states and societies to obtain and transform resources necessary for their development and advancement on the other hand lack of scientific knowledge and access to technology not only affects a country s level of development but also jeopardises its national security in an anarchic international system security interdependence implies that the security of a state is closely tied to the security of the other states and especially its neighbours since national securities are interdependent the security or insecurity of a state may have a considerable impact not only on the security of its immediate neighbours but also on the security of the whole region in which it is geographically embedded regional security technology as a factor affecting national security is closely related to population growth the greater the population growth and the greater the pace of the technological development of a country the greater the likelihood its activities and interests beyond its borders will expand the greater the demographic growth and the less rapid the technological development of a country the greater the likelihood it will face significant socio economic problems and instability choucri 2002 98 in other words unevenness in the interactive growth and development within and across the societies contributes to unevenness in the size development and capabilities of such societies to differential capabilities among them and to competitions conflicts and violence choucri 1984 as an engine of growth the potential of technology is still largely untapped in the middle east where states not only lack adequate skilled labour and capital but also use these factors less efficiently therefore the purpose of this chapter is to investigate the impact of science and technology on national and regional security in the middle east in doing so the chapter is divided into six sections the first section discusses the relationship between technology and development while the second section explores the relevance of science and technology to security drawing on a historical analysis the third section examines the reasons science and technology have not so far played an effective role in the development of middle eastern states and societies the next section identifies and discusses the instruments and patterns of technological development in the contemporary middle east the last section of the paper offers a sectoral analysis of the relationship between science and technology on the one hand and security national and regional in the middle east on the other the technology development relationship the commonly held view is that technology and development are strongly linked with development driven by technology and technology serving as a key indicator of national development in reality however technological change is often highly problematic with respect to its socio economic and environmental implications as it may exacerbate inequality uneven development ecological degradation and or social exclusion murphy 2017 1 a critical understanding of the drivers dynamics implications and geographically uneven distributions of technology and technological change is thus an important component of development studies and practice murphy 2017 1 generally speaking technology is the branch of knowledge that deals with the creation and use of technical means and their interrelation with life society and the environment drawing upon such subjects as industrial arts engineering sciences and applied sciences in this sense technology is embedded deeply in social cultural economic and political systems due to its spatial diffusion technology has uneven geographies of use significance and impact murphy 2017 1 with respect to development technology is seen as an essential driver and determinant of socioeconomic cultural environmental and political change economically technology can increase national productivity through improvements to the efficiency of production and logistics while encouraging and enhancing innovation and knowledge creation alternatively technology can exacerbate socioeconomic differences and create uneven development within and between countries and regions culturally technology has a profound effect on the norms and identities that help to constitute particular social groups environmentally technology can contribute in significant ways to greener and more sustainable societies or exacerbate ecological degradation through intensified or expanded impacts locally and globally politically technology can have democratising effects e g the facebook revolutions in the middle east or it can facilitate enhanced forms of repression or surveillance by state authorities hanska 2016 32 science and technology are key drivers of development this is because technological and scientific revolutions and innovations underpin economic advances and contribute to improvements in health systems education and infrastructure thus developments in science and technology have profound effects on economic and social development apart from constituting a salient political issue access to and application of technology are critical to a country s development by the same token access to high quality education especially higher education is essential for the creation of scientific knowledge science and technology are the differentiating factors among countries separating those that are able to tackle poverty effectively by growing and developing their economies and those that are not the level of countries economic development depends to a large extent on their ability to grasp and apply insights from science and technology and use them creatively to promote technological advances developing countries need to invest in quality education for youth continuous skills training for workers and managers as well as to ensure that knowledge is shared as widely as possible across society moreover adopting appropriate technologies leads directly to higher productivity which is the key to growth creativity and technological innovation emerge naturally in societies that have large stocks and flows of knowledge in sharp contrast in societies with limited stocks of knowledge creative people feel constrained and migrate to other countries thereby causing brain drain to their own countries and societies such societies are prone to remain in poverty and dependency hence in the presence of many social economic and defence needs and demands access to quality education as well as the adoption and application of appropriate technologies do not only constitute a policy question but also a question of policy priorities moreover both of these questions are tied to a country s political development science technology and security it has been suggested stivachtis 2011 397 422 that development and security are interrelated indeed the end of the cold war allowed the identification of development with human security undp 1993 2 for instance the declaration on the right to development 1986 2 asserts that all human beings have a human right to development and that development has been consequently subdivided into several sectors such as political development economic development and socio cultural development in addition development and the environment are inextricably linked undp 1994 24 40 moreover it has been shown stivachtis 2011 414 that there is a close relationship between development sectors and security sectors in the sense that the absence or presence of development in a particular sector impacts security and vice versa for example political development is related to political security while economic development is related to economic security as a result lack of political development has the potential of enhancing political insecurity yet as in the case of security problems in one development sector may affect other development sectors and as an extension the corresponding security sectors for instance political underdevelopment may affect economic development and therefore a state s economic security this means that security and development can to a great extent be operationalised in the same way mittleman 1988 22 yet it has been argued stivachtis 2011 415 that national security becomes inextricably connected to national development this means that neither development can be achieved without security nor security without development one of the most important questions in the field of security and development studies is whether a particular security or development sector is so significant that policy priority should be given to it the expectation is that if problems threats in this sector are addressed this would have positive effects on the other sectors addressing this question political scientists stress the political prerequisites for economic development political order and stability implying the presence and function of viable institutions and enforceable rules almond and coleman 1960 almond and powell 1966 for example whether political instability in a country may result from the inability of the national government to promote economic development and create sustainable and effective welfare mechanisms or from its inability to manage social and political change in a period of rapid economic growth political development appears to be fundamental as far as the last point is concerned the record contradicts the conventional wisdom that the way to avoid political instability is to stimulate economic development and industrialisation olsen 1963 empirical research shows that whatever the long term benefits of modernisation its short term impact tends to be more instability and sometimes violence skocpol 1994 feierabend et al 1966 thus discussion about development has emphasised political development meaning the need to establish institutions capable of managing socio political tensions and preventing their escalation into violence that may threaten the security of the state and its citizens however since developing states have widely divergent social economic and political attributes this diversity implies the absence of a unique policy formula that could apply without distinction to any developing state development enhances state power and capabilities and enhances national security on the other hand security provides the fertile ground for development while any threats to security ultimately affect development underdevelopment on the other hand increases the vulnerability of the state thereby enhancing its insecurity science and technology are key drivers of development and therefore central not only to a country s socio economic development but also its national security science technology and development in the middle east a historical account over the centuries scientific and technological advances have repeatedly enabled foreign powers to interfere with the functioning of middle eastern economies as well as to undermine the security of the less advanced countries of the region this section will discuss some of the main technology related events that led to this situation which continues today following the rise of islam in the seventh century science and technology flourished in the islamic world to a far greater extent than in the west muslim rulers promoted the translation of greek philosophy and science and then encouraged further scientific exploration in numerous fields including mathematics astronomy medicine pharmacology optics chemistry and physics much of the knowledge developed by the muslims and transmitted to the europeans enabled europe to emerge from the dark ages into the renaissance saliba 2011 until the sixteenth century the arab world was connected by a unique system of trade and transport that unified its large population scattered over vast areas of land and sea the system sustained the economy of each arab state underpinned trade with europe and fed into the various international trading systems bahlan 1999 261 in fact the arabs had developed an effective transnational trading system which reached its peak in the eighth to sixteenth centuries and which was based on local technological inputs such as skilled merchants and caravan managers navigators with extensive geographic knowledge efficiently operated ports and trading emporia scientifically bred camels and seaworthy dhows bahlan 1999 262 trust and mutual dependence among closely knit social groups prevailed the socioeconomic support of the transport and trading system enhanced regional harmony and the stability of local communities the mechanics of the arab trading system were so flexible that traders could move their business readily from place to place in response to changes in supply and demand or in order to avoid ruthless rulers or areas of conflict bahlan 1999 263 since trade brought prosperity and employment local governments sought to attract traders and provide security and support facilities to ease the process of trade and the life of the traveller the arab transport system was responsible for the large scale circulation of people and information this included the diffusion of agricultural products inventions and all types of knowledge thus the trade and transport system had a powerful economic social and cultural impact it also integrated the economies of arab countries with each other and with those of asia the mediterranean and africa according to antoine zahlan 1999 there are three main reasons middle eastern countries lag behind in terms of technology and scientific knowledge their loss of trade and transportation systems the effects of the industrial revolution on arab economies and the political and economic effects of the colonisation and neo colonisation processes the collapse of the arab trade and transport systems the collapse of the arab trade and transportation systems was induced by portuguese technological advances in ship design navigation and naval warfare guilmartin 1974 the strategic breakthrough was the invention of transoceanic ships these ships could carry a large number of guns and could navigate the high seas the arabs failed to acquire or develop the necessary technological capabilities to match portuguese naval vessels the small but powerful portuguese fleet interfered violently with trade between the arab world asia and africa guilmartin 1974 the portuguese used their superior naval force to harass and interfere with shipping attack coastal towns loot ships and pillage coastal towns ottoman technical assistance to the cities of the arabian peninsula ultimately saved the people of the arab coastal towns from outright massacre by the portuguese for the next three centuries the forces of the ottoman empire protected the region from european devastation however the ottomans themselves were unable to cope with european technological challenges and their empire eventually collapsed portugal s naval technology diffused to the european atlantic states by the early seventeenth century the british the dutch and the french had displaced the portuguese from the indian ocean between 1620 and 1670 these three countries introduced a new innovation the east india company which controlled fleets marketing systems finances storage space and armies platt 1977 while arab trade depended on the efforts of a very large number of traders operating in a small scale and each working on their own the east india company was centrally managed possessing the financial resources necessary to exercise monopolistic behaviour and thus control markets consequently the east india company quickly managed to eliminate arab long distance trade platt 1977 by the eighteenth century trade routes throughout the middle east were being reoriented toward coastal towns and european trade and transport whereas the arab international trading system had been heavily land based and internal the new system was heavily dependent on european shipping and trade bahlan 1996 264 this loss was soon followed by the progressive displacement of internal land based long distance travel services by european shipping no serious arab competition arose to challenge the rapid development of european mediterranean shipping firms headrick 1981 when in 1832 the french occupied algeria and later tunisia and morocco they sought to close all trans saharan routes which were being used by resistance movements and by clandestine trade bahlan 1999 265 thus by the early twentieth century the complex and rich system of internal trans saharan transport had been dismantled two further technological developments accelerated the dismantling of regional and local trade and transport systems the construction and operation of railway systems by foreign firms and the construction of the suez canal headrick 1981 by the latter part of the nineteenth century the national systems of trade and transport had disintegrated to the level where they were replaced by totally imported systems with very little local participation zahlan and zahlan 1978 the displacement of camel based transport technology with railway and steamship technologies without the transfer of mechanical and new naval technologies meant that the arabs lost the employment generated by operating their system of transport headrick 1981 even today arab countries remain unable to acquire the employment derived from operating and maintaining their extensive transport systems the strength of the arab and muslim worlds was based on a common market and not on political unity although many arab countries were in conflict this did not eliminate trade and cultural exchanges between them but as the arabs were unable to acquire adopt or develop alternative technologies to contain technological challenges which eventually led to the collapse of the transnational arab trading system the forces that bound the arab communities to each other were loosened and the cohesiveness of the arab world began to weaken industrial revolution the second phase of technology dismantling was induced by the industrial revolution which undermined the traditional textile industries that were firmly based in arab countries steam power machine production chemical sciences and technology electrification petroleum production and refining communication technologies radio electric power and engineering and countless advances in medical science construction technologies city planning and management systems all had dramatic consequences for the arab world every technological advance in europe contributed to the continuing decline of inter arab cohesiveness zahlan and zahaln 1997 the acquisition of western military technologies beginning with the ottomans and muhammad ali led to the progressive divorce of military institutions from their local environment and to their progressive integration into the military industrial intelligence complexes of western powers new technology was imported in a dependent mode and packaged with its consultants contractors operators and financiers and without any effort being made to develop new technologies at home zahlan and zahlan 1991 the cost of this dependency was enormous as were the resulting economic and political consequences of the egyptian and ottoman debts the occupation of egypt in 1882 and the collapse of the economy of the ottoman empire colonisation and independence the third phase of technology dismantling began with the direct occupation of arab countries when practically every single important decision was made by the emissaries of the colonial powers colonialism affected all aspects of life in the middle east the net result was the further divorce of the elites the culture and the economy of the region from technical matters zahlan 1999 267 the fourth phase was induced by political independence when independence was achieved the rulers and elites of the new states had little knowledge of contemporary developments in science and technology which had become so central to the industrialised world in the late twentieth century not only did all equipment industrial supplies and maintenance services have to be imported but also arab countries depended completely on foreign consulting and contracting services helie 1973 the new leaders sought to develop their countries through the rapid expansion of educational systems and investment in new industries cultural distortions and alienation were intensified by the accelerated programs adopted at this time beblawi and luciani 1987 because they wished to accelerate the process of development the new national elites unknowingly adopted methods that ultimately led to even greater technological dependence as a result foreign consulting firms conceived and designed enormous projects foreign accounting and law firms monitored them and an army of foreign contractors and foreign labour implemented them zahlan and zahlan 1978 although major things were built such as power and desalination plants hospitals irrigation schemes enormous dams transport systems and airports locals contributed little to the process beblawi and luciani 1987 however those who mediated these contracts earned enormous commissions and well placed people accumulated personal fortunes in the billions of dollars zahlan and zahlan 1984 meanwhile the gap between the arab world and industrial countries has continued to grow and arab economies still suffer from chronic stagnation and low productivity components and instruments of technology systems the major instruments of national technological development are university education systems research and development r d national consulting and contracting firms relevant economic and financial institutions to support technological development and science policy zahlan 1996 269 there has been a significant and dramatic expansion of the proportion of people in the middle east who have completed four or more years of higher education the number of universities has also increased including a significant number of foreign universities kjerfve 2014 yet the quality of higher education in the middle east is among the lowest in the world only two or three arab universities are in the list of the top 500 universities in the world and none is in the top 200 employers in the region complain that university graduates lack the skills needed to work in the global marketplace many are not well trained in science mathematics engineering and other technical subjects where the jobs are furthermore these graduates lack the soft skills including creativity and teamwork partly because their training has emphasised memorisation and rote learning devarajan 2016 much of the emphasis of arab foreign education has been in science and engineering qasem 1998 doctoral level knowledge producing education however is still highly underdeveloped in the region and therefore specialisation is pursued abroad dini et al 2015 arab universities have been the leading centres for both basic and applied research in science and technology the number of professors in arab universities has increased with the majority of them associated with science and technology zahlan 2012 the number of research and development centres also increased with half of them engaging in research in agriculture nutrition water and irrigation marine sciences and the biological science the rest focus on oil and petrochemicals ecology basic sciences and computer science lightfoot 2018 research activity in arab countries is thus highly focused on applied subjects with a priority in medicine and agriculture despite the valiant efforts of a number of scientists basic research is on such a small scale that it is virtually non existent zahlan 2012 r d organisations play a major role in successful planning design and operation of economic installations however because the consulting and contracting services utilised in establishing industrial plants are generally imported on a turnkey basis the demand for local r d services is still limited sehnaoui 2017 technological dependence severely constrains the development of the requisite r d capabilities to support and service the various economic sectors zahlan 2014 arab science and technology related human resources are more than adequate and could in principle constitute an integrative social factor but in the absence of rational and appropriate science policies and adequate financial resources the potential of this human resource is dissipated zahlan 2012 the reason for such a low figure is the lack of resources and the absence of demand for services by nationals both the public and private sectors depend nearly exclusively on foreign firms for technical services zahlan 2014 arab countries are near the top of the developing world level of activity but far below the levels of industrial countries thus although the output may be comparable the application of scientific findings is more constrained than in other large developing countries where there are no political or economic barriers to the circulation of ideas and expertise segal 2018 the arab world provides a large market for technology products and services this can be seen from the large number of identical contracts for the same technology that are awarded repeatedly over short periods of time in a number of technological fields such a market provides excellent opportunities for technology transfer because technology is best acquired as part of the repeated undertaking of similar projects zahlan 2012 the absence of adequate financial and insurance services to support national consulting and contracting firms combined with the absence of adequate technology policies are the main reasons for the slow pace at which technology trickles into the region zahlan 1984 contracts with foreign consulting and contracting firms are in agricultural development construction transport systems industry educational technologies aviation communication and so on emery et al 1986 zahlan and zahlan 1991 since the national markets for sophisticated technological services of each arab state are small any serious effort to transfer technology has to involve substantial arab economic cooperation there has been no significant effort to date to implement inter arab cooperation in technology moreover the subject of technology transfer to the arab world has become synonymous with trade emery et al 1986 ilgen and pempel 1987 in this type of analysis arabs are not seen as participant in a process of technological development the main focus of this approach is on the suppliers of technology rather than the consumers in addition emphasis is often placed on the competition among the various industrial powers for the lucrative arab markets the behaviour of the arab trading parties tends to be of minor interest this is mainly due to the fact that much of the planning and decision making is done by foreign institutions the leading arab development institutions as well as the arab governments utilise foreign consulting firms almost exclusively zahlan 2014 in the presence of foreign skills and know how the construction of petrochemical plants refineries and water desalination plants is well within the capabilities of arab organisations arab firms lack neither the technical expertise nor the natural financial or human resources to undertake such projects what is missing is a variety of other inputs such as financial legal and technical support services that arab governments do not make available to their national organisations finally the weakness of arab science and technology systems in conjunction with the absence of effective science policies in the arab world have made the economic integration of technological activity very difficult zahlan and zahlan 1980 the inability to formulate and adopt sensible technology policies has contributed to the continuing disintegration of arab society and culture beblawi and luciani 1987 27 unemployment alienation marginalisation and the intensification of civil unrest and violence are all direct or indirect indicators of the absence of an integrated science policy and of the impact of that absence on the economic life of the arab world bizri 2017 science technology and security sectors in the military sector the referent object of security is mainly the state military action usually threatens the state s physical base territory and population and institutions buzan 1991 116 117 the relevance of science and technology to military security is highlighted by the need of states to produce weapons systems necessary for national defence it is not by accident that due to current conflicts in the region the major focus of many middle eastern states is access to military related technologies states that have the necessary technology to produce their own weapons systems find themselves in a better position than those that have to import weapons this is not only for economic reasons i e impact on trade balance but also because they can be less politically dependent on weapon supply countries when it comes to achieving military self reliance in the middle east technology transfer and the expansion of local production for international export are common objectives of regional countries singer 2009 indeed in their contacts with the major western producers of military equipment some middle eastern states have made it clear that if western providers of military equipment want to work with local arab companies they will have to transfer their technical knowledge to the ones that are part of a rising indigenous defence sector mouchantaf 2018 however some analysts are sceptical of this attitude because regional states lack the capability to absorb military technology not only due to the shortage of nationals in the defence industry but also because of the limited access to science engineering and mathematics graduates mouchantaf 2018 in the political sector the referent object of security can be the government or the citizens threats may arise as a result of peoples dissatisfaction with governmental policies or from the attempts of governments to exercise tight control over their citizens in their effort to maintain power surveillance and other control related technologies in the hands of governments such as control over the mass media and press show the relevance of technology to political security on the other hand the recent arab uprisings demonstrated that communication technologies such as the internet facebook and cell phones can be effectively used to organise and coordinate popular resistance to the government berman 2017 specifically although text messaging was used extensively in the arab spring it had a limited effect and did not lead to direct political change brown 2012 as a tool it helped individuals to communicate and coordinate but this impact was indirect satellite tv also had more subtle and varying effects what made the big difference was the use of cell phones which provided a ubiquitous image and video capture device ellis 2011 anyone possessing a cell phone could document and transmit footage instantly without camera phones the only actors capable of documenting the 2011 uprisings would have been professional journalists whose coverage is usually lacking in dynamic situations such as the arab spring cell phone technology also helped to include citizens who were watching events unfold as they were seeing video and images captured by regular citizens this mobilised individuals who felt like they too could take part in the protests and have a political voice social media and the internet also had a significant impact on the outcome of the arab uprisings as they offered the protestors a space to express and develop political viewpoints unhindered by regimes this is because social networking sites like facebook have structural features that promote participation and mobilisation hanska 2016 29 30 on the other hand the arab spring demonstrated that it is quite dangerous to be friends with regime critics on facebook for example the syrian electronic army sea was established to wage online war against assad opponents as a result sea has attacked domestic sites as well as international targets such as the associated press twitter account ellis 2011 technology however has a long history of being used in revolutionary movements in the middle east for example during the iranian revolution ayatollah khomeini produced and distributed tapes of sermons denouncing the shah helping to grow dissent in the country parallels can also be drawn with the cedar revolution of 2005 in lebanon where protests occurred after the lebanese prime minister was killed citizens demanded an investigation and the withdrawal of syrian troops from the country ellis 2011 a final aspect of the impact of the internet on the middle east conflicts involves the utilisation of social media for jihadist recruitment the phenomenon is particularly relevant in cases of so called self radicalisation where individuals succumb to the lure of extremist propaganda produced in middle east sites pulled into isis circles some cyber recruits carry out violent acts as lone wolves while others travel to the middle east in order to fight for the caliphate in the societal sector the referent object of security is collective identities such as religious or national identities buzan 1991 122 123 as in the political sector surveillance and other control related technologies can serve as instruments of power in the hands of governments that aim at controlling particular religious and ethnic groups this is the reason societal threats can be difficult to disentangle from political ones on the other hand targeted social groups may use communication technologies to raise support for their cause or invite external involvement for protection purposes in the economic sector national security issues can emerge involving linkages between economic capability on the one hand and military capability power and socio political stability on the other buzan 1991 126 due to its connection to economic development science and technology become central to economic considerations chambers 2015 ahmed 2018 moreover a state s military capability rests at least partly on the possession of an industrial base capable of supporting the armed forces the absence or the economic decline of basic industries can therefore raise questions about the ability of the state to support independent military production buzan and sen 1990 for example the desire of several middle eastern states to maintain or acquire production capability in key militarily related industries has inserted a national security requirement into the management of the national economy on the other hand the pursuit of military research and development has prevented some middle eastern states from investing in their civil economy yet when technology cannot support economic development economic threats may also enhance domestic instability the link between economic and political stability generates a set of questions about development which can easily be seen as national security issues for example some middle eastern states that are not efficient producers find themselves locked into a cycle of poverty and underdevelopment from which there is no obvious escape hence the governments of those states find themselves having to choose between investing in new technologies and knowledge creation at the expense of lowering the already very low living standards information and communication technologies ict constitute one of the fastest growing sectors in the middle east nevertheless most of the countries in the middle east have shown no signs of impending information revolutions irs the proliferation and ever more sophisticated employment of icts are critically dependent upon economic factors as well as the nature of the government and its role in ict development except for israel and turkey every other country in the region is deficient in necessary economic factors or government participation burkhart 2003 thus it has been argued that despite having high mobile penetration rates the middle east lags behind other areas in terms of technological advancement and regional states need to improve technology education and the regulatory framework saadi 2017 moreover governments need to address information related security vulnerabilities that threaten the operation of both the private and public sectors and impact national economies in the environmental sector science and technology become extremely relevant due to the need to have an efficient use of natural resources and to protect the environment the overall aridity of the middle east has motivated some of the richer countries to search for technological solutions to their water requirements through sustained investment in research they have become experts in water desalination water recycling and solar energy the region s oil poor countries however cannot afford such advanced technologies and remain dependent on more traditional water resources yet the need to secure access to water has led to the utilisation of construction related technology to create water dams unfortunately while these dams regulate the water flow to cropland generate vital electricity and supply potable water they also introduce environmental problems that have cast a shadow on their overall success since the region s major rivers no longer flood to produce natural fertilisers farmers downstream are forced to use massive amounts of artificial fertilisers which in turn pollute the regional rivers conclusion the technological dependence of arab countries has enhanced their vulnerability to outside interference and reduced their internal national integration national integration depends on economic exchanges within society dependent technology policies reduce such exchanges instead economic exchanges take place with foreign countries without involving the national population the counterpart of weak internal cohesiveness is a high degree of dependence on imports in general the extent of arab dependence on imports for all necessities of life is striking on the positive side middle eastern countries possess enormous human strategic and natural resources which if efficiently managed and put to effective use could induce a rapid economic change but those resources cannot be put to socioeconomic use because of the underdeveloped state of their national and regional institutions in other words socioeconomic development is difficult to achieve in the absence of an adequate level of political development this situation is a direct consequence of the strength and stability of the prevailing rentier political economy beblawi and luciani 1987 therefore middle east governments need to strengthen their political legal and institutional systems adopt a performance oriented political economy and introduce an appropriate science and technology policy today arab countries face three major challenges population pressures global increase of oil and gas sources and declining arab labour productivity mounting population pressures will decrease the resources available for undertaking economic reforms by the year 2050 an expected increase of some 400 million inhabitants will bring the total population to some 700 million half of these will be below the age of 18 this young population could be an important force for positive and creative change if provided with proper education and training the absence of appropriate technology policies however could transform this abundant and youthful population into a disruptive and destabilising force to this one may add the fact that the expanding number of gas and oil sources worldwide have combined to reduce arab income and increase the cost of imports in addition increasing labour productivity in the newly industrialising countries is reducing the attractiveness of arab countries for foreign direct investment most of the subcontracting to the arab states now is for low value added and low technology activities in other words internal and external factors are not favourable to promoting technological development in the middle east however it is imperative the future of any country is contingent on its capacity to produce the goods and services in demand the major tool in achieving this goal is science and technology the middle east has remained outside this competition because arab states have not sought to acquire the requisite political economy however people in the region retain the capacity to alter their future thus a positive response to global technological challenges would require the adoption of a successful program of technology transfer in order to narrow or close the technology gap technology transfer takes place over a substantial period of time and is a cumulative and systemic process transfer however involves changes in a country s political culture the legal system the economy social organisation and management to promote technological advances middle eastern governments should invest in quality education for youth continuous skills training for workers and managers and should ensure that knowledge is shared as widely as possible across society yet particular attention should be given to improving the investment climate which is crucial as are the right incentive structures to guide the allocation of resources and to encourage research and development successful countries have grown their ability to innovate by investing public funding to help finance research and development in critical areas the benefits to flow from technological revolution in an increasingly connected and knowledge intensive world will be seized by those countries that are sensitive and responsive to the rapidly changing environment and nimble enough to take advantage of the opportunities those who succeed will make substantial advances in reducing poverty and inequality those who do not will face enormous internal insecurity and will transform themselves into a threat

menafn jordan times los angeles modern monetary theory mmt a seemingly new approach to economic policy has become a hot topic gaining support from leading us progressives such as presidential candidate senator bernie sanders and democratic representative alexandria ocasio cortez but mmt enthusiasts should heed lessons learned in latin america where policies based on similar ideas inevitably ended in economic catastrophe according to mmt s supporters the us federal reserve should print large amounts of money to finance massive public infrastructure projects along with a job guarantee programme aimed at ensuring full employment a major increase in public sector debt mmt backers claim does not represent a danger for a country that can borrow in its own currency as the united states can this unconventional view has been criticised by keynesians and monetarists alike many respected academic economists including paul krugman kenneth rogoff and larry summers say that mmt makes little sense in response mmt supporters argue that the theory s critics do not fully understand how a modern monetary economy works according to influential mmt advocates such as stephanie kelton governments in countries with their own national currency such as the us do not face hard budget constraints because they can simply print more money to finance higher expenditures assessing the merits of mmt is difficult for two reasons for starters its supporters have not provided a unified detailed description of how the model is meant to work as krugman recently wrote mmt backers tend to be unclear about what exactly their differences with conventional views are and also have a strong habit of dismissing out of hand any attempt to make sense of what they re saying in addition mmt supporters have offered hardly any inkling of how the policy might function in practice especially in the medium and long term yet the approach is not unprecedented mmt or some version of it has been tried in several latin american countries including chile argentina brazil ecuador nicaragua peru and venezuela all had their own currency at the time moreover their governments almost all of which were populist relied on arguments similar to those used by today s mmt supporters to justify huge increases in public expenditure financed by the central bank and all of these experiments led to runaway inflation huge currency devaluations and precipitous declines in real wages four episodes in particular are instructive chile under president salvador allende s socialist regime from 1970 to 1973 peru during president alan garcía s first administration 1985 1990 argentina under presidents néstor kirchner and cristina fernández de kirchner from 2003 to 2015 and venezuela since 1999 under presidents hugo chávez and nicolás maduro in all four cases a similar pattern emerged after the authorities created money to finance very large fiscal deficits an economic boom immediately followed wages increased helped by substantial minimum wage hikes and unemployment declined soon however bottlenecks appeared and prices skyrocketed in some cases at hyperinflationary rates inflation reached 500 per cent in chile in 1973 some 7 000 per cent in peru in 1990 and is expected to be almost 10 million per cent in venezuela this year in argentina meanwhile inflation was more subdued but still very high averaging 40 per cent in 2015 the authorities responded by imposing price and wage controls and stiff protectionist policies but the controls did not work and output and employment eventually collapsed worse still in three of these four countries inflation adjusted wages fell sharply during the mmt type experiment in the periods in question real wages declined by 39 per cent in chile 41 per cent in peru and by more than 50 per cent in venezuela hurting the poor and the middle class in each case the central bank was controlled by politicians with predictable results in chile the money supply grew by 360 per cent in 1973 alone helping to finance a budget deficit equivalent to an astonishing 24 per cent of gdp in peru in 1989 money growth was 7 000 per cent and the fiscal deficit exceeded 10 per cent of gdp in argentina in 2015 the deficit was 6 per cent of gdp with the annual rate of money creation surpassing 40 per cent and venezuela currently has a deficit of 32 per cent of gdp with the money supply estimated to be growing at an annual rate of more than 1 000 per cent as inflation increased in these countries people greatly reduced their holdings of domestic money but because governments required taxes to be paid in local currency it did not completely disappear instead the speed at which money changed hands what economists call velocity of circulation increased dramatically no one wanted to be holding paper money that lost 20 per cent or more of its value every month when the demand for money collapses the effects of money growth on inflation are amplified and a vicious circle develops one serious consequence is that the currency depreciates rapidly in international markets mmt supporters conveniently ignore the simple fact that demand for local money declines drastically when its value tumbles yet this is perhaps one of the theory s biggest weaknesses and one that makes it extremely risky for any country to implement the experience of latin america should serve as a clear warning for today s mmt enthusiasts in a variety of countries and at very different times fiscal expansions that were financed by printing money resulted in an uncontrollable loss of economic stability economic policy ideas are often as dangerous in practice as they are flawed in theory mmt may be a case in point sebastián edwards is professor of

this is an excerpt from regional security in the middle east sectors variables and issues get your free copy here science and technology enhance the capabilities of states and societies to obtain and transform resources necessary for their development and advancement on the other hand lack of scientific knowledge and access to technology not only affects a country s level of development but also jeopardises its national security in an anarchic international system security interdependence implies that the security of a state is closely tied to the security of the other states and especially its neighbours since national securities are interdependent the security or insecurity of a state may have a considerable impact not only on the security of its immediate neighbours but also on the security of the whole region in which it is geographically embedded regional security technology as a factor affecting national security is closely related to population growth the greater the population growth and the greater the pace of the technological development of a country the greater the likelihood its activities and interests beyond its borders will expand the greater the demographic growth and the less rapid the technological development of a country the greater the likelihood it will face significant socio economic problems and instability choucri 2002 98 in other words unevenness in the interactive growth and development within and across the societies contributes to unevenness in the size development and capabilities of such societies to differential capabilities among them and to competitions conflicts and violence choucri 1984 as an engine of growth the potential of technology is still largely untapped in the middle east where states not only lack adequate skilled labour and capital but also use these factors less efficiently therefore the purpose of this chapter is to investigate the impact of science and technology on national and regional security in the middle east in doing so the chapter is divided into six sections the first section discusses the relationship between technology and development while the second section explores the relevance of science and technology to security drawing on a historical analysis the third section examines the reasons science and technology have not so far played an effective role in the development of middle eastern states and societies the next section identifies and discusses the instruments and patterns of technological development in the contemporary middle east the last section of the paper offers a sectoral analysis of the relationship between science and technology on the one hand and security national and regional in the middle east on the other the technology development relationship the commonly held view is that technology and development are strongly linked with development driven by technology and technology serving as a key indicator of national development in reality however technological change is often highly problematic with respect to its socio economic and environmental implications as it may exacerbate inequality uneven development ecological degradation and or social exclusion murphy 2017 1 a critical understanding of the drivers dynamics implications and geographically uneven distributions of technology and technological change is thus an important component of development studies and practice murphy 2017 1 generally speaking technology is the branch of knowledge that deals with the creation and use of technical means and their interrelation with life society and the environment drawing upon such subjects as industrial arts engineering sciences and applied sciences in this sense technology is embedded deeply in social cultural economic and political systems due to its spatial diffusion technology has uneven geographies of use significance and impact murphy 2017 1 with respect to development technology is seen as an essential driver and determinant of socioeconomic cultural environmental and political change economically technology can increase national productivity through improvements to the efficiency of production and logistics while encouraging and enhancing innovation and knowledge creation alternatively technology can exacerbate socioeconomic differences and create uneven development within and between countries and regions culturally technology has a profound effect on the norms and identities that help to constitute particular social groups environmentally technology can contribute in significant ways to greener and more sustainable societies or exacerbate ecological degradation through intensified or expanded impacts locally and globally politically technology can have democratising effects e g the facebook revolutions in the middle east or it can facilitate enhanced forms of repression or surveillance by state authorities hanska 2016 32 science and technology are key drivers of development this is because technological and scientific revolutions and innovations underpin economic advances and contribute to improvements in health systems education and infrastructure thus developments in science and technology have profound effects on economic and social development apart from constituting a salient political issue access to and application of technology are critical to a country s development by the same token access to high quality education especially higher education is essential for the creation of scientific knowledge science and technology are the differentiating factors among countries separating those that are able to tackle poverty effectively by growing and developing their economies and those that are not the level of countries economic development depends to a large extent on their ability to grasp and apply insights from science and technology and use them creatively to promote technological advances developing countries need to invest in quality education for youth continuous skills training for workers and managers as well as to ensure that knowledge is shared as widely as possible across society moreover adopting appropriate technologies leads directly to higher productivity which is the key to growth creativity and technological innovation emerge naturally in societies that have large stocks and flows of knowledge in sharp contrast in societies with limited stocks of knowledge creative people feel constrained and migrate to other countries thereby causing brain drain to their own countries and societies such societies are prone to remain in poverty and dependency hence in the presence of many social economic and defence needs and demands access to quality education as well as the adoption and application of appropriate technologies do not only constitute a policy question but also a question of policy priorities moreover both of these questions are tied to a country s political development science technology and security it has been suggested stivachtis 2011 397 422 that development and security are interrelated indeed the end of the cold war allowed the identification of development with human security undp 1993 2 for instance the declaration on the right to development 1986 2 asserts that all human beings have a human right to development and that development has been consequently subdivided into several sectors such as political development economic development and socio cultural development in addition development and the environment are inextricably linked undp 1994 24 40 moreover it has been shown stivachtis 2011 414 that there is a close relationship between development sectors and security sectors in the sense that the absence or presence of development in a particular sector impacts security and vice versa for example political development is related to political security while economic development is related to economic security as a result lack of political development has the potential of enhancing political insecurity yet as in the case of security problems in one development sector may affect other development sectors and as an extension the corresponding security sectors for instance political underdevelopment may affect economic development and therefore a state s economic security this means that security and development can to a great extent be operationalised in the same way mittleman 1988 22 yet it has been argued stivachtis 2011 415 that national security becomes inextricably connected to national development this means that neither development can be achieved without security nor security without development one of the most important questions in the field of security and development studies is whether a particular security or development sector is so significant that policy priority should be given to it the expectation is that if problems threats in this sector are addressed this would have positive effects on the other sectors addressing this question political scientists stress the political prerequisites for economic development political order and stability implying the presence and function of viable institutions and enforceable rules almond and coleman 1960 almond and powell 1966 for example whether political instability in a country may result from the inability of the national government to promote economic development and create sustainable and effective welfare mechanisms or from its inability to manage social and political change in a period of rapid economic growth political development appears to be fundamental as far as the last point is concerned the record contradicts the conventional wisdom that the way to avoid political instability is to stimulate economic development and industrialisation olsen 1963 empirical research shows that whatever the long term benefits of modernisation its short term impact tends to be more instability and sometimes violence skocpol 1994 feierabend et al 1966 thus discussion about development has emphasised political development meaning the need to establish institutions capable of managing socio political tensions and preventing their escalation into violence that may threaten the security of the state and its citizens however since developing states have widely divergent social economic and political attributes this diversity implies the absence of a unique policy formula that could apply without distinction to any developing state development enhances state power and capabilities and enhances national security on the other hand security provides the fertile ground for development while any threats to security ultimately affect development underdevelopment on the other hand increases the vulnerability of the state thereby enhancing its insecurity science and technology are key drivers of development and therefore central not only to a country s socio economic development but also its national security science technology and development in the middle east a historical account over the centuries scientific and technological advances have repeatedly enabled foreign powers to interfere with the functioning of middle eastern economies as well as to undermine the security of the less advanced countries of the region this section will discuss some of the main technology related events that led to this situation which continues today following the rise of islam in the seventh century science and technology flourished in the islamic world to a far greater extent than in the west muslim rulers promoted the translation of greek philosophy and science and then encouraged further scientific exploration in numerous fields including mathematics astronomy medicine pharmacology optics chemistry and physics much of the knowledge developed by the muslims and transmitted to the europeans enabled europe to emerge from the dark ages into the renaissance saliba 2011 until the sixteenth century the arab world was connected by a unique system of trade and transport that unified its large population scattered over vast areas of land and sea the system sustained the economy of each arab state underpinned trade with europe and fed into the various international trading systems bahlan 1999 261 in fact the arabs had developed an effective transnational trading system which reached its peak in the eighth to sixteenth centuries and which was based on local technological inputs such as skilled merchants and caravan managers navigators with extensive geographic knowledge efficiently operated ports and trading emporia scientifically bred camels and seaworthy dhows bahlan 1999 262 trust and mutual dependence among closely knit social groups prevailed the socioeconomic support of the transport and trading system enhanced regional harmony and the stability of local communities the mechanics of the arab trading system were so flexible that traders could move their business readily from place to place in response to changes in supply and demand or in order to avoid ruthless rulers or areas of conflict bahlan 1999 263 since trade brought prosperity and employment local governments sought to attract traders and provide security and support facilities to ease the process of trade and the life of the traveller the arab transport system was responsible for the large scale circulation of people and information this included the diffusion of agricultural products inventions and all types of knowledge thus the trade and transport system had a powerful economic social and cultural impact it also integrated the economies of arab countries with each other and with those of asia the mediterranean and africa according to antoine zahlan 1999 there are three main reasons middle eastern countries lag behind in terms of technology and scientific knowledge their loss of trade and transportation systems the effects of the industrial revolution on arab economies and the political and economic effects of the colonisation and neo colonisation processes the collapse of the arab trade and transport systems the collapse of the arab trade and transportation systems was induced by portuguese technological advances in ship design navigation and naval warfare guilmartin 1974 the strategic breakthrough was the invention of transoceanic ships these ships could carry a large number of guns and could navigate the high seas the arabs failed to acquire or develop the necessary technological capabilities to match portuguese naval vessels the small but powerful portuguese fleet interfered violently with trade between the arab world asia and africa guilmartin 1974 the portuguese used their superior naval force to harass and interfere with shipping attack coastal towns loot ships and pillage coastal towns ottoman technical assistance to the cities of the arabian peninsula ultimately saved the people of the arab coastal towns from outright massacre by the portuguese for the next three centuries the forces of the ottoman empire protected the region from european devastation however the ottomans themselves were unable to cope with european technological challenges and their empire eventually collapsed portugal s naval technology diffused to the european atlantic states by the early seventeenth century the british the dutch and the french had displaced the portuguese from the indian ocean between 1620 and 1670 these three countries introduced a new innovation the east india company which controlled fleets marketing systems finances storage space and armies platt 1977 while arab trade depended on the efforts of a very large number of traders operating in a small scale and each working on their own the east india company was centrally managed possessing the financial resources necessary to exercise monopolistic behaviour and thus control markets consequently the east india company quickly managed to eliminate arab long distance trade platt 1977 by the eighteenth century trade routes throughout the middle east were being reoriented toward coastal towns and european trade and transport whereas the arab international trading system had been heavily land based and internal the new system was heavily dependent on european shipping and trade bahlan 1996 264 this loss was soon followed by the progressive displacement of internal land based long distance travel services by european shipping no serious arab competition arose to challenge the rapid development of european mediterranean shipping firms headrick 1981 when in 1832 the french occupied algeria and later tunisia and morocco they sought to close all trans saharan routes which were being used by resistance movements and by clandestine trade bahlan 1999 265 thus by the early twentieth century the complex and rich system of internal trans saharan transport had been dismantled two further technological developments accelerated the dismantling of regional and local trade and transport systems the construction and operation of railway systems by foreign firms and the construction of the suez canal headrick 1981 by the latter part of the nineteenth century the national systems of trade and transport had disintegrated to the level where they were replaced by totally imported systems with very little local participation zahlan and zahlan 1978 the displacement of camel based transport technology with railway and steamship technologies without the transfer of mechanical and new naval technologies meant that the arabs lost the employment generated by operating their system of transport headrick 1981 even today arab countries remain unable to acquire the employment derived from operating and maintaining their extensive transport systems the strength of the arab and muslim worlds was based on a common market and not on political unity although many arab countries were in conflict this did not eliminate trade and cultural exchanges between them but as the arabs were unable to acquire adopt or develop alternative technologies to contain technological challenges which eventually led to the collapse of the transnational arab trading system the forces that bound the arab communities to each other were loosened and the cohesiveness of the arab world began to weaken industrial revolution the second phase of technology dismantling was induced by the industrial revolution which undermined the traditional textile industries that were firmly based in arab countries steam power machine production chemical sciences and technology electrification petroleum production and refining communication technologies radio electric power and engineering and countless advances in medical science construction technologies city planning and management systems all had dramatic consequences for the arab world every technological advance in europe contributed to the continuing decline of inter arab cohesiveness zahlan and zahaln 1997 the acquisition of western military technologies beginning with the ottomans and muhammad ali led to the progressive divorce of military institutions from their local environment and to their progressive integration into the military industrial intelligence complexes of western powers new technology was imported in a dependent mode and packaged with its consultants contractors operators and financiers and without any effort being made to develop new technologies at home zahlan and zahlan 1991 the cost of this dependency was enormous as were the resulting economic and political consequences of the egyptian and ottoman debts the occupation of egypt in 1882 and the collapse of the economy of the ottoman empire colonisation and independence the third phase of technology dismantling began with the direct occupation of arab countries when practically every single important decision was made by the emissaries of the colonial powers colonialism affected all aspects of life in the middle east the net result was the further divorce of the elites the culture and the economy of the region from technical matters zahlan 1999 267 the fourth phase was induced by political independence when independence was achieved the rulers and elites of the new states had little knowledge of contemporary developments in science and technology which had become so central to the industrialised world in the late twentieth century not only did all equipment industrial supplies and maintenance services have to be imported but also arab countries depended completely on foreign consulting and contracting services helie 1973 the new leaders sought to develop their countries through the rapid expansion of educational systems and investment in new industries cultural distortions and alienation were intensified by the accelerated programs adopted at this time beblawi and luciani 1987 because they wished to accelerate the process of development the new national elites unknowingly adopted methods that ultimately led to even greater technological dependence as a result foreign consulting firms conceived and designed enormous projects foreign accounting and law firms monitored them and an army of foreign contractors and foreign labour implemented them zahlan and zahlan 1978 although major things were built such as power and desalination plants hospitals irrigation schemes enormous dams transport systems and airports locals contributed little to the process beblawi and luciani 1987 however those who mediated these contracts earned enormous commissions and well placed people accumulated personal fortunes in the billions of dollars zahlan and zahlan 1984 meanwhile the gap between the arab world and industrial countries has continued to grow and arab economies still suffer from chronic stagnation and low productivity components and instruments of technology systems the major instruments of national technological development are university education systems research and development r d national consulting and contracting firms relevant economic and financial institutions to support technological development and science policy zahlan 1996 269 there has been a significant and dramatic expansion of the proportion of people in the middle east who have completed four or more years of higher education the number of universities has also increased including a significant number of foreign universities kjerfve 2014 yet the quality of higher education in the middle east is among the lowest in the world only two or three arab universities are in the list of the top 500 universities in the world and none is in the top 200 employers in the region complain that university graduates lack the skills needed to work in the global marketplace many are not well trained in science mathematics engineering and other technical subjects where the jobs are furthermore these graduates lack the soft skills including creativity and teamwork partly because their training has emphasised memorisation and rote learning devarajan 2016 much of the emphasis of arab foreign education has been in science and engineering qasem 1998 doctoral level knowledge producing education however is still highly underdeveloped in the region and therefore specialisation is pursued abroad dini et al 2015 arab universities have been the leading centres for both basic and applied research in science and technology the number of professors in arab universities has increased with the majority of them associated with science and technology zahlan 2012 the number of research and development centres also increased with half of them engaging in research in agriculture nutrition water and irrigation marine sciences and the biological science the rest focus on oil and petrochemicals ecology basic sciences and computer science lightfoot 2018 research activity in arab countries is thus highly focused on applied subjects with a priority in medicine and agriculture despite the valiant efforts of a number of scientists basic research is on such a small scale that it is virtually non existent zahlan 2012 r d organisations play a major role in successful planning design and operation of economic installations however because the consulting and contracting services utilised in establishing industrial plants are generally imported on a turnkey basis the demand for local r d services is still limited sehnaoui 2017 technological dependence severely constrains the development of the requisite r d capabilities to support and service the various economic sectors zahlan 2014 arab science and technology related human resources are more than adequate and could in principle constitute an integrative social factor but in the absence of rational and appropriate science policies and adequate financial resources the potential of this human resource is dissipated zahlan 2012 the reason for such a low figure is the lack of resources and the absence of demand for services by nationals both the public and private sectors depend nearly exclusively on foreign firms for technical services zahlan 2014 arab countries are near the top of the developing world level of activity but far below the levels of industrial countries thus although the output may be comparable the application of scientific findings is more constrained than in other large developing countries where there are no political or economic barriers to the circulation of ideas and expertise segal 2018 the arab world provides a large market for technology products and services this can be seen from the large number of identical contracts for the same technology that are awarded repeatedly over short periods of time in a number of technological fields such a market provides excellent opportunities for technology transfer because technology is best acquired as part of the repeated undertaking of similar projects zahlan 2012 the absence of adequate financial and insurance services to support national consulting and contracting firms combined with the absence of adequate technology policies are the main reasons for the slow pace at which technology trickles into the region zahlan 1984 contracts with foreign consulting and contracting firms are in agricultural development construction transport systems industry educational technologies aviation communication and so on emery et al 1986 zahlan and zahlan 1991 since the national markets for sophisticated technological services of each arab state are small any serious effort to transfer technology has to involve substantial arab economic cooperation there has been no significant effort to date to implement inter arab cooperation in technology moreover the subject of technology transfer to the arab world has become synonymous with trade emery et al 1986 ilgen and pempel 1987 in this type of analysis arabs are not seen as participant in a process of technological development the main focus of this approach is on the suppliers of technology rather than the consumers in addition emphasis is often placed on the competition among the various industrial powers for the lucrative arab markets the behaviour of the arab trading parties tends to be of minor interest this is mainly due to the fact that much of the planning and decision making is done by foreign institutions the leading arab development institutions as well as the arab governments utilise foreign consulting firms almost exclusively zahlan 2014 in the presence of foreign skills and know how the construction of petrochemical plants refineries and water desalination plants is well within the capabilities of arab organisations arab firms lack neither the technical expertise nor the natural financial or human resources to undertake such projects what is missing is a variety of other inputs such as financial legal and technical support services that arab governments do not make available to their national organisations finally the weakness of arab science and technology systems in conjunction with the absence of effective science policies in the arab world have made the economic integration of technological activity very difficult zahlan and zahlan 1980 the inability to formulate and adopt sensible technology policies has contributed to the continuing disintegration of arab society and culture beblawi and luciani 1987 27 unemployment alienation marginalisation and the intensification of civil unrest and violence are all direct or indirect indicators of the absence of an integrated science policy and of the impact of that absence on the economic life of the arab world bizri 2017 science technology and security sectors in the military sector the referent object of security is mainly the state military action usually threatens the state s physical base territory and population and institutions buzan 1991 116 117 the relevance of science and technology to military security is highlighted by the need of states to produce weapons systems necessary for national defence it is not by accident that due to current conflicts in the region the major focus of many middle eastern states is access to military related technologies states that have the necessary technology to produce their own weapons systems find themselves in a better position than those that have to import weapons this is not only for economic reasons i e impact on trade balance but also because they can be less politically dependent on weapon supply countries when it comes to achieving military self reliance in the middle east technology transfer and the expansion of local production for international export are common objectives of regional countries singer 2009 indeed in their contacts with the major western producers of military equipment some middle eastern states have made it clear that if western providers of military equipment want to work with local arab companies they will have to transfer their technical knowledge to the ones that are part of a rising indigenous defence sector mouchantaf 2018 however some analysts are sceptical of this attitude because regional states lack the capability to absorb military technology not only due to the shortage of nationals in the defence industry but also because of the limited access to science engineering and mathematics graduates mouchantaf 2018 in the political sector the referent object of security can be the government or the citizens threats may arise as a result of peoples dissatisfaction with governmental policies or from the attempts of governments to exercise tight control over their citizens in their effort to maintain power surveillance and other control related technologies in the hands of governments such as control over the mass media and press show the relevance of technology to political security on the other hand the recent arab uprisings demonstrated that communication technologies such as the internet facebook and cell phones can be effectively used to organise and coordinate popular resistance to the government berman 2017 specifically although text messaging was used extensively in the arab spring it had a limited effect and did not lead to direct political change brown 2012 as a tool it helped individuals to communicate and coordinate but this impact was indirect satellite tv also had more subtle and varying effects what made the big difference was the use of cell phones which provided a ubiquitous image and video capture device ellis 2011 anyone possessing a cell phone could document and transmit footage instantly without camera phones the only actors capable of documenting the 2011 uprisings would have been professional journalists whose coverage is usually lacking in dynamic situations such as the arab spring cell phone technology also helped to include citizens who were watching events unfold as they were seeing video and images captured by regular citizens this mobilised individuals who felt like they too could take part in the protests and have a political voice social media and the internet also had a significant impact on the outcome of the arab uprisings as they offered the protestors a space to express and develop political viewpoints unhindered by regimes this is because social networking sites like facebook have structural features that promote participation and mobilisation hanska 2016 29 30 on the other hand the arab spring demonstrated that it is quite dangerous to be friends with regime critics on facebook for example the syrian electronic army sea was established to wage online war against assad opponents as a result sea has attacked domestic sites as well as international targets such as the associated press twitter account ellis 2011 technology however has a long history of being used in revolutionary movements in the middle east for example during the iranian revolution ayatollah khomeini produced and distributed tapes of sermons denouncing the shah helping to grow dissent in the country parallels can also be drawn with the cedar revolution of 2005 in lebanon where protests occurred after the lebanese prime minister was killed citizens demanded an investigation and the withdrawal of syrian troops from the country ellis 2011 a final aspect of the impact of the internet on the middle east conflicts involves the utilisation of social media for jihadist recruitment the phenomenon is particularly relevant in cases of so called self radicalisation where individuals succumb to the lure of extremist propaganda produced in middle east sites pulled into isis circles some cyber recruits carry out violent acts as lone wolves while others travel to the middle east in order to fight for the caliphate in the societal sector the referent object of security is collective identities such as religious or national identities buzan 1991 122 123 as in the political sector surveillance and other control related technologies can serve as instruments of power in the hands of governments that aim at controlling particular religious and ethnic groups this is the reason societal threats can be difficult to disentangle from political ones on the other hand targeted social groups may use communication technologies to raise support for their cause or invite external involvement for protection purposes in the economic sector national security issues can emerge involving linkages between economic capability on the one hand and military capability power and socio political stability on the other buzan 1991 126 due to its connection to economic development science and technology become central to economic considerations chambers 2015 ahmed 2018 moreover a state s military capability rests at least partly on the possession of an industrial base capable of supporting the armed forces the absence or the economic decline of basic industries can therefore raise questions about the ability of the state to support independent military production buzan and sen 1990 for example the desire of several middle eastern states to maintain or acquire production capability in key militarily related industries has inserted a national security requirement into the management of the national economy on the other hand the pursuit of military research and development has prevented some middle eastern states from investing in their civil economy yet when technology cannot support economic development economic threats may also enhance domestic instability the link between economic and political stability generates a set of questions about development which can easily be seen as national security issues for example some middle eastern states that are not efficient producers find themselves locked into a cycle of poverty and underdevelopment from which there is no obvious escape hence the governments of those states find themselves having to choose between investing in new technologies and knowledge creation at the expense of lowering the already very low living standards information and communication technologies ict constitute one of the fastest growing sectors in the middle east nevertheless most of the countries in the middle east have shown no signs of impending information revolutions irs the proliferation and ever more sophisticated employment of icts are critically dependent upon economic factors as well as the nature of the government and its role in ict development except for israel and turkey every other country in the region is deficient in necessary economic factors or government participation burkhart 2003 thus it has been argued that despite having high mobile penetration rates the middle east lags behind other areas in terms of technological advancement and regional states need to improve technology education and the regulatory framework saadi 2017 moreover governments need to address information related security vulnerabilities that threaten the operation of both the private and public sectors and impact national economies in the environmental sector science and technology become extremely relevant due to the need to have an efficient use of natural resources and to protect the environment the overall aridity of the middle east has motivated some of the richer countries to search for technological solutions to their water requirements through sustained investment in research they have become experts in water desalination water recycling and solar energy the region s oil poor countries however cannot afford such advanced technologies and remain dependent on more traditional water resources yet the need to secure access to water has led to the utilisation of construction related technology to create water dams unfortunately while these dams regulate the water flow to cropland generate vital electricity and supply potable water they also introduce environmental problems that have cast a shadow on their overall success since the region s major rivers no longer flood to produce natural fertilisers farmers downstream are forced to use massive amounts of artificial fertilisers which in turn pollute the regional rivers conclusion the technological dependence of arab countries has enhanced their vulnerability to outside interference and reduced their internal national integration national integration depends on economic exchanges within society dependent technology policies reduce such exchanges instead economic exchanges take place with foreign countries without involving the national population the counterpart of weak internal cohesiveness is a high degree of dependence on imports in general the extent of arab dependence on imports for all necessities of life is striking on the positive side middle eastern countries possess enormous human strategic and natural resources which if efficiently managed and put to effective use could induce a rapid economic change but those resources cannot be put to socioeconomic use because of the underdeveloped state of their national and regional institutions in other words socioeconomic development is difficult to achieve in the absence of an adequate level of political development this situation is a direct consequence of the strength and stability of the prevailing rentier political economy beblawi and luciani 1987 therefore middle east governments need to strengthen their political legal and institutional systems adopt a performance oriented political economy and introduce an appropriate science and technology policy today arab countries face three major challenges population pressures global increase of oil and gas sources and declining arab labour productivity mounting population pressures will decrease the resources available for undertaking economic reforms by the year 2050 an expected increase of some 400 million inhabitants will bring the total population to some 700 million half of these will be below the age of 18 this young population could be an important force for positive and creative change if provided with proper education and training the absence of appropriate technology policies however could transform this abundant and youthful population into a disruptive and destabilising force to this one may add the fact that the expanding number of gas and oil sources worldwide have combined to reduce arab income and increase the cost of imports in addition increasing labour productivity in the newly industrialising countries is reducing the attractiveness of arab countries for foreign direct investment most of the subcontracting to the arab states now is for low value added and low technology activities in other words internal and external factors are not favourable to promoting technological development in the middle east however it is imperative the future of any country is contingent on its capacity to produce the goods and services in demand the major tool in achieving this goal is science and technology the middle east has remained outside this competition because arab states have not sought to acquire the requisite political economy however people in the region retain the capacity to alter their future thus a positive response to global technological challenges would require the adoption of a successful program of technology transfer in order to narrow or close the technology gap technology transfer takes place over a substantial period of time and is a cumulative and systemic process transfer however involves changes in a country s political culture the legal system the economy social organisation and management to promote technological advances middle eastern governments should invest in quality education for youth continuous skills training for workers and managers and should ensure that knowledge is shared as widely as possible across society yet particular attention should be given to improving the investment climate which is crucial as are the right incentive structures to guide the allocation of resources and to encourage research and development successful countries have grown their ability to innovate by investing public funding to help finance research and development in critical areas the benefits to flow from technological revolution in an increasingly connected and knowledge intensive world will be seized by those countries that are sensitive and responsive to the rapidly changing environment and nimble enough to take advantage of the opportunities those who succeed will make substantial advances in reducing poverty and inequality those who do not will face enormous internal insecurity and will transform themselves into a threat

at the pembine food depot a northwoods grocery store tucked alongside a crook in highway 141 about 15 miles south of the michigan state line owner tim potterville has some good things going his bloody mary snack sticks are popular his deli cook whips up old family recipe dishes like the fabi ground beef cabbage and onions over potatoes fried in an electric skillet and his meat counter may be the only one in wisconsin offering al capone roast boneless pork butt stuffed with mozzarella black olives hard salami mushrooms and potterville s homemade italian sausage but where pembine food depot used to feature frito lay snacks on two end caps the boardwalk of grocery store real estate sales have dropped so much that potterville has exiled the chips to less prominent mid aisle territory the pepsi situation is similar just one end cap now instead of the former two the reason potterville said about two years ago dollar general the discount retailer that now has more than 15 000 stores nationwide opened about a quarter mile up 141 potterville estimates his sales have fallen 4 since dollar general s arrival seemingly not much but according to him enough to wipe out his profits and force him to extend his mortgage for 15 years yeah it s hurt a lot he said i can go down there buy pepsi for example pay tax on it and still get it cheaper there at the dollar general than i get it wholesale off the same truck much as walmart generated angst among retailers in small city downtowns decades ago when it ramped up its nationwide expansion dollar general s aggressive rollout is a gut check for grocers in even tinier communities how tiny coloma population 453 got a dollar general in 2017 neshkoro population 416 got one last year so did pittsville population 869 in february dollar general which already had a store in clintonville opened another six miles away in embarrass population 371 then there s pembine an unincorporated hamlet estimated to have 123 residents and one dollar general they re popping up everywhere said potterville 55 i ve been in this business for a long time and i know a lot of other retailers and usually when they come in they ll take and put a hurt on ma and pa interviews with 10 small town grocers confirmed that almost all said they d been hurt by a dollar general opening nearby the severity of the blow though is another question store owners in manawa and pittsville spoke of serious impact we ve got a deli thankfully and catering said john baum who has owned baum s mercantile in pittsville for 17 years and said sales had dropped 20 to 25 since dollar general opened in early 2018 because otherwise we would not be here in the marathon county community of edgar where dollar general opened in 2017 with village assistance through a tax financing district that also supported a factory expansion local iga owner lance bauer said the new competition had taken its toll in multiple departments he bristles at the accommodation to dollar general saying he got no financial help from the village when he bought what he described as a failing supermarket in 2012 but others sounded much less dire in stratford a village of 1 600 about 11 miles north of marshfield davel s one stop owner mark kraus while not happy to see dollar general come to town last year said the new competition didn t hurt us real bad not as bad as i thought it was going to hurt us in wittenberg sentry operator sherry hersant said the opening of a dollar general two or three years ago had been no problem to the extent that chains like dollar general take sales from local merchants however they drain money from the surrounding community in contrast to locally owned businesses profits from chains leave the area steven deller an economist at the university of wisconsin madison said by email independent retailers return more than three times as much money to their communities per dollar of sales than chain competitors said isabelle busenitz of the center for engagement and community development at kansas state university the name notwithstanding dollar general isn t an everything costs a buck place that s the realm of another discounter dollar tree which targets middle class consumers often in suburban locations dollar general like less successful rival family dollar stakes out different ground it packs the high shelving in its stores with a mini walmart array of items plastic totes small rugs coffeemakers spatulas duct tape paint brushes motor oil boys undershirts greeting cards coloring books lego sets dvds dollar general s main business though accounting for 77 of revenue last year is selling everyday consumables such as food cleaning supplies paper products and health and beauty items categories found in many supermarkets the institute for local self reliance a washington based advocacy group has pointed to independent grocers shutting down in other states because of dollar general but bill ryan a community business development specialist with the university of wisconsin extension said he knew of none in wisconsin i feel pretty strongly that they are not driving out many more businesses because they ve already been driven out he said if anything they re adding more economic life to a community the communities and neighborhoods dollar general seeks out often are those that are hurting its core customers are low and fixed income households and dollar general locates its stores accordingly the publicly traded company said in its most recent annual report to securities regulators for dollar general a bad economy isn t bad news at an investor conference in march 2016 ceo todd vasos said dollar general s extensive expansion opportunities were due in part to this economy that continues to create more of our core customer each and every year according to a transcript posted on research site seeking alpha at the time of the conference tennessee based dollar general had 12 483 stores nationwide and had identified potential sites for 13 000 more wisconsin is a prime target for that growth a map presented at the investor conference showed potential future store locations as green dots clustered tightly across much of the state as a swarm of honeybees forming a new colony the expansion prospects here may stem in part from the fact that until recently the state was relatively untapped by dollar general but in 2016 the firm opened a 100 million distribution center in janesville creating 550 jobs there and over the last two years dollar general has added wisconsin stores at nearly twice the national rate that s a big increase from the company s previous pace and took wisconsin as of march 1 to 171 stores by dollar general standards though there s plenty of room for more if wisconsin had roughly as many dollar generals per person as indiana and iowa there would be nearly 500 here family dollar meanwhile has been stuck on about 140 wisconsin locations since 2013 dollar general stores are cheap to open at about 250 000 each and cheap to run their sales floors average 7 400 square feet a typical walgreens has 10 600 and there s no need to hire say butchers or deli staff they re also profitable to develop many of the wisconsin sites have been developed by todd platt and the pfefferle companies inc of appleton real estate records for six dollar general locations across the state show that pfefferle entities bought the sites for prices ranging from 59 900 to 175 000 and after the stores were built sold the properties for 1 1 million to 1 2 million for those prices the buyers get a stream of rental income in the neighborhood of 75 000 to 90 000 a year current pfefferle store listings suggest platt declined to talk about the development of dollar general stores in wisconsin the institute for local self reliance views dollar stores as agents of economic distress by undermining the viability of independent grocery stores and other local businesses ryan of the uw extension doesn t agree but does believe that the growth of dollar stores reflects what for many americans remains a difficult economy i think it goes back to the great recession he said i think some of the impact is still being felt a dollar general spokeswoman said by email that the firm s stores represent economic growth for communities the stores offer both alternative and complementary options to items sold by grocers and other retailers she said like ryan rick shea president of shea food consultants in minneapolis didn t know of wisconsin grocers closing shop because of dollar general no he said but we ve heard a lot of the same thing that the volume gets split or a portion of it gets siphoned off and then it becomes kind of a slow decline and eventually even death if they don t have the wherewithal and the financing behind them development of some dollar general stores like those in edgar and in the waupaca county city of manawa has been helped by local government creating tax financing districts in manawa the city also received a 240 000 grant from the wisconsin economic development corp to clear an old milk and butter plant for construction of a dollar general mayor john smith said the store benefited the city of 1 327 by providing such items as clothing gardening gear and small hardware previously unavailable in manawa so we don t have to run to new london or clintonville or waupaca for everything and that keeps more people shopping at our local grocery store as well as getting gas at our local gas station smith said grocery store owner wendy remington sees things differently remington s quality foods the supermarket she and her husband run is right across bridge street from dollar general the chain store opened last november it s taken away quite a bit remington said about 80 to 85 of what they sell are consumables so pretty much i m left with all the things that take high labor to sell like the deli you need three four employees at least in a small store meat department you need two three people over the course of an hour on a recent saturday afternoon remington s attracted more customers than dollar general but not by much 21 cars pulling into one driveway 17 into the other among those at dollar general was heather sprenger a 35 year old lifelong manawa resident driving a shiny silverado pickup she does most of her major grocery shopping in larger cities but used to hit remington s occasionally too now not so much on this day she walked out of dollar general toting a plastic bag containing eight hot dogs two cans of spaghettios two cans of green giant cut green beans two boxes of kraft macaroni and cheese and a bottle of mountain dew for 8 easy supper for three girls sprenger said she said she makes about 17 an hour working at waupaca foundry and that her husband has a good job and they could afford to shop at pricier stores than dollar general but why she said when you can get the same stuff cheaper which perhaps suggests a path for independents confronted by the mushrooming dollar store phenomenon offer what the competition can t at the manawa dollar general a 55 year old dump truck driver named loren he wouldn t give his last name had just loaded up on pepsi but when it comes to buying cheese he s fussy he d never opt for dollar general s skimpy selection of velveeta kraft singles and private label swiss and cheddar rather he heads for remington s and its ample stock of dupont cheese made at a plant only a few miles north on highway 110 he particularly likes the jalapeno variety dupont has the best he said to survive in a world increasingly filled with grocery selling dollar stores the 2016 dollar general analysis suggests there s still room for another 10 000 independents must adapt and switch to fresh strategies shea said some of the wisconsin stores are trying to do just that but they don t sound optimistic in pembine potterville installed a grab and go bakery center on his prime end cap in manawa remington is trying to carry still more local products and has meat sales every few weeks to draw traffic but i really don t know she said i m worried about the future so is baum in pittsville for now he s riding the strength of his deli and catering and his longstanding presence in the community and for the future crossing my fingers and hoping he said contact rick

this is an excerpt from regional security in the middle east sectors variables and issues get your free copy here science and technology enhance the capabilities of states and societies to obtain and transform resources necessary for their development and advancement on the other hand lack of scientific knowledge and access to technology not only affects a country s level of development but also jeopardises its national security in an anarchic international system security interdependence implies that the security of a state is closely tied to the security of the other states and especially its neighbours since national securities are interdependent the security or insecurity of a state may have a considerable impact not only on the security of its immediate neighbours but also on the security of the whole region in which it is geographically embedded regional security technology as a factor affecting national security is closely related to population growth the greater the population growth and the greater the pace of the technological development of a country the greater the likelihood its activities and interests beyond its borders will expand the greater the demographic growth and the less rapid the technological development of a country the greater the likelihood it will face significant socio economic problems and instability choucri 2002 98 in other words unevenness in the interactive growth and development within and across the societies contributes to unevenness in the size development and capabilities of such societies to differential capabilities among them and to competitions conflicts and violence choucri 1984 as an engine of growth the potential of technology is still largely untapped in the middle east where states not only lack adequate skilled labour and capital but also use these factors less efficiently therefore the purpose of this chapter is to investigate the impact of science and technology on national and regional security in the middle east in doing so the chapter is divided into six sections the first section discusses the relationship between technology and development while the second section explores the relevance of science and technology to security drawing on a historical analysis the third section examines the reasons science and technology have not so far played an effective role in the development of middle eastern states and societies the next section identifies and discusses the instruments and patterns of technological development in the contemporary middle east the last section of the paper offers a sectoral analysis of the relationship between science and technology on the one hand and security national and regional in the middle east on the other the technology development relationship the commonly held view is that technology and development are strongly linked with development driven by technology and technology serving as a key indicator of national development in reality however technological change is often highly problematic with respect to its socio economic and environmental implications as it may exacerbate inequality uneven development ecological degradation and or social exclusion murphy 2017 1 a critical understanding of the drivers dynamics implications and geographically uneven distributions of technology and technological change is thus an important component of development studies and practice murphy 2017 1 generally speaking technology is the branch of knowledge that deals with the creation and use of technical means and their interrelation with life society and the environment drawing upon such subjects as industrial arts engineering sciences and applied sciences in this sense technology is embedded deeply in social cultural economic and political systems due to its spatial diffusion technology has uneven geographies of use significance and impact murphy 2017 1 with respect to development technology is seen as an essential driver and determinant of socioeconomic cultural environmental and political change economically technology can increase national productivity through improvements to the efficiency of production and logistics while encouraging and enhancing innovation and knowledge creation alternatively technology can exacerbate socioeconomic differences and create uneven development within and between countries and regions culturally technology has a profound effect on the norms and identities that help to constitute particular social groups environmentally technology can contribute in significant ways to greener and more sustainable societies or exacerbate ecological degradation through intensified or expanded impacts locally and globally politically technology can have democratising effects e g the facebook revolutions in the middle east or it can facilitate enhanced forms of repression or surveillance by state authorities hanska 2016 32 science and technology are key drivers of development this is because technological and scientific revolutions and innovations underpin economic advances and contribute to improvements in health systems education and infrastructure thus developments in science and technology have profound effects on economic and social development apart from constituting a salient political issue access to and application of technology are critical to a country s development by the same token access to high quality education especially higher education is essential for the creation of scientific knowledge science and technology are the differentiating factors among countries separating those that are able to tackle poverty effectively by growing and developing their economies and those that are not the level of countries economic development depends to a large extent on their ability to grasp and apply insights from science and technology and use them creatively to promote technological advances developing countries need to invest in quality education for youth continuous skills training for workers and managers as well as to ensure that knowledge is shared as widely as possible across society moreover adopting appropriate technologies leads directly to higher productivity which is the key to growth creativity and technological innovation emerge naturally in societies that have large stocks and flows of knowledge in sharp contrast in societies with limited stocks of knowledge creative people feel constrained and migrate to other countries thereby causing brain drain to their own countries and societies such societies are prone to remain in poverty and dependency hence in the presence of many social economic and defence needs and demands access to quality education as well as the adoption and application of appropriate technologies do not only constitute a policy question but also a question of policy priorities moreover both of these questions are tied to a country s political development science technology and security it has been suggested stivachtis 2011 397 422 that development and security are interrelated indeed the end of the cold war allowed the identification of development with human security undp 1993 2 for instance the declaration on the right to development 1986 2 asserts that all human beings have a human right to development and that development has been consequently subdivided into several sectors such as political development economic development and socio cultural development in addition development and the environment are inextricably linked undp 1994 24 40 moreover it has been shown stivachtis 2011 414 that there is a close relationship between development sectors and security sectors in the sense that the absence or presence of development in a particular sector impacts security and vice versa for example political development is related to political security while economic development is related to economic security as a result lack of political development has the potential of enhancing political insecurity yet as in the case of security problems in one development sector may affect other development sectors and as an extension the corresponding security sectors for instance political underdevelopment may affect economic development and therefore a state s economic security this means that security and development can to a great extent be operationalised in the same way mittleman 1988 22 yet it has been argued stivachtis 2011 415 that national security becomes inextricably connected to national development this means that neither development can be achieved without security nor security without development one of the most important questions in the field of security and development studies is whether a particular security or development sector is so significant that policy priority should be given to it the expectation is that if problems threats in this sector are addressed this would have positive effects on the other sectors addressing this question political scientists stress the political prerequisites for economic development political order and stability implying the presence and function of viable institutions and enforceable rules almond and coleman 1960 almond and powell 1966 for example whether political instability in a country may result from the inability of the national government to promote economic development and create sustainable and effective welfare mechanisms or from its inability to manage social and political change in a period of rapid economic growth political development appears to be fundamental as far as the last point is concerned the record contradicts the conventional wisdom that the way to avoid political instability is to stimulate economic development and industrialisation olsen 1963 empirical research shows that whatever the long term benefits of modernisation its short term impact tends to be more instability and sometimes violence skocpol 1994 feierabend et al 1966 thus discussion about development has emphasised political development meaning the need to establish institutions capable of managing socio political tensions and preventing their escalation into violence that may threaten the security of the state and its citizens however since developing states have widely divergent social economic and political attributes this diversity implies the absence of a unique policy formula that could apply without distinction to any developing state development enhances state power and capabilities and enhances national security on the other hand security provides the fertile ground for development while any threats to security ultimately affect development underdevelopment on the other hand increases the vulnerability of the state thereby enhancing its insecurity science and technology are key drivers of development and therefore central not only to a country s socio economic development but also its national security science technology and development in the middle east a historical account over the centuries scientific and technological advances have repeatedly enabled foreign powers to interfere with the functioning of middle eastern economies as well as to undermine the security of the less advanced countries of the region this section will discuss some of the main technology related events that led to this situation which continues today following the rise of islam in the seventh century science and technology flourished in the islamic world to a far greater extent than in the west muslim rulers promoted the translation of greek philosophy and science and then encouraged further scientific exploration in numerous fields including mathematics astronomy medicine pharmacology optics chemistry and physics much of the knowledge developed by the muslims and transmitted to the europeans enabled europe to emerge from the dark ages into the renaissance saliba 2011 until the sixteenth century the arab world was connected by a unique system of trade and transport that unified its large population scattered over vast areas of land and sea the system sustained the economy of each arab state underpinned trade with europe and fed into the various international trading systems bahlan 1999 261 in fact the arabs had developed an effective transnational trading system which reached its peak in the eighth to sixteenth centuries and which was based on local technological inputs such as skilled merchants and caravan managers navigators with extensive geographic knowledge efficiently operated ports and trading emporia scientifically bred camels and seaworthy dhows bahlan 1999 262 trust and mutual dependence among closely knit social groups prevailed the socioeconomic support of the transport and trading system enhanced regional harmony and the stability of local communities the mechanics of the arab trading system were so flexible that traders could move their business readily from place to place in response to changes in supply and demand or in order to avoid ruthless rulers or areas of conflict bahlan 1999 263 since trade brought prosperity and employment local governments sought to attract traders and provide security and support facilities to ease the process of trade and the life of the traveller the arab transport system was responsible for the large scale circulation of people and information this included the diffusion of agricultural products inventions and all types of knowledge thus the trade and transport system had a powerful economic social and cultural impact it also integrated the economies of arab countries with each other and with those of asia the mediterranean and africa according to antoine zahlan 1999 there are three main reasons middle eastern countries lag behind in terms of technology and scientific knowledge their loss of trade and transportation systems the effects of the industrial revolution on arab economies and the political and economic effects of the colonisation and neo colonisation processes the collapse of the arab trade and transport systems the collapse of the arab trade and transportation systems was induced by portuguese technological advances in ship design navigation and naval warfare guilmartin 1974 the strategic breakthrough was the invention of transoceanic ships these ships could carry a large number of guns and could navigate the high seas the arabs failed to acquire or develop the necessary technological capabilities to match portuguese naval vessels the small but powerful portuguese fleet interfered violently with trade between the arab world asia and africa guilmartin 1974 the portuguese used their superior naval force to harass and interfere with shipping attack coastal towns loot ships and pillage coastal towns ottoman technical assistance to the cities of the arabian peninsula ultimately saved the people of the arab coastal towns from outright massacre by the portuguese for the next three centuries the forces of the ottoman empire protected the region from european devastation however the ottomans themselves were unable to cope with european technological challenges and their empire eventually collapsed portugal s naval technology diffused to the european atlantic states by the early seventeenth century the british the dutch and the french had displaced the portuguese from the indian ocean between 1620 and 1670 these three countries introduced a new innovation the east india company which controlled fleets marketing systems finances storage space and armies platt 1977 while arab trade depended on the efforts of a very large number of traders operating in a small scale and each working on their own the east india company was centrally managed possessing the financial resources necessary to exercise monopolistic behaviour and thus control markets consequently the east india company quickly managed to eliminate arab long distance trade platt 1977 by the eighteenth century trade routes throughout the middle east were being reoriented toward coastal towns and european trade and transport whereas the arab international trading system had been heavily land based and internal the new system was heavily dependent on european shipping and trade bahlan 1996 264 this loss was soon followed by the progressive displacement of internal land based long distance travel services by european shipping no serious arab competition arose to challenge the rapid development of european mediterranean shipping firms headrick 1981 when in 1832 the french occupied algeria and later tunisia and morocco they sought to close all trans saharan routes which were being used by resistance movements and by clandestine trade bahlan 1999 265 thus by the early twentieth century the complex and rich system of internal trans saharan transport had been dismantled two further technological developments accelerated the dismantling of regional and local trade and transport systems the construction and operation of railway systems by foreign firms and the construction of the suez canal headrick 1981 by the latter part of the nineteenth century the national systems of trade and transport had disintegrated to the level where they were replaced by totally imported systems with very little local participation zahlan and zahlan 1978 the displacement of camel based transport technology with railway and steamship technologies without the transfer of mechanical and new naval technologies meant that the arabs lost the employment generated by operating their system of transport headrick 1981 even today arab countries remain unable to acquire the employment derived from operating and maintaining their extensive transport systems the strength of the arab and muslim worlds was based on a common market and not on political unity although many arab countries were in conflict this did not eliminate trade and cultural exchanges between them but as the arabs were unable to acquire adopt or develop alternative technologies to contain technological challenges which eventually led to the collapse of the transnational arab trading system the forces that bound the arab communities to each other were loosened and the cohesiveness of the arab world began to weaken industrial revolution the second phase of technology dismantling was induced by the industrial revolution which undermined the traditional textile industries that were firmly based in arab countries steam power machine production chemical sciences and technology electrification petroleum production and refining communication technologies radio electric power and engineering and countless advances in medical science construction technologies city planning and management systems all had dramatic consequences for the arab world every technological advance in europe contributed to the continuing decline of inter arab cohesiveness zahlan and zahaln 1997 the acquisition of western military technologies beginning with the ottomans and muhammad ali led to the progressive divorce of military institutions from their local environment and to their progressive integration into the military industrial intelligence complexes of western powers new technology was imported in a dependent mode and packaged with its consultants contractors operators and financiers and without any effort being made to develop new technologies at home zahlan and zahlan 1991 the cost of this dependency was enormous as were the resulting economic and political consequences of the egyptian and ottoman debts the occupation of egypt in 1882 and the collapse of the economy of the ottoman empire colonisation and independence the third phase of technology dismantling began with the direct occupation of arab countries when practically every single important decision was made by the emissaries of the colonial powers colonialism affected all aspects of life in the middle east the net result was the further divorce of the elites the culture and the economy of the region from technical matters zahlan 1999 267 the fourth phase was induced by political independence when independence was achieved the rulers and elites of the new states had little knowledge of contemporary developments in science and technology which had become so central to the industrialised world in the late twentieth century not only did all equipment industrial supplies and maintenance services have to be imported but also arab countries depended completely on foreign consulting and contracting services helie 1973 the new leaders sought to develop their countries through the rapid expansion of educational systems and investment in new industries cultural distortions and alienation were intensified by the accelerated programs adopted at this time beblawi and luciani 1987 because they wished to accelerate the process of development the new national elites unknowingly adopted methods that ultimately led to even greater technological dependence as a result foreign consulting firms conceived and designed enormous projects foreign accounting and law firms monitored them and an army of foreign contractors and foreign labour implemented them zahlan and zahlan 1978 although major things were built such as power and desalination plants hospitals irrigation schemes enormous dams transport systems and airports locals contributed little to the process beblawi and luciani 1987 however those who mediated these contracts earned enormous commissions and well placed people accumulated personal fortunes in the billions of dollars zahlan and zahlan 1984 meanwhile the gap between the arab world and industrial countries has continued to grow and arab economies still suffer from chronic stagnation and low productivity components and instruments of technology systems the major instruments of national technological development are university education systems research and development r d national consulting and contracting firms relevant economic and financial institutions to support technological development and science policy zahlan 1996 269 there has been a significant and dramatic expansion of the proportion of people in the middle east who have completed four or more years of higher education the number of universities has also increased including a significant number of foreign universities kjerfve 2014 yet the quality of higher education in the middle east is among the lowest in the world only two or three arab universities are in the list of the top 500 universities in the world and none is in the top 200 employers in the region complain that university graduates lack the skills needed to work in the global marketplace many are not well trained in science mathematics engineering and other technical subjects where the jobs are furthermore these graduates lack the soft skills including creativity and teamwork partly because their training has emphasised memorisation and rote learning devarajan 2016 much of the emphasis of arab foreign education has been in science and engineering qasem 1998 doctoral level knowledge producing education however is still highly underdeveloped in the region and therefore specialisation is pursued abroad dini et al 2015 arab universities have been the leading centres for both basic and applied research in science and technology the number of professors in arab universities has increased with the majority of them associated with science and technology zahlan 2012 the number of research and development centres also increased with half of them engaging in research in agriculture nutrition water and irrigation marine sciences and the biological science the rest focus on oil and petrochemicals ecology basic sciences and computer science lightfoot 2018 research activity in arab countries is thus highly focused on applied subjects with a priority in medicine and agriculture despite the valiant efforts of a number of scientists basic research is on such a small scale that it is virtually non existent zahlan 2012 r d organisations play a major role in successful planning design and operation of economic installations however because the consulting and contracting services utilised in establishing industrial plants are generally imported on a turnkey basis the demand for local r d services is still limited sehnaoui 2017 technological dependence severely constrains the development of the requisite r d capabilities to support and service the various economic sectors zahlan 2014 arab science and technology related human resources are more than adequate and could in principle constitute an integrative social factor but in the absence of rational and appropriate science policies and adequate financial resources the potential of this human resource is dissipated zahlan 2012 the reason for such a low figure is the lack of resources and the absence of demand for services by nationals both the public and private sectors depend nearly exclusively on foreign firms for technical services zahlan 2014 arab countries are near the top of the developing world level of activity but far below the levels of industrial countries thus although the output may be comparable the application of scientific findings is more constrained than in other large developing countries where there are no political or economic barriers to the circulation of ideas and expertise segal 2018 the arab world provides a large market for technology products and services this can be seen from the large number of identical contracts for the same technology that are awarded repeatedly over short periods of time in a number of technological fields such a market provides excellent opportunities for technology transfer because technology is best acquired as part of the repeated undertaking of similar projects zahlan 2012 the absence of adequate financial and insurance services to support national consulting and contracting firms combined with the absence of adequate technology policies are the main reasons for the slow pace at which technology trickles into the region zahlan 1984 contracts with foreign consulting and contracting firms are in agricultural development construction transport systems industry educational technologies aviation communication and so on emery et al 1986 zahlan and zahlan 1991 since the national markets for sophisticated technological services of each arab state are small any serious effort to transfer technology has to involve substantial arab economic cooperation there has been no significant effort to date to implement inter arab cooperation in technology moreover the subject of technology transfer to the arab world has become synonymous with trade emery et al 1986 ilgen and pempel 1987 in this type of analysis arabs are not seen as participant in a process of technological development the main focus of this approach is on the suppliers of technology rather than the consumers in addition emphasis is often placed on the competition among the various industrial powers for the lucrative arab markets the behaviour of the arab trading parties tends to be of minor interest this is mainly due to the fact that much of the planning and decision making is done by foreign institutions the leading arab development institutions as well as the arab governments utilise foreign consulting firms almost exclusively zahlan 2014 in the presence of foreign skills and know how the construction of petrochemical plants refineries and water desalination plants is well within the capabilities of arab organisations arab firms lack neither the technical expertise nor the natural financial or human resources to undertake such projects what is missing is a variety of other inputs such as financial legal and technical support services that arab governments do not make available to their national organisations finally the weakness of arab science and technology systems in conjunction with the absence of effective science policies in the arab world have made the economic integration of technological activity very difficult zahlan and zahlan 1980 the inability to formulate and adopt sensible technology policies has contributed to the continuing disintegration of arab society and culture beblawi and luciani 1987 27 unemployment alienation marginalisation and the intensification of civil unrest and violence are all direct or indirect indicators of the absence of an integrated science policy and of the impact of that absence on the economic life of the arab world bizri 2017 science technology and security sectors in the military sector the referent object of security is mainly the state military action usually threatens the state s physical base territory and population and institutions buzan 1991 116 117 the relevance of science and technology to military security is highlighted by the need of states to produce weapons systems necessary for national defence it is not by accident that due to current conflicts in the region the major focus of many middle eastern states is access to military related technologies states that have the necessary technology to produce their own weapons systems find themselves in a better position than those that have to import weapons this is not only for economic reasons i e impact on trade balance but also because they can be less politically dependent on weapon supply countries when it comes to achieving military self reliance in the middle east technology transfer and the expansion of local production for international export are common objectives of regional countries singer 2009 indeed in their contacts with the major western producers of military equipment some middle eastern states have made it clear that if western providers of military equipment want to work with local arab companies they will have to transfer their technical knowledge to the ones that are part of a rising indigenous defence sector mouchantaf 2018 however some analysts are sceptical of this attitude because regional states lack the capability to absorb military technology not only due to the shortage of nationals in the defence industry but also because of the limited access to science engineering and mathematics graduates mouchantaf 2018 in the political sector the referent object of security can be the government or the citizens threats may arise as a result of peoples dissatisfaction with governmental policies or from the attempts of governments to exercise tight control over their citizens in their effort to maintain power surveillance and other control related technologies in the hands of governments such as control over the mass media and press show the relevance of technology to political security on the other hand the recent arab uprisings demonstrated that communication technologies such as the internet facebook and cell phones can be effectively used to organise and coordinate popular resistance to the government berman 2017 specifically although text messaging was used extensively in the arab spring it had a limited effect and did not lead to direct political change brown 2012 as a tool it helped individuals to communicate and coordinate but this impact was indirect satellite tv also had more subtle and varying effects what made the big difference was the use of cell phones which provided a ubiquitous image and video capture device ellis 2011 anyone possessing a cell phone could document and transmit footage instantly without camera phones the only actors capable of documenting the 2011 uprisings would have been professional journalists whose coverage is usually lacking in dynamic situations such as the arab spring cell phone technology also helped to include citizens who were watching events unfold as they were seeing video and images captured by regular citizens this mobilised individuals who felt like they too could take part in the protests and have a political voice social media and the internet also had a significant impact on the outcome of the arab uprisings as they offered the protestors a space to express and develop political viewpoints unhindered by regimes this is because social networking sites like facebook have structural features that promote participation and mobilisation hanska 2016 29 30 on the other hand the arab spring demonstrated that it is quite dangerous to be friends with regime critics on facebook for example the syrian electronic army sea was established to wage online war against assad opponents as a result sea has attacked domestic sites as well as international targets such as the associated press twitter account ellis 2011 technology however has a long history of being used in revolutionary movements in the middle east for example during the iranian revolution ayatollah khomeini produced and distributed tapes of sermons denouncing the shah helping to grow dissent in the country parallels can also be drawn with the cedar revolution of 2005 in lebanon where protests occurred after the lebanese prime minister was killed citizens demanded an investigation and the withdrawal of syrian troops from the country ellis 2011 a final aspect of the impact of the internet on the middle east conflicts involves the utilisation of social media for jihadist recruitment the phenomenon is particularly relevant in cases of so called self radicalisation where individuals succumb to the lure of extremist propaganda produced in middle east sites pulled into isis circles some cyber recruits carry out violent acts as lone wolves while others travel to the middle east in order to fight for the caliphate in the societal sector the referent object of security is collective identities such as religious or national identities buzan 1991 122 123 as in the political sector surveillance and other control related technologies can serve as instruments of power in the hands of governments that aim at controlling particular religious and ethnic groups this is the reason societal threats can be difficult to disentangle from political ones on the other hand targeted social groups may use communication technologies to raise support for their cause or invite external involvement for protection purposes in the economic sector national security issues can emerge involving linkages between economic capability on the one hand and military capability power and socio political stability on the other buzan 1991 126 due to its connection to economic development science and technology become central to economic considerations chambers 2015 ahmed 2018 moreover a state s military capability rests at least partly on the possession of an industrial base capable of supporting the armed forces the absence or the economic decline of basic industries can therefore raise questions about the ability of the state to support independent military production buzan and sen 1990 for example the desire of several middle eastern states to maintain or acquire production capability in key militarily related industries has inserted a national security requirement into the management of the national economy on the other hand the pursuit of military research and development has prevented some middle eastern states from investing in their civil economy yet when technology cannot support economic development economic threats may also enhance domestic instability the link between economic and political stability generates a set of questions about development which can easily be seen as national security issues for example some middle eastern states that are not efficient producers find themselves locked into a cycle of poverty and underdevelopment from which there is no obvious escape hence the governments of those states find themselves having to choose between investing in new technologies and knowledge creation at the expense of lowering the already very low living standards information and communication technologies ict constitute one of the fastest growing sectors in the middle east nevertheless most of the countries in the middle east have shown no signs of impending information revolutions irs the proliferation and ever more sophisticated employment of icts are critically dependent upon economic factors as well as the nature of the government and its role in ict development except for israel and turkey every other country in the region is deficient in necessary economic factors or government participation burkhart 2003 thus it has been argued that despite having high mobile penetration rates the middle east lags behind other areas in terms of technological advancement and regional states need to improve technology education and the regulatory framework saadi 2017 moreover governments need to address information related security vulnerabilities that threaten the operation of both the private and public sectors and impact national economies in the environmental sector science and technology become extremely relevant due to the need to have an efficient use of natural resources and to protect the environment the overall aridity of the middle east has motivated some of the richer countries to search for technological solutions to their water requirements through sustained investment in research they have become experts in water desalination water recycling and solar energy the region s oil poor countries however cannot afford such advanced technologies and remain dependent on more traditional water resources yet the need to secure access to water has led to the utilisation of construction related technology to create water dams unfortunately while these dams regulate the water flow to cropland generate vital electricity and supply potable water they also introduce environmental problems that have cast a shadow on their overall success since the region s major rivers no longer flood to produce natural fertilisers farmers downstream are forced to use massive amounts of artificial fertilisers which in turn pollute the regional rivers conclusion the technological dependence of arab countries has enhanced their vulnerability to outside interference and reduced their internal national integration national integration depends on economic exchanges within society dependent technology policies reduce such exchanges instead economic exchanges take place with foreign countries without involving the national population the counterpart of weak internal cohesiveness is a high degree of dependence on imports in general the extent of arab dependence on imports for all necessities of life is striking on the positive side middle eastern countries possess enormous human strategic and natural resources which if efficiently managed and put to effective use could induce a rapid economic change but those resources cannot be put to socioeconomic use because of the underdeveloped state of their national and regional institutions in other words socioeconomic development is difficult to achieve in the absence of an adequate level of political development this situation is a direct consequence of the strength and stability of the prevailing rentier political economy beblawi and luciani 1987 therefore middle east governments need to strengthen their political legal and institutional systems adopt a performance oriented political economy and introduce an appropriate science and technology policy today arab countries face three major challenges population pressures global increase of oil and gas sources and declining arab labour productivity mounting population pressures will decrease the resources available for undertaking economic reforms by the year 2050 an expected increase of some 400 million inhabitants will bring the total population to some 700 million half of these will be below the age of 18 this young population could be an important force for positive and creative change if provided with proper education and training the absence of appropriate technology policies however could transform this abundant and youthful population into a disruptive and destabilising force to this one may add the fact that the expanding number of gas and oil sources worldwide have combined to reduce arab income and increase the cost of imports in addition increasing labour productivity in the newly industrialising countries is reducing the attractiveness of arab countries for foreign direct investment most of the subcontracting to the arab states now is for low value added and low technology activities in other words internal and external factors are not favourable to promoting technological development in the middle east however it is imperative the future of any country is contingent on its capacity to produce the goods and services in demand the major tool in achieving this goal is science and technology the middle east has remained outside this competition because arab states have not sought to acquire the requisite political economy however people in the region retain the capacity to alter their future thus a positive response to global technological challenges would require the adoption of a successful program of technology transfer in order to narrow or close the technology gap technology transfer takes place over a substantial period of time and is a cumulative and systemic process transfer however involves changes in a country s political culture the legal system the economy social organisation and management to promote technological advances middle eastern governments should invest in quality education for youth continuous skills training for workers and managers and should ensure that knowledge is shared as widely as possible across society yet particular attention should be given to improving the investment climate which is crucial as are the right incentive structures to guide the allocation of resources and to encourage research and development successful countries have grown their ability to innovate by investing public funding to help finance research and development in critical areas the benefits to flow from technological revolution in an increasingly connected and knowledge intensive world will be seized by those countries that are sensitive and responsive to the rapidly changing environment and nimble enough to take advantage of the opportunities those who succeed will make substantial advances in reducing poverty and inequality those who do not will face enormous internal insecurity and will transform themselves into a threat

this is an excerpt from regional security in the middle east sectors variables and issues get your free copy here science and technology enhance the capabilities of states and societies to obtain and transform resources necessary for their development and advancement on the other hand lack of scientific knowledge and access to technology not only affects a country s level of development but also jeopardises its national security in an anarchic international system security interdependence implies that the security of a state is closely tied to the security of the other states and especially its neighbours since national securities are interdependent the security or insecurity of a state may have a considerable impact not only on the security of its immediate neighbours but also on the security of the whole region in which it is geographically embedded regional security technology as a factor affecting national security is closely related to population growth the greater the population growth and the greater the pace of the technological development of a country the greater the likelihood its activities and interests beyond its borders will expand the greater the demographic growth and the less rapid the technological development of a country the greater the likelihood it will face significant socio economic problems and instability choucri 2002 98 in other words unevenness in the interactive growth and development within and across the societies contributes to unevenness in the size development and capabilities of such societies to differential capabilities among them and to competitions conflicts and violence choucri 1984 as an engine of growth the potential of technology is still largely untapped in the middle east where states not only lack adequate skilled labour and capital but also use these factors less efficiently therefore the purpose of this chapter is to investigate the impact of science and technology on national and regional security in the middle east in doing so the chapter is divided into six sections the first section discusses the relationship between technology and development while the second section explores the relevance of science and technology to security drawing on a historical analysis the third section examines the reasons science and technology have not so far played an effective role in the development of middle eastern states and societies the next section identifies and discusses the instruments and patterns of technological development in the contemporary middle east the last section of the paper offers a sectoral analysis of the relationship between science and technology on the one hand and security national and regional in the middle east on the other the technology development relationship the commonly held view is that technology and development are strongly linked with development driven by technology and technology serving as a key indicator of national development in reality however technological change is often highly problematic with respect to its socio economic and environmental implications as it may exacerbate inequality uneven development ecological degradation and or social exclusion murphy 2017 1 a critical understanding of the drivers dynamics implications and geographically uneven distributions of technology and technological change is thus an important component of development studies and practice murphy 2017 1 generally speaking technology is the branch of knowledge that deals with the creation and use of technical means and their interrelation with life society and the environment drawing upon such subjects as industrial arts engineering sciences and applied sciences in this sense technology is embedded deeply in social cultural economic and political systems due to its spatial diffusion technology has uneven geographies of use significance and impact murphy 2017 1 with respect to development technology is seen as an essential driver and determinant of socioeconomic cultural environmental and political change economically technology can increase national productivity through improvements to the efficiency of production and logistics while encouraging and enhancing innovation and knowledge creation alternatively technology can exacerbate socioeconomic differences and create uneven development within and between countries and regions culturally technology has a profound effect on the norms and identities that help to constitute particular social groups environmentally technology can contribute in significant ways to greener and more sustainable societies or exacerbate ecological degradation through intensified or expanded impacts locally and globally politically technology can have democratising effects e g the facebook revolutions in the middle east or it can facilitate enhanced forms of repression or surveillance by state authorities hanska 2016 32 science and technology are key drivers of development this is because technological and scientific revolutions and innovations underpin economic advances and contribute to improvements in health systems education and infrastructure thus developments in science and technology have profound effects on economic and social development apart from constituting a salient political issue access to and application of technology are critical to a country s development by the same token access to high quality education especially higher education is essential for the creation of scientific knowledge science and technology are the differentiating factors among countries separating those that are able to tackle poverty effectively by growing and developing their economies and those that are not the level of countries economic development depends to a large extent on their ability to grasp and apply insights from science and technology and use them creatively to promote technological advances developing countries need to invest in quality education for youth continuous skills training for workers and managers as well as to ensure that knowledge is shared as widely as possible across society moreover adopting appropriate technologies leads directly to higher productivity which is the key to growth creativity and technological innovation emerge naturally in societies that have large stocks and flows of knowledge in sharp contrast in societies with limited stocks of knowledge creative people feel constrained and migrate to other countries thereby causing brain drain to their own countries and societies such societies are prone to remain in poverty and dependency hence in the presence of many social economic and defence needs and demands access to quality education as well as the adoption and application of appropriate technologies do not only constitute a policy question but also a question of policy priorities moreover both of these questions are tied to a country s political development science technology and security it has been suggested stivachtis 2011 397 422 that development and security are interrelated indeed the end of the cold war allowed the identification of development with human security undp 1993 2 for instance the declaration on the right to development 1986 2 asserts that all human beings have a human right to development and that development has been consequently subdivided into several sectors such as political development economic development and socio cultural development in addition development and the environment are inextricably linked undp 1994 24 40 moreover it has been shown stivachtis 2011 414 that there is a close relationship between development sectors and security sectors in the sense that the absence or presence of development in a particular sector impacts security and vice versa for example political development is related to political security while economic development is related to economic security as a result lack of political development has the potential of enhancing political insecurity yet as in the case of security problems in one development sector may affect other development sectors and as an extension the corresponding security sectors for instance political underdevelopment may affect economic development and therefore a state s economic security this means that security and development can to a great extent be operationalised in the same way mittleman 1988 22 yet it has been argued stivachtis 2011 415 that national security becomes inextricably connected to national development this means that neither development can be achieved without security nor security without development one of the most important questions in the field of security and development studies is whether a particular security or development sector is so significant that policy priority should be given to it the expectation is that if problems threats in this sector are addressed this would have positive effects on the other sectors addressing this question political scientists stress the political prerequisites for economic development political order and stability implying the presence and function of viable institutions and enforceable rules almond and coleman 1960 almond and powell 1966 for example whether political instability in a country may result from the inability of the national government to promote economic development and create sustainable and effective welfare mechanisms or from its inability to manage social and political change in a period of rapid economic growth political development appears to be fundamental as far as the last point is concerned the record contradicts the conventional wisdom that the way to avoid political instability is to stimulate economic development and industrialisation olsen 1963 empirical research shows that whatever the long term benefits of modernisation its short term impact tends to be more instability and sometimes violence skocpol 1994 feierabend et al 1966 thus discussion about development has emphasised political development meaning the need to establish institutions capable of managing socio political tensions and preventing their escalation into violence that may threaten the security of the state and its citizens however since developing states have widely divergent social economic and political attributes this diversity implies the absence of a unique policy formula that could apply without distinction to any developing state development enhances state power and capabilities and enhances national security on the other hand security provides the fertile ground for development while any threats to security ultimately affect development underdevelopment on the other hand increases the vulnerability of the state thereby enhancing its insecurity science and technology are key drivers of development and therefore central not only to a country s socio economic development but also its national security science technology and development in the middle east a historical account over the centuries scientific and technological advances have repeatedly enabled foreign powers to interfere with the functioning of middle eastern economies as well as to undermine the security of the less advanced countries of the region this section will discuss some of the main technology related events that led to this situation which continues today following the rise of islam in the seventh century science and technology flourished in the islamic world to a far greater extent than in the west muslim rulers promoted the translation of greek philosophy and science and then encouraged further scientific exploration in numerous fields including mathematics astronomy medicine pharmacology optics chemistry and physics much of the knowledge developed by the muslims and transmitted to the europeans enabled europe to emerge from the dark ages into the renaissance saliba 2011 until the sixteenth century the arab world was connected by a unique system of trade and transport that unified its large population scattered over vast areas of land and sea the system sustained the economy of each arab state underpinned trade with europe and fed into the various international trading systems bahlan 1999 261 in fact the arabs had developed an effective transnational trading system which reached its peak in the eighth to sixteenth centuries and which was based on local technological inputs such as skilled merchants and caravan managers navigators with extensive geographic knowledge efficiently operated ports and trading emporia scientifically bred camels and seaworthy dhows bahlan 1999 262 trust and mutual dependence among closely knit social groups prevailed the socioeconomic support of the transport and trading system enhanced regional harmony and the stability of local communities the mechanics of the arab trading system were so flexible that traders could move their business readily from place to place in response to changes in supply and demand or in order to avoid ruthless rulers or areas of conflict bahlan 1999 263 since trade brought prosperity and employment local governments sought to attract traders and provide security and support facilities to ease the process of trade and the life of the traveller the arab transport system was responsible for the large scale circulation of people and information this included the diffusion of agricultural products inventions and all types of knowledge thus the trade and transport system had a powerful economic social and cultural impact it also integrated the economies of arab countries with each other and with those of asia the mediterranean and africa according to antoine zahlan 1999 there are three main reasons middle eastern countries lag behind in terms of technology and scientific knowledge their loss of trade and transportation systems the effects of the industrial revolution on arab economies and the political and economic effects of the colonisation and neo colonisation processes the collapse of the arab trade and transport systems the collapse of the arab trade and transportation systems was induced by portuguese technological advances in ship design navigation and naval warfare guilmartin 1974 the strategic breakthrough was the invention of transoceanic ships these ships could carry a large number of guns and could navigate the high seas the arabs failed to acquire or develop the necessary technological capabilities to match portuguese naval vessels the small but powerful portuguese fleet interfered violently with trade between the arab world asia and africa guilmartin 1974 the portuguese used their superior naval force to harass and interfere with shipping attack coastal towns loot ships and pillage coastal towns ottoman technical assistance to the cities of the arabian peninsula ultimately saved the people of the arab coastal towns from outright massacre by the portuguese for the next three centuries the forces of the ottoman empire protected the region from european devastation however the ottomans themselves were unable to cope with european technological challenges and their empire eventually collapsed portugal s naval technology diffused to the european atlantic states by the early seventeenth century the british the dutch and the french had displaced the portuguese from the indian ocean between 1620 and 1670 these three countries introduced a new innovation the east india company which controlled fleets marketing systems finances storage space and armies platt 1977 while arab trade depended on the efforts of a very large number of traders operating in a small scale and each working on their own the east india company was centrally managed possessing the financial resources necessary to exercise monopolistic behaviour and thus control markets consequently the east india company quickly managed to eliminate arab long distance trade platt 1977 by the eighteenth century trade routes throughout the middle east were being reoriented toward coastal towns and european trade and transport whereas the arab international trading system had been heavily land based and internal the new system was heavily dependent on european shipping and trade bahlan 1996 264 this loss was soon followed by the progressive displacement of internal land based long distance travel services by european shipping no serious arab competition arose to challenge the rapid development of european mediterranean shipping firms headrick 1981 when in 1832 the french occupied algeria and later tunisia and morocco they sought to close all trans saharan routes which were being used by resistance movements and by clandestine trade bahlan 1999 265 thus by the early twentieth century the complex and rich system of internal trans saharan transport had been dismantled two further technological developments accelerated the dismantling of regional and local trade and transport systems the construction and operation of railway systems by foreign firms and the construction of the suez canal headrick 1981 by the latter part of the nineteenth century the national systems of trade and transport had disintegrated to the level where they were replaced by totally imported systems with very little local participation zahlan and zahlan 1978 the displacement of camel based transport technology with railway and steamship technologies without the transfer of mechanical and new naval technologies meant that the arabs lost the employment generated by operating their system of transport headrick 1981 even today arab countries remain unable to acquire the employment derived from operating and maintaining their extensive transport systems the strength of the arab and muslim worlds was based on a common market and not on political unity although many arab countries were in conflict this did not eliminate trade and cultural exchanges between them but as the arabs were unable to acquire adopt or develop alternative technologies to contain technological challenges which eventually led to the collapse of the transnational arab trading system the forces that bound the arab communities to each other were loosened and the cohesiveness of the arab world began to weaken industrial revolution the second phase of technology dismantling was induced by the industrial revolution which undermined the traditional textile industries that were firmly based in arab countries steam power machine production chemical sciences and technology electrification petroleum production and refining communication technologies radio electric power and engineering and countless advances in medical science construction technologies city planning and management systems all had dramatic consequences for the arab world every technological advance in europe contributed to the continuing decline of inter arab cohesiveness zahlan and zahaln 1997 the acquisition of western military technologies beginning with the ottomans and muhammad ali led to the progressive divorce of military institutions from their local environment and to their progressive integration into the military industrial intelligence complexes of western powers new technology was imported in a dependent mode and packaged with its consultants contractors operators and financiers and without any effort being made to develop new technologies at home zahlan and zahlan 1991 the cost of this dependency was enormous as were the resulting economic and political consequences of the egyptian and ottoman debts the occupation of egypt in 1882 and the collapse of the economy of the ottoman empire colonisation and independence the third phase of technology dismantling began with the direct occupation of arab countries when practically every single important decision was made by the emissaries of the colonial powers colonialism affected all aspects of life in the middle east the net result was the further divorce of the elites the culture and the economy of the region from technical matters zahlan 1999 267 the fourth phase was induced by political independence when independence was achieved the rulers and elites of the new states had little knowledge of contemporary developments in science and technology which had become so central to the industrialised world in the late twentieth century not only did all equipment industrial supplies and maintenance services have to be imported but also arab countries depended completely on foreign consulting and contracting services helie 1973 the new leaders sought to develop their countries through the rapid expansion of educational systems and investment in new industries cultural distortions and alienation were intensified by the accelerated programs adopted at this time beblawi and luciani 1987 because they wished to accelerate the process of development the new national elites unknowingly adopted methods that ultimately led to even greater technological dependence as a result foreign consulting firms conceived and designed enormous projects foreign accounting and law firms monitored them and an army of foreign contractors and foreign labour implemented them zahlan and zahlan 1978 although major things were built such as power and desalination plants hospitals irrigation schemes enormous dams transport systems and airports locals contributed little to the process beblawi and luciani 1987 however those who mediated these contracts earned enormous commissions and well placed people accumulated personal fortunes in the billions of dollars zahlan and zahlan 1984 meanwhile the gap between the arab world and industrial countries has continued to grow and arab economies still suffer from chronic stagnation and low productivity components and instruments of technology systems the major instruments of national technological development are university education systems research and development r d national consulting and contracting firms relevant economic and financial institutions to support technological development and science policy zahlan 1996 269 there has been a significant and dramatic expansion of the proportion of people in the middle east who have completed four or more years of higher education the number of universities has also increased including a significant number of foreign universities kjerfve 2014 yet the quality of higher education in the middle east is among the lowest in the world only two or three arab universities are in the list of the top 500 universities in the world and none is in the top 200 employers in the region complain that university graduates lack the skills needed to work in the global marketplace many are not well trained in science mathematics engineering and other technical subjects where the jobs are furthermore these graduates lack the soft skills including creativity and teamwork partly because their training has emphasised memorisation and rote learning devarajan 2016 much of the emphasis of arab foreign education has been in science and engineering qasem 1998 doctoral level knowledge producing education however is still highly underdeveloped in the region and therefore specialisation is pursued abroad dini et al 2015 arab universities have been the leading centres for both basic and applied research in science and technology the number of professors in arab universities has increased with the majority of them associated with science and technology zahlan 2012 the number of research and development centres also increased with half of them engaging in research in agriculture nutrition water and irrigation marine sciences and the biological science the rest focus on oil and petrochemicals ecology basic sciences and computer science lightfoot 2018 research activity in arab countries is thus highly focused on applied subjects with a priority in medicine and agriculture despite the valiant efforts of a number of scientists basic research is on such a small scale that it is virtually non existent zahlan 2012 r d organisations play a major role in successful planning design and operation of economic installations however because the consulting and contracting services utilised in establishing industrial plants are generally imported on a turnkey basis the demand for local r d services is still limited sehnaoui 2017 technological dependence severely constrains the development of the requisite r d capabilities to support and service the various economic sectors zahlan 2014 arab science and technology related human resources are more than adequate and could in principle constitute an integrative social factor but in the absence of rational and appropriate science policies and adequate financial resources the potential of this human resource is dissipated zahlan 2012 the reason for such a low figure is the lack of resources and the absence of demand for services by nationals both the public and private sectors depend nearly exclusively on foreign firms for technical services zahlan 2014 arab countries are near the top of the developing world level of activity but far below the levels of industrial countries thus although the output may be comparable the application of scientific findings is more constrained than in other large developing countries where there are no political or economic barriers to the circulation of ideas and expertise segal 2018 the arab world provides a large market for technology products and services this can be seen from the large number of identical contracts for the same technology that are awarded repeatedly over short periods of time in a number of technological fields such a market provides excellent opportunities for technology transfer because technology is best acquired as part of the repeated undertaking of similar projects zahlan 2012 the absence of adequate financial and insurance services to support national consulting and contracting firms combined with the absence of adequate technology policies are the main reasons for the slow pace at which technology trickles into the region zahlan 1984 contracts with foreign consulting and contracting firms are in agricultural development construction transport systems industry educational technologies aviation communication and so on emery et al 1986 zahlan and zahlan 1991 since the national markets for sophisticated technological services of each arab state are small any serious effort to transfer technology has to involve substantial arab economic cooperation there has been no significant effort to date to implement inter arab cooperation in technology moreover the subject of technology transfer to the arab world has become synonymous with trade emery et al 1986 ilgen and pempel 1987 in this type of analysis arabs are not seen as participant in a process of technological development the main focus of this approach is on the suppliers of technology rather than the consumers in addition emphasis is often placed on the competition among the various industrial powers for the lucrative arab markets the behaviour of the arab trading parties tends to be of minor interest this is mainly due to the fact that much of the planning and decision making is done by foreign institutions the leading arab development institutions as well as the arab governments utilise foreign consulting firms almost exclusively zahlan 2014 in the presence of foreign skills and know how the construction of petrochemical plants refineries and water desalination plants is well within the capabilities of arab organisations arab firms lack neither the technical expertise nor the natural financial or human resources to undertake such projects what is missing is a variety of other inputs such as financial legal and technical support services that arab governments do not make available to their national organisations finally the weakness of arab science and technology systems in conjunction with the absence of effective science policies in the arab world have made the economic integration of technological activity very difficult zahlan and zahlan 1980 the inability to formulate and adopt sensible technology policies has contributed to the continuing disintegration of arab society and culture beblawi and luciani 1987 27 unemployment alienation marginalisation and the intensification of civil unrest and violence are all direct or indirect indicators of the absence of an integrated science policy and of the impact of that absence on the economic life of the arab world bizri 2017 science technology and security sectors in the military sector the referent object of security is mainly the state military action usually threatens the state s physical base territory and population and institutions buzan 1991 116 117 the relevance of science and technology to military security is highlighted by the need of states to produce weapons systems necessary for national defence it is not by accident that due to current conflicts in the region the major focus of many middle eastern states is access to military related technologies states that have the necessary technology to produce their own weapons systems find themselves in a better position than those that have to import weapons this is not only for economic reasons i e impact on trade balance but also because they can be less politically dependent on weapon supply countries when it comes to achieving military self reliance in the middle east technology transfer and the expansion of local production for international export are common objectives of regional countries singer 2009 indeed in their contacts with the major western producers of military equipment some middle eastern states have made it clear that if western providers of military equipment want to work with local arab companies they will have to transfer their technical knowledge to the ones that are part of a rising indigenous defence sector mouchantaf 2018 however some analysts are sceptical of this attitude because regional states lack the capability to absorb military technology not only due to the shortage of nationals in the defence industry but also because of the limited access to science engineering and mathematics graduates mouchantaf 2018 in the political sector the referent object of security can be the government or the citizens threats may arise as a result of peoples dissatisfaction with governmental policies or from the attempts of governments to exercise tight control over their citizens in their effort to maintain power surveillance and other control related technologies in the hands of governments such as control over the mass media and press show the relevance of technology to political security on the other hand the recent arab uprisings demonstrated that communication technologies such as the internet facebook and cell phones can be effectively used to organise and coordinate popular resistance to the government berman 2017 specifically although text messaging was used extensively in the arab spring it had a limited effect and did not lead to direct political change brown 2012 as a tool it helped individuals to communicate and coordinate but this impact was indirect satellite tv also had more subtle and varying effects what made the big difference was the use of cell phones which provided a ubiquitous image and video capture device ellis 2011 anyone possessing a cell phone could document and transmit footage instantly without camera phones the only actors capable of documenting the 2011 uprisings would have been professional journalists whose coverage is usually lacking in dynamic situations such as the arab spring cell phone technology also helped to include citizens who were watching events unfold as they were seeing video and images captured by regular citizens this mobilised individuals who felt like they too could take part in the protests and have a political voice social media and the internet also had a significant impact on the outcome of the arab uprisings as they offered the protestors a space to express and develop political viewpoints unhindered by regimes this is because social networking sites like facebook have structural features that promote participation and mobilisation hanska 2016 29 30 on the other hand the arab spring demonstrated that it is quite dangerous to be friends with regime critics on facebook for example the syrian electronic army sea was established to wage online war against assad opponents as a result sea has attacked domestic sites as well as international targets such as the associated press twitter account ellis 2011 technology however has a long history of being used in revolutionary movements in the middle east for example during the iranian revolution ayatollah khomeini produced and distributed tapes of sermons denouncing the shah helping to grow dissent in the country parallels can also be drawn with the cedar revolution of 2005 in lebanon where protests occurred after the lebanese prime minister was killed citizens demanded an investigation and the withdrawal of syrian troops from the country ellis 2011 a final aspect of the impact of the internet on the middle east conflicts involves the utilisation of social media for jihadist recruitment the phenomenon is particularly relevant in cases of so called self radicalisation where individuals succumb to the lure of extremist propaganda produced in middle east sites pulled into isis circles some cyber recruits carry out violent acts as lone wolves while others travel to the middle east in order to fight for the caliphate in the societal sector the referent object of security is collective identities such as religious or national identities buzan 1991 122 123 as in the political sector surveillance and other control related technologies can serve as instruments of power in the hands of governments that aim at controlling particular religious and ethnic groups this is the reason societal threats can be difficult to disentangle from political ones on the other hand targeted social groups may use communication technologies to raise support for their cause or invite external involvement for protection purposes in the economic sector national security issues can emerge involving linkages between economic capability on the one hand and military capability power and socio political stability on the other buzan 1991 126 due to its connection to economic development science and technology become central to economic considerations chambers 2015 ahmed 2018 moreover a state s military capability rests at least partly on the possession of an industrial base capable of supporting the armed forces the absence or the economic decline of basic industries can therefore raise questions about the ability of the state to support independent military production buzan and sen 1990 for example the desire of several middle eastern states to maintain or acquire production capability in key militarily related industries has inserted a national security requirement into the management of the national economy on the other hand the pursuit of military research and development has prevented some middle eastern states from investing in their civil economy yet when technology cannot support economic development economic threats may also enhance domestic instability the link between economic and political stability generates a set of questions about development which can easily be seen as national security issues for example some middle eastern states that are not efficient producers find themselves locked into a cycle of poverty and underdevelopment from which there is no obvious escape hence the governments of those states find themselves having to choose between investing in new technologies and knowledge creation at the expense of lowering the already very low living standards information and communication technologies ict constitute one of the fastest growing sectors in the middle east nevertheless most of the countries in the middle east have shown no signs of impending information revolutions irs the proliferation and ever more sophisticated employment of icts are critically dependent upon economic factors as well as the nature of the government and its role in ict development except for israel and turkey every other country in the region is deficient in necessary economic factors or government participation burkhart 2003 thus it has been argued that despite having high mobile penetration rates the middle east lags behind other areas in terms of technological advancement and regional states need to improve technology education and the regulatory framework saadi 2017 moreover governments need to address information related security vulnerabilities that threaten the operation of both the private and public sectors and impact national economies in the environmental sector science and technology become extremely relevant due to the need to have an efficient use of natural resources and to protect the environment the overall aridity of the middle east has motivated some of the richer countries to search for technological solutions to their water requirements through sustained investment in research they have become experts in water desalination water recycling and solar energy the region s oil poor countries however cannot afford such advanced technologies and remain dependent on more traditional water resources yet the need to secure access to water has led to the utilisation of construction related technology to create water dams unfortunately while these dams regulate the water flow to cropland generate vital electricity and supply potable water they also introduce environmental problems that have cast a shadow on their overall success since the region s major rivers no longer flood to produce natural fertilisers farmers downstream are forced to use massive amounts of artificial fertilisers which in turn pollute the regional rivers conclusion the technological dependence of arab countries has enhanced their vulnerability to outside interference and reduced their internal national integration national integration depends on economic exchanges within society dependent technology policies reduce such exchanges instead economic exchanges take place with foreign countries without involving the national population the counterpart of weak internal cohesiveness is a high degree of dependence on imports in general the extent of arab dependence on imports for all necessities of life is striking on the positive side middle eastern countries possess enormous human strategic and natural resources which if efficiently managed and put to effective use could induce a rapid economic change but those resources cannot be put to socioeconomic use because of the underdeveloped state of their national and regional institutions in other words socioeconomic development is difficult to achieve in the absence of an adequate level of political development this situation is a direct consequence of the strength and stability of the prevailing rentier political economy beblawi and luciani 1987 therefore middle east governments need to strengthen their political legal and institutional systems adopt a performance oriented political economy and introduce an appropriate science and technology policy today arab countries face three major challenges population pressures global increase of oil and gas sources and declining arab labour productivity mounting population pressures will decrease the resources available for undertaking economic reforms by the year 2050 an expected increase of some 400 million inhabitants will bring the total population to some 700 million half of these will be below the age of 18 this young population could be an important force for positive and creative change if provided with proper education and training the absence of appropriate technology policies however could transform this abundant and youthful population into a disruptive and destabilising force to this one may add the fact that the expanding number of gas and oil sources worldwide have combined to reduce arab income and increase the cost of imports in addition increasing labour productivity in the newly industrialising countries is reducing the attractiveness of arab countries for foreign direct investment most of the subcontracting to the arab states now is for low value added and low technology activities in other words internal and external factors are not favourable to promoting technological development in the middle east however it is imperative the future of any country is contingent on its capacity to produce the goods and services in demand the major tool in achieving this goal is science and technology the middle east has remained outside this competition because arab states have not sought to acquire the requisite political economy however people in the region retain the capacity to alter their future thus a positive response to global technological challenges would require the adoption of a successful program of technology transfer in order to narrow or close the technology gap technology transfer takes place over a substantial period of time and is a cumulative and systemic process transfer however involves changes in a country s political culture the legal system the economy social organisation and management to promote technological advances middle eastern governments should invest in quality education for youth continuous skills training for workers and managers and should ensure that knowledge is shared as widely as possible across society yet particular attention should be given to improving the investment climate which is crucial as are the right incentive structures to guide the allocation of resources and to encourage research and development successful countries have grown their ability to innovate by investing public funding to help finance research and development in critical areas the benefits to flow from technological revolution in an increasingly connected and knowledge intensive world will be seized by those countries that are sensitive and responsive to the rapidly changing environment and nimble enough to take advantage of the opportunities those who succeed will make substantial advances in reducing poverty and inequality those who do not will face enormous internal insecurity and will transform themselves into a threat

this is an excerpt from regional security in the middle east sectors variables and issues get your free copy here science and technology enhance the capabilities of states and societies to obtain and transform resources necessary for their development and advancement on the other hand lack of scientific knowledge and access to technology not only affects a country s level of development but also jeopardises its national security in an anarchic international system security interdependence implies that the security of a state is closely tied to the security of the other states and especially its neighbours since national securities are interdependent the security or insecurity of a state may have a considerable impact not only on the security of its immediate neighbours but also on the security of the whole region in which it is geographically embedded regional security technology as a factor affecting national security is closely related to population growth the greater the population growth and the greater the pace of the technological development of a country the greater the likelihood its activities and interests beyond its borders will expand the greater the demographic growth and the less rapid the technological development of a country the greater the likelihood it will face significant socio economic problems and instability choucri 2002 98 in other words unevenness in the interactive growth and development within and across the societies contributes to unevenness in the size development and capabilities of such societies to differential capabilities among them and to competitions conflicts and violence choucri 1984 as an engine of growth the potential of technology is still largely untapped in the middle east where states not only lack adequate skilled labour and capital but also use these factors less efficiently therefore the purpose of this chapter is to investigate the impact of science and technology on national and regional security in the middle east in doing so the chapter is divided into six sections the first section discusses the relationship between technology and development while the second section explores the relevance of science and technology to security drawing on a historical analysis the third section examines the reasons science and technology have not so far played an effective role in the development of middle eastern states and societies the next section identifies and discusses the instruments and patterns of technological development in the contemporary middle east the last section of the paper offers a sectoral analysis of the relationship between science and technology on the one hand and security national and regional in the middle east on the other the technology development relationship the commonly held view is that technology and development are strongly linked with development driven by technology and technology serving as a key indicator of national development in reality however technological change is often highly problematic with respect to its socio economic and environmental implications as it may exacerbate inequality uneven development ecological degradation and or social exclusion murphy 2017 1 a critical understanding of the drivers dynamics implications and geographically uneven distributions of technology and technological change is thus an important component of development studies and practice murphy 2017 1 generally speaking technology is the branch of knowledge that deals with the creation and use of technical means and their interrelation with life society and the environment drawing upon such subjects as industrial arts engineering sciences and applied sciences in this sense technology is embedded deeply in social cultural economic and political systems due to its spatial diffusion technology has uneven geographies of use significance and impact murphy 2017 1 with respect to development technology is seen as an essential driver and determinant of socioeconomic cultural environmental and political change economically technology can increase national productivity through improvements to the efficiency of production and logistics while encouraging and enhancing innovation and knowledge creation alternatively technology can exacerbate socioeconomic differences and create uneven development within and between countries and regions culturally technology has a profound effect on the norms and identities that help to constitute particular social groups environmentally technology can contribute in significant ways to greener and more sustainable societies or exacerbate ecological degradation through intensified or expanded impacts locally and globally politically technology can have democratising effects e g the facebook revolutions in the middle east or it can facilitate enhanced forms of repression or surveillance by state authorities hanska 2016 32 science and technology are key drivers of development this is because technological and scientific revolutions and innovations underpin economic advances and contribute to improvements in health systems education and infrastructure thus developments in science and technology have profound effects on economic and social development apart from constituting a salient political issue access to and application of technology are critical to a country s development by the same token access to high quality education especially higher education is essential for the creation of scientific knowledge science and technology are the differentiating factors among countries separating those that are able to tackle poverty effectively by growing and developing their economies and those that are not the level of countries economic development depends to a large extent on their ability to grasp and apply insights from science and technology and use them creatively to promote technological advances developing countries need to invest in quality education for youth continuous skills training for workers and managers as well as to ensure that knowledge is shared as widely as possible across society moreover adopting appropriate technologies leads directly to higher productivity which is the key to growth creativity and technological innovation emerge naturally in societies that have large stocks and flows of knowledge in sharp contrast in societies with limited stocks of knowledge creative people feel constrained and migrate to other countries thereby causing brain drain to their own countries and societies such societies are prone to remain in poverty and dependency hence in the presence of many social economic and defence needs and demands access to quality education as well as the adoption and application of appropriate technologies do not only constitute a policy question but also a question of policy priorities moreover both of these questions are tied to a country s political development science technology and security it has been suggested stivachtis 2011 397 422 that development and security are interrelated indeed the end of the cold war allowed the identification of development with human security undp 1993 2 for instance the declaration on the right to development 1986 2 asserts that all human beings have a human right to development and that development has been consequently subdivided into several sectors such as political development economic development and socio cultural development in addition development and the environment are inextricably linked undp 1994 24 40 moreover it has been shown stivachtis 2011 414 that there is a close relationship between development sectors and security sectors in the sense that the absence or presence of development in a particular sector impacts security and vice versa for example political development is related to political security while economic development is related to economic security as a result lack of political development has the potential of enhancing political insecurity yet as in the case of security problems in one development sector may affect other development sectors and as an extension the corresponding security sectors for instance political underdevelopment may affect economic development and therefore a state s economic security this means that security and development can to a great extent be operationalised in the same way mittleman 1988 22 yet it has been argued stivachtis 2011 415 that national security becomes inextricably connected to national development this means that neither development can be achieved without security nor security without development one of the most important questions in the field of security and development studies is whether a particular security or development sector is so significant that policy priority should be given to it the expectation is that if problems threats in this sector are addressed this would have positive effects on the other sectors addressing this question political scientists stress the political prerequisites for economic development political order and stability implying the presence and function of viable institutions and enforceable rules almond and coleman 1960 almond and powell 1966 for example whether political instability in a country may result from the inability of the national government to promote economic development and create sustainable and effective welfare mechanisms or from its inability to manage social and political change in a period of rapid economic growth political development appears to be fundamental as far as the last point is concerned the record contradicts the conventional wisdom that the way to avoid political instability is to stimulate economic development and industrialisation olsen 1963 empirical research shows that whatever the long term benefits of modernisation its short term impact tends to be more instability and sometimes violence skocpol 1994 feierabend et al 1966 thus discussion about development has emphasised political development meaning the need to establish institutions capable of managing socio political tensions and preventing their escalation into violence that may threaten the security of the state and its citizens however since developing states have widely divergent social economic and political attributes this diversity implies the absence of a unique policy formula that could apply without distinction to any developing state development enhances state power and capabilities and enhances national security on the other hand security provides the fertile ground for development while any threats to security ultimately affect development underdevelopment on the other hand increases the vulnerability of the state thereby enhancing its insecurity science and technology are key drivers of development and therefore central not only to a country s socio economic development but also its national security science technology and development in the middle east a historical account over the centuries scientific and technological advances have repeatedly enabled foreign powers to interfere with the functioning of middle eastern economies as well as to undermine the security of the less advanced countries of the region this section will discuss some of the main technology related events that led to this situation which continues today following the rise of islam in the seventh century science and technology flourished in the islamic world to a far greater extent than in the west muslim rulers promoted the translation of greek philosophy and science and then encouraged further scientific exploration in numerous fields including mathematics astronomy medicine pharmacology optics chemistry and physics much of the knowledge developed by the muslims and transmitted to the europeans enabled europe to emerge from the dark ages into the renaissance saliba 2011 until the sixteenth century the arab world was connected by a unique system of trade and transport that unified its large population scattered over vast areas of land and sea the system sustained the economy of each arab state underpinned trade with europe and fed into the various international trading systems bahlan 1999 261 in fact the arabs had developed an effective transnational trading system which reached its peak in the eighth to sixteenth centuries and which was based on local technological inputs such as skilled merchants and caravan managers navigators with extensive geographic knowledge efficiently operated ports and trading emporia scientifically bred camels and seaworthy dhows bahlan 1999 262 trust and mutual dependence among closely knit social groups prevailed the socioeconomic support of the transport and trading system enhanced regional harmony and the stability of local communities the mechanics of the arab trading system were so flexible that traders could move their business readily from place to place in response to changes in supply and demand or in order to avoid ruthless rulers or areas of conflict bahlan 1999 263 since trade brought prosperity and employment local governments sought to attract traders and provide security and support facilities to ease the process of trade and the life of the traveller the arab transport system was responsible for the large scale circulation of people and information this included the diffusion of agricultural products inventions and all types of knowledge thus the trade and transport system had a powerful economic social and cultural impact it also integrated the economies of arab countries with each other and with those of asia the mediterranean and africa according to antoine zahlan 1999 there are three main reasons middle eastern countries lag behind in terms of technology and scientific knowledge their loss of trade and transportation systems the effects of the industrial revolution on arab economies and the political and economic effects of the colonisation and neo colonisation processes the collapse of the arab trade and transport systems the collapse of the arab trade and transportation systems was induced by portuguese technological advances in ship design navigation and naval warfare guilmartin 1974 the strategic breakthrough was the invention of transoceanic ships these ships could carry a large number of guns and could navigate the high seas the arabs failed to acquire or develop the necessary technological capabilities to match portuguese naval vessels the small but powerful portuguese fleet interfered violently with trade between the arab world asia and africa guilmartin 1974 the portuguese used their superior naval force to harass and interfere with shipping attack coastal towns loot ships and pillage coastal towns ottoman technical assistance to the cities of the arabian peninsula ultimately saved the people of the arab coastal towns from outright massacre by the portuguese for the next three centuries the forces of the ottoman empire protected the region from european devastation however the ottomans themselves were unable to cope with european technological challenges and their empire eventually collapsed portugal s naval technology diffused to the european atlantic states by the early seventeenth century the british the dutch and the french had displaced the portuguese from the indian ocean between 1620 and 1670 these three countries introduced a new innovation the east india company which controlled fleets marketing systems finances storage space and armies platt 1977 while arab trade depended on the efforts of a very large number of traders operating in a small scale and each working on their own the east india company was centrally managed possessing the financial resources necessary to exercise monopolistic behaviour and thus control markets consequently the east india company quickly managed to eliminate arab long distance trade platt 1977 by the eighteenth century trade routes throughout the middle east were being reoriented toward coastal towns and european trade and transport whereas the arab international trading system had been heavily land based and internal the new system was heavily dependent on european shipping and trade bahlan 1996 264 this loss was soon followed by the progressive displacement of internal land based long distance travel services by european shipping no serious arab competition arose to challenge the rapid development of european mediterranean shipping firms headrick 1981 when in 1832 the french occupied algeria and later tunisia and morocco they sought to close all trans saharan routes which were being used by resistance movements and by clandestine trade bahlan 1999 265 thus by the early twentieth century the complex and rich system of internal trans saharan transport had been dismantled two further technological developments accelerated the dismantling of regional and local trade and transport systems the construction and operation of railway systems by foreign firms and the construction of the suez canal headrick 1981 by the latter part of the nineteenth century the national systems of trade and transport had disintegrated to the level where they were replaced by totally imported systems with very little local participation zahlan and zahlan 1978 the displacement of camel based transport technology with railway and steamship technologies without the transfer of mechanical and new naval technologies meant that the arabs lost the employment generated by operating their system of transport headrick 1981 even today arab countries remain unable to acquire the employment derived from operating and maintaining their extensive transport systems the strength of the arab and muslim worlds was based on a common market and not on political unity although many arab countries were in conflict this did not eliminate trade and cultural exchanges between them but as the arabs were unable to acquire adopt or develop alternative technologies to contain technological challenges which eventually led to the collapse of the transnational arab trading system the forces that bound the arab communities to each other were loosened and the cohesiveness of the arab world began to weaken industrial revolution the second phase of technology dismantling was induced by the industrial revolution which undermined the traditional textile industries that were firmly based in arab countries steam power machine production chemical sciences and technology electrification petroleum production and refining communication technologies radio electric power and engineering and countless advances in medical science construction technologies city planning and management systems all had dramatic consequences for the arab world every technological advance in europe contributed to the continuing decline of inter arab cohesiveness zahlan and zahaln 1997 the acquisition of western military technologies beginning with the ottomans and muhammad ali led to the progressive divorce of military institutions from their local environment and to their progressive integration into the military industrial intelligence complexes of western powers new technology was imported in a dependent mode and packaged with its consultants contractors operators and financiers and without any effort being made to develop new technologies at home zahlan and zahlan 1991 the cost of this dependency was enormous as were the resulting economic and political consequences of the egyptian and ottoman debts the occupation of egypt in 1882 and the collapse of the economy of the ottoman empire colonisation and independence the third phase of technology dismantling began with the direct occupation of arab countries when practically every single important decision was made by the emissaries of the colonial powers colonialism affected all aspects of life in the middle east the net result was the further divorce of the elites the culture and the economy of the region from technical matters zahlan 1999 267 the fourth phase was induced by political independence when independence was achieved the rulers and elites of the new states had little knowledge of contemporary developments in science and technology which had become so central to the industrialised world in the late twentieth century not only did all equipment industrial supplies and maintenance services have to be imported but also arab countries depended completely on foreign consulting and contracting services helie 1973 the new leaders sought to develop their countries through the rapid expansion of educational systems and investment in new industries cultural distortions and alienation were intensified by the accelerated programs adopted at this time beblawi and luciani 1987 because they wished to accelerate the process of development the new national elites unknowingly adopted methods that ultimately led to even greater technological dependence as a result foreign consulting firms conceived and designed enormous projects foreign accounting and law firms monitored them and an army of foreign contractors and foreign labour implemented them zahlan and zahlan 1978 although major things were built such as power and desalination plants hospitals irrigation schemes enormous dams transport systems and airports locals contributed little to the process beblawi and luciani 1987 however those who mediated these contracts earned enormous commissions and well placed people accumulated personal fortunes in the billions of dollars zahlan and zahlan 1984 meanwhile the gap between the arab world and industrial countries has continued to grow and arab economies still suffer from chronic stagnation and low productivity components and instruments of technology systems the major instruments of national technological development are university education systems research and development r d national consulting and contracting firms relevant economic and financial institutions to support technological development and science policy zahlan 1996 269 there has been a significant and dramatic expansion of the proportion of people in the middle east who have completed four or more years of higher education the number of universities has also increased including a significant number of foreign universities kjerfve 2014 yet the quality of higher education in the middle east is among the lowest in the world only two or three arab universities are in the list of the top 500 universities in the world and none is in the top 200 employers in the region complain that university graduates lack the skills needed to work in the global marketplace many are not well trained in science mathematics engineering and other technical subjects where the jobs are furthermore these graduates lack the soft skills including creativity and teamwork partly because their training has emphasised memorisation and rote learning devarajan 2016 much of the emphasis of arab foreign education has been in science and engineering qasem 1998 doctoral level knowledge producing education however is still highly underdeveloped in the region and therefore specialisation is pursued abroad dini et al 2015 arab universities have been the leading centres for both basic and applied research in science and technology the number of professors in arab universities has increased with the majority of them associated with science and technology zahlan 2012 the number of research and development centres also increased with half of them engaging in research in agriculture nutrition water and irrigation marine sciences and the biological science the rest focus on oil and petrochemicals ecology basic sciences and computer science lightfoot 2018 research activity in arab countries is thus highly focused on applied subjects with a priority in medicine and agriculture despite the valiant efforts of a number of scientists basic research is on such a small scale that it is virtually non existent zahlan 2012 r d organisations play a major role in successful planning design and operation of economic installations however because the consulting and contracting services utilised in establishing industrial plants are generally imported on a turnkey basis the demand for local r d services is still limited sehnaoui 2017 technological dependence severely constrains the development of the requisite r d capabilities to support and service the various economic sectors zahlan 2014 arab science and technology related human resources are more than adequate and could in principle constitute an integrative social factor but in the absence of rational and appropriate science policies and adequate financial resources the potential of this human resource is dissipated zahlan 2012 the reason for such a low figure is the lack of resources and the absence of demand for services by nationals both the public and private sectors depend nearly exclusively on foreign firms for technical services zahlan 2014 arab countries are near the top of the developing world level of activity but far below the levels of industrial countries thus although the output may be comparable the application of scientific findings is more constrained than in other large developing countries where there are no political or economic barriers to the circulation of ideas and expertise segal 2018 the arab world provides a large market for technology products and services this can be seen from the large number of identical contracts for the same technology that are awarded repeatedly over short periods of time in a number of technological fields such a market provides excellent opportunities for technology transfer because technology is best acquired as part of the repeated undertaking of similar projects zahlan 2012 the absence of adequate financial and insurance services to support national consulting and contracting firms combined with the absence of adequate technology policies are the main reasons for the slow pace at which technology trickles into the region zahlan 1984 contracts with foreign consulting and contracting firms are in agricultural development construction transport systems industry educational technologies aviation communication and so on emery et al 1986 zahlan and zahlan 1991 since the national markets for sophisticated technological services of each arab state are small any serious effort to transfer technology has to involve substantial arab economic cooperation there has been no significant effort to date to implement inter arab cooperation in technology moreover the subject of technology transfer to the arab world has become synonymous with trade emery et al 1986 ilgen and pempel 1987 in this type of analysis arabs are not seen as participant in a process of technological development the main focus of this approach is on the suppliers of technology rather than the consumers in addition emphasis is often placed on the competition among the various industrial powers for the lucrative arab markets the behaviour of the arab trading parties tends to be of minor interest this is mainly due to the fact that much of the planning and decision making is done by foreign institutions the leading arab development institutions as well as the arab governments utilise foreign consulting firms almost exclusively zahlan 2014 in the presence of foreign skills and know how the construction of petrochemical plants refineries and water desalination plants is well within the capabilities of arab organisations arab firms lack neither the technical expertise nor the natural financial or human resources to undertake such projects what is missing is a variety of other inputs such as financial legal and technical support services that arab governments do not make available to their national organisations finally the weakness of arab science and technology systems in conjunction with the absence of effective science policies in the arab world have made the economic integration of technological activity very difficult zahlan and zahlan 1980 the inability to formulate and adopt sensible technology policies has contributed to the continuing disintegration of arab society and culture beblawi and luciani 1987 27 unemployment alienation marginalisation and the intensification of civil unrest and violence are all direct or indirect indicators of the absence of an integrated science policy and of the impact of that absence on the economic life of the arab world bizri 2017 science technology and security sectors in the military sector the referent object of security is mainly the state military action usually threatens the state s physical base territory and population and institutions buzan 1991 116 117 the relevance of science and technology to military security is highlighted by the need of states to produce weapons systems necessary for national defence it is not by accident that due to current conflicts in the region the major focus of many middle eastern states is access to military related technologies states that have the necessary technology to produce their own weapons systems find themselves in a better position than those that have to import weapons this is not only for economic reasons i e impact on trade balance but also because they can be less politically dependent on weapon supply countries when it comes to achieving military self reliance in the middle east technology transfer and the expansion of local production for international export are common objectives of regional countries singer 2009 indeed in their contacts with the major western producers of military equipment some middle eastern states have made it clear that if western providers of military equipment want to work with local arab companies they will have to transfer their technical knowledge to the ones that are part of a rising indigenous defence sector mouchantaf 2018 however some analysts are sceptical of this attitude because regional states lack the capability to absorb military technology not only due to the shortage of nationals in the defence industry but also because of the limited access to science engineering and mathematics graduates mouchantaf 2018 in the political sector the referent object of security can be the government or the citizens threats may arise as a result of peoples dissatisfaction with governmental policies or from the attempts of governments to exercise tight control over their citizens in their effort to maintain power surveillance and other control related technologies in the hands of governments such as control over the mass media and press show the relevance of technology to political security on the other hand the recent arab uprisings demonstrated that communication technologies such as the internet facebook and cell phones can be effectively used to organise and coordinate popular resistance to the government berman 2017 specifically although text messaging was used extensively in the arab spring it had a limited effect and did not lead to direct political change brown 2012 as a tool it helped individuals to communicate and coordinate but this impact was indirect satellite tv also had more subtle and varying effects what made the big difference was the use of cell phones which provided a ubiquitous image and video capture device ellis 2011 anyone possessing a cell phone could document and transmit footage instantly without camera phones the only actors capable of documenting the 2011 uprisings would have been professional journalists whose coverage is usually lacking in dynamic situations such as the arab spring cell phone technology also helped to include citizens who were watching events unfold as they were seeing video and images captured by regular citizens this mobilised individuals who felt like they too could take part in the protests and have a political voice social media and the internet also had a significant impact on the outcome of the arab uprisings as they offered the protestors a space to express and develop political viewpoints unhindered by regimes this is because social networking sites like facebook have structural features that promote participation and mobilisation hanska 2016 29 30 on the other hand the arab spring demonstrated that it is quite dangerous to be friends with regime critics on facebook for example the syrian electronic army sea was established to wage online war against assad opponents as a result sea has attacked domestic sites as well as international targets such as the associated press twitter account ellis 2011 technology however has a long history of being used in revolutionary movements in the middle east for example during the iranian revolution ayatollah khomeini produced and distributed tapes of sermons denouncing the shah helping to grow dissent in the country parallels can also be drawn with the cedar revolution of 2005 in lebanon where protests occurred after the lebanese prime minister was killed citizens demanded an investigation and the withdrawal of syrian troops from the country ellis 2011 a final aspect of the impact of the internet on the middle east conflicts involves the utilisation of social media for jihadist recruitment the phenomenon is particularly relevant in cases of so called self radicalisation where individuals succumb to the lure of extremist propaganda produced in middle east sites pulled into isis circles some cyber recruits carry out violent acts as lone wolves while others travel to the middle east in order to fight for the caliphate in the societal sector the referent object of security is collective identities such as religious or national identities buzan 1991 122 123 as in the political sector surveillance and other control related technologies can serve as instruments of power in the hands of governments that aim at controlling particular religious and ethnic groups this is the reason societal threats can be difficult to disentangle from political ones on the other hand targeted social groups may use communication technologies to raise support for their cause or invite external involvement for protection purposes in the economic sector national security issues can emerge involving linkages between economic capability on the one hand and military capability power and socio political stability on the other buzan 1991 126 due to its connection to economic development science and technology become central to economic considerations chambers 2015 ahmed 2018 moreover a state s military capability rests at least partly on the possession of an industrial base capable of supporting the armed forces the absence or the economic decline of basic industries can therefore raise questions about the ability of the state to support independent military production buzan and sen 1990 for example the desire of several middle eastern states to maintain or acquire production capability in key militarily related industries has inserted a national security requirement into the management of the national economy on the other hand the pursuit of military research and development has prevented some middle eastern states from investing in their civil economy yet when technology cannot support economic development economic threats may also enhance domestic instability the link between economic and political stability generates a set of questions about development which can easily be seen as national security issues for example some middle eastern states that are not efficient producers find themselves locked into a cycle of poverty and underdevelopment from which there is no obvious escape hence the governments of those states find themselves having to choose between investing in new technologies and knowledge creation at the expense of lowering the already very low living standards information and communication technologies ict constitute one of the fastest growing sectors in the middle east nevertheless most of the countries in the middle east have shown no signs of impending information revolutions irs the proliferation and ever more sophisticated employment of icts are critically dependent upon economic factors as well as the nature of the government and its role in ict development except for israel and turkey every other country in the region is deficient in necessary economic factors or government participation burkhart 2003 thus it has been argued that despite having high mobile penetration rates the middle east lags behind other areas in terms of technological advancement and regional states need to improve technology education and the regulatory framework saadi 2017 moreover governments need to address information related security vulnerabilities that threaten the operation of both the private and public sectors and impact national economies in the environmental sector science and technology become extremely relevant due to the need to have an efficient use of natural resources and to protect the environment the overall aridity of the middle east has motivated some of the richer countries to search for technological solutions to their water requirements through sustained investment in research they have become experts in water desalination water recycling and solar energy the region s oil poor countries however cannot afford such advanced technologies and remain dependent on more traditional water resources yet the need to secure access to water has led to the utilisation of construction related technology to create water dams unfortunately while these dams regulate the water flow to cropland generate vital electricity and supply potable water they also introduce environmental problems that have cast a shadow on their overall success since the region s major rivers no longer flood to produce natural fertilisers farmers downstream are forced to use massive amounts of artificial fertilisers which in turn pollute the regional rivers conclusion the technological dependence of arab countries has enhanced their vulnerability to outside interference and reduced their internal national integration national integration depends on economic exchanges within society dependent technology policies reduce such exchanges instead economic exchanges take place with foreign countries without involving the national population the counterpart of weak internal cohesiveness is a high degree of dependence on imports in general the extent of arab dependence on imports for all necessities of life is striking on the positive side middle eastern countries possess enormous human strategic and natural resources which if efficiently managed and put to effective use could induce a rapid economic change but those resources cannot be put to socioeconomic use because of the underdeveloped state of their national and regional institutions in other words socioeconomic development is difficult to achieve in the absence of an adequate level of political development this situation is a direct consequence of the strength and stability of the prevailing rentier political economy beblawi and luciani 1987 therefore middle east governments need to strengthen their political legal and institutional systems adopt a performance oriented political economy and introduce an appropriate science and technology policy today arab countries face three major challenges population pressures global increase of oil and gas sources and declining arab labour productivity mounting population pressures will decrease the resources available for undertaking economic reforms by the year 2050 an expected increase of some 400 million inhabitants will bring the total population to some 700 million half of these will be below the age of 18 this young population could be an important force for positive and creative change if provided with proper education and training the absence of appropriate technology policies however could transform this abundant and youthful population into a disruptive and destabilising force to this one may add the fact that the expanding number of gas and oil sources worldwide have combined to reduce arab income and increase the cost of imports in addition increasing labour productivity in the newly industrialising countries is reducing the attractiveness of arab countries for foreign direct investment most of the subcontracting to the arab states now is for low value added and low technology activities in other words internal and external factors are not favourable to promoting technological development in the middle east however it is imperative the future of any country is contingent on its capacity to produce the goods and services in demand the major tool in achieving this goal is science and technology the middle east has remained outside this competition because arab states have not sought to acquire the requisite political economy however people in the region retain the capacity to alter their future thus a positive response to global technological challenges would require the adoption of a successful program of technology transfer in order to narrow or close the technology gap technology transfer takes place over a substantial period of time and is a cumulative and systemic process transfer however involves changes in a country s political culture the legal system the economy social organisation and management to promote technological advances middle eastern governments should invest in quality education for youth continuous skills training for workers and managers and should ensure that knowledge is shared as widely as possible across society yet particular attention should be given to improving the investment climate which is crucial as are the right incentive structures to guide the allocation of resources and to encourage research and development successful countries have grown their ability to innovate by investing public funding to help finance research and development in critical areas the benefits to flow from technological revolution in an increasingly connected and knowledge intensive world will be seized by those countries that are sensitive and responsive to the rapidly changing environment and nimble enough to take advantage of the opportunities those who succeed will make substantial advances in reducing poverty and inequality those who do not will face enormous internal insecurity and will transform themselves into a threat

experts say trade tensions affect international supply chains and could potentially wipe out entire industries in certain countries as the globalisation of trade over the past 30 years has made some countries excessively reliant on exports and imports disruptions in well established trade links could prompt some nations to try to substitute imports with domestic products and sell their otherwise export oriented products domestically but existing imbalances in output volumes could make such attempts quite painful for years to come as a result employment and wages in the export oriented industries might suffer while the rising cost of imports could drive inflation across many economies impairing the standards of living of hundreds of millions of people to put it bluntly this cannot be the new normal oecd chief economist laurence boone said we cannot accept an economy that doesn t raise people s living standards oecd economists believe that global gdp will expand by 3 2 percent this year its slowest in three years and below the 5 percent average expansion at the beginning of the 2000s experts also called on the us and china to remove their recently imposed tariffs which would they believe allow the world economy to pick up momentum next year however the trump administration has made it clear it wouldn t tolerate china s alleged practices of dumping cheaper products in the american market as well as the alleged abuse of intellectual property rights and other perceived transgressions global trade growth has already fallen markedly from 5 5 percent in 2017 to projected rates of 2 1 percent in 2019 and 3 1 percent in 2020 gurria said it should be growing at double the rate of gdp growth for its part china has struggled to reform its economy for the past few years to make it less reliant on foreign trade such efforts at growth rebalancing have produced limited results so far

the twelve months ended 31 december 2018 full year results 2018 were rescheduled to 24 may 2019 due to the need to complete the comprehensive capital structure review of the group as was announced by the company on 15 april 2019 nyrstar initiated a review of its capital structure the capital structure review in october 2018 in response to the challenging financial and operating conditions being faced by the group as previously announced these conditions included substantial working capital and liquidity outflows experienced during the fourth quarter of 2018 and first quarter of 2019 necessitating the raising of urgent short term funding combined with the group s materially reduced underlying ebitda performance in 2018 and the maturity of certain liabilities during 2019 these factors resulted in the need to reconsider the group s capital structure the capital structure review identified a very substantial additional funding requirement that the group is unable to meet without a material reduction of the group s indebtedness as a consequence the capital structure review has necessitated negotiations between the group s financial creditors in order to develop a deleveraging and funding plan as part of a comprehensive balance sheet recapitalisation alternatives to such a recapitalisation would place the future of the group and its stakeholders at severe risk as at the date of this announcement the company is in the process of implementing the recapitalision the company has received from its auditor and is publishing today an opinion issued in accordance with article 143 2 of the belgian company code non compliance opinion on the basis that certain information requested from the company was not timely delivered the company is working hard to deliver such information to its auditor with the intention that the auditor will issue its audit opinion once it has audited such information the full year results that are published today will then again be published to the market together with the audit opinion that the auditor will then issue group financial overview group gross profit for 2018 of eur 1 118 million was up 4 on 2017 driven by higher zinc production volumes in mining and metals processing and marginally higher zinc and gold prices which were both up 1 partially offset by deteriorating benchmark zinc treatment charge terms and a weaker us dollar against the euro direct operating costs for 2018 of eur 1 014 million increased 16 on 2017 due to higher zinc production volumes in mining and metals processing higher electricity prices at the smelters increased mining costs as a result of the restart of operations at myra falls and the ramp up of mining operations at middle tennessee group underlying ebitda of eur 99 million in 2018 a decrease of 52 on 2017 due to a weakening of the us dollar against the euro lower lead and silver prices a 15 reduction in the benchmark zinc treatment charge higher direct operating costs per tonne of zinc in both mining and metals processing underlying adjustments in 2018 were a total of eur 49 million comprising eur 2 million of embedded derivatives eur 22 million of restructuring expense eur 1 million of m a related transaction expense and eur 30 million of other expenditure relating primarily to the write off of payments that were connected with the divestment of the el toqui mine in chile depreciation depletion and amortisation expense for 2018 of eur 162 million was up 4 year on year in 2018 the company recognised a non cash pre tax impairment loss of eur 99 million 2017 impairment gain of eur 126 million this impairment loss 2017 impairment gain relates fully to pre tax impairment losses on nyrstar s mining assets eur 85 9 million at langlois and myra falls and specific asset write offs in metals processing eur 11 4 million net finance expense including foreign exchange for 2018 of eur 151 million eur 207 million in 2017 primarily due to a net foreign exchange gain of eur 6 5 million in 2018 compared to a loss of eur 59 9 million in 2017 the interest expense in 2018 of eur 128 3 million was higher than in 2017 eur 104 4 million nyrstar recognised an income tax expense for the year ended 31 december 2018 of eur 250 million 2017 income tax benefit of eur 37 million representing an effective income tax rate of 68 9 for the year ended 31 december 2017 481 3 the tax rate is impacted by non recognition of current year losses and by the de recognition of previous losses relating mainly to nyrstar sales marketing ag the us group and the canadian group given it is not probable that these tax losses will be used in the future considering forecast profit projections loss after tax of eur 618 million in 2018 compared to a net profit of eur 47 million in 2017 mainly as a result of the impairment charges related to the write down of the carrying value of the langlois and myra falls mines the partial de recognition of nyrstar sales marketing ag and nyrstar us deferred tax assets due to reduced expected recoverability and the operational losses incurred in 2018 and change of control impacts capital expenditure was eur 229 million in 2018 representing a decrease of 37 year on year driven by a substantial reduction in metals processing from eur 303 million in 2017 to eur 126 million in 2018 with the completion of the port pirie redevelopment and a eur 45 million increase in mining with the restart of the myra falls mine net debt at the end of 2018 at eur 1 643 million excluding the zinc metal prepay was 49 higher compared to the end of 2017 eur 1 102 million at the end of 2017 predominantly due to substantial working capital outflow during q4 2018 due to higher commodity prices no new silver prepays in h2 2018 reduction in non committed letter of credit lines from banking counterparties tightened credit terms with a number of suppliers the reclassification of eur 82 5 million and eur 50 7 million of prepayments for deliveries of silver metal and zinc metal respectively from deferred income to loans and borrowing at 31 december 2018 as the group had no ability to settle by physical delivery of silver metal and zinc metal respectively from its own production and the reclassification of perpetual securities eur 174 9 million at 31 december 2018 from equity to loans and borrowings 6 the net debt inclusive of the zinc metal prepay and perpetual securities at the end of 2018 was eur 1 771 million up 30 compared to the end of 2017 cash balance at the end of 2018 was eur 239 million compared to eur 68 million at the end of 2017 safety health and environment prevent harm is a core value of nyrstar the company is committed to maintaining safe operations and to proactively managing risks including with respect to people and the environment at nyrstar we work together to create a workplace where all risks are effectively identified and controlled and everyone goes home safe and healthy each day of their working life in 2018 we placed particular emphasis on the prevention of hand injuries which account for a large portion of our total injuries a dedicated hand injury prevention program entitled because some tools cannot be replaced was introduced at all operations with the purpose of eliminating unsafe conditions contributing to hand injuries improving tools and personal protective equipment and changing at risk behaviours relevant to hand injuries we also continued the implementation of the process safety management system launched in 2017 and strengthened controls related to hydrogen explosion risks at our smelters the group continued to make significant progress in safety performance no severe irreversible injuries occurred the frequency rate of cases with time lost or under

higher energy prices in europe and australia during h2 2018 and the suspension of operations at port pirie in december 2018 partially offset by higher production of zinc copper silver and minor metals marginally stronger year over year gross profit up 1 at eur 863 million in 2018 was mainly driven by higher zinc prices up 1 compared to 2017 which were constrained by the zinc price collar hedging in place at that time and higher production volumes of zinc metal and by products largely offset by a 19 decrease in zinc and lead treatment charge income annual 2018 zinc benchmark treatment charge

tonnes of zinc metal in 2018 representing a 4 increase on 2017 the increase in zinc metal production year over year was despite the planned maintenance shuts at auby balen clarksville and hobart and was assisted by a lack of material unplanned outages which had impacted production volumes in 2016 and 2017 however zinc and lead metal production was impacted during q4 2018 by lower raw material inventory as a consequence of the company s liquidity constraints lead metal production at port pirie of 160kt was down 7 year over year due to a 38 day planned blast furnace maintenance outage in q2 2018 and a shut of the blast furnace for december 2018 during december 2018 the company chose not to operate the old sinter plant at port pirie in order to further support reducing lead in air emissions which ended the year below the defined limit in addition nyrstar also performed maintenance on the tsl furnace and blast furnace during december 2018 these maintenance shuts were to address

lower level of zinc in concentrate production has been largely due to disappointing production performance of the langlois and the middle tennessee mines and commercial production at the myra falls mine commencing slightly later than had been originally anticipated at the start of the year and the impact of the suspension of ore extraction at year end to address deficiencies identified in compliance orders from the ministry for energy mines petroleum resources in british columbia other developments port pirie redevelopment on 1 february 2019 nyrstar published an operational and financial update which included amongst other items a financial update with regards to the port pirie redevelopment the company provides the following additional clarification with regards to the latest port pirie redevelopment guidance the historic and normalised forecast pro forma underlying ebitda for port pirie hobart and australian metals processing is summarised in the table below pro forma underlying ebitda eurm 2016a 2017a 2018a 2019f 2020f port pirie 8 18 11 38 56 hobart 51 40 31 57 69 australian metals processing 59 58 20 95 125 the total pro forma underlying ebitda guidance of eur 95 million and eur 125 million for australian metals processing in fy 2019 and fy 2020 respectively is the aggregate of the total pro forma underlying ebitda contribution from both the port pirie and the hobart smelters under normalised liquidity and operating conditions this guidance is not incremental or uplift as was the case for the port pirie redevelopment guidance provided before 1 february 2019 and will be materially negatively impacted by the liquidity constraints that have been experienced by the group in q4 2018 and h1 2019 the normalised underlying ebitda guidance is the total pro forma ebitda contribution from the two australian smelters the main factors driving the negative pro forma underlying ebitda result for port pirie in 2018 were a combination of increased costs due to the continued ramp up of the tsl furnace with the parallel operation of the sinter plant and higher energy prices production outage in december 2018 and technical process bottlenecks which reduced the recovery of metal from the feed other macro factors such as lower lead treatment charges and metal prices also negatively impacted the pro forma underlying ebitda at port pirie the allocation of additional costs to residues between 2016 and 2018 has had an impact on the guided pro forma underlying ebitda contribution from the port pirie redevelopment in fy 2019 and to a lesser extent in fy 2020 as was disclosed in nyrstar s press release on 1 february 2019 the processing of historical inventory will provide a cash flow benefit of approximately eur 70 million in fy 2019 if there had not been costs allocated to these residues in 2016 to 2018 the underlying ebitda contribution from port pirie in fy 2019 would be approximately eur 70 million higher the other main reasons for the current lower but still material pro forma underlying ebitda contribution guidance from the port pirie redevelopment as compared to previous guidance are lower metal recovery assumptions as a result of technical process bottlenecks at port pirie which results in a reduction in free metal extracted from all feed processed by port pirie these bottlenecks primarily the slag fumer and copper plant at port pirie were identified in the preparation of the 5 year business plan for the capital structure review process and were incorporated in the pro forma underlying ebitda modelling for australian metals processing and the application of one year of actual operating data instead of the projected data which nyrstar previously needed to rely on as was indicated in the operational and financial update published on 1 february 2019 the metals processing segment profitability of both the australian sites are intrinsically linked by the raw material flows between the two sites and are only possible due to the port pirie redevelopment in the absence of the port pirie redevelopment the hobart and port pirie sites would both be non operational and would not contribute ebitda to the metals processing segment furthermore the pro forma underlying ebitda of the two sites individually but not of australian metal processing overall depends on the internal re charge arrangements between the two sites for internal residues that are used as feedstock at the sites for this reason to provide more clarity the company has decided to show the proforma underlying ebitda for australian metal processing with a breakdown of this figure to port pirie and hobart the total project cost for the port pirie redevelopment was approximately aud 714 million this is inclusive of the feasibility study costs and project management labour costs management changes in connection with the capital structure review process nyrstar announced on 18 january 2019 that mr martyn konig had taken up the role of executive chairman and that mr roman matej had been appointed to serve as interim chief financial officer mr michel abaza the former chief financial officer left the nyrstar group with immediate effect strategic foreign exchange hedges since 2016 nyrstar has entered into a series of 12 month rolling foreign exchange options to hedge the company s monthly exposure related to the direct operating costs denominated in australian dollars aud canadian dollars cad and in euro eur utilising put and call collar structures during the course of 2018 eur usd exposure was unhedged in h1 2018 and hedged on a fixed forward basis at 1 18 in h2 2018 for the aud usd transactional exposure various collars were executed resulting in a weighted average collar of 0 70 to 0 80 for approximately 100 of 2018 for the cad usd transactional exposure on langlois various collars were executed resulting in a weighted average collar of 1 32 to 1 36 for approximately 100 of 2018 transactional cad usd currency exposure for the mining segment was hedged with a fixed forward of 1 32 in 2019 in january and february 2019 nyrstar unwound all of its strategic forward foreign exchange hedges due to the loss of credit lines from the hedge counterparties strategic metal price hedges in h1 2018 nyrstar had in place zinc price collar hedges to protect 70 of total free metal produced at the zinc smelters and north american mines within a price range of usd 2 300 t and usd 3 094 t above and below these prices nyrstar s exposure was limited to 30 of the total free metal produced in h2 2018 nyrstar had in place zinc price collar hedges to protect 50 of total free metal produced at the zinc smelters and north american mines within a price range of usd 2 600 t and usd 3 842 t above and below these prices nyrstar s exposure was limited to 50 of the total free metal produced during 2018 nyrstar continued with its 12 month rolling hedging programme and had hedged the majority of its zinc free metal exposure 150kt for the mining segment at c usd 3 000 t zinc in concentrate production in 2020 was also partly hedged with approximately 16kt hedged at a zinc price of c usd 2 900 t in december 2018 nyrstar terminated all of its strategic metal hedges to provide additional liquidity to the business metal at risk hedging at any given time nyrstar holds metal either as work in progress or finished good inventory that has been priced in but not priced out as this metal remains exposed to fluctuations in the underlying metal price until it is priced out it is called metal at risk the actual metal at risk at any given point in time fluctuates with deliveries of raw materials and production levels as a risk mitigation process nyrstar has always consistently monitored its metal at risk on an ongoing basis and undertaken hedging to mitigate the metal price exposure in what nyrstar refers to as transactional hedging the price of placing these transactional hedges is dependent on whether future or forward prices are higher or lower than current or spot prices as indicated by the shape of the forward underlying metal price curve future prices can be either higher or lower than current prices depending on a range of factors and can change quite rapidly at times the hedges required to hedge nyrstar s metal at risk position are determined by whether

visitors look at a model of beidou china s global navigation system at the 20th china beijing international high tech expo china has to upgrade its productivity and its technology this is the only way it can escape the middle income trap over the next 10 years trade issues pale in importance compared to the need to maintain good economic political and people to people relations between china and the united states most of the economic concerns are short term and relatively small but the china us relationship will shape the state of the world for decades i m an american living in china and married to a chinese woman so i have a strong interest in and love for both countries the deterioration in economic relations over the last 10 years or so frightens me let s look at what is important and what s not according to a recent study by the san francisco federal reserve bank imports from china constitute only 1 76 percent of us consumer spending on the other side china s trade with the us amounts to less than 5 percent or 4 5 trillion yuan around 660 billion of its gdp around 90 trillion yuan in 2018 these numbers are not tiny but they are also not large enough to affect the lives of most people much however limited groups of workers and companies are directly affected a principal goal of both governments is to protect low skilled industrial workers the us administration is trying to restore the kinds of factory jobs that once gave working class people a shot at middle income lifestyle and china is aiming to protect the jobs of factory workers in its export industries but any protection of those low skilled jobs will have to be short term and transitional in both countries us wages have long been too high to allow industries based primarily on low wages to locate there only the artificial separation of work forces in india china and the former soviet union from western markets allowed those jobs to exist from the 1940s to the 1970s in china incomes and wages have risen sharply so a business based on low wage labor will no longer work here either the only long term solution for both countries is to upgrade to higher value added manufacturing and service jobs the two countries should be focused on how to manage this transition since world war ii the us has had a history of allowing developing nations easy access to its markets but then restricted this access when a country became more advanced from 1945 until about 1970 west european countries especially germany had easy access to us markets and the us did not require access to the european market european currencies were strongly undervalued from the us point of view this was okay when european producers were small and technologically inferior but by 1970 the europeans had caught up so the nixon administration responded by removing the tie between the dollar and gold effectively devaluing the dollar similarly the japanese enjoyed easy unreciprocated access to us market from the 1950s through the 1970s the japanese yen was strongly undervalued at about 300 yen to the dollar compared to about 100 today but by the 1980s japanese companies had become highly competitive with us companies so the us insisted on a rapid upward revaluation of the yen and imposed quotas on the imports of japanese cars into the us in some ways the current us position in the trade negotiations is similar to those it had earlier with its western allies over the last 20 years the chinese and american economies have become strongly intertwined according to the gravity model of trade countries trade primarily with their near neighbors for example canada and mexico are traditionally major trading partners with the us it is unusual for two such distant nations as the us and china to be each other s leading trading partners part of the transition over the coming decade will be a partial separation of the two economies and a diversification of supply chains america will re emphasize trade within north america and china will increase trade with the belt and road economies americans need to realize that china has to upgrade its productivity and its technology this is the only way it can escape the middle income trap over the next 10 years this upgrading is driven primarily by chinese firms competing in china s highly competitive markets senior leaders of tech companies tell me that the chinese tech market is much more competitive than silicon valley is many americans stress the roles of state owned enterprises and government r d or investment subsidies but these factors are small compared to the role of china s competitive entrepreneurial firms american strategic thinkers often write about four instruments of national power diplomatic military informational and economic some uses of economic influence are positive for instance the us marshall plan after world war ii or china s belt and road initiative today link people and economies together for mutual benefit of course other uses of the economic instruments of power are negative such as sanctions and tariffs sometimes sanctions serve a good purpose for example the reagan administration s sanctions against south africa in the 1980s helped bring about the end of apartheid but those are rare cases more often the negative use of economic power will cause long lasting animosities but will not have the desired long term goal europe and china will be highly motivated to develop financial systems and technological capabilities that are not subject to us control there are definitely some influential people in the current and past us administrations who write a lot about stopping the rise of china as a peer competitor in my view this is just silly the world is not the same as it was in 1990 the chinese economy already exceeds the size of the us economy on a purchasing power parity local price adjusted basis and will soon exceed it in terms of measured gdp the two countries will always be partly rivals in business and international politics but they don t have to be hostile rivals hundreds of thousands of influential chinese know the us firsthand they have seen both its good sides and its bad sides but few americans have any real idea of life in china my perception from living in beijing and visiting many other cities in china is that there s not much difference in the daily life in the two countries with some advantages in china and others in the us western media coverage almost invariably focuses on negative aspects of life in china a 2013 study by the reuters institute at oxford university analyzed stories in new york times bbc and economist magazine the study concluded that coverage of china is narrowly focused looks mostly at negative issues such as corruption or pollution and gives only minimal coverage to important issues such as social change culture or science and technology this just adds to the possibility that animosities could build up between peoples on tuesday president trump described the trade dispute as a little squabble in the midst of a good relationship in terms of long term economics he is right but winston churchill said history is just one damn thing after another the only really important goal is to be sure that the relationship between china and the us does not become one of those things from a hard headed realist point of view the disputes between the us and china look small and short term compared to the real interests we share in common

london may 24 it was a stark warning about the risks ahead for the global economy even by the forthright standards of the boss of the organisation for economic co operation and development the world economy is in a dangerous place angel gurria said as the oecd announced its latest lower forecasts for growth on may 21 the source of his worry the mounting trade tensions between the united states and china which could hit the rest of the world much harder than they have to date let s avoid complacency at all costs gurria said clearly the biggest threat is through the escalation of trade restriction measures and this is happening as we speak this clear and present danger could easily have knock on effects advertisement with much of the world economy still recovering from the after effects of the global financial crisis a decade ago us president donald trump caused alarm when he raised tariffs on us 200 billion rm836 8 billion worth of goods from china on may 10 prompting beijing to say it would hit back with its own higher duties trade tensions are the main reason that growth in the global economy will weaken to 3 2 per cent this year the slowest pace in three years and down from rates of about 5 per cent before the financial crisis a decade ago the oecd said more tariffs advertisement the world economy is expected to pick up slowly next year but only if washington and china drop their latest tariff moves the impact could be a lot more severe if trump follows through on his latest threat to hit a further us 300 billion of chinese imports with tariffs and china retaliates again that kind of tariff escalation plus the associated rise in uncertainty about a broadening of the trade war could lop about 0 7 per cent off the world economy by 2021 2022 the oecd said that would be equivalent to about us 600 billion or the loss of the economy of argentina but the knock on effects might not stop there a full blown trade war combined with an ensuing debt crisis in china and a shift away from exports to drive its economy could cause a 2 per cent hit to china s economy in turn knocking global growth further the oecd said to be sure that kind of worst case scenario may well be averted given the stakes for the united states and china trump and chinese president xi jinping are due to meet at a group of 20 leaders summit in japan on june 28 29 other g20 nations will be urging them to step back from the fight chief among them germany and japan two export power houses which have much to lose from a long trade war for now the effect of the trade tensions is being felt mostly among manufacturers by contrast consumers buoyed by low unemployment and weak inflation in many of the world s rich economies have shown little sign of alarm at the row between washington and beijing but over the longer term a protracted trade war is likely to drag down the consumer economy too global trade should normally grow at double the pace of the world economy but is expected to lag it in 2019 boding ill for investment by companies the oecd said that investment would normally drive productivity growth which is key for long term prosperity and is urgently needed living standards for many workers in rich countries remain lower than before the financial crisis of 2008 09 the frustration with lower living standards is widely seen as one of the main factors behind the rise of populist politics including trump s presidential election victory in 2016 to put it bluntly this cannot be the new normal said laurence boone the oecd s chief economist we cannot accept an economy that doesn t raise people s living standards reuters

advertisement now comes the difficult part where do we go from here the recently concluded elections where the president got overwhelming support for his style of leadership the brashness and profanity included shows something very evident in the public psyche impatience for change a great majority of our people seem ready to gloss over the erosion of democratic values as the opposition described it but failed to impress upon the electorate advertisement cory aquino once rued that democracy does not pay dividends as when she became disappointed when the gnomes of wall street and the pashas of the world bank and international monetary fund gave her and our people no discounts nor write offs for loans her predecessor left us paying off those loans on top of eliminating subsidies on a lot of economic goods that made political pogi points but little fiscal sustainability became a heavy yoke upon the macro economy for decades beyond cory s term meanwhile allowing the unlamented cardinal sin and his archaic roman catholic orthodoxy to interfere with and reverse marcos nascent population management policy brought about more strains on government resources people mushroomed so that now we have 107 million versus 54 3 million by the end of 1985 virtually double in 33 years by way of contrast thailand had 52 million in 1985 now they are 69 million vietnam had more than us in 1985 at 61 million now they are 96 million and we wonder why we import rice from them with free public high school education and additional public services enshrined as musts in the 1987 constitution the strains on public spending led to a diminution in the quality of life of the d and e income classes while the middle income c found their lives virtually unchanged still struggling to give their families a better life for far too long people pinned their hopes on a succession of leaders to save them from their misery and the cycle of electoral change did not provide answers from cory s immediate successor fvr who to his credit started to reverse the economic stagnation through trail blazing reforms in the regulatory capture of monopoly capitalism to erap s short lived populism down to gma s troubled administration where long term economic reforms were eclipsed by the political maelstrom of questioned mandate punctuated by corruption and to noynoy s penchant for good marks from the gnomes and pashas while being distant and cold to the impoverished state of the poor man sociologists could probably describe the last three decades as a state of anomie where values and ideals have broken down due to the seeming hopelessness of life and the perceived helplessness of leadership to provide hope this was the state of public dissatisfaction with national leadership which brought an unlikely candidate from the deep and forgotten south to the presidency in 2016 from the very start this writer felt that the electorate was fed up with the system that produced little results but unable to change the system they yearned for someone some savior who could effect meaningful change surveying the declared competition from p noy s hand picked mar roxas to a populist but corruption tainted jojo binay to a leadership challenged grace poe who was bent on reviving old cinematic glory this writer knew that rodrigo duterte of davao would be the answer to that yearning for change note how the overseas filipino workers rallied to a man for duterte in 2016 despite his curses his thumbing down in no uncertain language the hallowed institutions of society these ofws were the refugees of hopelessness who saw painful separation from family and home the only escape from continuing misery and to a great extent duterte did not disappoint in his first two and a half years as president such that the electorate glossed over the harshness of the drug war the so called assaults against individual freedoms and human rights even a short run of high inflation last year which under normal circumstances would have dented the president s popularity considerably the senatorial results show that the public approves of the duterte leadership give and take the survival of a few who banked on the last dying gasps of personal largely cinematic popularity the fact that bong go whose first entry into politics duterte nurtured amazingly landed third over veteran legislators and known quantities proves the enduring faith in the duterte leadership ditto for bato de la rosa and francis tolentino the president had only 10 candidates from the very start which excluded lito lapid and bong revilla plus reelectionists grace poe and nancy binay strictly speaking only eight of his 10 made it jv ejercito and dong mangudadatu failing to make the electoral bar but the shut out of the defined and declared opposition even those of early shoo ins like bam aquino and mar roxas scions of historic political brands says it all by any and all standards it was a duterte win now comes the difficult part moving forward enshrining legacy instead of waiting for the twilight years with great power comes great responsibility uncle ben told spiderman if rodrigo roa duterte is to be the spiderman in our story of redemption from the people s state of hopelessness from the anomie that pervades our social environment then we are all collectively the uncle ben who know that there are great responsibilities that he must yet perform in these last three years sure the public is happy that there is greater peace on the streets that the drug menace to a very large extent has stopped being a threat to their daily lives they are happy that passports are now valid for 10 years and driving licenses extended to five years that there is less kotong from traffic enforcers and highway cops swift removal from public office though sometimes harshly has become the norm rather than cover ups and dilly dallying even the end to luggage terrorism in our airports all these and more acts of the duterte presidency are the mabababaw na kaligayahan that people overwhelmingly approve of they remain patient that the quality of life requires greater improvement and that jobs will yet multiply that the justice system will improve and see a glimmer of hope in the president s handling of the muslim mindanao insurgency and even his dealing with the bandits among the communists even if their hearts still pine for virginia which their mis education in history and their consumer appetites have ingrained upon them they are realistic enough to realize that duterte s independent foreign policy is the way to go in this day and age moving forward with a short time bind of two and a half years before the next presidential campaign convulses the polity requires priorities priorities priorities to quote my and many others favorite contemporary poet robert frost the woods are lovely dark and deep but i have promises to keep and miles to go before i sleep and miles to go before i sleep
the perspective atlanta georgia may 26 2019 updated may 27 2019 liberia is a west african nation in which there is no drought of corruption since its inception as a nation during the tolbert administration in the 1970s the liberian president identified three enemies to combat ignorance disease and poverty but until his death none of those enemies suffered and wound tolbert also established the anti corruption bureau however the bureau did not administer any blow to the corruption it was established to fight in fact liberians trivialized the fight by calling the bureau a corruption bureau since itself was very corrupt then came president doe who overthrew tolbert in a coup d état because of rampant corruption liberians were jubilating singing congua woman born rogue countrywoman born soldier but before the song ended the doe government became an embodiment of rampant corruption and dictatorship doe replaced nepotism from the tolbert regime with tribalism and this coupled with corruption and dictatorship led to the downfall of the doe regime doe s government mismanaged millions forcing the us congress to send its general accountability office gao to audit his government an audit which left doe wanting to pay back nearly 500 million in mismanaged us aid thus began the gradual pullback of us support to the doe s government taylor launched the civil war to get rid of doe for corruption financial malfeasance and with the help of prince johnson doe was brutally murdered by prince johnson taylor was elected in 1997 with liberians again singing you killed my ma you killed my pa i will vote for you taylor pillaged the resources of the nation with impunity and corruption was at an all time high in the nation after taylor liberia put together a government of warring factors they too feasted with impunity on the national resources of the country forcing the international to sign a binding agreement to enforce the resources of the nation from further pillaging thus giving birth to the governance and economic management assistance program gemap among other things gemap to reduce corruption and fundamentally improve governance to ensure that all liberian revenues will be available for the benefit of all liberian people to ensure that the liberian government will have the appropriate fiscal instruments to capture the revenue required for the development of the country and to strengthen liberian institutions so that they can take responsibility for reversing decades of deficiencies in economic and financial management the ntgl and its partners have concluded that immediate remedial action is needed many liberians declared the interim government as very corrupt the end of the civil war the end of the interim government and the departure of charles taylor from liberian created some euphoria among liberians and within the international community that euphoria was reinforced by the election of ellen johnson sirleaf in 2005 making her africa s first female president on her inauguration day sirleaf declared public enemy number one receiving wide applause from international partners and liberians moving quickly to arrest and imprison the head of the interim government charles gyude bryant and a host of former officials who have administration felt were wanting for corruption but not long after she would appoint some of these same officials she arrested for corruption such as sam wulu as ministers in government ellen sirleaf was one of those who bankrolled the taylor war effort but resurfaced as the redeemer she was referred to as iron lady during the 2005 campaign signaling that she was a no nonsense lady who would practice fiscal probity fight corruption head on and rebuild the nation but as soon as she was sworn in she and her inner circle campaigned for the abolition of the iron lady title she preferred to be called mama ellen the logic was that with the iron lady nickname the expectation would be high accountability would be expected to be at the top of her agenda but the newly elected president had her eyes on corruption so she did not want any of that during the inaugural ball she and mr corruption got engaged her administration became the most corrupt government the liberian nation has ever seen nepotism in her government was more than what liberia experienced during the tolbert administration the most corrupt government officials were either her family members or members of her inner circle she got married to mr corruption during the president second term to her credit however she did not manipulate the constitution to enable her to run for a third as it is done elsewhere on the african continent but what she did was to sponsor a candidate that she had over and over said was incapable to run the country money was printed illegally to provide the illegal wherewithal to support the weah candidacy but this was not without any string weah promised madam sirleaf that he was going to protect her and her family not only that weah went further to say that he was going to continue and promote madam sirleaf s legacy which is corruption and corruption with impunity so he got sirleaf support dashing the hope and aspiration of her vice president of 12 years weah assumed power on january 21 2018 and also promised to end corruption i further believe that the overwhelming mandate i received from the liberian people is a mandate to end corruption in public service i promise to deliver on this mandate as officials of government it is time to put the interest of our people above our own selfish interests it is time to be honest with our people though corruption is a habit amongst our people we must end it we must pay civil servants a living wage so that corruption is not an excuse for taking what is not theirs those who do not refrain from enriching themselves at the expense of the people the law will take its course i say today that you will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law about 47 mansions constructed by president weah just a few days after he became president of liberia courtesy of fpa but here is mr weah s reality mansions built by the president weah was elected president of the nation and during the inauguration he reminded liberians of his pledge to protect madam sirleaf her family and keep her legacy on but before the inaugural program was over president weah started building 47 homes mansion and that is in line with his pledge to keep the ellen corruption legacy alive his officials followed suit they started building mansions in and around monrovia minister of state nathaniel mcgill said he paid 200k for his home barely a week in office and claimed he borrowed the money from the liberian bank for development and reconstruction lbdi a bank that seems to finance only government officials as others in the sirleaf s government also claimed they borrowed huge sums from lbdi when they were accused of corruption albeit such borrowings with no tangible collateral or paperwork to support the borrowing in one of our editorials we asked as to where the moral outrage of the liberian people was and now we see so the june 7 protest must go on the missing 16 billion liberians dollars then came information about the missing 16 billion liberian dollars the university students as well as the poor liberian people were outraged there came a protest but forky klon weah and his handlers had a gimmick they decided that president weah declare free college education in the absence of any budgetary allotment to silence the students the university students went into a hiatus due to the free education gimmick but could not continue because of the unaccounted for 25 million united states dollars today we all know that this was a gimmick so the june 7 protest must go on the 25 million us dollars president weah called the usaid to assist with an audit of both the 16 billion liberian dollars and the 25 million united states dollar the audit was done but presumably at the promptings of madam sirleaf weah usaid and the american embassy in monrovia the kroll audit was redacted as if to say it was a cia classified report so this reinforces the need for the protest to go on passing on the corruption legacy the gac audit when the cia type report backfired president weah decided for gac to conduct an audit of the us25 million dollars the request to gac was made through justice minister musa dean there was an mou signed though the contents of the mou are not mentioned in the resulting audit report everyone in monrovia knows that someone took public money somewhere between the central bank and the money exchange bureaus everyone remembers president dr dr cic forky klon weah giving directives through musa dean to the gac to carry out an investigation kroll and the weah appointed presidential investigation unit pit called for a forensic audit instead of a forensic audit gac and the minister of justice decided to do an agreed upon procedure audit as in audit parlance such procedures are mainly laid down by the requesting party and gac agreeing to them this means gac did as they were told to do by the minister of justice leaving some liberians to even question why would kroll pit and the president asked for a forensic audit investigations but gac and the minister of justice chose to do instead a procedural audit with gac saying in its own report that it would have reached a different decision if it was not an agreed upon procedure audit the president may or may not act on the gac audit report which we understand was carried out following the dictate of the auditee meaning the government through justice minister musa dean since the days of john morlu we have become wary of the auditing commission s capacity to fulfill its functions independently the perspective is now more skeptical because of the discrepancies in communications about the timeline of this audit it was reported that gac asked for more time when it was the auditees that asked for time to respond to the audit management letter we therefore have reasons to believe that the gac report was tampered with not too long ago the current auditor general disowned the ebola audit report putting the blames on auditors and her deputy whom she said forced her to sign the report after she the auditor general was reprimanded by the auditees president sirleaf and her inner circle interestingly president forky klon weah wants to make cbl governor patray the sacrificial lamb but the governor says when you pull the rope the rope pulls the bush so he cannot go down alone president weah minister tweah etc must be pulled too do the protesters wait for this you pull rope rope pulls the bush hell no the june 7 protest must go on donors money liberia is heavily dependent on foreign aid the united nations the world bank the imf and nine prominent ambassadors including the mighty united states have written in an unprecedented to the weah s government to complain against irregular withdrawals from their donor funded accounts instead of giving real justifications for such abroad day financial misbehavior the minister of information contends that this is normal practice blaming it on a dig hole cover hole suggesting that the weah s government is engaged in a ponzi scheme with donor funds these donors have threatened disengagement with this government and we are afraid because of this government corrupt practices our major donors might pull out or significantly reduce their support to liberia and in such a case ordinary liberians who are already dying in poverty and despair will die more in greater numbers additionally such irregular financial practices against donor funds have further tainted the image of liberia as a corruption dent scaring away investors liberians need to show that the nation comes first and we do not as a civilized people condone or tolerate these kinds of irregular financial practices the june 7 protest must go on separation of power there is no separation of power in the country at president weah s promptings associate justice kabinah ja neh was impeached illegally though the perspective did not support the appointment of justice ja neh we feel that once he was in the position any attempt to remove him must be legal weah also appointed and commissioned the liberian ambassador to the united states of america bypassing the constitutionally laid down process of senate confirmation so currently there is no separation of power in the country weah is now the president speaker of the house president pro tempore of the senate and chief justice we know that this can only happen in a banana republic so the june 7 protest must go on violations of the code of conduct interim president dr amos sawyer worked with president sirleaf and together were able to pass the code of conduct act of course president sirleaf administration contravened the same code of conduct law when it allowed political appointees to leave their jobs and go on to campaign in 2017 and after they lost they selectively came back to work and though they did not resign two years earlier as stipulated by the law president sirleaf broke the law and as expected the weah administration is breaking the law likewise sirleaf and weah have effectively made liberia a lawless country it took weah one year to declare his assets after being in office he has refused to make his asset declaration public all in contravention of the code of conduct so the june 7 protest must go on the date june 7 2019 is almost cast in stones unless something drastic happens the march must take place president dr dr george forky klon weah is open to it and welcomes it some liberians and some international partners are ambivalent because of the senseless 15 year civil war but this time around liberians are determined to show their moral outrage due to the prevailing corruption from top to bottom in the country and to show their maturity by making the process peaceful it does not make a bit of sense to stop the protest that is aimed at curtailing corruption with impunity so the protest to go on the exchange rate everyone also knows that the prices of commodities have gone through the sky a year ago people bought us 1 00 scratch card for ld 140 and now it is up to ld 180 it is a fact that gas stations sometimes refuse to sell gasoline whenever another hike of the dollar is around the corner this makes the so called mop up exercise a scam according to the gac report the liberian dollars they got from the money exchangers was put back on the market which does not make any sense another observation by the gac is that the government of liberia has not paid back the 25 million dollars june 7 save the state protest the fishing licenses the president sold over 300 fishing licenses to fishermen of senegal because the senegalese have depleted the fish in its territorial water causing the new president of the country to ban fishing senegalese fishermen are fishing in liberia territorial water and taking their catches to senegal the fish are then dried and exported this also justifies the staging of june 7 save the state protest what can be done to save the state the president should fire minister tweah bank governor patray minister mcgill charles bright crooked emmanuel shaw mayor kojee for inexperience etc and have them audited the entire economic management must be dismissed and replaced with competent and professionals with integrity weah needs to give an account of how he earned the millions of dollars he used to build his mansions it is ridiculous to just replace patray with minister tarpeh as speculated in social media as he promised the president and his administration should prosecute successfully all those who caught in corruption and other forms of financial malfeasance the president should also allocate money in the next fiscal budget to provide free education build more schools train more teachers professors and equip the schools the fishing licenses given to senegalese fishermen must be revoked this will take energy out of the protest but will president forky klon weah take these steps we doubt it the donor funds must be paid back immediately as well as put back in the liberian international reserves the 25 million immediately

capital s interest until their press release as they had not previously contacted us homestreet has been a fannie mae dus lender and servicer since the initiation of the program by fannie mae over 30 years ago and this business has and continues to be a profitable and important part of our commercial real estate lending business the board of directors will review the letter from dwight capital and respond as appropriate and as such we will not be making any additional comments on their offer on this call joining me today is our chief financial officer mark ruh we are conducting today s call from two separate locations so please excuse any additional background noise or possible cross talk most probably during questions later on this call in a moment mark will present our financial results but first i d like to give an update on our results of operations and review our progress in executing our business strategy during the past several months we ve made significant progress toward achieving our long term strategic goals we re executing a series of transactions that when completed will redefine our business the board of directors approved a plan of exit of our standalone home loan center based mortgage origination business and related mortgage loan servicing this decision resulted in recasting our financial results to reflect the discontinued operations in the form of mortgage banking segment the earnings result released this morning reflect those changes for the current quarter and the comparative historical quarters in conjunction with the board of directors decision to exit or dispose of the large scale mortgage banking business in the first quarter we sold the majority of our single family mortgage servicing rights and in april of this year we entered into an agreement to sell substantially all of our home loan centers and related fulfillment centers in connection with the home loan center sale we expected a significant number of our mortgage personnel will transition to positions with the buyer closing conditions include minimum levels of employment offer acceptance and loan officer and branch licensing requirements any home loan centers or fulfillment centers not sold to homebridge will be closed in the second quarter to the extent that minimum closing conditions are not met for home loan centers and fulfillment centers expected to be sold in part or in total loss on disposal may materially exceed current estimates we thank those employees that are part of the transaction for their work at homestreet and contribution to our success we expect that significant number of our mortgage personnel will transition to positions with the buyer other personnel in corporate positions supporting the mortgage banking business will be reduced in the remainder of 2019 primarily in the second quarter we also announced that we sold approximately 10 billion of fannie mae and freddie mac single family mortgage servicing rights and sold approximately 4 billion of ginnie mae s single family mortgage servicing rights in the first quarter together the sale of these servicing rights represent 177 million of msr fair value and approximately 71 of our portfolio of single family servicing rights as of december 31 2018 we have retained the servicing associated with loan officers that will continue with the company as well as the more specialized or niche loan programs for which there is not a liquid secondary market nevertheless we expect the remaining portfolio to shrink over time as future additions will be less than expected amortization and prepayments this transition will provide more portfolio space for commercial lending going forward these transactions align with our long term strategic goal of reducing the impact of the cyclical and volatile earnings stream our remaining single family mortgage business will be reported going forward within continuing operations substantially smaller focused on our retail deposit and regional markets and position for ongoing profitability as part of the plan of exit the company recognized 12 1 million of loss on exit or disposal and restructuring charges during the first quarter we expect to incur additional expenses of 7 million to 12 million during the remainder of 2019 primarily in the second quarter under generally accepted accounting principles we are unable to recognize the results of discontinued operations all of the corporate overhead and support costs such as information technology human resources legal and accounting that we incurred to support these businesses and previously reported in the results of our former mortgage banking segment these corporate overhead and support costs have been recast in our historical results of operations and are now included in continuing operations in our presentation we refer to these costs as stranded costs these stranded costs are identified in the financial tables in today s release and totaled 8 3 million during the first quarter of this year as part of our plan of exit or disposal of our home loan center based mortgage origination and servicing business we have already identified approximately 45 to 50 of these stranded costs for immediate reduction the majority of which will occur during the second quarter of this year included in these initial reductions are approximately 100 employees in corporate overhead positions whose positions will be eliminated prior to year end 2019 and we provided notice to those affected employees earlier this month in addition to these initially identified reductions we have initiated a corporatewide efficiency improvement project to go beyond the current restructuring plan to improve the operating efficiency of the entire company as part of this initiative we have engaged the services of a well known consultant dan davis at cbc for profits who has successfully helped many west coast banks identify opportunities for cost reductions and process improvements and improve their overall operating efficiency in addition to these restructuring activities during the quarter we also completed the acquisition of a retail deposit branch in san marcos california with approximately 75 million in deposits along with our 112 million of commercial loans and a san diego county focused commercial lending team we look forward to continuing our growth in that large and diverse market with a high quality commercial banking team with a great track record we also opened two de novo branches in san jose and santa clara california these locations are an important expansion of our retail deposit branch footprint with the sizable number of our retail customers that we acquired in the acquisition of simplicity bancorp are located in the region these branches are also an important addition to our commercial lending business located in northern california our investment in the branches had been planned and committed for some time going forward we have suspended future de novo deposit branch openings consistent with our strategic shift toward slower growth improved efficiency and profitability improvement while we ve been busy with strategic changes and related transactions our core businesses has continued to perform well we grew loans held for investment 5 during the quarter 3 excluding loans acquired with our new san marcos branch total deposits increased 7 during the quarter 5 excluding the deposits acquired with our new san marcos branch and non interest bearing deposits increased 12 5 excluding acquired deposits during the quarter asset quality remained strong during the quarter with our non performing asset ratio ending at 23 basis points of total assets lastly the board of directors has approved a share repurchase program for up to 75 million of our common stock this share repurchase and the ongoing growth and success of our core business supported by the outlook for continued economic strength in our primary markets underscores our confidence in homestreet s future performance and long term value creation for our shareholders once these transactions are complete and their total financial impact are known the board of directors will consider potential uses of any remaining excess capital which may include additional share repurchases establishing a regular cash dividend and other measures intended to improve long term shareholder value and now i ll turn it over to mark who will share the details of our financial results mark ruh thank you mark good morning everyone and thank you again for joining us as mark stated the earnings results released this morning include the recap of our financial results to reflect the change to discontinued operations accounting for the former mortgage banking segment regarding our results our net consolidated loss which includes the results of both continuing and discontinued operations for the first quarter of 2019 was 1 7 million or 0 06 per diluted share compared to net income of 15 2 million or 0 56 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2018 one time items included in net income for the first quarter of 2019 were a non core expense of 9 6 million of loss on exit or disposal and other restructuring expenses related to the decision to exit the large scale mortgage banking business and 290 000 of acquisition related expenses net of taxes this compared to one time items in the fourth quarter of 2018 which included a non core 4 9 million income tax benefit a 676 000 recovery of restructuring related expenses net of tax and 54 000 of acquisition related expenses net of tax excluding the impact of these charges core net consolidated income which includes the results of operations for both continuing and discontinued operations for the first quarter of 2019 was 8 1 million or 0 30 per diluted share compared to core net consolidated income of 9 7 million or 0 36 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2018 net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2019 was 5 1 million compared to net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2018 of 12 5 million this decrease in net income from continuing operations was primarily due to the 4 9 million income tax benefit recognized in the fourth quarter of 2018 and a 2 3 million decrease in non interest income net interest income decreased by 1 4 million to 47 6 million in the first quarter of 2019 from 48 9 million in the fourth quarter this decrease in net interest income is primarily due to the compression of our net interest margin to 311 basis points in the first quarter from 319 basis points in the fourth quarter of last year largely as a result of the flattening yield curve and rising deposit and borrowing costs exceeding increasing loan yields loans held for investment increased by 269 8 million or 5 during the first quarter included in the increase for the quarter were 86 4 million of acquired commercial and industrial loans and a 23 5 million of non owner occupied commercial real estate loans not including acquired loans loans grew organically by 3 during the quarter non performing assets increased to 16 7 million or 23 basis points of total assets at march 31 compared to 17 basis points of assets at december 31 the increase from december 31 2018 was primarily due to the downgrade to non accrual of a 4 7 million sba 504 construction loan note however that construction on this property is complete the business is operating and the underlying real estate is contracted for sale we believe we re sufficiently collateralized to avoid potential losses we recorded a 1 5 million provision for credit losses in the first quarter compared to a 500 000 provision in the fourth quarter this increase in provision was primarily due to higher loan portfolio growth and lower recoveries during the first quarter deposit balances excluding those related to discontinued operations were 5 2 billion at march 31 an increase of 6 from december 31 the increase includes 75 million in deposits related to the acquisition of the silvergate deposit branch previously mentioned including 42 7 million of non interest bearing accounts and 31 8 million of money market and savings accounts non interest bearing deposits increased 12 to 683 8 million from 612 5 million at december 31 2018 excluding acquired deposits non interest bearing account balances increased 5 during the quarter non interest income decreased 2 3 million from 10 4 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 to 8 1 million in the first quarter of 2019 the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in other non interest income from lower investment income specifically a distribution from one of our small business investment companies funds in the fourth quarter of 218 and a decrease in fannie mae dus loan origination and sale income due to seasonally lower activities during the first quarter non interest expense decreased slightly to 47 8 million in the first quarter of 2019 from 47 9 million in the fourth quarter primarily from savings associated with our ongoing reductions of headcount and overhead expenses our effective income tax rate of 19 8 for the first quarter of 2019 differs from our combined federal and blended state statutory tax rate of 23 6 primarily due to the benefit we received from tax exempt interest income on municipal securities net loss from discontinued operations was 6 8 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to net income of 2 8 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 this decrease is primarily due to a 9 6 million net of tax in loss on exit or disposal and restructuring expenses in the first quarter versus the one time 2 5 million net recovery of washington state business and occupation or b o tax we recovered in the fourth quarter of 2018 i will now turn it back over to mark mason mark mason thank you mark during the past several years we have made substantial changes in our business as part of our long term strategic plan to convert a troubled thrift into a leading west coast major market footprint regional commercial bank the recent decision to exit large scale mortgage banking was made only after we felt we had exhausted opportunities to improve performance additionally after mortgage segment breakeven here in 2018 lower volume and profit margins in 2018 and absent near term regulatory capital relief for mortgage servicing rights and improvement in the industry conditions we made the painful decision to exit the business this decision has certain costs and opportunities but on balance our board of directors believe that this significant strategic change creates the opportunity for meaningful near term shareholder value creation as you ll note from our discontinued operations reporting we have a substantial amount of residual corporate overhead now remaining within our continuing operations to address going forward a significant amount of this overhead will be reduced in the second quarter as i stated earlier the remainder of these stranded costs as well as all of our corporate expenses are part of the corporate wide efficiency improvement project to which we now turn our full attention we will be adopting peer levels of return on assets return on equity and operating efficiency along with interim milestones however until the homebridge transaction is complete and we complete our initial assessment of opportunities for cost reduction and process improvement we re not prepared to discuss the targets or timing to achievement at this time nevertheless we expect our loan portfolio growth to average between 1 and 3 per quarter throughout the remainder of this year we expect single family mortgage production volume from continuing operations to total approximately 500 million in the second quarter 450 million in the third quarter and 300 million in the fourth quarter of this year we expect approximately 85 of this volume will be sold to the secondary market while the remaining 15 will be retained in our loan portfolio reflecting the yield curve as of the end of the first quarter and absent changes in market rates and loan prepayment speeds we expect our consolidated net interest margin to remain in the range of 305 basis points to 315 basis points throughout the remainder of this year due to the uncertainty of timing of the home loan center sales and the expense reductions associated with our discontinued operations we will not be providing expense guidance at this time we anticipate providing expense guidance in future quarters this concludes our prepared comments thank you for your attention and patience today mark and i would be happy to answer any questions you have at this time question and answer session operator thank you the first question comes from jeff rulis from d a davidson please go ahead jeffrey rulis on the fee income line just to kind of get a sense for the loan origination and sale line item and loan servicing those two kind of run rate and kind of what s been â what changes and maybe what your expectations are for the run rate on those two mark mason jeff i m sorry i didn t hear the first part of that question could you repeat it jeffrey rulis yeah looking for detail on the fee income line item so the net gain on loan origination and sale activities was 2 6 million this quarter and loan servicing income of 1 million just looking at the run rate of those for the balance of the year given the changes that you ve made mark mason so i m going to just probably have to make the same apology a couple of times unfortunately the changes to create continued operations and discontinued operations are going to create a little bit of confusions in the transition part of that of course relates to the non interest expense stranded costs that we ve discussed the other part relates to the transition of the residual or remaining mortgage banking operations origination and servicing that historically have been reported as a part of the mortgage banking segment or discontinued operations in the second quarter that continuing mortgage origination and servicing component which relates to 500 million in originations next quarter that we provided guidance on will move from discontinued operations to continuing operations so what you see in continuing operations in the first quarter relates solely to commercial activities â sba loan sales commercial real estate loan sales dus loan sales and the like second quarter and going forward that line item will also include revenue both servicing and origination gain on sale from the continuing mortgage banking operations jeffrey rulis so what is that outlook that was good detail but what is the number that you re looking for for the balance of the year mark mason we re not giving guidance yet on that number we ve provided origination estimates and an estimate of that â the amount of that origination that will be sold in the secondary market additionally from a proportional standpoint you can take prior servicing income and reduce it by the proportion sold that was a pretty good start on making those estimates but at this time we re not giving specific dollar guidance jeffrey rulis okay i ll move on to expenses i understand you ve not given guidance there but just want to â given the stranded cost sort of phrase the 47 8 million if you were to remove as you said a good portion of the 45 to 50 of the stranded costs going forward this would imply a little over 3 million decline if you capture that would that assume a core run rate of 44 5 million is that in the ballpark of what you would i guess agree mark mason the stranded cost number we detail in the non gaap reconciliation it is a little over 8 million i believe mark do you have that number mark mason yes i do mark it s 8 3 million and it s on the second page of the non gaap table jeff mark mason right so that sâ jeffrey rulis right i see the number i guess i m looking for the itemization and the run rate you guys kind of â how it s presented on page 15 of your powerpoint you ve got non interest expense of 47 8 million am i to assume that the stranded costs are included in that 47 8 million and then that is the run rate and we take the savings or it s not a piece of that mark mason well that s correct so 47 8 million includes 8 3 million of what we re calling stranded costs our current estimate is that will be reduced in the second quarter by about 50 right and that will occur in the quarter though so that won t be a clean immediate reduction for the quarter but sort of third quarter forward you can reduce that number by that amount and then further as we work on the remainder of the corporate expenses jeffrey rulis okay i ll step back thank you operator the next question comes from steve moss from b riley fbr please go ahead stephen moss good afternoon mark mason hi steve stephen moss i just want to start with the slower growth comments you made mark in your prepared remarks in particular it seems like you re slowing loan growth a little bit it looks like judging by originations probably on the construction side of the business but just kind of want to see where you guys are thinking about slowing the growth down and your focus on profitability mark mason so in the investor deck we published this morning we provided average quarterly net loan portfolio growth of 1 to 3 in the second quarter and then decreasing somewhat the third and fourth quarters that reflects in part the run off of the single family portfolio lower additions to the single family portfolio from current loan productions offset by growing commercial production stephen moss okay and just in terms of the â and just on the construction piece in particular it does look like it s â the trend has been lower balances just wondering if we re going to see that going forward and just what your thoughts are with that line of business mark mason we re still active because home construction has been strong to this point but that will slow as we finish the mortgage banking origination business sale commercial construction we have slowed intentionally as we ve seen a cooling in the pacific northwest markets and in our home building business demand has declined moderately as builders have slowed somewhat their current building schedule we re not expecting a meaningfully significant further decline at this point but our volume at least in the first quarter was a little more than 10 lower than we expected in home building still strong markets still very profitable but a little slower demand stephen moss okay that s helpful and then on the margin here and i know you guys gave 3 05 to 3 15 type guidance just kind of wondering what you re thinking in terms of the impact from the inverted yield curve how that may change your behavior and your thoughts especially around the investment securities portfolio and should we think about it perhaps close to low end in the near term mark mason well we gave a range that we think we can perform within of course it s hard to assess the balance of risks at this point we have raised guidance from last quarter on the net interest margin i believe it was 300 basis points to 310 basis points last quarter and so we feel a little better about going forward margin as interest rates have settled sort of for the time being it s hard for me to assess the balance of risk there steve i ve never been a good predictor of rates stephen moss all right i appreciate that thank you guys mark mason thank you operator the next question comes from tim o brien from sandler o neill and partners please go ahead timothy o brien thank you just a question about â i guess through the remainder of the year do you have fte addition plans for the commercial business given the free up of capital mark mason we have additions we are making we also have reductions we are making so i don t believe we are planning any material net additions to commercial lending we have been doing some restructuring some top grading if that s the right phrase i m supposed to use and watching our expenses so i think that with the addition of the team in san diego in the commercial lending area our current size is going to be what you re going to see for a little bit timothy o brien and then could you also just again i guess revisit thoughts on contractual timing and any updates or refinements you can make to that timing with regard to pending closes and milestones with regard to the mortgage bank exit process that s underway what comes here in the second quarter obviously with regard to the internal aspects of it but with regard to the counterparty aspects can you give us any â just some more color on that and also remind us of what s contractually in the works mark mason sure to the extent i can we re fairly far along with the process of getting our loan officers licensed i think we ve talked about those requirements before homebridge is well along the way in getting branches we re transferring licensed so what remains to be seen is ultimately the full pull through of employees loan officers in particular who have received offers from homebridge the acceptance rate the show up rate if you will and whether or not those numbers will exceed the hurdle amounts or not by region and then what reconciliation of that might occur i want to tell you we feel very good today that we have had strong acceptance and there s a lot of enthusiasm for the migration to homebridge that may vary by individual office we have had some attrition i have to tell you one of the most surprising things about this process has been the recruiting competition for our best talent and the amounts of money that other lenders independents in particular have offered our best people to change companies and just to put that in perspective some of our largest producers have received offers that look like 50 of your 2018 w 2 as a sign on bonus a commission plan of 155 basis points to 180 basis points initially for six months and near that thereafter paid assistance and marketing budgets it is unbelievable to me that anyone can make money paying those amounts so for the very best people the level of competition for that talent and what people want to pay has really i think gone beyond economic reality and that has been challenging for us to deal with but i think that the significant majority of our personnel are excited and enthusiastic about moving to homebridge with their leadership with their fulfillment personnel continuing to do great business in terms of timing these closings are to occur within the second quarter in our commentary we have described all of this completed during the second quarter to the extent of our individual branches of personnel we dealt decide to go with homebridge transaction those branches will be closed in the second quarter but we re very optimistic that that will hopefully be a small minority of the branches at this juncture timothy o brien will the transfers mark take place on a loan production office basis will it be kind of done at one time or will it be rolling transfers how does that process unfold mark mason contractually we ve set up two transfer dates as we get closer to the first one that may migrate in terms of the absolute date of those two transfer dates one is currently expected in late may and the other in mid to late june and so as we get closer to those dates we get to know more about how this is going to close out timothy o brien great and then just shifting gears last question as far as the repurchase process and prospects for that what s the lock up like on that and when can you guys consider executing on that authorization mark mason great question we are prepared to get started we are going to be adopting a â i believe 10b 5 compliant program that has to be initiated in an open window period we expect to initiate that repurchase program later this week after the market has had a chance to digest our earnings release it may slide into next week we re also expecting to file initial proxy materials and so depending upon the date of those things that date may0 move but in the near term we re expecting to initiate that program timothy o brien last question i know you kind of suggested you didn t want to talk about this is there a proxy date calendar there in mind that you can remind us of or is that still to be decided not a proxy date but an annual meeting date mark mason the board of directors has yet to determine that date but there are considerations about how long you can wait to hold it after your last year s date is so we expect that the board will make a decision in the near term and of course make it public timothy o brien thank you very much mark mason thanks tim operator the next question comes from jackie bohlen from kbw please go ahead jacquelynne bohlen hi good morning everyone mark mason good morning jackie with regard to the expected loan contraction in 3q and 4q understanding that growth will be slower in the single family and so that s part of the driver does any of that involve any transfer of loans within portfolios or perhaps any sales you are anticipating to work on the mix mark mason we are a consistent seller of small balance commercial real estate loans you saw the first quarter we had a sizable amount of activity that we expect to continue going forward additionally sba loan sales fannie mae dus loan sales so i think that you can expect consistent activity in those areas that will tend to keep loan portfolio balances down i don t think that we are expecting meaningfully higher volume but that s somewhat dependent upon our success in originating and the demand from buyers jacquelynne bohlen okay so those portfolio sales are no different than they ve been in the past so that doesn t have an impact on the outlook for the latter half of 2019 mark mason generally no but i think it s â loan sales are important part of our business it allows us to originate more and i think we re forecasting or expecting the market to be similar of course that could change jacquelynne bohlen okay understood and in terms of i know you ve provided guidance in terms of how to think about the servicing income from the single family that will transition to continuing ops and with the volume and everything from a gain on sale margin perspective can we use prior guidance on the composite margin i think it was 3 10 to 3 20 in terms of what you would expect on those portfolio sale the single family generation sale mark mason yeah we decided not to provide guidance because we were thinking the number wasn t going to be as material but i understand your need to consider that when making those estimates i think that the prior guidance while appropriate for the periods also was a decline from the part of the last guidance and i think that trend continues so i think that people should take a conservative view of gain on sale during this time frame jacquelynne bohlen okay that s good color and then just lastly the remaining piece of what s in loans held for sale i think it was roughly 56 million give or take that was included in the continuing operation balance sheet is that a pretty good go forward estimate for where we should expect those loans to be mark mason it s going to go up a little because of the transition of single family mortgage banking right the entirety of those balances might go up a little jacquelynne bohlen okay so what s in that bucket right now is related to commercial portfolio sales and not related to single family mark mason i think that s correct let me check with mark mark is that correct jacquelynne bohlen sorry i know that s a really technical question mark ruh yes that s correct mark mason okay good so it will rise a little bit but again thinking about the lower volume we re estimating 500 million next quarter with only a small amount of that being held for sale i think our estimate is 15 i think we ve footnoted so that s a small addition jacquelynne bohlen okay great thank you very much mark mason thanks jackie operator our next question comes from tim coffey from fig partners please go ahead timothy coffey thank you mark afternoon mark mark mason good afternoon tim timothy coffey hey i was looking at that slide in the presentation on the key drivers it somewhat implies origination â annualized origination of single family residential of about 1 5 billion to 1 6 billion a year is that kind of what you re aiming for mark mason i guess what i should say is it is what it says obviously first quarter is similarly historically seasonally a lower quarter and if you extend those numbers i guess you could assume that we have not made an estimate of first quarter of 2020 but this is our best estimate of the next three quarters timothy coffey right but excluding from the sale of the mortgage business it is a piece of it that you did want to keep for origination activities right mark mason right and that s this line item you are talking about on the guidance page timothy coffey yes okay do you plan to sell â continue selling 85 of that production mark mason that s our current estimate and that s the footnote to that table timothy coffey yeah what i mean is beyond the three quarters that you ve outlined in that table mark mason it is that s our current estimate tim i think a lot remains to be seen including what portfolio these are timothy coffey okay and then turning back on the gain on sale question are you going to be retaining the servicing on these mark mason that is something we re still discussing on a great deal yes we are still talking about whether or not we will continue to retain ginnie mae servicing as an example the ginnie servicing is more involved and more costly while the revenue is higher the cost of servicing are higher as well so that is still under analysis by us timothy coffey okay and then you mentioned you wanted to do more â improving efficiency at the ongoing enterprise and i wonder what kind of things are coming to mind when you talk about that mark mason well we re sort of at the front end of that companywide analysis but it runs really the full gamut of renegotiating technology agreements real estate restructuring lines of reporting process improvement a whole â i can almost not think of an aspect of the business that we will not reevaluate and we re going to do it thoughtfully we have a lot of savings already slated for implementation it s probably hard for people to imagine the difference but it is significant between an organization that was built to grow 20 a year on the balance sheet and run a multi billion dollar mortgage banking business to one focused on efficiency and profitability our prior strategy was necessary because of the influence of the large mortgage banking business cyclicality and seasonality and our strategy previously had been to outgrow it well that s a significant change and the cost of supporting a growth business versus the cost of running an optimized business is â the infrastructure is much different and that s a transition we re going to go through thoughtfully timothy coffey okay and as you are nearing completion of selling the mortgage business do you have a new estimate or another estimate on what your restructuring expenses might be in the second quarter mark mason we do it was in my conference call comments you can go back and look let me see if i can find them mark ruh do you remember those mark ruh yeah yeah it was 7 million to 12 million tim is what we had in the script is what we had expected in the range we expect for the second quarter timothy coffey okay yeah i did have them in my notes i apologize for that and then one final question isâ mark mason tim just a caution on that number to the extent that we close less of the branches that we re selling to homebridge than our current estimate that number could go up timothy coffey okay all right okay i think those were all my questions thank you mark mason all right thanks tim operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to mark mason for closing remarks mark mason thank you again for attending and participating on our call this quarter we look forward to speaking with you again after the second quarter results have a great day operator the conference is now concluded thank you for attending today s presentation you may now disconnect
foreign fund outflow slowed during the holiday shortened week of may 21 and 23 to rm252 98 million compared with rm1 0 billion last week bank islam malaysia bhd chief economist mohd afzanizam abdul rashid said foreign investors were offloading their position in view of the heightened uncertainties we believe that this period of heightened uncertainties will continue to hog the limelight between now and until the g20 summit scheduled for end june economic data has been soft judging from the recent purchasing managers index pmi indices he told bernama the pmi for manufacturing in the eurozone is currently at 47 7 points for may suggesting manufacturers sentiment is generally pessimistic and this could have an impact on their decision to hire and capital expenditure said mohd afzanizam similarly in the united states the pmi for manufacturing fell to 50 6 points in may from 52 6 points previously while japan s manufacturing pmi slid to 49 6 points in may from 50 2 in april businesses in the advanced world are very cautious now therefore it is a risk off mode and typically investors would seek shelter in safe haven instruments such as bonds and safe haven currencies such as the us dollar yen euro and swiss franc mohd afzanizam pointed out meanwhile local institutions remained a net buyer at rm230 67 million between may 21 23 lower against the rm934 18 million recorded in the same period the previous week asked about the escalating trade tensions between the us and china mohd afzanizam said the impact on the global supply chain in the technology sector could be quite severe with the blacklisting of chinese telco giant huawei of course there is talk that trade diversion would happen and benefit other asian countries however the transition to a new supplier could take a while in many respects especially from the operational point of view so we think the trade diversion story is for the medium to long term said mohd afzanizam according to the international data corporation idc the sales of global smartphones declined by 6 6 percent in the first quarter of 2019 led by major brands such as samsung and apple which fell by 8 1 percent and 30 2 per cent respectively while xiaomi and oppo contracted by 10 2 percent and 6 0 percent in that sense the technology sector is already on a declining trend in terms of sales with or without the trade war the technology sector appears to be already softening said mohd afzanizam on another note it was reported that oil prices tumbled on rising demand risks over the us china trade war the benchmark brent crude was trading lower at us 67 23 per barrel on friday as at time of writing from us 73 08 per barrel on may 20 fxtm market analyst han tan said the rapid deterioration in us china ties brings next month s organisation of the petroleum exporting countries opec meeting into sharper focus demand side risks are set to feature prominently in the upcoming decision by oil producers on whether to maintain production cuts going into the second half of the year ultimately the us china standoff is expected to dent global oil demand for 2019 and complicate attempts by opec producers to rebalance the global oil markets while further bouts of volatility should not come as a surprise to traders moving forward he added on a friday to friday basis the ringgit fell to 4 1870 1900 against the us dollar from 4 1750 1780 previously due to the ongoing global uncertainties the ringgit is expected to trade between 4 1850 to 4 1950 against the greenback next week bernama

menafn khaleej times globalisation one of the pillars of the modern economic system is facing serious trust deficit as geopolitical storms lash the world pushing the year 2019 into a maelstrom of uncertainties according to a research paper tabled last week at the astana economic forum aef known as the asian davos political commitment to globalisation in developed countries is weakening while the world is witnessing a transformation of the capitalistic model of development the paper said in this context trade conflicts have significant potential to escalate into trade wars with consequent disruptions in global production and supply chains when international organisations and arbitration bodies do not have sufficient weight to resolve trade and political disputes as a result we see tensions between former partners and a return to gunboat diplomacy in trade relations said the paper which listed out 10 risks that would define the world economy the current juncture is delicate for the global economy a year ago activity was accelerating in almost all regions of the world however we have witnessed a slowdown since the second half of 2018 reflecting rising trade tensions and a tightening of financial conditions we are expecting a rebound in late 2019 but it seems precarious and vulnerable to downside risks christine lagarde managing director of the international monetary fund said in a special note in the paper these risks include country related uncertainties such as brexit broader tension around trade and unease in global financial markets said lagarde who also addressed the forum in the kazakhstan capital of nur sultan formerly known as astana the aef paper lamented the plunging influence of international institutions for the first time in the post war period the us changed its economic policy to a domestically oriented one breaking a number of trade partnership agreements at the same time a debate on the integrity of the single european market is raging in the continent the paper pointed out these developments impact globalisation by giving rise to new regional blocs whose partners are only guided by their own interests such neoprotectionism is creating barriers not only in manufacturing and agriculture but also in the digital economy and innovative industries growing digitisation and the current transition to a new industrial revolution are provoking a new technological race that would reduce employment leading to more income inequality the paper warned such fragmentation of the common technology market would also create both market risks and risks associated with information and cyber security breaches discussing the risks of new financial bubbles the paper s authors from kazakhstan s institute of economic research said emerging markets are experiencing difficulties due to rising interest rates in the us despite the stabilisation of energy prices currencies of an increasing number of developing countries are becoming cheaper amid fears that their economies will not be able to cope with the increase in the cost of borrowing in the us an increasing influence of china is another risk factor at a time when washington lacks a coherent policy beijing has put in place an effective global trade and investment strategy by using its technology companies to promote state interests consequently trade relations among asian countries are shifting from the us to china which is rapidly promoting the belt and road initiative that is capable of bringing the annual trade turnover between the asian giant and the 65 silk route countries to 2 5 trillion though the silk road may become a game changer in asia there are a number of challenges in implementing the project most countries consider the initiative as too dominated and controlled by china and fear it would just end up as a transit for chinese goods the countries around the silk road need a single coordinated plan that could simplify trade barriers and agreements and ensure a smooth and safe movement of goods and services it said one of the main issues of the next decade would be how to manage the risks of climate change while meeting the growing demand for electricity and also fighting poverty and improving living standards in developing countries experts expect a recession in the united states which may occur by 2021 to be one of the most important threats according to imf estimates gdp growth will slow in 2019 and 2020 first to 2 5 per cent then to 1 8 per cent the decline may be stronger due to the vulnerability of the us financial sector in addition the threat of a sharper than expected slowdown in china s economic growth is expected to damage growth prospects in asia and the world at large it is noted that the slowdown in china will be gradual the slowdown is exacerbated by the impact of us tariffs as well as a substantial amount of chinese debt that can negatively affect infrastructure investment to address these issues and put growth on a higher and more inclusive path the world needs strong international cooperation in addition to good domestic policies said lagarde the writer is senior editor of khaleej times views expressed are his own and do not reflect the newspaper s policy
this is an opinion piece the view that minimum wages can rise significantly without inflicting harm on the job prospects of lesser skilled workers has certainly taken root the success of the fight for 15 movement has been particularly striking with several cities six states and the district of columbia moving their minimum wage up to 15 an hour several democratic presidential candidates explicitly support a 15 national minimum wage a bill that would legislate this has more than 200 democratic co sponsors in the house of representatives economist jeffrey clemens argues however in a recent policy paper published by the cato institute that a good deal of this support is predicated on an incomplete reading of the academic literature clemens correctly acknowledges a recent string of important papers including several co authored by the economist arindrajit dube that found little evidence that minimum wage increases reduce employment but he argues that many other important papers written in the past few years get short shrift by journalists opinion leaders and policy makers clemens suggests they should pay particular attention to new research with transparent methods and highlights a 2018 paper by the economist john horton that analyzes an online labor market in which workers are hired to do programming data entry and graphic design horton randomly assigned minimum wage restrictions to the hiring companies and found that when the wage floor increased the employers hired workers with more skills and the hours worked declined substantially the policy implications are clear a higher minimum wage can reduce employment opportunities for the least skilled workers in the labor market it is often easier for researchers to get their hands on the administrative records of european governments than those in the u s and clemens points to a string of recent papers using high quality european data that find reductions in employment after the minimum wage rose when the minimum wage for 18 year olds increased in denmark a study finds employment among 18 year olds fell relative to 17 year olds to the point that the total earnings of the older workers was the same as the younger workers despite their higher wage floor economist jan kabátek finds something similar in the netherlands in 2012 greece reduced its minimum wage as part of the deal it made with the international monetary fund during its debt crisis and bailout an analysis of this reduction found that minimum wages are inversely correlated with employment of affected workers between 2007 and 2009 sweden cut the payroll taxes paid by employers for young workers and employment of younger workers relative to older workers increased substantially as a result in hungary the minimum wage increased from about 35 to 55 of the median wage over just two years a 2018 paper finds that roughly 1 in 10 workers affected by this increase lost their jobs and that most of the cost of the increase was borne by consumers because businesses raised their prices and there is recent evidence that employment fell by a small amount after germany s introduction of a minimum wage in 2015 economists typically look at all minimum wage increases over the past several decades in the same statistical analysis instead clemens argues that analyzing discrete episodes allows economists to better understand and investigate the specific context around a smaller set of minimum wage increases which can be taken into account in the design of the study and in interpreting its results my own work with clemens looks only at the period following the great recession in a series of papers we find that large and small minimum wage increases have different effects with large jumps reducing employment and small changes mattering much less or possibly even increasing employment our findings suggest that the specifics of minimum wage policy and the broader economic context matter during an economic expansion it may be that increases in the wage floor must be large in order to reduce hiring and employment because in good times companies can absorb the cost through other channels including raising their prices indeed in their 2019 analysis of minimum wage increases during the great recession clemens and michael wither find employment reductions larger than have been typically found in previous research beyond its effects on employment economists are actively researching other aspects of the minimum wage does it affect employment growth over time rather than the number of jobs in the year of an increase does employment respond differently to increases in states that index their minimum wages to inflation when the minimum wage is increased are individuals less likely to have employer provided health insurance is their health affected and are they more likely to be victims of wage theft how do industries respond to increases and are long run employment effects more important than short run effects is the minimum wage an effective anti poverty policy the minimum wage is not a settled issue important high quality studies come to different conclusions on serious questions journalists commentators and policy makers take note
the latest trade war escalation triggered by the white house s decision to blacklist huawei and several chinese surveillance companies has further increased pressure on the global supply chain of goods and services it has also raised the risk of a technology cold war and helped send semiconductor equities into a tailspin preview_thumbnail 10 arab countries in terms of ease of doing business the overall weakness in em stocks not least south korea given its importance as a gauge for activity in china has further raised concerns that the current slowdown across the major economies is unlikely to be reversed anytime soon the us is not immune with q2 growth heading towards 1 per cent while additional headwinds are being stirred up by the strong dollar which this past week according to one us fed measure reached its highest level since 2002 beyond the sharp fall in the energy sector weather worries in the us continued to drive a reduction of what up until recently was a record short position held by funds across the key crops of corn soybeans and wheat industrial metals struggled amid the current growth worries with hg copper at one stage almost giving back the gains for the year precious metals meanwhile received a lukewarm bid despite support from falling stocks and lower bond yields gold s inability to move higher despite an overwhelmingly supportive backdrop remains a puzzle at this stage opposing forces had up until recently managed to keep crude oil stuck in a relatively tight range middle east tensions and the opec group of producers maintaining and potentially extending current production cuts have supported the flat price of oil this despite concerns about slowing demand growth as the negative impact on the global economy of the us china trade war continues to spread that was until this week when the latest escalation of the trade war triggered a rethink and fresh selling from macro orientated funds worried that the outlook beyond the current tightness could begin to deteriorate adding to this is the dollar which according to the us fed s trade weighted broad dollar basket has reached its highest level in 17 years the trigger that pushed many long positions towards the exit and promoted a 6 per cent two day sell off was a 16 8 million barrel weekly increase in us crude oil and product stock to the highest total since october 2017 the tightness caused by dramatic opec production cuts however has not gone away and this helps to explain why the flat price spread versus later traded futures month remains at its highest level in five years regarding the recent escalation of tensions in the middle east it is our belief that the risk of it leading to an armed conflict and a subsequent spike in crude oil prices is very unlikely with president trump often measuring his success on low gasoline prices and high stock market valuations a war with iran does not make any political sense with an election to be fought in 2020 however with the global economy showing further signs of cooling as the impact of the us china trade war begins to be felt outside of asia the risk is that slowing demand growth eventually will overtake the risk of lower supply the paris based oecd has downgraded further its projection for global growth this year while eric s rosengren the boston fed president warned that the trade war is increasing downside risks to the us economy while wti crude oil led the weakness the selling in brent picked up following the break below key moving averages before finding support at 67 b and bouncing ahead of the long weekend that will see the us and uk markets shut on monday may 27 having rallied almost non stop since late december it makes sense for the market to pause given the multiple opposing drivers currently in existence brent crude oil remains in an uptrend and this will only from a technical perspective be challenged on a break below 65 8 b gold traded close to unchanged following another bout of long liquidation from funds having bought into the recent failed breakout attempt above 1 300 oz stock market uncertainty and a renewed drop in bond yields provided some support but not enough to attract renewed investment demand from traders having seen the price whipsaw during the past few months the dollar remains a key drag with its continued strength against most of the major currencies not least the chinese renminbi where speculation is rife about whether the peoples bank of china will eventually allow it to weaken beyond 7 0 while the us fed has adopted a wait and see approach the policymakers may be overtaken by current events which is raising the risk of a bigger and sharper response in terms of cutting rates than what is currently expected on that basis we are not ruling out a potential and surprise 50 bps rate cut before september a move which could hurt the dollar while helping gold to break the current deadlock and move higher the correction from the february peak has lost momentum with a sideways trading pattern having taken over a weekly close below 1 275 oz would increase the risk of a downside extension to 1 253 oz while a break above 1 303 oz is needed to attract renewed demand by ole hansen

with market narrative though all four major u s indices eked out gains on friday on thin trade ahead of the memorial day weekend it wasn t enough to recoup losses incurred over the course of the week daily vacillations driven by wavering sentiment on the possibility of a trade war settlement ultimately pushed the and to yet another series of weekly declines as well as to the brink of an official downtrend in the medium term the run on treasurys came to a halt on friday the u s slipped for a second day as well as for the week the rebounded after prime minister theresa may announced she would

pattern stabilized trade war taking toll on global u s economies thursday s disappointing american confirmed for many the unavoidable impact of an escalating trade war to the u s economy not just the global consequences as was recently projected through among german businesses market structure continues to break down as small caps perform poorly even as the dollar grows stronger which shouldn t be the case a ramp up of the current trade war ought to have the opposite impact on domestic focused small caps not to mention the global reserve currency on the final day of this past week s trade the s

3 34 as compounded the negative outlook for demand amid a global trade war this was the index s third consecutive drop technically a fall below the 2 800 level would signal the start of a medium term downtrend we have been bearish on the market s medium term outlook since early december and despite a still booming economy that in june will earn a record for the longest positive recorded surpassing the robust expansion of the 1990s there s still a snag the u s just reached a record 13 straight years without real gdp growth reaching 3 at 3 6 is at a 50 year low nonetheless one has to ask is this sustainable given technology s exponential growth which will likely put more and more humans out of work on the other hand this is still the second most profitable bull market with a more than 400 return from the 2009 lows however does that make this an appropriate time to enter the market or exit it the s p 500 found support above the 2 800 level which hasn t been broken since march the 200 dma has flattened right below this level however it provided a downside breakout for a pennant since the beginning of the month bearish after the fall as is reflected in the beginning of the 200 dma s downward curve even after the 100 dma crossed above it lagging the rally which fell below its uptrend line in late april a fall below the 200 dma would complete a h s top registering a descending series of peaks and troughs establishing a medium term downtrend the completed pennant suggests the h s reversal would itself finish with a downside breakout of the neckline the trend line connecting the two previous lows from late march to mid may also the rsi provided a negative divergence when it fell below not only its level of the price lows making up the neckline but even below its mar 8 level in fact the rsi fell to its lowest point since the beginning of the year when the price was at the 2 400 level since momentum leads price the weakness in momentum adds to the weight of the evidence that prices will fall as well the dow jones industrial average recouped 0 37 on friday but dropped 0 69 for the week for a fifth straight week this is its longest decline since 2011 for a total decline of 3 67 technically the price pared losses after successfully testing the 200 dma on thursday a fall below the 2 5208 mar 11 low would complete a h s top the nasdaq gained just 0 11 on friday making it the laggard among major u s indices as u s tech companies wait for chinese retaliation after the u s s huawei ban the tech heavy index slipped 2 29 for the week underperforming on that measure as well this was the benchmark s third consecutive weekly decline it s now off by 6 46 the interim positive outlook on a trade deal saved it from being the worst performing benchmark during the overall selloff from a technical perspective the index closed right on top of the neckline of a h s top the 200 dma is just 1 5 below at 7 530 the small cap was the outperformer yet again on friday jumping 1 03 however it didn t fare as well for the entire week it dropped 1 41 during the period for the third straight week of losses down 6 19 it was the second worst performer just behind the nasdaq adding to a long string of market narrative and structural inconsistencies we pointed out repeatedly over the past months that the trade narrative isn t aligned with internal market structure if it were large caps and tech stocks would fall while small caps would rise when a trade deal appears to be slipping away since the current selloff has been directly attributed to this market theme the performance of small caps should be out of the park given their distance from tariff sensitivity or any disruption of global shipping additionally the muscular dollar should provide a boost small caps which are unaffected by unfavorable exchange rates for u s exporters the yield on treasurys fell to the lowest point since october 2017 closing below the 200 wma this is not a sign of

via economicprism the dawn of war is a time of simple clarity and purpose good guys vs bad guys cowboys vs indians confederates vs yankees coppers vs robbers it s a time when lines are drawn songs are sang and drums are beaten with gaiety and confidence indeed calls for a jolly little war are always greeted with merriment and optimism this also goes for the dawn of a trade war regardless of whether you re from scranton or suzhou the escalating trump vs xi standoff all seems so virtuous we re right they re wrong and vice versa here in the usa the perspective is crystal clear america s rightful bounty is within reach after several presidents that were light in the loafers there s finally a leader of the free world with the brass fortitude to reach out and grab it for his fellow countrymen and why not several decades of getting spanked by chinese grunt laborers have american workers longing for reprisal this ain t their granddaddy s economy they ve been repurposed from well paying manufacturing jobs to low level service workers the relentless progression has been demoralizing given a fair shake american workers just know they ll kick tail and take names yet as far as we can tell trump s fight is a day late and a dollar short the time to stand up for the american worker came and went while ray dalio was busy getting absurdly rich from the financialization of the economy what s more the means to stand up for the american worker had and still has little to do with slapping tariffs on chinese made doohickeys we ll have more on this in a moment but first some dawn of war merriment out of the middle kingdom trade war trade war china s 40 year economic boom has all the trappings of miraculous growth real wealth has been created living standards have improved and mega cities have sprouted up from the barren earth like garden weeds following a spring rain for perspective between 2011 and 2013 china used more cement than the u s did in the entire 20th century according to the international cement review an industry publication based in london between 1901 and 2000 the u s used 4 4 gigatons of cement whereas china used 6 6 gigatons of cement between 2011 and 2013 without question china deserves an award for its rapid disfiguration of the landscape yet there are other consequences too not only did all this mass splattering of cement rapidly disfigure china s landscape it also rapidly disfigured the national psyche hoots whoops and the state media s anti u s propaganda machine has brought forth new and creative additions to the culture this week as reported by zero hedge a song titled trade war went viral on the chinese social media platform wechat the song set to the tune of an anti japanese song from the 1960s begins with the rousing chorus trade war trade war not afraid of the outrageous challenge not afraid of the outrageous challenge a trade war is happening over the pacific ocean we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us the lyrics also include if the perpetrator wants to fight we will beat him out of his wits what sort of deceit could provoked such drivel workers of the world unite several decades of perpetual credit creation courtesy of the fed s artificially low interest rates have had countless unintended consequences for the global economy in short the economy s reconfigured itself in ways it otherwise wouldn t have one example is the offshoring of u s jobs to china and the massive trade imbalance between the two countries where did american consumers get the endless supply of credit to consume all the made in china goods where did the money that showed up in the paychecks of chinese workers come from if you follow the money back up the supply chain the culpability for its origination is the fed still it takes two to tango you see china could have rejected the fiat dollars they were being sent they were conjured from nothing why trade real goods and products fabricated with real raw materials for dubious abstractions and therein lies the second part of the deceit for the scam to work the chinese government had to go along with it and as far as we can tell they went along with it for several reasons 1 the money was too good and 2 it gave the chinese populace a purpose in life but as china reaped more and more of the fed s fake money beijing had to debase the chinese yuan at greater and greater rates to keep their cheap labor advantage over u s workers year after year decade after decade the u s heartland was hollowed out and deindustrialized and its prior vitality was reconstructed in china all the while the excess credit was used to financialize american businesses where rather than borrowing money for capital expenditures corporations borrowed money to boost share prices wall street was rewarded for their part in the money shuffling as the cheap credit that pumped up financial assets was the same cheap credit that pumped up china s economy main street on the other hand was rewarded with stagnant wages and exploding debts the real dirty dead which allowed the giant fiasco in the first place occurred on august 15 1971 that s when nixon defaulted on the bretton woods system and terminated the agreement that allowed other nations to redeem their paper dollars acquired through trade for gold since then debts and deficits have gone completely haywire when it comes down to it the gripes of the american worker and the chinese worker and all workers of the world should be united not against capitalism as promoted by marx but against the curse of fake money and the governments that perpetuate it of course recognition of this fact would require honest thought and contemplation and why bother when you can mindlessly bang the drums and chant the songs of jolly trade war merriment sincerely mn gordon for economic prism

menafn jordan times the shrinking palestinian economy as a result of the major absence of liquidity requires the newly appointed palestinian prime minister mohammad shtayyeh to carry out serious austerity measures the absence within a short period of time of hundreds of millions of dollars from usaid projects followed by the refusal of the palestinian government to receive it s low tax remittances collected by israel at border crossings require major economic surgery the politics behind the american and israeli decisions is quite obvious the americans want to squeeze palestinians so that they will accept or at least not oppose a political deal that they have been working on for two years the israeli decisions are much less grandeur the decision made in the heat of the israeli election campaign to reduce part of the monthly taxes collected by israel on behalf of palestinians was aimed at showing how israel takes a tough stand against palestinians who dare raise arms against it and against a palestinian government that is willing to support the families of these prisoners israel and the us are searching for ways to engage palestinians and to reduce the tensions that are arising daily as a result of the major reduction in the palestinian economy an israeli general described the israeli actions during the first years of the siege on gaza as an attempt to force palestinians on a diet and not to get them to die of hunger the proud palestinian leadership is refusing to make any movement on the political stage and therefore the only option that is left for it is to explain its position to its people with the hope that they understand in the meantime the palestinian government if it is serious about not wanting to raise taxes has little choice but to implement some deep cuts in its own spending budget shtayyeh articulated this issue in the first session of his cabinet which he came to walking rather than in a motorcade by announcing a moratorium on buying new cars and flying first class a further decision to end all medical referrals to israel was also made much more is needed if the austerity plan will come close to addressing the big gap between revenues and expenses the first cuts that are required now should be in the palestinian security why does a state under a belligerent occupation need to keep so many people within the security forces with the decisions of the palestinian national council to end the security coordination with israel and with the israelis rubbing their thumbs in the palestinian nose why would palestinian president mahmoud abbas and his government want to have a security budget that is greater than that of the health and education it is true that the security forces have not been expanded only to protect israel but also to protect the ruling powers in palestine but if the political decisions that are being made reflect palestinian sentiment then there is no need for a huge force to protect a popular government and leadership that are in touch with their own people and their aspiration the newly appointed palestinian government must also do a lot to further amend its relations with its people the idea of taking revenge on political enemies such as the blocking of salaries to civil servants in gaza as a means to pressure hamas must stop also the policy of punishing political opponents cannot be allowed to continue if the palestinian government wants the public to support it as we go through the difficult months ahead this logic also requires that all politically motivated arrests and detentions must come to a stop no palestinian should be jailed for expressing an opinion no matter what that opinion is at the same time friends of palestine whether in the arab region or throughout the world need to step up and help support the legitimate palestinian government which is simply attaching itself to international law and order the world should not sit idly by as the us and israel continue to flaunt international law and then punish palestinians for their stubborn attachment to international law if the world community feels that the palestinian position is wrong it will need to change international law not be silent partners to the americans and israelis who are punishing palestinians simply because they insist that occupation needs to end and settlements are illegal mahmoud abbas and mohammad shtayyeh have a long and difficult month ahead as they prepare to deal with what looks like a disastrous us vision that violates international law and international practices to be able to weather this storm palestinian officials need to revise their policies in such a way so that they are in total sync with their people and their aspiration palestinians are willing to share their government by paying the price for being steadfast to their rights but to do that the palestinian government must be transparent and accountable reflecting the will of the people and not the will of a small group that is in leadership positions

care she pointed to a recent gallup poll that found only 54 percent of working americans believe that they will have enough money to live comfortably in their retirement years for most older mainers she said social security makes up at least 90 percent of their income i ve heard from so many maine seniors who say they are barely getting by collins said in a recent phone interview we have a looming crisis now and more of our seniors are going to end up retiring into poverty or outliving their savings the elder index nearly 75 000 senior households or about 110 000 older mainers who live independently are financially insecure according to the elder economic security standard index advertisement that means at the end of each month they have little or no money left for necessary home repairs dinner at a restaurant a weekend trip to visit grandchildren or larger looming costs such as assisted living or long term care the elder index was developed by demographics experts at the university of massachusetts boston to provide a more complete picture of financial insecurity than federal poverty measures set by the u s department of health and human services maine s overall senior poverty rate is 8 1 percent below the 9 3 percent national average but that number doesn t reflect households that are slightly above poverty level but unable to cover their basic expenses applying elder index standards to maine 57 percent of single seniors and 30 percent of two senior households are economically insecure resulting in national rankings of 11th place and 7th place respectively across the united states 53 percent of single seniors and 26 percent of two senior households have annual incomes below the index such stark numbers spotlight mounting problems related to the rising demand and cost of health care accessible housing rural transportation long term care and other things older people need especially in the united states where the senior population is burgeoning as it is in many industrialized nations for so long the discussion around senior finances was that older people are all set they have social security they have medicare but it isn t enough now and it won t be in the future said jan mutchler a demographics expert who worked on the elder index advertisement without any extras rena heath s 1 500 monthly pension adds up to 18 000 per year that s almost 6 000 above the federal poverty level which is 12 140 for a single person but it falls nearly 5 000 short of the 22 848 annual income that the elder index says she needs to cover basic expenses without any extras like the coffee she sips while reading a book in a sunny window at slates bakery in downtown hallowell she reads a lot she hasn t had a tv for a while single with no children heath pays nearly 500 to rent her apartment in subsidized senior housing that leaves about 1 000 for other monthly expenses including food clothing prescription co pays any unexpected bills and occasional taxi rides because she no longer drives and can t always count on friends to get where she needs to go heath has a little savings about 5 000 she put away near the end of her career but she knows that won t last long if she has a major emergency or needs some form of long term care last year heath s monthly pension increased by 39 but her rent went up 18 and other expenses followed suit she said two years ago a change in health coverage for state retirees added 600 in deductible medical costs to her annual expenses she said i realize to people who have a lot of money that s not much heath said but when you don t have much that s a lot seniors who fall below the elder index might own their homes though many don t and they might be active in their communities like heath who regularly attends senior luncheons and state house hearings on elder issues but often they can t afford any extras and must make tough choices between paying for prescriptions buying personal care items subscribing to basic cable television or putting gas in the car advertisement in maine single older renters like heath need a yearly income of 22 848 to cover the basics while two senior rental households need 33 624 according to the elder index the national average is 23 364 for single seniors and 33 876 for two senior households federal poverty income level is 12 140 for a single person and 16 460 for a two person household for older mainers who own mortgage free homes the elder index is 20 064 for singles and 30 576 for two senior households for older mainers with a mortgage the elder index is 30 972 for singles and 41 484 for two senior households published in september 2016 the elder index is expected to be updated this year using 2018 data reflecting 5 percent cost increases said mutchler the demographics expert the elder index doesn t allow for vacations restaurant meals large purchases gifts or entertainment of any kind it also doesn t allow for increasing savings that s a significant challenge facing many seniors across the united states and in maine where the typical working household has just 3 000 in retirement savings and the average social security income is 16 000 according to elder advocates thanks to social security fewer seniors are living in poverty said lori parham state director of aarp maine but costs are rising and people are living longer and many retirees have very little savings we re expecting to see an increase in senior poverty because social security benefits aren t going to keep up no retirement savings philip christy started working full time when he dropped out of portland high school as a junior and took a job as a bundle boy at shaw s supermarket he went on to work as a longshoreman truck driver grocery manager and baker he even put in several years with the maine army national guard advertisement i always worked said christy 86 a widower who lives in scarborough matter of fact i worked two jobs for a while with four kids and trying to make a house payment disabled by a serious heart attack at age 59 christy gets by today on his monthly 1 460 social security check which is quickly consumed by a mortgage payment utilities taxes repairs to his modest cape and his 2005 automobile and other expenses to cover those basic needs the elder index shows he needs a monthly income of 2 372 or 30 972 per year to stretch his annual 17 520 social security benefit christy said he visits the town s food pantry for staples such as canned goods cereal eggs and cheese he s a regular at local senior lunches where payment is optional and he goes on occasional day trips for seniors if they don t cost too much he enjoys discount coffee at mcdonald s every morning with friends and he gets free and reduced phone services through programs for seniors medicare covers his growing medical needs but he has no retirement savings when he was working his paychecks usually weren t large enough to put much away and every place i worked i never got any retirement benefits christy said pending federal bills advertisement not much has changed since christy was driving trucks or baking bread nearly half of maine s private sector employees about 254 000 mainers don t have access to a retirement savings plan at work according to the national institute on retirement security and access is a key factor people earning 30 000 to 50 000 per year are 16 times more likely to save for retirement if a workplace plan is available the employee benefit research institute found moreover maine could save as much as 23 million on public assistance programs over the next 15 years if lower income workers could save enough to increase retirement income by just 1 000 per year according to the aarp public policy institute sen collins introduced two federal bills this year that would help people avoid christy s situation one is the retirement security act of 2019 which would make it easier and more affordable for smaller businesses to join so called multiple employer plans it also would allow employees to receive an employer match for contributions up to 10 percent of their salary and would give businesses with fewer than 100 employees a tax credit to offset their increased contributions the second bill would upgrade simple retirement plans which were established in 1996 to be less costly and easier to manage than 401 k plans for businesses with 100 or fewer employees the bill would increase annual contribution limits for employees allowing them to save more on a tax deferred basis collins said she s also working to increase funding for programs that help keep seniors in their homes including safety and technology upgrades and she noted the need to increase medicaid funding for home care and long term care but she acknowledged that none of these efforts will help boost retirement savings for current seniors or increase wages for low income workers who otherwise still won t be able to save much for retirement she also acknowledged the growing need for accessible senior housing and the lack of transportation for seniors in rural maine advertisement it s a real problem collins said the demographics are overwhelming now and the needs are only going to skyrocket long term care need with no savings and limited income philip christy knows his options and relative independence would soon evaporate if he became further disabled by illness and required some form of long term care we did my funeral arrangements me and my daughter but we haven t thought about long term care christy said moving in with one of his kids isn t an option i wouldn t want to burden them he said i d go into a home but finding long term care is becoming more challenging in maine where seven nursing homes closed in the last 15 months largely because long term care facilities are increasingly dependent on medicaid funding that s already falling short advertisement today there are 93 nursing facilities statewide down from 132 in 1995 said richard erb head of the maine health care association which also represents 127 assisted living facilities the latest nursing home closures were mountain heights in patten sunrise in jonesport ledgeview in west paris freeport nursing in freeport bridgton health in bridgton fryeburg health in fryeburg and sonogee in bar harbor all of the homes that closed were relatively small and relied heavily on the mainecare program for their livelihood erb said noting that two thirds of nursing home residents in maine are covered by medicaid and while the maine legislature recently increased medicaid reimbursement rates to nursing homes they continue to experience dramatic increases in labor costs erb said as a result medicaid reimbursements to maine nursing homes fell short by 33 3 million in 2017 7 5 million more than the medicaid shortfall in 2016 erb worries that maine won t have enough nursing homes as its senior population blossoms in the coming years maine currently has 24 nursing home beds for every 1 000 people age 65 and older compared with 36 beds per 1 000 seniors nationwide according to the centers for medicare and medicaid services and while long term care insurance can help seniors pay for assisted living nursing home and home care less than 10 percent of older mainers have purchased the coverage erb said the biggest challenge facing maine nursing homes and assisted living facilities is the rising minimum wage amid a nationwide workforce shortage erb said the combination is making it difficult to hire and retain certified nursing assistants and personal support specialists who make up a significant portion of long term care workers several state proposals this spring would again increase and streamline medicaid funding for long term care advertisement increasing wages is a good thing erb said we just have to figure out how to pay for it our facilities are competing with other segments of the labor market and there are many easier ways to make a living than working in long term care challenges to come paul armstrong embodies the breadth of challenges facing older mainers and he s not yet 65 armstrong was working construction in 2004 when he fell 32 feet and landed on his heels he said crippling compression fractures left him with excruciating chronic pain arthritis degenerative disc disease and other serious health problems now 59 the former restaurant owner can walk only short distances and stand for short periods armstrong receives a 1 250 social security disability payment each month or 15 000 per year based on the elder index he needs an annual income of 20 568 to cover basic expenses instead his health care is mostly covered by medicare and mainecare he also receives 193 per month in food stamps and 900 a year in fuel assistance which buys a tank and a half of propane to run his refrigerator space heaters and other appliances in his off the grid home advertisement increasingly however the hillside house he built in rural palermo in the early 1990s a wood wind and solar powered refuge with views across the kennebec river valley is becoming a burden to maintain and a source of unrelenting worry his fear is magnified at the end of each month when he finds himself broke after paying regular bills such as property taxes insurance car repairs and credit card debt that mounted after his divorce he hires help to stack wood and do other chores when he can afford it but the idea of leaving the home he loves and moving into an apartment depresses him he knows there are long waiting lists for subsidized housing that s accessible to disabled seniors and that ongoing efforts to promote senior housing development wouldn t benefit him for a while i m scared about the future armstrong confessed i ve got nothing put away and i ve got no one to take care of me i love this place but it s getting to be too much for me now i ve been considering moving for a while but i don t know where i would go send questions comments to the editors filed under
today we present a guest post written by jeffrey frankel harpel professor at harvard s kennedy school of government and formerly a member of the white house council of economic advisers a shorter version appeared in project syndicate on may 23rd donald trump on may 5 suddenly revealed that a trade agreement with china was not imminent after all to the contrary the administration on may 10 raised its earlier 10 percent tariff on 200 billion of chinese goods to 25 and threatened to extend 25 tariffs to the remainder of imports from china by late june roughly 300 billion of goods china of course retaliated against us exports indeed to the extent there may have been truth to the allegation that the chinese government was subsidizing such products as solar panels the tariffs imposed since january 2018 are now preventing the chinese government from subsidizing the us it is true that in theory chinese exporters might have experienced a sufficiently large loss in demand as a result of all these tariffs that they would have been forced to lower their prices students in econ 101 learn about the incidence of a tax i e who ultimately pays the cost but two new studies by eminent economists examine the 2018 data and find that 1 the chinese have not in fact lowered their prices and as a result 2 the full cost of the price increase has been passed through to american households so one doesn t even need econ 101 simple common sense gives the right answer in this case if trump goes ahead with his threat to extend the tariff to all imports from china the cost for a typical american household will be 300 800 billion a year in one estimate or as much as 2 200 in another estimate the cost to consumers doesn t count the cost of lost exports on the part of us firms workers and farmers the exports are lost through chinese retaliation as well as other channels including appreciation of the dollar against the renminbi in at least one respect trump s trade policies are actually hurting the us budget china has retaliated particularly against soybeans and other american farm products the trump administration sensitive to the electoral importance of the farm states is attempting to compensate farmers with billions of dollars in federal subsidies much of it going to large wealthy farmers it s yet another assault on the american taxpayer does one need to understand comparative advantage economists have long noted whether ruefully or pridefully that the public can t be expected to understand the principle of the gains from trade without having been taught david ricardo s principle of comparative advantage paul samuelson famously identified the principle as both universally true and yet not obvious but one does not in fact need to assimilate the principle of comparative advantage to understand the basic idea of mutual gains from trade if both the buyer and the seller voluntarily agree to the exchange then both gain this assumes that they are each good judges of what they want better at least than is the government this assumption is usually correct with a few exceptions such as purchases of opium the theory of comparative advantage makes useful predictions as to which country will choose to export which good but it is not really essential for understanding the basic presumption that both sides gain from voluntary trade again common sense gives the right answer to say that both countries gain from trade overall is not to claim that every resident of each country gains of course an increase in trade gives rise to both winners and losers within each country so does any major change tariffs create both winners and losers as well but the winners tend to outnumber the losers when trade is liberalized whereas the losers tend to outnumber the winners when tariffs are raised tariffs without winners donald trump appears to have engineered a spectacular example of this generalization his trade war has hurt almost every segment of the american economy with very few winners the losers include not just consumers but also firms and the workers they employ whether they are farmers who are losing their export markets or manufacturers who are forced to pay higher input costs even the us auto industry which did not ask for this protection is worse off over all having to pay more for steel and auto parts trump has come close to accomplishing something that one might have thought impossible tariffs that benefit almost noone we may have to re think the theory of political economy that says protectionism is usually the outcome of special interests that wield disproportionate power it is not enough to go back 30 years to the japan bashers of the 1980s we may have to go back 300 years to the mercantilists who preceded adam smith 1776 and the enlightenment the mercantilists disliked trade because it favored free individuals over the power of the state this post written by jeffrey frankel
as may winds down the light economic calendar will allow investors to take their cues from the evolution of three disruptive forces trade brexit and the us economy with actions against huawei and possibly a handful of chinese surveillance equipment producers the us raised the stakes the retaliatory tariffs are effective on june 1 but beijing has not formally responded to the moves against chinese companies the trump administration seems to believe that the pressure from the tariffs and other actions will get china to capitulate to us demands officials were still playing up the likelihood that the two presidents meet on the sidelines of the g20 meeting in japan at the end of next month there is a relatively benign consensus narrative that the tariffs are a tactic and like at the end of last year a meeting between trump and xi will jump start talks again however there is nothing for china to gain at this juncture by talks the us tariffs have already been lifted on 200 bln of its imports to 25 the process has already begun to slap a 25 levy on the remaining chinese goods that have escaped a penalty tax thus far including popular consumer products like cell phones tablets and computers say what you want about chinese trade practices and no one seriously defends them but the us red lines cannot be the basis of serious negotiations trump has indicated that the us will not accept a mutually beneficial deal because it needs to be compensated for past wrongs and he has explicitly stated that he will not allow china to become the largest superpower many observers seem to think that because china sometimes speaks in communist ideological terms it is monolithic it is not the us demands cannot do anything but strengthen the hardline hawkish camp within china s ruling circles a meeting at the g20 meeting plays into trump s hands it could look as if china capitulated trump had demonstrated a flair for the dramatic as he showed when he walked away from north korean talks and also again this past week when he walked away from the domestic bipartisan talks for an infrastructure initiative the g20 venue and the spontaneity would be to trump s advantage chinese officials prefer a more scripted event xi and vice premier liu visited a rare earth facility at the start of the week intended or not it was understood as a small reminder of vulnerabilities and asymmetries that china can exploit that are not captured in the macro data that us policymakers rely on to think that they can dominate the tariff escalation ladder while the trump administration is stretching national security to justify steel and aluminum tariffs and threaten protection for the auto sector the rare earths are truly essential for defense as well as modern technologically advanced goods including electric hybrid cars windmills computer memories cell phones rechargeable batteries and even some medicines last year the us imported about 4100 tonnes of rare earths from china at the cost of about 175 mln which is hardly even a rounding error for the bean counters who understand prices but not values most of the rare earths are embedded in the products it imports us dependence on china for rare earths is well documented reports suggest that china will impose limits on rare earth exports to the us as a way to express its displeasure there is precedent from nine years ago when in a dispute with japan china cut its access to rare earths given the complex supply chains and distribution channels it is difficult for china to play this card directly just like it is not very easy to weaponize the yuan or china s treasury holdings weaponizing rare earths could have broad impact not the kind of laser focus that the prc seems to prefer this is not to say china can t or won t the argument here is less bold the cost of doing so is high and therefore likely at a higher rung in the escalation ladder in china s command economy a quota is set for rare earth production the most recent one for h1 19 was set mid march the mining quota was set at 60k tonnes in h1 19 which is down nearly 18 5 from a year ago the smelting and refining quota was cut by almost 18 to 57 5k tonnes the decline partly reflects the high quotas from the first part of last year which were later balanced with lower quota in the second half the 2018 quotas for the entire year worked out to be 120k tonnes of mining and 115k tonnes of processing the quotas for the second half are expected to be announced by the end of june a date for the trade talks to resume has not been set the rhetoric remains bellicose reference in chinese state media about another long march and the importance of self reliance are meant to pull on the nationalist strings the trajectory of developments since the end of the tariff truce does not appear to have run its course yet it might not be until later in the year maybe q4 that may be the crunch time domestically the treasury s ability to maneuver around the debt ceiling will be exhausted if not addressed and the acrimony between the president and the democrats is as intense as ever making the necessary bipartisanship challenging to envision the 180 day grace period on auto imports will be exhausted the 25 tariff on imported chinese goods will begin being felt by american consumers even if households purchase more services than goods separately but not wholly unrelated is the accumulation of evidence that the us economy is slowing markedly here in q2 china s economy also appears to have lost momentum recently april industrial output and retail sales were weaker than expected and the may pmi that will be released next week is expected to show further slowing and pick up the first sentiment readings since the end of the tariff truce most observers had recognized that 3 q1 us was not sustainable and in particular the contribution of trade and inventories would not be repeated a weak flash markit pmi and disappointing durable goods orders even after the boeing effect is taken into account the atlanta and ny fed s gdp tracker is pointing to growth 1 3 1 4 respectively the january fed funds futures contract implies an effective average rate of 2 07 compared with 2 38 presently that could be consistent with 25 bp cut in the target range to 2 00 2 25 and a 30 bp cut in the interest paid on reserves currently 2 35 the federal reserve has done nothing to encourage these views the softness of core inflation is seen as temporary the minutes from the last meeting and comments from several fed officials including the leadership seemed to underscore that it remains comfortable with the patient wait and see attitude it did not talk about rate hikes when q1 gdp overshot expectations and it does not appear particularly concerned about some of the recent high frequency data some reporters try to play up the differences among the fed officials but there have been no dissents the president s criticism of the fed including the calls for dramatic rate cuts and a resumption of its asset purchase program has if anything encouraged the officials to close ranks this seems more the story than the different ways officials respond to different questions the tax cuts on corporate profits and household income have been succeeded by tax increases on imports reports and anecdotes suggest the result has been higher prices for many of the goods that have been hit with the tax even if when a 25 tariff on the remainder of china s exports to the us hits the impact on measured inflation is likely to be modest the price of goods that reach the us shores is a fraction of what the consumer pays the product is stored shipped insured marketed and every person along the way needs to be fed profits margins may be squeezed in some areas the price increases may not be sufficient to boost measured inflation very much but it may be enough to reduce demand on the margins at least until alternatives can be found or developed to say the same thing in a slightly different way the impact of the tax increase on imports will likely be more a headwind to growth and an accelerant of inflation a third issue that has vied for attention is brexit a new chapter in the history of the uk s relations to europe is about to begin after nearly three years since the referendum the uk has still not decided how it should leave the eu the government spent 18 months negotiating with the ec and produced a withdrawal agreement that did the seemingly impossible by uniting parliament in opposition to it unable to go forward with a divided party may has reluctantly agreed to step down investors have been anticipating this and recognize that her successor will most likely be someone who wants to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement which the ec rejects and leave the eu in any event at the end of october this increases the risk of an exit without an agreement and sterling has shed nearly six cents since the beginning of the month sterling snapped a record 14 day losing streak against the euro with a small 0 25 gain ahead of the weekend it will likely take the tories several weeks to sort things out even when it does the sailing will be anything but smooth perhaps no one can square the circle a sharp break with the eu and still honor the good friday agreement after losing its parliament majority the tories are able to govern through an agreement with the democrat union party from northern ireland a new tory leader and prime minister would have to re negotiate a pact with the dup if this is not possible new elections would likely result another moving piece in all this is that there will be a new configuration of the european commission it will arise out of the election for the european parliament whose results will be known before the markets open in asia on monday it will take some time to get a sense of the distribution of posts and assignments there are also other positions like draghi s replacement at the ecb that will part of the great horse trade of european politics the point is that by the end of october when the uk ostensibly leaves the eu seven months after the initial intention there will be a new european commission and a new ecb president

oil markets are once again uneasily balanced between two completely different outcomes and one again involves iran back in the summer of 2008 markets were dominated by the potential for an israeli attack on iranian nuclear facilities as i summarised at the time nothing is certain in life except death and taxes but it is hard to see markets becoming less volatile until either an attack takes place or a peaceful solution is confirmed and with oil now around 150 bbl two quite different outcomes seem possible in the event of an israeli attack prices might well rise 50 bbl to reach 200 bbl at least temporarily but if diplomacy works they could easily fall 50 bbl to 100 bbl in the event an attack was never launched and prices quickly fell back to 100 bbl and then lower as the financial crisis began today brent s uneasy balance around 70 bbl reflects even more complex fears one set of worries focuses on potential supply disruption from a war in the middle east the other agonises over the us china trade war and the rising risk of recession it is of course possible that both fears could be realised if war did break out in the gulf and oil prices then rose above 100 bbl the issue is highlighted in the reuters chart on the left which shows that brent has moved from a contango of 1 bbl at the beginning of the year into a backwardation of nearly 4 bbl on the 6 month calendar spread as they note backwardation is associated with periods of under supply and falling inventories while contango is associated with the opposite so the current backwardation implies stocks are expected to fall sharply but as the second reuters chart confirms traders are also aware that forecasts for oil demand are based on optimistic imf forecasts for global growth and recent hedge fund positioning confirms that caution may be starting to appear traders are also aware of the key message from the above chart which shows that periods when oil prices cost 3 of global gdp have almost always led to recession the only exception was after the financial crisis when central banks were printing as much money as possible to boost liquidity the reason is that consumers only have a certain amount of discretionary income if oil prices are low then they have spare cash to buy the products and services that create economic growth but if prices are high their cash is instead spent on transport and heating cooling costs and so the economy slows to govern is to choose and president trump therefore has some hard choices ahead his trade war with china currently appeals to many voters democrat and republican but will that support continue as the costs bite the new york federal reserve reported on friday that the latest round of tariffs will cost the average american household 831 year similarly many voters favour taking a hard line with iran but average us gasoline prices are already 2 94 gal as the us driving season starts this weekend and today s high prices will particularly impact the president s core blue collar and rural voters history doesn t repeat but it often rhymes as the famous american writer mark twain noted if the president now chooses to fight a trade war with china and a real war with iran then he risks losing popularity very quickly as the costs in terms of lives and cash become more apparent yet as we have seen since lyndon johnson s time this is usually something that politicians only learn after the event investors and companies therefore have little to lose and potentially much to gain by accepting that we can only guess at how the two situations may play out developing a scenario approach that plans for all the possible outcomes as in 2008 is much the most prudent option

rena heath learned the value of hard work growing up on a potato farm in northern maine she raised livestock and canned vegetables for 4 h competitions and earned money baby sitting she started her teaching career in the 1960s and retired in 2004 as a receptionist at the maine attorney general s office a job she enjoyed for 23 years now at age 82 heath is among a growing number of older mainers with limited incomes and little or no retirement savings who are increasingly dependent on taxpayer funded programs and charity for everyday expenses and eventual long term care with mounting health problems and dwindling financial resources heath finds herself struggling to make ends meet on her monthly 1 500 state pension her budget is so tight she said one friend pays for her cellphone line and another friend has promised to cover her funeral expenses the hallowell resident recently faced the hard reality of her financial straits when she started checking out future long term care options she called a few assisted living facilities to find out if they accepted residents who would be dependent on medicaid known as mainecare here some i called don t want charity cases heath said there aren t many places that do advertisement like heath about 40 percent of all maine seniors who live independently are financially insecure according to a national index they cannot afford basic expenses food housing transportation health care or even cleaning supplies without relying on benefit programs loans or gifts more than half of single mainers age 65 and older and about a third of two senior households are considered financially insecure maine ranks 7th in the nation for the rate of two senior households that struggle to afford basic expenses and 11th in the nation for the rate of single seniors who are considered economically insecure the number of struggling maine elders is only expected to grow as the state s senior population continues to swell maine has the highest median age in the nation 44 6 years and ranks a whisper close second to florida for population age 65 or older 20 percent maine s senior population is projected to increase 42 percent in less than 20 years from 266 241 people today to more than 379 731 in 2036 according to the state economist s office the statistics put maine on the front lines of a national retirement crisis that anticipates a 1 trillion to 14 trillion funding gap between the pensions and retirement savings that americans have today and what economists say they will need to maintain their standard of living after retirement pressure is mounting on government and community agencies that step in when seniors can t provide for themselves the cost of public assistance to maine s retired population from food stamps to long term care is expected to increase from 35 million this year to 273 million in 2032 according to a university of maine report by philip trostel nationwide the cost is expected to increase from 7 6 billion to 65 billion in the same period advertisement which is why u s sen susan collins is pushing two bills in congress that would help mainers save for retirement and encourage employers to offer work based retirement savings plans collins a republican who heads the senate aging committee spoke to the issue recently on the senate floor she noted that some recent retirees lost or spent their retirement savings during the 2008 recession many carry more debt than past generations and because people are living longer health care costs are rising along with the need for expensive long term care she pointed to a recent gallup poll that found only 54 percent of working americans believe that they will have enough money to live comfortably in their retirement years for most older mainers she said social security makes up at least 90 percent of their income i ve heard from so many maine seniors who say they are barely getting by collins said in a recent phone interview we have a looming crisis now and more of our seniors are going to end up retiring into poverty or outliving their savings the elder index nearly 75 000 senior households or about 110 000 older mainers who live independently are financially insecure according to the elder economic security standard index advertisement that means at the end of each month they have little or no money left for necessary home repairs dinner at a restaurant a weekend trip to visit grandchildren or larger looming costs such as assisted living or long term care the elder index was developed by demographics experts at the university of massachusetts boston to provide a more complete picture of financial insecurity than federal poverty measures set by the u s department of health and human services maine s overall senior poverty rate is 8 1 percent below the 9 3 percent national average but that number doesn t reflect households that are slightly above poverty level but unable to cover their basic expenses applying elder index standards to maine 57 percent of single seniors and 30 percent of two senior households are economically insecure resulting in national rankings of 11th place and 7th place respectively across the united states 53 percent of single seniors and 26 percent of two senior households have annual incomes below the index such stark numbers spotlight mounting problems related to the rising demand and cost of health care accessible housing rural transportation long term care and other things older people need especially in the united states where the senior population is burgeoning as it is in many industrialized nations for so long the discussion around senior finances was that older people are all set they have social security they have medicare but it isn t enough now and it won t be in the future said jan mutchler a demographics expert who worked on the elder index advertisement without any extras rena heath s 1 500 monthly pension adds up to 18 000 per year that s almost 6 000 above the federal poverty level which is 12 140 for a single person but it falls nearly 5 000 short of the 22 848 annual income that the elder index says she needs to cover basic expenses without any extras like the coffee she sips while reading a book in a sunny window at slates bakery in downtown hallowell she reads a lot she hasn t had a tv for a while single with no children heath pays nearly 500 to rent her apartment in subsidized senior housing that leaves about 1 000 for other monthly expenses including food clothing prescription co pays any unexpected bills and occasional taxi rides because she no longer drives and can t always count on friends to get where she needs to go heath has a little savings about 5 000 she put away near the end of her career but she knows that won t last long if she has a major emergency or needs some form of long term care last year heath s monthly pension increased by 39 but her rent went up 18 and other expenses followed suit she said two years ago a change in health coverage for state retirees added 600 in deductible medical costs to her annual expenses she said i realize to people who have a lot of money that s not much heath said but when you don t have much that s a lot seniors who fall below the elder index might own their homes though many don t and they might be active in their communities like heath who regularly attends senior luncheons and state house hearings on elder issues but often they can t afford any extras and must make tough choices between paying for prescriptions buying personal care items subscribing to basic cable television or putting gas in the car advertisement in maine single older renters like heath need a yearly income of 22 848 to cover the basics while two senior rental households need 33 624 according to the elder index the national average is 23 364 for single seniors and 33 876 for two senior households federal poverty income level is 12 140 for a single person and 16 460 for a two person household for older mainers who own mortgage free homes the elder index is 20 064 for singles and 30 576 for two senior households for older mainers with a mortgage the elder index is 30 972 for singles and 41 484 for two senior households published in september 2016 the elder index is expected to be updated this year using 2018 data reflecting 5 percent cost increases said mutchler the demographics expert the elder index doesn t allow for vacations restaurant meals large purchases gifts or entertainment of any kind it also doesn t allow for increasing savings that s a significant challenge facing many seniors across the united states and in maine where the typical working household has just 3 000 in retirement savings and the average social security income is 16 000 according to elder advocates thanks to social security fewer seniors are living in poverty said lori parham state director of aarp maine but costs are rising and people are living longer and many retirees have very little savings we re expecting to see an increase in senior poverty because social security benefits aren t going to keep up no retirement savings philip christy started working full time when he dropped out of portland high school as a junior and took a job as a bundle boy at shaw s supermarket he went on to work as a longshoreman truck driver grocery manager and baker he even put in several years with the maine army national guard advertisement i always worked said christy 86 a widower who lives in scarborough matter of fact i worked two jobs for a while with four kids and trying to make a house payment disabled by a serious heart attack at age 59 christy gets by today on his monthly 1 460 social security check which is quickly consumed by a mortgage payment utilities taxes repairs to his modest cape and his 2005 automobile and other expenses to cover those basic needs the elder index shows he needs a monthly income of 2 372 or 30 972 per year to stretch his annual 17 520 social security benefit christy said he visits the town s food pantry for staples such as canned goods cereal eggs and cheese he s a regular at local senior lunches where payment is optional and he goes on occasional day trips for seniors if they don t cost too much he enjoys discount coffee at mcdonald s every morning with friends and he gets free and reduced phone services through programs for seniors medicare covers his growing medical needs but he has no retirement savings when he was working his paychecks usually weren t large enough to put much away and every place i worked i never got any retirement benefits christy said pending federal bills advertisement not much has changed since christy was driving trucks or baking bread nearly half of maine s private sector employees about 254 000 mainers don t have access to a retirement savings plan at work according to the national institute on retirement security and access is a key factor people earning 30 000 to 50 000 per year are 16 times more likely to save for retirement if a workplace plan is available the employee benefit research institute found moreover maine could save as much as 23 million on public assistance programs over the next 15 years if lower income workers could save enough to increase retirement income by just 1 000 per year according to the aarp public policy institute sen collins introduced two federal bills this year that would help people avoid christy s situation one is the retirement security act of 2019 which would make it easier and more affordable for smaller businesses to join so called multiple employer plans it also would allow employees to receive an employer match for contributions up to 10 percent of their salary and would give businesses with fewer than 100 employees a tax credit to offset their increased contributions the second bill would upgrade simple retirement plans which were established in 1996 to be less costly and easier to manage than 401 k plans for businesses with 100 or fewer employees the bill would increase annual contribution limits for employees allowing them to save more on a tax deferred basis collins said she s also working to increase funding for programs that help keep seniors in their homes including safety and technology upgrades and she noted the need to increase medicaid funding for home care and long term care but she acknowledged that none of these efforts will help boost retirement savings for current seniors or increase wages for low income workers who otherwise still won t be able to save much for retirement she also acknowledged the growing need for accessible senior housing and the lack of transportation for seniors in rural maine advertisement it s a real problem collins said the demographics are overwhelming now and the needs are only going to skyrocket long term care need with no savings and limited income philip christy knows his options and relative independence would soon evaporate if he became further disabled by illness and required some form of long term care we did my funeral arrangements me and my daughter but we haven t thought about long term care christy said moving in with one of his kids isn t an option i wouldn t want to burden them he said i d go into a home but finding long term care is becoming more challenging in maine where seven nursing homes closed in the last 15 months largely because long term care facilities are increasingly dependent on medicaid funding that s already falling short advertisement today there are 93 nursing facilities statewide down from 132 in 1995 said richard erb head of the maine health care association which also represents 127 assisted living facilities the latest nursing home closures were mountain heights in patten sunrise in jonesport ledgeview in west paris freeport nursing in freeport bridgton health in bridgton fryeburg health in fryeburg and sonogee in bar harbor all of the homes that closed were relatively small and relied heavily on the mainecare program for their livelihood erb said noting that two thirds of nursing home residents in maine are covered by medicaid and while the maine legislature recently increased medicaid reimbursement rates to nursing homes they continue to experience dramatic increases in labor costs erb said as a result medicaid reimbursements to maine nursing homes fell short by 33 3 million in 2017 7 5 million more than the medicaid shortfall in 2016 erb worries that maine won t have enough nursing homes as its senior population blossoms in the coming years maine currently has 24 nursing home beds for every 1 000 people age 65 and older compared with 36 beds per 1 000 seniors nationwide according to the centers for medicare and medicaid services and while long term care insurance can help seniors pay for assisted living nursing home and home care less than 10 percent of older mainers have purchased the coverage erb said the biggest challenge facing maine nursing homes and assisted living facilities is the rising minimum wage amid a nationwide workforce shortage erb said the combination is making it difficult to hire and retain certified nursing assistants and personal support specialists who make up a significant portion of long term care workers several state proposals this spring would again increase and streamline medicaid funding for long term care advertisement increasing wages is a good thing erb said we just have to figure out how to pay for it our facilities are competing with other segments of the labor market and there are many easier ways to make a living than working in long term care challenges to come paul armstrong embodies the breadth of challenges facing older mainers and he s not yet 65 armstrong was working construction in 2004 when he fell 32 feet and landed on his heels he said crippling compression fractures left him with excruciating chronic pain arthritis degenerative disc disease and other serious health problems now 59 the former restaurant owner can walk only short distances and stand for short periods armstrong receives a 1 250 social security disability payment each month or 15 000 per year based on the elder index he needs an annual income of 20 568 to cover basic expenses instead his health care is mostly covered by medicare and mainecare he also receives 193 per month in food stamps and 900 a year in fuel assistance which buys a tank and a half of propane to run his refrigerator space heaters and other appliances in his off the grid home advertisement increasingly however the hillside house he built in rural palermo in the early 1990s a wood wind and solar powered refuge with views across the kennebec river valley is becoming a burden to maintain and a source of unrelenting worry his fear is magnified at the end of each month when he finds himself broke after paying regular bills such as property taxes insurance car repairs and credit card debt that mounted after his divorce he hires help to stack wood and do other chores when he can afford it but the idea of leaving the home he loves and moving into an apartment depresses him he knows there are long waiting lists for subsidized housing that s accessible to disabled seniors and that ongoing efforts to promote senior housing development wouldn t benefit him for a while i m scared about the future armstrong confessed i ve got nothing put away and i ve got no one to take care of me i love this place but it s getting to be too much for me now i ve been considering moving for a while but i don t know where i would go send questions comments to the editors filed under

manager and baker he even put in several years with the maine army national guard advertisement i always worked said christy 86 a widower who lives in scarborough matter of fact i worked two jobs for a while with four kids and trying to make a house payment disabled by a serious heart attack at age 59 christy gets by today on his monthly 1 460 social security check which is quickly consumed by a mortgage payment utilities taxes repairs to his modest cape and his 2005 automobile and other expenses to cover those basic needs the elder index shows he needs a monthly income of 2 372 or 30 972 per year to stretch his annual 17 520 social security benefit christy said he visits the town s food pantry for staples such as canned goods cereal eggs and cheese he s a regular at local senior lunches where payment is optional and he goes on occasional day trips for seniors if they don t cost too much he enjoys discount coffee at mcdonald s every morning with friends and he gets free and reduced phone services through programs for seniors medicare covers his growing medical needs but he has no retirement savings when he was working his paychecks usually weren t large enough to put much away and every place i worked i never got any retirement benefits christy said pending federal bills advertisement not much has changed since christy was driving trucks or baking bread nearly half of maine s private sector employees about 254 000 mainers don t have access to a retirement savings plan at work according to the national institute on retirement security and access is a key factor people earning 30 000 to 50 000 per year are 16 times more likely to save for retirement if a workplace plan is available the employee benefit research institute found moreover maine could save as much as 23 million on public assistance programs over the next 15 years if lower income workers could save enough to increase retirement income by just 1 000 per year according to the aarp public policy institute sen collins introduced two federal bills this year that would help people avoid christy s situation one is the retirement security act of 2019 which would make it easier and more affordable for smaller businesses to join so called multiple employer plans it also would allow employees to receive an employer match for contributions up to 10 percent of their salary and would give businesses with fewer than 100 employees a tax credit to offset their increased contributions the second bill would upgrade simple retirement plans which were established in 1996 to be less costly and easier to manage than 401 k plans for businesses with 100 or fewer employees the bill would increase annual contribution limits for employees allowing them to save more on a tax deferred basis collins said she s also working to increase funding for programs that help keep seniors in their homes including safety and technology upgrades and she noted the need to increase medicaid funding for home care and long term care but she acknowledged that none of these efforts will help boost retirement savings for current seniors or increase wages for low income workers who otherwise still won t be able to save much for retirement she also acknowledged the growing need for accessible senior housing and the lack of transportation for seniors in rural maine advertisement it s a real problem collins said the demographics are overwhelming now and the needs are only going to skyrocket long term care need with no savings and limited income philip christy knows his options and relative independence would soon evaporate if he became further disabled by illness and required some form of long term care we did my funeral arrangements me and my daughter but we haven t thought about long term care christy said moving in with one of his kids isn t an option i wouldn t want to burden them he said i d go into a home but finding long term care is becoming more challenging in maine where seven nursing homes closed in the last 15 months largely because long term care facilities are increasingly dependent on medicaid funding that s already falling short advertisement today there are 93 nursing facilities statewide down from 132 in 1995 said richard erb head of the maine health care association which also represents 127 assisted living facilities the latest nursing home closures were mountain heights in patten sunrise in jonesport ledgeview in west paris freeport nursing in freeport bridgton health in bridgton fryeburg health in fryeburg and sonogee in bar harbor all of the homes that closed were relatively small and relied heavily on the mainecare program for their livelihood erb said noting that two thirds of nursing home residents in maine are covered by medicaid and while the maine legislature recently increased medicaid reimbursement rates to nursing homes they continue to experience dramatic increases in labor costs erb said as a result medicaid reimbursements to maine nursing homes fell short by 33 3 million in 2017 7 5 million more than the medicaid shortfall in 2016 erb worries that maine won t have enough nursing homes as its senior population blossoms in the coming years maine currently has 24 nursing home beds for every 1 000 people age 65 and older compared with 36 beds per 1 000 seniors nationwide according to the centers for medicare and medicaid services and while long term care insurance can help seniors pay for assisted living nursing home and home care less than 10 percent of older mainers have purchased the coverage erb said the biggest challenge facing maine nursing homes and assisted living facilities is the rising minimum wage amid a nationwide workforce shortage erb said the combination is making it difficult to hire and retain certified nursing assistants and personal support specialists who make up a significant portion of long term care workers several state proposals this spring would again increase and streamline medicaid funding for long term care advertisement increasing wages is a good thing erb said we just have to figure out how to pay for it our facilities are competing with other segments of the labor market and there are many easier ways to make a living than working in long term care challenges to come paul armstrong embodies the breadth of challenges facing older mainers and he s not yet 65 armstrong was working construction in 2004 when he fell 32 feet and landed on his heels he said crippling compression fractures left him with excruciating chronic pain arthritis degenerative disc disease and other serious health problems now 59 the former restaurant owner can walk only short distances and stand for short periods armstrong receives a 1 250 social security disability payment each month or 15 000 per year based on the elder index he needs an annual income of 20 568 to cover basic expenses instead his health care is mostly covered by medicare and mainecare he also receives 193 per month in food stamps and 900 a year in fuel assistance which buys a tank and a half of propane to run his refrigerator space heaters and other appliances in his off the grid home advertisement increasingly however the hillside house he built in rural palermo in the early 1990s a wood wind and solar powered refuge with views across the kennebec river valley is becoming a burden to maintain and a source of unrelenting worry his fear is magnified at the end of each month when he finds himself broke after paying regular bills such as property taxes insurance car repairs and credit card debt that mounted after his divorce he hires help to stack wood and do other chores when he can afford it but the idea of leaving the home he loves and moving into an apartment depresses him he knows there are long waiting lists for subsidized housing that s accessible to disabled seniors and that ongoing efforts to promote senior housing development wouldn t benefit him for a while i m scared about the future armstrong confessed i ve got nothing put away and i ve got no one to take care of me i love this place but it s getting to be too much for me now i ve been considering moving for a while but i don t know where i would go send questions comments to the editors filed under
japan s labor market has achieved full employment over the past two years unemployment has declined over the past two years to below 3 percent close to the levels of the 1980s and early 1990s after peaking at 5 4 percent in 2012 currently most unemployed people are either those who quit jobs voluntarily or who reached retirement age and or completed temporary labor contracts the lower number of laid off workers indicates a growing labor shortage which is already prevalent among small and medium size enterprises the shortage stems from a steady drop in the working age population 15 to 64 years old since the mid 90s and moderate economic growth inviting working age housewives and people over the age of 65 to participate in the labor market japan has also been facing an important production capacity shortage for the past two years across most sectors this reflects firms hesitance to invest in production equipment and structure after the global financial crisis the recent rapid recovery in such investment has been a major driver of economic growth however investment in real terms has only recovered to the 2000 level which suggests that capital stock accumulation has not yet eliminated firms production capacity constraint
with the recent announcement of prime minister theresa may s pending resignation and the general chaos surrounding brexit and british governance new politics has decided to offer a preview of a lengthier article which is to appear in the summer 2019 print edition ashley smith interviews neil davidson about the roots politics and trajectory of the battle over brexit davidson is a member of revolutionary socialism in the 21st century rs21 across the uk and rise within scotland and the author of numerous books including how revolutionary were the bourgeois revolutions and we cannot escape history states and revolutions ashley smith the eu just gave a long extension to brexit negotiations until halloween to give the british government time to come up with an agreement and pass it in parliament why did this happen and what will be the impact of the long delay neil davidson the first reason for the delay is the failure of theresa may and parliament to vote in favor of any plan the eu is itself divided between hards and softs the six month extension is a compromise between the two no one in the eu wants a hard brexit or no deal brexit at the same time germany and france who really run the eu want to make sure that britain does not set a precedent that leads other countries to leave as a lot of people even on the left think the eu is a progressive formation what was the eu set up to do and what is its nature nd the eu developed over many decades since the end the world war ii i m just going to call it the eu regardless of earlier forms and names it took it was set up for four reasons first france wanted to avoid another war with germany like the three they had fought over the previous seventy years they wanted to establish rules that would separate economic competition from geopolitical and military competition that s the element of truth in the idea that the eu has kept peace since 1945 second the united states wanted the eu established as a political and economic complement to the nato military alliance it was part of washington s cold war imperial project third the eu was designed to avoid protectionism within europe the united states germany and france thought such limitations on trade were one of the causes of the great depression so from the very beginning free trade and globalization were immanent dynamics in the eu fourth the eu took shape during the postwar boom the greatest boom in capitalist history when capital needed outlets for investment beyond the boundaries of individual states at a time when de colonization meant that this was no longer possible across the global south in the way it had been before 1945 the eu provided a mechanism for that to take place within western europe itself given the illusions many on the left have in the eu it s ironic that its structure corresponds quite closely to the model of interstate federalism devised by frederick von hayek in 1939 hayek in many ways the intellectual forerunner of neoliberalism proposed that economic activity in a federal europe should be governed by a set of nonnegotiable rules presided over by a group of unelected bureaucrats without any elected governments and irrational voters getting in the way that s how the eu is actually structured the institutions that are least democratic like the european commission the european council the central bank and the court of justice have the most power while those that are at least nominally democratic like the european parliament have the least its structures make it almost impossible for left wing reformists like jeremy corbyn to implement his program in the eu as what has been the majority viewpoint among the british capitalist class on membership in the eu nd british capitalists on the whole have always been in favor of the eu they saw it as a replacement for their colonies which they had used as key sites for investment british capital remains in favor of remaining in the eu today there are two exceptions to this rule at the opposite extremes of that capitalist class first many among the smaller capitalists shading into the petty bourgeoisie proper support brexit they do so because they are negatively impacted by the eu regulations on health and safety maternity leave and so on which they can least afford these form part of the base of the united kingdom independence party ukip and the tory brexiteers second some large financial capitalists also support brexit they tend not to be based in the city of london nor are they oriented toward investment in the eu instead they are oriented toward asia the united states and the middle east and don t see the importance of the eu but these two extremes are dissident wings of the capitalist class most of the core of british capital in finance manufacturing and service want to remain in the eu as why then did the tory party the traditional party of capital in britain opt for brexit how have labour and its party leader jeremy corbyn positioned themselves on the issue nd the tory party is not acting in the interests of british capital in pushing through brexit this dereliction of its duty is the result of how ruling class parties have evolved in the neoliberal era ince thatcher the tory leadership has progressively degenerated in their capacity to think about developing a program to solve problems they have been recycling the same ideas for four decades on top of that since the poll tax revolt of the late 1980s they ve not faced real opposition from organized labor social movements or even the labour party which fully accepted and implemented neoliberalism until corbyn took leadership the great recession changed all of this neoliberalism has stopped delivering for a capitalist class that desperately needs solutions to restore growth and profits but the tories have not been able to come up with any as a result three things have happened first as i mentioned earlier the capitalist class has splintered with the petty bourgeois and a small section of finance capital deciding to call for leaving the eu even though it s not in the general interests of the class second the leadership of the tory party started denouncing the eu to fend off a challenge from their right by the nationalist and bigoted ukip third a lot of tory politicians are incompetent ideologically driven and incapable of thinking through the consequences of their rhetoric and policy proposals this is a symptom of the decline of the quality of the ruling class a global phenomenon but one which for historical reasons is particularly acute in the uk so you have a perfect storm of divisions in the capitalist class over the eu deep discontent in british society with neoliberal austerity and ideological madness and political incompetence in the tory party on the other side the capitalist class on the whole backed remain other sections of the professional middle class and well paid workers in places like london edinburgh and manchester voted to remain for good anti racist reasons but they also fell for ideological fantasies that the eu is progressive anti racist and pro migrant corbyn and the labour party were caught in a contradiction corbyn stands in the tradition of tony benn and others who long opposed the eu as a capitalist club but he knows that the bulk of mps supported remain and his base was divided between leavers and remainers as a result the party mildly supported remain as may s failure to get a deal over brexit and the long delay are likely to precipitate both a general election and a leadership fight in the tory party right what will happen to them in an election what will happen in labour where corbyn seems to be under massive pressure from remainers and leavers at the same time nd most of the sane elements of the tory party did not want a delay for brexit because they were worried it would trigger a general election in which they know they would suffer one of the biggest defeats in their history there will be a fight over party leadership in the run up to the elections a bunch of buffoons like boris johnson will stand for party leader many of those members are in the extreme wing of the tory party most of them are over 60 and will probably vote for the most right wing candidate possible the more rational elements know that would be a disaster because they know that a right wing leader would be totally unpopular in the general election but the main electoral opposition to them labour is also deeply divided the blairites who are for remaining in the eu have launched unrelenting attacks on corbyn for months they charged him with being an anti semite and they have denounced him for his reluctance to aggressively campaign for remain their attempt to portray corbyn as antisemitic and their assertion that antisemitism is rampant in the labour party are of course absurd they are intentionally confusing corbyn s support for palestinian rights with antisemitism in reality he has a long record of combining opposition to antisemitism with support for palestine nevertheless the blairites who are the majority of the mps weakened corbyn with these attacks they will do anything to get rid of corbyn so labour is deeply divided and it will be very difficult for the party to come up with a manifesto for either the upcoming eu election or a general election while the two main parties are deeply divided other parties are in a better position politically there are two anti eu parties ukip and nigel farage s new brexit party with clear platforms on the other hand there are a range of parties supporting remain including the scottish national party snp the greens and the liberal democrats and as a result they too stand to gain in any future general election as what are the dynamics behind the push for a new vote on brexit what are the class and social forces behind it will it happen and what would be the likely result of a new vote nd the main backers of remain and a new vote on brexit come from the big capitalists the professional middle class and sections of the well paid working class each has different visions of the eu the bourgeoisie wants to stay in the eu or secure a soft brexit for their class interests and neoliberal project they have drawn behind them sections of middle and working class people who have illusions in the eu as a progressive and anti racist institution in reaction to this push for a new vote to remain corbyn is trying to maintain a studied ambiguity about where exactly he stands he supports the least bad brexit possible while all the time saying we need a general election but has so far been silent on the question of a second referendum as how will the fight over brexit affect the eu nd as i said earlier the eu is of two minds on brexit on the one hand they want to punish the british suffi ciently scare anyone else away from doing an exit of their own and they are succeeding in this even right wing governments and parties who are mainly opposed to migrants have dropped plans for leaving the eu because they do not want to suffer britain s fate on the other hand the eu doesn t want to be so punitive as to force a hard no deal brexit that would affect their economies nevertheless they don t want to concede too much to britain that would in any way compromise their neoliberal project as what does this all mean for the neoliberal program of free trade globalization nd brexit is a sign that neoliberalism is weakening as a regime of accumulation or possibly coming to an end not just in europe but around the world protectionism is beginning to revive some of this is just rhetorical but the conflict between the united states and china is a harbinger of things to come i think we are probably in a transition to a new phase of capitalism this transition is going to last a long time i m not sure what that new regime of accumulation will be nor am i clear what range of options capitalism has now we won t know the real form of its replacement for a decade or two at the moment you re seeing the ruling classes reviving old strategies from the 1930s like tariffs as finally the radical left seems to have been divided confused and unable to impact the crisis over brexit are there any signs of this changing how should the revolutionary left position itself today nd british politics is highly contradictory right now on the one hand there is the unending crisis around brexit which frankly the radical left has yet to figure out how to intervene in with any degree of coherence and influence on the other hand there signs of hope especially the extinction rebellion which has essentially closed down the centers of london and edinburgh for days with hundreds of young people arrested this action has come on the heels of the massive protests and school strikes against climate change these have been some of the biggest actions since the anti war protests in the 2000s but they are different from those protests and earlier ones young people largely from outside the traditional parties and organizations of the left are initiating these demonstrations we need intellectual clarity about what we re doing first and foremost the approach of the british international socialists back in the early 1960s is more like what we need to do today it was about 500 people it had real analysis of the dynamics of the system and it was open and fl uid and really more luxemburgist than leninist so we need revolutionary organization of that sort in the movements we need to gather together people who agree and want to collaborate regardless of organizational affiliation around shared viewpoints to push demands on a left government if it comes to power this is classic united front tactics e have to work together on what we agree on like anti austerity freedom of movement more democracy defense and expansion of the welfare state and so on we have come to the end of the process of party building that began in the 1960s we are in a new phase and there are new movements of course there are similarities with the past and there will always be as long as capitalism exists but the left should stop expecting tomorrow to be like yesterday and the day before that
