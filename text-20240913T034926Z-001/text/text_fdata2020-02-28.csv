28 february 2020 anglo african agriculture plc aaap or the company directors report and financial statements for the year ended 31 october 2019 company registration no 07913053 england and wales overview the results today do not reflect the overall direction that aaa is heading in it has been known over the last few years that aaa could operationally improve dynamic intertrade despite this dynamic intertrade on its own could not sustain a plc listing in order to diversify its revenue stream 18 months ago in 2018 aaa announced a 1 million loan to comarco group and the subsequent intended acquisition of comarco group by means of a reverse takeover during 2019 a large amount of work was expended to finalise the acquisition aaa has assisted the management team of comarco group to re organise and prepare themselves to have suitable controls and processes for a listed company having been a family owned business for 38 years this included the valuations of all comarco group assets audited review of all the financial accounts and the preparation and publication of a share registration document in anticipation of the finalisation of the transaction and the associated equity fundraise a combination of macroeconomic uncertainty resulting from the uk general election and brexit as well as institutional capital flight from the small cap market resulting from the demise of woodford investment management together created difficult capital market conditions to raise the capital required to complete the rto during the course of marketing comarco group globally significant interest was raised from major private equity firms and strategic port operators conversations are currently underway and i am pleased on the ongoing progress the impact of such a structure would mean less dilution for aaa shareholders and yet still provide material exposure to the growth of the port and marine logistic businesses however this does mean that the transaction will follow a different structure than originally anticipated and will require further time for due diligence to be conducted by the interested parties but to re iterate i believe ultimately the future of aaa is aligned to the comarco group aaa and the management of comarco group continue to believe that a listing is strategically important and also wishes to deliver the value of the port and its associated operations to the aaa shareholders the intention is thus to simultaneously continue with the originally intended acquisition by way of a traditional public equity raise but also consider expanded structures where private equity or strategic investors may invest in the comarco group assets at an asset level alongside aaa the transaction long stop date was initially 31 december 2019 however aaa and comarco group have agreed to extend the long stop date to 31 march 2020 and this demonstrates the commitment from both sides to work together to consummate this alignment during the course of aaa s assistance to comarco group the comarco port has achieved a major milestone of being gazetted which is the authorisation by the kenyan port authority to import and export goods that it previously did not have the authority for in mozambique a world class liquefied natural gas project has at long last been initiated and the project has an exceptionally strong necessity for barges and landing craft project mobilization has started to take place and the large scale on shore and off shore construction work should provide a huge boost to the marine logistics revenue of comarco group for the coming 10 years as we stand today aaa s primary operations and source of revenue remains dynamic intertrade our cape town based spice trader the objectives of the past financial year remained focussed on value added products and the expanded market opportunities that arose in conjunction with targeted approaches to specific major food manufacturers who would be able to provide long term stability for our product lines group turnover for the year improved by 4 3 in pound sterling 8 2 in local currency group operating losses reduced from 558 417 in 2018 to 271 339 for the current year this has been achieved despite a very difficult economy in south africa the primary contributors to the group loss for 2019 were the transaction fees associated with the comarco group transaction which amounted to 224 798 for the year this is an investment for the future of aaa george roach resigned during the course of the year i would like to thank george for his service to aaa i would also like to take this

objective of the strategic report is to provide information for the shareholders and help them to assess how the directors have performed their duty under section 172 of the act to promote the success of the company and to provide context for the related financial statements the duty of a director as set out in section 172 of the act is to act in the way he considers in good faith would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members and in doing so have regard amongst other matters to a the likely consequences of any decision in the long term b the interests of the company s employees c the need to foster the company s business relationships with suppliers customers and others d the impact of the company s operations on the community and the environment e the desirability of the company maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct and f the need to act fairly as between members of the company review of the group s business dynamic intertrade pty ltd dynamic is based in cape town south africa and is involved in the importation milling blending and packaging of products that include herbs spices seasonings and confectionary for both the domestic and export markets dynamic recorded an increase in top line revenue of 4 34 to 1 8 million 2018 a decrease of 18 to 1 7 million this increase was partly due to a general price increase to our customers for our core spice lines of commodity paprika and chilli based products as well as our value added blended products gross profits decreased by 3 41 to 598 894 2018 increase of 19 8 to 620 048 zar10 95 million 2018 zar10 93 million and represents a 32 9 gross margin 2018 35 6 mainly as a result of an exchange rate that averaged zar18 28 1 00 for the year 2018 zar17 68 1 00 together with increased economic and market pressures that the south african economy faces underlying losses for the year decreased to 271 339 2018 558 417 this was primarily due to cost cutting initiatives implemented in prior years in both the dynamic intertrade and the holding company admission and regulatory expenses of 249 798 2018 276 306 were incurred during the year these charges primarily related to the comarco transaction during the year as part of the comarco transaction the company consolidated its issued share capital on a 20 1 basis whereby every 20 shares held were consolidated into 1 new share basic and diluted loss per share from continuing operations for the year was 1 94p financing during the year the company consolidated the number of shares in issue on the basis of 20 existing shares for 1 new share no new convertible loan notes were issued there were no other changes to the capital structure of the holding company during the course of the year dynamic intertrade signed agreements for new working capital loans this was done as their existing funders decided to wind their lending down the new facility is r2 5m larger than the old facility and should give it the opportunity to increase its stock holding holding and improve working capital management acquisition strategy the directors strategy is to develop the business of the group both organically and by acquisition it is intended that the company completes the comarco group acquisition before embarking on any other future acquisitions key performance indicators 31 october 31 october 2019 2018 turnover 1 819 552 1 743 772 gross profit 598 894 620 048 cash on hand and in bank 5 218 945 823 underlying operating loss 271 467 558 416 principal risks and uncertainties the directors consider the following risk factors to be of relevance to the group s activities it should be noted that the list is not exhaustive and that other risk factors not presently known or currently deemed immaterial may apply the risk factors are summarised below i development risk the group s development will be in part dependent on the ability of the directors to continue to improve the current business to complete the comarco transaction and to identify suitable investment opportunities and to implement the group s strategy there is no assurance that the group will be successful in acquiring suitable investments ii sector risk the agriculture sector is a highly competitive market and many of the competitors will have greater financial and other resources than the company and as a result may be in a better position to compete for opportunities the development of agricultural enterprises involves significant uncertainties and risks including unusual climatic conditions such as drought improper use of pesticides availability of labour and seasonality of produce any one of which could result in damage to or destruction of crops environmental damage or pollution each of these could have a material adverse impact on the business operations and financial performance of the group the market price of agricultural products and crops is volatile and affected by numerous factors which are beyond the group s control these include international supply and demand the level of consumer product demand international economic trends currency exchange rate fluctuations the level of interest rates the rate of inflation global or regional political events as well as a range of other market forces sustained downward movements in agricultural prices could render less economic or un economic any development or investing activities to be undertaken by the group certain agricultural projects involve high capital costs and associated risks unless such projects enjoy long term returns their profitability will be uncertain resulting in potentially high investment risk the marine industry in east africa has proved to be quite cyclical and although there appears to be an improvement in the prospects it is possible that the cycle could turn negative iii political and regulatory risk african countries experience varying degrees of political instability there can be no assurance that political stability will persist in those countries where the group may have operations going forward in the event of political instability or changes in government policies in those countries where the group may operate the operations and financial condition of the group could be adversely affected iv environmental risks and hazards all phases of the group s operations are subject to environmental regulation in the areas in which it operates environmental legislation is evolving in a manner that may require stricter standards and enforcement increased fines and penalties for non compliance more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers directors and employees there is no assurance that existing or future environmental regulation will not materially adversely affect the group s business financial condition and results of operations environmental hazards may exist on the properties on which the group holds interests that are unknown to the group at present the board manages this risk by working with environmental consultants and by engaging with the relevant governmental departments and other concerned stakeholders v internal control and financial risk management the board has overall responsibility for the group s systems of internal control and for reviewing their effectiveness the group maintains systems which are designed to provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against material loss and to manage rather than eliminate risk the key features of the group s systems of internal control are as follows management structure with clearly identified responsibilities production of timely and comprehensive historical management information presented to the board detailed budgeting and forecasting day to day hands on involvement of the executive director and senior management and regular board meetings and discussions with the non executive directors the group s activities expose it to several financial risks including cash flow risk liquidity risk and foreign currency risk vi environmental policy the group is aware of the potential impact that its subsidiary and associate companies may have on the environment the group ensures that it complies with all local regulatory requirements and seeks to implement a best practice approach to managing environmental aspects the wholly owned subsidiary dynamic intertrade operates a food safety system certification fssc compliant facility in cape town the fssc provides a framework for effectively managing the organization s food safety responsibilities and is fully recognized by the global food safety initiative gfsi and is based on existing iso standards vii health and safety the group s aim is to achieve and maintain a high standard of workplace safety in order to achieve this objective the group provides ongoing training and support to employees and sets demanding standards for workplace safety viii financing risk the development of the group s business may depend upon the group s ability to obtain financing primarily through the raising of new equity capital or debt the group s ability to raise further funds may be affected by the success of existing and acquired investments the group may not be successful in procuring the requisite funds on terms which are acceptable to it or at all and if such funding is unavailable the group may be required to reduce the scope of its investments or the anticipated expansion further shareholders holdings of ordinary shares may be materially diluted if debt financing is not available ix credit risk the directors have reviewed the forecasts prepared by both aaa and dynamic and believe that dynamic has adequate resources available to meet its obligations to make capital repayments of the loan to aaa if dynamics trading performance is below that forecast aaa will exercise a degree of flexibility on the repayment timetable with the dynamic turnover increasing and the group forecasting profitability there is no requirement for any impairment charge x liquidity risk the directors have reviewed the working capital requirements of aaa dynamic intertrade and dia and believe that following stress tests and variance analysis on the forecasts there is sufficient working capital to fund the business while expanding turnover and achieving sustainable profitability the directors further highlight the inherent uncertainties involved in making the assessment that the entity is a going concern xi market risk the group s investments in an associate company comprise a non controlling shareholding in an unlisted company the shares are not readily tradable and any monetisation of the shares is dependent on finding a willing buyer xii capital risk the group manages its capital resources to ensure that entities in the group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising shareholder return the capital structure of the group consists of equity attributable to shareholders comprising issued share capital and reserves the availability of new capital will depend on many factors including a positive operating environment positive stock market conditions the group s track record and the experience of management there are no externally imposed capital requirements the directors are confident that adequate cash resources exist or will be made available to finance operations and controls over expenditure are carefully managed going concern these consolidated financial statements are prepared on the going concern basis the going concern basis assumes that the group will continue in operation for the foreseeable future and will be able to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business the group has incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from operations as the group continued to improve its operations during the year under review during the year the group raised no additional equity funding in the prior year the group raised 935 374 in gross funding through share

any other relevant risk factors arise the group will need to obtain additional debt finance or equity to fund its operations for the period to 28 february 2021 the cash flow forecast is dependent on production targets being met at dynamic intertrade maintaining the invoice financing arrangements generating future sales and the selling prices remaining stable during the period to 28 february 2021

advisors to the company are presented on the directors and advisors page at the beginning of this report the company has a standard listing on the london stock exchange main market the information within these financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared for the year ended 31 october 2019 with comparatives for the year ended 31 october 2018 1 changes in significant accounting policies the group has initially applied ifrs 15 see 2 a below and ifrs 9 see 2 b below from 1 january 2018 a number of other new standards are also effective from 1 january 2018 but they do not have a material effect on the group s financial statements due to the transition methods chosen by the group in applying these standards comparative information throughout these financial statements has not been restated to reflect the requirements of the new standards there is no effect of initially applying these standards a ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers ifrs 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether how much and when revenue is recognised it replaces existing revenue recognition guidance including ias 18 revenue ias 11 construction contracts and ifric 13 customer loyalty programmes under ifrs 15 revenue will be recognised when a customer obtains control of the goods determining the timing of the transfer of control at a point in time or over time requires judgement the group has adopted ifrs 15 using the cumulative effect method without practical expedients with the effect of initially applying this standard recognised at the date of initial application i e 1 january 2018 accordingly the information presented for 2018 has not been restated i e it is presented as previously reported under ias 18 ias 11 and related interpretations additionally the disclosure requirements in ifrs 15 have been applied to the comparative information sales of goods for the sale of goods revenue was previously recognised when the goods are delivered to the customers premises which is taken to be the point in time at which the customer accepts the goods and the related risks and rewards of ownership transfer revenue was recognised at this point provided that the revenue and costs can be measured reliably the recovery of the consideration is probable and there is no continuing management involvement with the goods under ifrs 15 revenue will be recognised when a customer obtains control of the goods which for the sale of goods is when the goods is delivered to the customer s premises accordingly there is no impact of ifrs 15 on the prior year figures as all contracts are concluded once the customer takes delivery of the products sold ifrs 15 had no impact on the consolidated statements of financial position nor the consolidated statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income for the year ended 31 october 2018 or 31 october 2019 ifrs 15 requires additional disclosure in terms of the sources of revenue as follows 2018 2017 major product service lines sale of goods 1 743 772 2 126 797 total revenue 1 743 772 2 126 797 primary geographical markets africa 1 743 772 2 126 797 1 743 772 2 126 797 timing of revenue recognition products transferred at a point in time 1 743 772 2 126 797 1 743 772 2 126 797 sale of goods under ias 18 revenue was recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership had been transferred to the customer recovery of the consideration was probable the associated costs and possible return of goods could be estimated reliably there was no continuing management involvement with the goods and the amount of revenue could be measured reliably revenue was measured net of returns trade discounts and volume rebates the timing of the transfer of risks and rewards varied depending on the individual terms of the sales agreement b ifrs 9 financial instruments ifrs 9 sets out requirements for recognising and measuring financial assets financial liabilities and some contracts to buy or sell non financial items this standard replaces ias 39 financial instruments recognition and measurement as a result of the adoption of ifrs 9 the group has adopted consequential amendments to ias 1 presentation of financial statements which require impairment of financial assets to be presented in a separate line item in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income previously the group s approach was to include the impairment of trade receivables in other expenses impairment losses on other financial assets are presented under finance costs similar to the presentation under ias 39 and not presented separately in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income due to materiality considerations additionally the group has adopted consequential amendments to ifrs 7 financial instruments disclosures that are applied to disclosures about 2018 but have not been generally applied to comparative information classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities ifrs 9 contains three principle classifications of financial assets namely 1 measured at amortised costs 2 fair value through other comprehensive income fvoci and 3 fair value through profit and loss fvtpl the classification of financial assets under ifrs 9 is generally based on the business model in which a financial asset is managed and its contractual cash flow characteristics ifrs 9 eliminates the previous ias 39 categories of held to maturity loans and receivables and available for sale under ifrs 9 derivatives embedded in contracts where the host is a financial asset in the scope of the standard are never separated instead the financial instrument as a whole is assessed for classification ifrs 9 largely retains the existing requirements in ias 39 for the classification and measurement of financial liabilities the adoption of ifrs 9 has not had a significant effect on the group s accounting policies related to financial liabilities and derivative financial instruments the adoption by the group of ifrs 9 did not require any changes to the amount or classification of any financial instruments for an explanation of how the group classifies and measures financial instruments and accounts for related gains and losses under ifrs 9 see note 29 the group did not restate the carrying amounts of any financial assets or financial liabilities on 1 november 2017 ii impairment of financial assets ifrs 9 replaces the incurred loss model in ias 39 with an expected credit loss ecl model the new impairment model applies to financial assets measured at amortised cost contract assets and debt investments at fvoci but not to investments in equity instruments under ifrs 9 credit losses are recognised earlier than under ias 39 see note 29 for assets in the scope of the ifrs 9 impairment model impairment losses are generally expected to increase and become more volatile the group has determined that the application of ifrs 9 s impairment requirements at 1 november 2018 results in no additional impairment 2 basis of preparation and significant accounting policies the consolidated financial statements of anglo african agriculture plc have been prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards as adopted by the european union ifrs as adopted by the eu ifrs interpretations committee and the companies act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under ifrs the consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention the preparation of financial statements in conformity with ifrs requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates it also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the group s accounting policies the areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in note 4 this is the first set of the group s financial statements in which ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers and ifrs 9 financial instruments have been applied changes to significant accounting policies are described in note 2 above the preparation of financial statements in conformity with ifrs requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and reported amounts of assets liabilities income and expenses although these estimates are based on management s experience and knowledge of current events and actions actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates the estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the year in which the estimates are revised if the revision affects only that year or in the year of the revision and future year if the revision affects both current and future year a going concern these consolidated financial statements are prepared on the going concern basis the going concern basis assumes that the group will continue in operation for the foreseeable future and will be able to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business the group has incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from operations as the group continued to expand its operations during the year under review during the year the group raised nil in gross funding through share subscriptions in 2018 1 055 000 was raised through share subscriptions to fund working capital and in the latter part of the prior year as announced to fund a loan to comarco there remains an active and liquid market for the group s shares as at 31 october 2019 the group held 5 218 2018 945 823 in cash and cash equivalents the directors have prepared cash flow forecasts for the period ended 28 february 2021 considering forecast operating cash flows and capital expenditure requirements for dynamic intertrade available working capital and forecast expenditure for the rest of the group including overheads and other costs the forecasts include additional funding requirements which the directors believe will be met in the event that dynamic intertrade fails to meet revenue predictions and any other relevant risk factors arise the group will need to obtain additional debt finance or equity to fund its operations for the period to 28 february 2021 the cash flow forecast is dependent on production targets being met at dynamic intertrade maintaining the invoice financing arrangements generating future sales and the selling prices remaining stable during the period to 28 february 2021 after careful consideration of the matters set out above the directors are of the opinion that the group will be able to undertake its planned activities for the period to 28 february 2021 from production and from additional fund raising and have prepared the consolidated financial statements on the going concern basis nevertheless due to the uncertainties inherent in meeting its revenue predictions and obtaining additional fund raising there can be no certainty in these respects the financial statements do not include any adjustments that would result if the group was unable to continue as a going concern b new and amended standards adopted by the company there are no ifrs and ifric interpretations that are effective for the first time for the financial year beginning on or after 1 november 2019 that would be expected to have a material impact on the group standards interpretations and amendments to published standards which are not yet effective the following new standards amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued but are not effective for the financial year beginning 1 november 2019 and have not been early adopted reference title summary application date of standard periods commencing on or after ifrs 16 leases original issue 1 november 2019 ifrs 17 insurance contracts establishes principles for the recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts issued 1 november 2021 the directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and the interpretations in future periods will not have a material impact on the financial statements of the group c basis of consolidation the consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the company and entities controlled by the company its subsidiaries made up to 31 october each year control is achieved where the company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities the results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal as appropriate where necessary adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those used by other members of the group all intra group transactions balances income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation changes in the group s ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in the group losing control over the subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions the carrying amounts of the group s interests and the non controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries when the group loses control of a subsidiary the profit or loss on disposal is calculated as the difference between i the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and ii the previous carrying amount of the assets including goodwill and liabilities of the subsidiary and any non controlling interests where certain assets of the subsidiary are measured at revalued amounts or fair values and the related cumulative gain or loss has been recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are accounted for as if the company had directly disposed of the related assets i e reclassified to profit or loss or transferred directly to retained earnings the fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is regarded as the fair value on initial recognition for subsequent accounting under ias 39 financial instruments recognition and measurement or when applicable the cost on initial recognition of an investment in an associate or a jointly controlled entity business combinations acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method the consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition date fair values of the assets transferred by the group liabilities incurred by the group to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the group in exchange for control of the acquiree acquisition related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred at the acquisition date the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date except that deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in accordance with ias 12 income taxes and ias 19 employee benefits respectively liabilities or equity instruments related to share based payment transactions of the acquiree or the replacement of an acquiree s share based payment transactions with share based payment transactions of the group are measured in accordance with ifrs 2 share based payment at the acquisition date and assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for sale in accordance with ifrs 5 non current assets held for sale and discontinued operations are measured in accordance with that standard goodwill goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred the amount of any non controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer s previously held equity interest in the acquiree if any over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed if after assessment the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred the amount of any non controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer s previously held interest in the acquiree if any the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain joint ventures and associates a joint venture is a contractual agreement under which two or more parties conduct an economic activity and unanimous approval is required for the financial and operating policies associates are all entities over which the group has significant influence but not control generally accompanying a shareholding between 20 and 50 of the voting rights joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method which involves recognition in the consolidated income statement of aaa s share of the net result of the joint ventures and associates for the year accounting policies of joint ventures and associates have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the group aaa s interest in a joint venture or associate is carried in the statement of financial position at its share in the net assets of the joint venture or associate together with goodwill paid on acquisition less any impairment loss when the share in the losses exceeds the carrying amount of an equity accounted company including any other receivables forming part of the net investment in the company the carrying amount is written down to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued unless we have incurred legal or constructive obligations relating to the company in question d property plant and equipment property plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less subsequent accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses if any historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items subsequent costs are included in the asset s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset as appropriate only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably all other repairs and maintenance are charged to profit or loss during the financial year in which they are incurred depreciation on property plant and equipment is calculated using the straight line method to write off their cost over their estimated useful lives at the following annual rates leasehold improvements 33 3 furniture fixtures and equipment 17 plant and machinery 20 and 33 3 useful lives and depreciation method are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate at the end of each reporting year an item of property plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the relevant asset and is recognised in profit or loss in the year in which the asset is derecognised e investments in subsidiaries investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less where appropriate provisions for impairment f inventories inventories are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value cost is determined using specific identification and in the case of work in progress and finished goods comprises the cost of purchase cost of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated cost of completion and applicable selling expenses when the inventories are sold the carrying amount of those inventories is recognised as an expense in the year in which the related revenue is recognised the amount of any write down of inventories to net realisable value and all losses of inventories are recognised as an expense in the year in which the write down or loss occurs the amount of any reversal of any write down of inventories is recognised as an expense in the year in which the reversal occurs g impairment policy applicable after 1 november 2018 non derivative financial assets credit impaired financial assets at each reporting date the group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost and debt securities at fvoci are credit impaired a financial asset is credit impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial assets have occurred evidence that a financial asset is credit impaired includes the following observable data significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer a breach of contract such as a default or being more than 90 days past due the restructuring of a loan or advance by the group on terms that the group would not consider otherwise it is probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation or the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties a 12 months approach is followed in determining the expected credit loss ecl presentation of allowance for ecl in the statement of financial position loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortised cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets for debt securities at fvoci the loss allowance is charged to profit or loss and is recognised in oci write off the gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off when the group has no reasonable expectations of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof for corporate customers the group individually makes an assessment with respect to the timing and amount of write off based on whether there is a reasonable expectation of recovery from the amount written off however financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the group s procedures of recovery of the amounts due h financial instruments the group classifies non derivative financial assets into the following categories loans and receivables and fvtpl and fvtoci financial assets the group classifies non derivative financial liabilities into the following category other financial liabilities i non derivative financial assets and financial liabilities recognition and derecognition the group initially recognises loans and receivables on the date when they are originated all other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised on the trade date when the entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument the group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or it neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and does not retain control over the transferred asset any interest in such derecognised financial assets that is created or retained by the group is recognised as a separate asset or liability the group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled or expire gains or losses on derecognition of financial liabilities are recognised in profit or loss as a finance charge financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when and only when the group currently has a legally enforceable right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously ii loans and receivables measurement these assets are initially measured at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method iii assets at fvoci measurement these assets are initially measured at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at fair value and changes therein other than impairment losses are recognised in oci and accumulated in the revaluation reserve when these assets are derecognised the gain or loss accumulated in equity is reclassified to profit or loss iv non derivative financial liabilities measurement other non derivative financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs subsequent to initial recognition these liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method v convertible loan notes and derivative financial instruments the presentation and measurement of loan notes for accounting purposes is governed by ias 32 and ias 39 these standards require the loan notes to be separated into two components a derivative liability and a debt host liability this is because the loan notes are convertible into an unknown number of shares therefore failing the fixed for fixed criterion under ias 32 this requires the underlying option component of the loan note to be valued first as an embedded derivative with the residual of the face value being allocated to the debt host liability refer financial liabilities policy above compound financial instruments issued by the group comprise convertible notes denominated in british pounds that can be converted to ordinary shares at the option of the holder when the number of shares to be issued is fixed and does not vary with changes in fair value the liability component of compound financial instruments is initially recognised at the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an equity conversion option the equity component is initially recognised at the difference between the fair value of the compound financial instrument as a whole and the fair value of the liability component any directly attributable transaction costs are allocated to the liability and equity components in proportion to their initial carrying amounts subsequent to initial recognition the liability component of a compound financial instrument is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method the equity component of a compound financial instrument is not remeasured interest related to the financial liability is recognised in profit or loss on conversion at maturity the financial liability is reclassified to equity and no gain or loss is recognised the group s financial liabilities include amounts due to a director trade payables and accrued liabilities these financial liabilities are classified as fvtpl are stated at fair value with any gains or losses arising on re measurement recognised in profit or loss other financial liabilities including borrowings are initially measured at fair value net of transaction costs i borrowings borrowings are presented as current liabilities unless the group has an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date in which case they are presented as non current liabilities borrowings are initially recorded at fair value net of transaction costs and subsequently carried for at amortised costs using the effective interest method any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in profit or loss over the year of the borrowings using the effective interest method borrowings which are due to be settled within twelve months after the balance sheet date are included in current borrowings in the balance sheet even though the original term was for a period longer than twelve months and an agreement to refinance or to reschedule payments on a long term basis is completed after the balance sheet date and before the financial statements are authorised for issue j revenue recognition performance obligations and service recognition policies revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer the group recognises revenue when it transfers control over of goods or services to a customer the following table provides information about the nature and timing of the satisfaction of performance obligations in contracts with customers including significant payment terms and the related revenue recognition policies type of product service nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations including significant payment terms revenue recognition under ifrs 15 applicable from 1 november 2018 sale of goods customers obtain control of the goods when the goods have been delivered top them and have been accepted at their premises or the agreed point of delivery invoices are generated at that point in time net of rebates and discounts invoices are generally payable within 30 days no settlement discounts are provided for the sale of the goods are not subject to a return policy revenue is recognised when the goods are delivered and have been accepted by the customers at their premises or the agreed point of delivery interest revenue interest income is recognised in the income statement for all interest bearing instruments whether classified as held to maturity fvtoci fvtpl derivatives or other assets on an accrual basis using the effective interest method based on the actual purchase price including direct transaction costs once a financial asset has been written down to its estimated recoverable amount interest income is thereafter recognised based on the effective interest rate that was used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the recoverable amount k cost of sales cost of sales consists of all costs of purchase and other directly incurred costs cost of purchase comprises the purchase price import duties and other taxes other than those subsequently recoverable by the group from the taxing authorities if any and transport handling and other costs directly attributable to the acquisition of goods trade discounts rebates and other similar items are deducted in determining the costs of purchase cost of conversion primarily consists of hiring charges of subcontractors incurred during conversion l finance income and finance costs the group s finance income and finance costs include interest income interest expense dividend income interest income and expense is recognised using the effective interest method dividend income is recognised in profit or loss on the date on which the group s right to receive payment is established the effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset or the amortised cost of the financial liability in calculating interest income and expense the effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying amount of the asset when the asset is not credit impaired or to the amortised cost of the liability however for financial assets that have become credit impaired subsequent to initial recognition interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset if the asset is no longer credit impaired then the calculation of interest income reverts to the gross basis m taxation income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax the tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the statement of comprehensive income because it excludes items of income and expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible the group s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting year deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilised such deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries except where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such investments are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilise the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future the carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting year and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year in which the liability is settled or the asset realised the measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the group expects at the end of the reporting year to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities current or deferred tax for the year is recognised in profit or loss except when it relates to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity in which case the current and deferred tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively where current tax or deferred tax arises from the initial accounting for a business combination the tax effect is included in the accounting for the business combination n cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and on hand demand deposits with banks and other financial institutions and short term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value having been within three months of maturity at acquisition bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the group s cash management are also included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows o provisions and contingencies provisions are recognised when the group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the group will be required to settle that obligation provisions are measured at the directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the statement of financial position date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material provisions are not recognised for future operating losses where there are a number of similar obligations the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole a provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small when the effect of discounting is material the amount recognised for a provision is the present value at the reporting date of the future expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation the increase in the discounted present value amount arising from the passage of time is included in finance costs in the statement of comprehensive income contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial statements they are disclosed unless the possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote a contingent asset is not recognised in the financial statements but disclosed when an inflow of economic benefits is probable p share capital ordinary shares are classified as equity proceeds from issuance of ordinary shares are classified as equity incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of new ordinary shares are deducted against share capital q foreign currencies in preparing the financial statements of each individual group entity transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of that entity foreign currencies are recorded in the respective functional currency i e the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates at the rates of exchanges prevailing on the dates of the transactions at the end of the reporting year monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date non monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the date when the fair value was determined non monetary items that are measured in terms of historical costs in a foreign currency are not retranslated exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items and on translation of monetary items are recognised in profit or loss in the year in which they arise exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non monetary items carried at fair value are included in profit or loss for the year except for differences arising on the retranslation of non monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised directly in other comprehensive income in which cases the exchange differences are also recognised directly in other comprehensive income for the purposes of presenting the consolidated financial statements assets and liabilities of the group s foreign operations are translated into the presentation currency of the group i e south african rand at the rate of exchange prevailing at the end of the reporting year and their income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates for the year unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that year in which case the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of transactions are used exchange differences arising if any are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity the principal exchange rates during the year are set out in the table below rate compared to year end rate 2019 year end rate 2018 south african rand 19 53 18 66 us dollar 1 29 1 28 r finance leases assets held under finance leases are initially recognised as assets of the group at their fair value at the inception of the lease or if lower at the present value of the minimum lease payments the corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the statement of financial position as a finance lease obligation lease payments are treated as a reduction of the lease obligation on the remaining balance of the liability finance expenses are recognised immediately in profit or loss unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets in which case they are capitalised contingent rentals are recognised as expenses in the years in which they are incurred s operating leases where the group has the use of assets held under operating leases payment made under the leases are charged to profit or loss over the accounting years covered by the lease term except where an alternative basis is more representative of the pattern of benefits to be derived from the leased asset lease incentives received are recognised in profit or loss as an integral part of the aggregate net lease payments made contingent rentals are charged to profit or loss in the accounting years in which they are incurred t employee benefits salaries annual bonuses paid annual leave and the cost to the group of non monetary benefits are accrued in the year in which employees of the group render the associated services where payment or settlement is deferred and the effect would be material these amounts are stated at their present values u segmental reporting operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker the chief operating decision maker who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments has been identified as the executive director who makes strategic decisions 3 critical accounting estimates and judgements estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances in the application of the group s accounting policies which are described above management is required to make estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources the estimates and assumptions that had a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities are discussed below a inventory valuation inventory is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value net realisable value of inventories is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less estimated costs of completion and selling expenses these estimates are based on the current market conditions and the historical experience of selling products of a similar nature it could change significantly as a result of competitors actions in response to severe industry cycles the group reviews its inventories in order to identify slow moving merchandise and uses markdowns to clear merchandise inventory value is reduced when the decision to markdown below cost is made b impairment of receivables the group s management reviews receivables on a regular basis to determine if any provision for impairment is necessary the policy for the impairment of receivables of the group is based on where appropriate the evaluation of collectability and ageing analysis of the receivables and on management s judgement a considerable amount of judgement is required in assessing the ultimate realisation of these outstanding amounts including the current creditworthiness and the past collection history of each debtor if the financial conditions of debtors of the group were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments provision for impairment may be required c income taxes the group is subject to income taxes in south africa and the uk the south african income taxes are administered by south african accountants significant judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes and the timing of payment of the related tax there are certain transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business the group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded such differences will impact the income tax provision in the year in which such determination is made d share based payments the fair value of share based payments recognised in the income statement is measured by use of the black scholes model which considers conditions attached to the vesting and exercise of the equity instruments the expected life used in the model is adjusted based on management s best estimate for the effects of non transferability exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations the share price volatility percentage factor used in the calculation is based on management s best estimate of future share price behaviour based on past experience future expectations and benchmarked against peer companies in the industry e depreciation and amortisation the group depreciates property plant and equipment and amortises the leasehold land and land use rights on a straight line method over the estimated useful lives the estimated useful lives reflect the directors estimate of the years that the group intends to derive future economic benefits from the use of the group s property plant and equipment 4 segmental reporting in the opinion of the directors the group has one class of business being the trading of agricultural materials the group s primary reporting format is determined by the geographical segment according to the location of its establishments there is currently only one geographic

the excess of the sum of the consideration paid and the fair value of the acquirer s previously held equity interest in the acquiree over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed goodwill has been tested for impairment as at the balance sheet date the recoverable amount of goodwill at 31 october 2019 and 2018 was assessed on the basis of value in use as this exceeded the carrying values no impairment loss was recognised the key assumptions in the calculation to assess value in use are future revenues and the ability to generate future cash flows the most recent financial results and forecasts for the next year were used followed by an extrapolation of future cash flows using a price earnings ratio the projected results were discounted at a rate which is a prudent evaluation of the pre tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the cash generating unit the key assumptions used in the value in use calculations in 2018 and 2019 were as follows a discount rate of 10 sales growth of 18 weighting of probabilities assigned to potential earnings the directors believe the significance of the earning potential identified mean that the goodwill does not require impairment at this early stage 18 loan receivable group group company company year ended

economists continue to warn against the consequences of lifting subsidies on commodities in light of the decline in the purchasing power of the sudanese pound and the continuing surge of prices in the country the dollar reached a new record price against the sudanese pound on thursday economists continue to warn against the consequences of lifting subsidies on commodities in light of the decline in the purchasing power of the sudanese pound and the continuing surge of prices in the country the dollar reached a new record price against the sudanese pound on thursday lifting subsidies on basic commodities will lead to a suffocating crisis it will negatively affect all sectors of society and lead to social and political instability in the country according to prof hasan bashir economist and director of the red sea university in an interview with radio dabanga on thursday he warned that lifting the subsidy on petrol will lead to higher inflation and a collapse in purchasing power the lifting of subsidies is an economically irrational and extremely dangerous plan in light of the low indicators of growth and savings he warned most sudanese live in extreme poverty they will not be able not bear the loss of government funding bashir pointed out that there are no mechanisms planned to compensate for the shock of lifting subsidies such as social security systems health insurances or other social support for the poorest sectors a direct support mechanism is currently unavailable and difficult to implement the repeated talk about lifting subsidies liberalising the dollar and raising the rate of the dollar for customs fees has already led to the increase in commodity prices he said and described talks about foreign exchange liberalisation in the absence of adequate reserves while parasitic activities are not being tackled as futile he criticised the slowness of the government in fulfilling the obligations of the sudanese revolution including the dismantling of institutions set up during the reign of ousted president omar al bashir and addressing the hoarding of basic commodities by affiliates of the defunct regime way out according to the professor the way out is to attract foreign currencies stabilise the exchange rate control the inflation instead of leaving the exchange rate floating and lifting subsidies on goods which was the national salvation regime s economic approach par excellence in order to tackle the current economic crisis holding companies should be established in partnership with the private sector in the field of production and control of export sectors especially exports of oil seeds cotton gum arabic and livestock the government should further take steps to strengthen its control of the gold sector become a production partner and establish a gold exchange market the ministry of finance should investigate companies owned by security and military officers as well as other institutions set up by members of the defunct regime and use them for the interest of the country yet most important is the tightening of control over the market prices creating incentives for investors and working with partners in order to relieve the life of the poorest bashir said he called for speeding up the peace agreement revitalising border trade securing the oil pipelines with south sudan as well as making efforts in lifting the western sanctions on sudan most important is the tightening of control over the market prices creating incentives for investors and working with partners in order to relieve the life of the poorest prof hasan bashir economist and director of the red sea university the professor expressed his hope that the economic conference scheduled for march will come out with recommendations for an economic recovery roadmap he also expects that the donor conference planned to be held in june will lead to foreign currency support assistance in financing the production process and exports through partnerships with the private sector in europe yet a breakthrough in the field of foreign investment in the productive sectors can already be expected in the coming months bashir expressed his happiness concerning the breakthrough in international relations he pointed to the possibility of sudan obtaining support from the european union the arrival of the german president to sudan accompanied by a large economic delegation and visits by us businessmen and members of the american congress considering the external openness a positive sign in the direction of relief of our crises lack of vision other independent economic experts have cited the instability of the dollar exchange rate and subsidies as major factors in sudan s economic crisis in an interview with radio dabanga earlier this week former banker hafiz ismail said that the current economic crisis is attributable to the lack of vision and the absence of an economic plan to manage the crisis failure to tackle the economic crisis will neutralise the public towards the government and increase the growing rejectionist trend he warned in a separate interview with this station professor hamid eltigani head of the department of public policy and administration at the american university in cairo warned against an explosion in the country in case the economic crisis is not dealt with he called for a gradual lifting of subsidies on fuel and normalisation of the exchange rate between the sudanese pound and the us dollar currency market the price of the dollar on thursday reached sdg 108 compared to sdg 107 on wednesday currency traders in khartoum told radio dabanga the selling price of the euro became sdg 114 the uae dirham scored sdg 27 7 on thursday while the selling price of the saudi riyal rose to sdg 28 5 in a press conference on saturday last week minister of finance ibrahim el badawi confirmed the parallel market supremacy over the currency trading the parallel currency markets are rich and the official market is poor he stressed the need to make liberalise the exchange rate for private sector transactions as well as for cash transfers of sudanese expats to the country in order to control the black market the official rate of the usd is sdg 54 64 central bank of sudan sudan s annual inflation rate rose to 64 28 per cent in january from 57 01 per cent in december radio dabanga s editorial independence means that we can continue to provide factual updates about political developments to sudanese and international actors educate people about how to avoid outbreaks of infectious diseases and provide a window to the world for those in all corners of sudan support radio dabanga for as little as 2 50 the equivalent of a cup of coffee
hiruni a fisherman s wife who has to manage her household of five people with an income of about 2 5 euros 500 sri lankan rupees per day is heavily indebted in order to increase her household income she borrowed 50 000 rupees 250 euros from the lolc bank which specialises in micro credit with this money she started the production of insecticide treated mosquito nets as recommended by foundations such as bill gates which she sold for rs 2 000 eur 10 each for a while this worked but two factors beyond her control worked against her 1 the grossly abusive interest rate charged by lolc over 50 real interest rate and the huge penalties for late payments 2 a powerful commercial firm started selling imported nets at 25 less and payable in two installments hiruni was not able to withstand this competition because the price offered by this firm was lower than her production costs she had to stop production and marketing of nets and was no longer able to continue normal repayments this led her to contract another loan from another bank in order to resume payments to lolc hiruni is desperate and over indebted the imf s actions has a direct impact on the fate of hundreds of thousands of women like hiruni in sri lanka for years the imf has been pushing for an end to customs barriers protecting local producers whether farmers fishermen artisans or others this is one of the reasons why hiruni and others like her can no longer make a living out of what they produce the imf together with the world bank and other international institutions also promotes the deregulation of the banking sector and micro credit it supports the right of credit companies to set the rates they want in the name of freedom of prices and the market this is why hiruni and so many others have to pay exorbitant interest rates the imf in collaboration with other international institutions put pressure on governments to privatize or close down public credit banks who were providing loans at reasonable usually subsidized rates i e without making profits which the imf and the world bank abhor this is another reason why hiruni and others cannot find credit from government sources to complete this negative picture one must add several conditionalities imposed by the imf s credit policy handed out to sri lanka like so many other countries the imf wants the government to reduce the public deficit by cutting social spending and reducing government staff as a result hiruni and millions of people in sri lanka witnessed the free education and health care drastically eroded indeed sri lanka is one of the few countries where health and education are still free in principle but the austerity measures imposed by the government in complicity with the imf mean that the real cost of education including primary education and basic health is constantly rising as school books and medicines have to be paid for and parents are also being pushed into private education and health care to escape the falling public service therefore poor families have to go into debt with micro credit agencies to meet school and health expenses and it is women who are most directly affected since they are primary responsible for ensuring education and health for their children the list of neo liberal measures recommended by the imf having a disastrous impact on the daily lives of millions of people in sri lanka and hundreds of millions worldwide is enormous and this will only change if the people get rid of the imf by electing such political forces in the government that have the will to bring radical solutions that ensure respect for social justice the enjoyment of human rights and respect for nature current imf policy in sri lanka in 2016 the neo liberal government of sri lanka appealed to the imf which in return pledged 1 600 million in credit on the condition that it would follow the imf s recommendations this programme is still being implemented and the balance sheet is entirely negative on 7 february 2020 an imf visit to sri lanka was concluded the press release of the washington based institution is highly significant the imf states that the government s decision to set a maximum interest rate of 35 on micro credit loans can only be temporary because the distortion sic of the functioning of the financial market must be avoided it should be noted that the government set such a ceiling as it was under pressure from the streets thousands of women victims of micro credit and its abusive rates had mobilized in the north of the country to demand that interest rates should not exceed 25 which remains an extremely high rate since the inflation rate is only 4 setting the maximum interest rate at 35 is a limited concession made by the government in view of the scale of the social drama and the risk of extending the mobilizations it should also be noted that in a very clear report the united nations independent expert on debt and human rights sounded the alarm about the dramatic situation experienced by the very many victims of micro credit in sri lanka his report written after completing a field mission was damning for the government financial institutions and other foreign donors he called on the government to act the government had tried to justify itself by claiming that it was pursuing a policy of poverty reduction it should also be noted that the independent expert followed with keen interest the proceedings of the 7th south asia cadtm workshop held in colombo in april 2018 and that sri lankan social movements had submitted to him a public document at the time of his visit in august 2018 as a result of various forms of pressure exerted on it the government set a maximum rate of 35 although this rate is still completely exaggerated and must be characterized as usurious the imf has the audacity to state in its press release of 7 february 2020 that it is necessary to soon restore the right to freely set rates the imf also calls on the government to end as soon as possible the moratorium on the payment of debts of small and medium sized enterprises it must be said that following the terror attacks of april 2019 tourists have deserted sri lanka for months which has damaged the economy and in particular small and medium enterprises in order to prevent an increase of bankruptcies the government has decreed a suspension of payment of their debts and it is this measure that the imf is also asking to be cancelled soon in addition the imf calls on the government to continue austerity measures and the underhand and gradual privatization of state owned enterprises this applies in particular to srilankan airlines the oil company and the electricity company see the imf calls on the government to deepen international trade liberalisation and measures to attract foreign investment the negative consequences of this policy are well known the volume of sri lanka s public debt has risen sharply over the past three years and now exceeds 90 of gdp it should be recalled that the current imf arrangement dates back to 2016 however between 2016 and the end of 2018 public debt increased by 30 this means that imf action has actively contributed to the increase in sri lanka s debt increasing the country s dependence on foreign and domestic lenders although a small part debt in the form of sovereign securities issued in foreign financial markets has doubled in volume in percentage terms it has increased by 50 per cent the imf is banging its fist on the table to call on the government to implement a firmer policy of austerity in public spending hiruni like the overwhelming majority of sri lanka s population has no fair expectations from the imf the cadtm which held its 8th south asia regional workshop in colombo in february 2020 supported the struggle of victims of government and imf policies the un independent expert on debt and human rights sent a message to the cadtm workshop participants that addresses the substantive issues it should be noted that in addition to the fatal agreements with the imf the deadly action of the trump administration also plays a significant role in the deterioration of the living conditions of a large majority of the sri lankan population one of the channels of washington s intervention is a federal agency created in 2004 called the millennium challenge corporation which has been active in sri lanka since april 2019 see it assigns good or bad ratings to the countries in which it operates see its deleterious action is combined with that of usaid the other federal agency that strongly encourages further job insecurity in sri lanka so that the imf does not deal with it directly the european union is not to be outdone its investment bank the eib actively supports micro credit enterprises that exploit and despoil hundreds of thousands of women in sri lanka it should also be noted that the so called ethical european private bank triodos also invests in the microcredit business in the country of course we must not forget china for which sri lanka occupies a geo strategic position in terms of trade routes china is building a number of ports without taking into account the preservation of the environment and it is doing so while putting sri lanka into debt china is not giving a gift either cadtm joins hiruni and all those who like her have finally decided to resist for after having been a passive victim hiruni joined the action of active resistance like many other women who demonstrated in colombo on 27 february 2020 to request that the government respond to their demands translated by eric toussaint with www deepl com translator free version eric toussaint is a historian and political scientist who completed his ph d at the universities of paris viii and liège is the spokesperson of the cadtm international and sits on the scientific council of attac france

hybrid solar heavy fuel oil hfo plants in the world with a 30 megawatt mw solar component combined with 64 mw of hfo and diesel generating capacity the solar plant will also have a 15 4 mw hour battery component with up to 17 3 mw of discharge power the project has a four year payback and is estimated to reduce processing costs by over 7 hfo consumption is estimated to be reduced by approximately 13 1 million litres per year eliminating approximately 39 000 tonnes per year of carbon dioxide emissions masbate gold mine the philippines the masbate mine in the philippines achieved another year of out performance in 2019 producing an annual record 217 340 ounces of gold 2018 216 498 ounces well exceeding the upper limit of its guidance range of between 200 000 and 210 000 ounces by 3 7 340 ounces throughout 2019 mining activity was mainly conducted within the main vein pit gold production was above budget largely due to higher than planned high grade ore tonnage mined from the main vein pit including ore tonnage from backfilled areas resulting in higher than expected head grade for full year 2019 the average grade processed was 1 16 g t compared to budget of 1 07 g t and 1 29 g t in 2018 mill throughput was on budget at 8 0 million tonnes compared to 7 0 million tonnes in 2018 and gold recoveries averaged 73 2 compared to budget of 75 2 and 75 2 in 2018 for the fourth quarter 2019 the masbate mine produced 50 741 ounces of gold 7 3 604 ounces below budget due to lower than planned recoveries resulting from not commencing mining in the montana pit in 2019 as originally budgeted the mining permit for the new montana pit was recently received and mining operations at the pit commenced in mid february 2020 for full year 2019 masbate s cash operating costs were 594 per ounce produced 589 per ounce sold guidance was between 625 to 665 per ounce and aisc were 815 per ounce sold guidance was between 860 to 900 per ounce both well below the low end of their respective guidance range mainly as a result of higher than expected production as well as lower than budgeted mining tonnage and mining costs in the fourth quarter of 2019 masbate s cash operating costs were 694 per ounce produced 667 per ounce sold and aisc were 956 per ounce sold as expected in the fourth quarter of 2019 cash operating costs were higher than budget as a result of rescheduling production of the ore from the montana pit into the first quarter of 2020 capital expenditures totaled 26 million in 2019 including mobile equipment purchases and rebuilds of 6 million processing plant upgrade costs of 6 million and pre stripping costs of 5 million capital expenditures for the fourth quarter of 2019 totaled 5 million including 1 million for mobile equipment and 1 million of pre stripping the masbate expansion project for the upgrade of the processing plant to 8 0 mtpa was completed in early 2019 with the expansion now fully commissioned and online masbate s annual gold production is projected to average approximately 200 000 ounces per year during the mining phase and above 100 000 ounces per year when the low grade stockpiles are processed in the subsequent period after open pit mining activities have ceased in 2020 the masbate mine is forecast to produce between 200 000 and 210 000 ounces of gold at cash operating costs of between 665 to 705 per ounce and aisc of between 965 to 1 005 per ounce otjikoto gold mine namibia the otjikoto mine in namibia also had another solid year in 2019 producing 177 966 ounces of gold exceeding the upper end of its production guidance range of between 165 000 and 175 000 ounces by 2 2 966 ounces as high grade ore tonnage from the wolfshag pit exceeded expectations gold production for 2019 also increased by 6 10 620 ounces over 2018 as higher grade ore production resumed from the wolfshag pit in the second half of the year wolfshag ore is forecast to be mined and processed throughout 2020 the otjikoto mine continued its remarkable safety performance extending the number of days without a lost time injury to 649 days 5 4 million man hours at the end of 2019 otjikoto s production for 2019 resulted from processing 3 4 million tonnes comparable with both budget and 2018 at an average grade of 1 64 g t compared to budget of 1 57 g t and 1 53 g t in 2018 and average gold recoveries of 98 7 compared to budget of 98 0 and 98 7 in 2018 for the fourth quarter of 2019 the otjikoto mine produced 58 422 ounces of gold exceeding budget by 8 4 419 ounces and 31 higher than the fourth quarter of 2018 due to the high grade ore from the wolfshag pit for full year 2019 otjikoto s cash operating costs were 461 per ounce produced 468 per ounce sold guidance was between 520 to 560 per ounce and aisc were 895 per ounce sold guidance was between 905 to 945 per ounce both below the low end of their respective guidance range reflecting higher than expected production as well as lower than budgeted fuel and reagent prices a weaker namibian dollar compared to the us dollar and higher than expected capitalized pre stripping in the fourth quarter of 2019 otjikoto s cash operating costs were 379 per ounce produced 392 per ounce sold and aisc were 897 per ounce sold and included the impact of stripping costs for wolfshag pit phase 3 which were delayed from earlier quarters capital expenditures totaled 56 million in 2019 primarily consisting of 37 million for pre stripping for the wolfshag pit phases 2 and 3 14 million in mobile equipment rebuilds and replacements and 2 million for the powerplant rebuild capital expenditures for the fourth quarter of 2019 totaled 22 million primarily consisting of 13 million for pre stripping 6 million in mobile equipment rebuilds and replacements and 2 million for the powerplant rebuild in 2020 the otjikoto mine is forecast to produce between 165 000 and 175 000 ounces of gold at cash operating costs of between 480 and 520 per ounce and aisc of between 1 010 to 1 050 per ounce development gramalote project colombia on december 23 2019 the company and anglogold ashanti limited aga entered into an amended and restated shareholders agreement under which b2gold agreed to sole fund the first 13 9 million of 2020 budgeted expenditures on the gramalote project in colombia following which b2gold and aga will each hold a 50 ownership interest in the joint venture currently 48 3 b2gold and 51 7 aga and b2gold would continue its role of manager of the gramalote joint venture which it assumed on january 1 2020 the parties will continue to have equal representation on the joint venture management committee following the expenditure of the sole fund amount each joint venture partner will fund its share of expenditures pro rata b2gold and aga have agreed on a budget for the feasibility study on the gramalote project of approximately 37 4 million through the end of 2020 this budget will fund 42 500 metres of infill drilling to confirm and upgrade the existing inferred mineral resources to the indicated category and 7 645 metres of geotechnical drilling for site infrastructure the company currently expects to complete all drilling by the end of may 2020 in addition the budget will fund feasibility work including an updated mineral resource estimate detailed mine planning additional environmental studies metallurgical test work engineering and detailed economic analysis b2gold as manager plans to continue the feasibility work with the goal of completing a final feasibility study by december 31 2020 due to the amount of work completed by aga over the past several years including extensive testing programs the work with local communities and small miners and the high level of engineering performed in 2017 for an internal study the work remaining to reach final feasibility is not extensive the main work program for feasibility is infill drilling to confirm and upgrade the inferred mineral resources to the indicated category on january 21 2020 the company announced positive results from the updated gramalote pea for the gramalote ridge deposit at the gramalote project based on the positive results from the gramalote pea the company believes that the gramalote project has the potential to become a large low cost open pit gold mine subject to completion of ongoing infill drilling which commenced in november 2019 and the results of a final feasibility study expected by the end of 2020 the gramalote project has several key infrastructure advantages including reliable water supply high rainfall region and located next to the nus river adjacent to a national highway which connects directly to medellin and to a major river with port facilities capable of bringing supplies by barge to within 70 kilometres of the site proximity to the national electricity grid with ample low cost power and a stable record of hydroelectric power and a skilled labour workforce within colombia in addition b2gold expects the gramalote project to benefit from several key operational advantages including excellent metallurgical characteristics of the ore which results in high recovery rates at low processing costs relatively low strip ratio in the mine and ability to mine and process higher grade ore in the initial years of the mine life resulting in improved project economics summary and outlook for b2gold 2019 was another record year with record consolidated gold production of 980 219 ounces including record annual production from the large low cost fekola mine in mali and the masbate mine in the philippines cash flows from operations totalled a record 492 million a product of the company s record annual gold production ongoing disciplined cost control at all projects and higher realized gold prices in 2019 b2gold has also continued to execute on its financial strategy of using debt and operating cash flow from existing operations rather than equity to fund the construction of the fekola and otjikoto mines b2gold utilized its cash flows from operations to reduce total debt including equipment loans and leases by 220 million from approximately 480 million at the beginning of the year to 260 million by year end the company also reinforced its commitment to maximizing shareholder value by declaring its first quarterly dividend in the fourth quarter of 2019 and announcing its intention to maintain the payment of a quarterly dividend going forward payment of a dividend is the culmination of the company s rapid and successful growth from an exploration company to a successful globally diverse producer and marks the achievement of another of the company s strategic objectives which was to become a sustainable low cost producer that utilizes cash flow to continue growth and to pay a dividend to its shareholders b2gold ended 2019 with cash and cash equivalents of 141 million in 2019 the company completed infill drilling of the fekola deposit converting mineral resources from inferred category to indicated additional exploration drilling has continued to expand the fekola mineralization to the north and remains open exploration drilling also continues on the highly prospective anaconda zones 20 km north of fekola and the cardinal zone west of fekola following a very successful year for exploration in 2019 the company is planning another year of aggressive exploration in 2020 with a budget of approximately 51 million excluding drilling included in the gramalote joint venture budget focusing predominantly in west africa as well as the other operating mine sites in namibia and the philippines with a budget of 33 million the company has also allocated a further 18 million for its grassroots exploration programs for 2020 on october 15 2019 the company completed a restructuring of its interests in its nicaraguan assets by closing a deal with calibre whereby calibre acquired el limon and la libertad mines in return for gross consideration totaling 100 million plus additional working capital adjustments of approximately 18 million of which 40 million was received in calibre common shares the company still currently retains an approximate 34 indirect interest in the nicaraguan assets through its equity interest in calibre and will continue to share in any exploration success or economic upside realized for those operations late in 2019 the company and aga signed an amended and restated shareholders agreement under which b2gold agreed to sole fund the next 13 9 million of expenditures on the gramalote project following which b2gold and aga will each hold a 50 ownership interest in the joint venture on january 1 2020 b2gold assumed the role of manager of the gramalote joint venture the company recently released the positive gramalote pea for gramalote ridge and expects to complete a final feasibility study by december 31 2020 based on the positive results from the gramalote pea b2gold believes that the gramalote project has the potential to become a large low cost open pit gold mine subject to completion of ongoing infill drilling and the results of a final feasibility study expected by the end of 2020 for 2020 b2gold remains well positioned for continued strong operational and financial performance with production guidance of between 1 000 000 and 1 055 000 ounces of gold including attributable ounces of between 45 000 and 50 000 from calibre with forecast cash operating costs of between 415 and 455 per ounce and all in sustaining costs of between 780 and 820 per ounce in addition the company is on schedule to realize a significant increase in gold production from the fekola mine in 2020 approximately 600 000 ounces based on the addition of a larger mining fleet and the optimization of the mining sequence b2gold s construction team is on schedule to complete the fekola mill expansion in the third quarter of 2020 which will significantly increase mill throughput yielding projected annual production averaging 550 000 ounces of gold over the next five years based on current assumptions looking forward through 2020 and beyond the company will continue to execute on its strategic objectives the company s ongoing strategy is to continue to maximize profitable production from its mines reduce debt expand the fekola mine throughput and annual production further advance its

globe newswire mr steve orr chief executive officer of shawcor ltd remarked fourth quarter revenues and margins were softer than expected primarily due to lower than anticipated demand for products and services in the north america land market and the impact of a quality event in our pipe coating operations although the revenues and margins were lower than expected the company s backlog continued its strength from the previous quarter and the company s adjusted ebitda1 was as expected due to the solid results delivered by the automotive and industrial and composite systems segments mr orr added shawcor s newly amended segment reporting provides increased granularity into the diversity of our portfolio that has been built to deliver sustainable results while maintaining the ability to participate in our customer s large capital projects based on this new segment reporting it should be clear that a step up in the company s financial performance is expected as our pipe coating business benefits from increased spending in offshore and international markets with orders already under contract combined with those that are expected to be booked in the upcoming quarters

and oilfield asset management formerly guardian tubular management services and lined tubing products automotive and industrial formerly petrochemical and industrial connection systems including dsg canusa heat shrinkable tubing products and shawflex wire and cable products 1 1 fourth quarter highlights and outlook despite several challenges in the fourth quarter of 2019 that negatively impacted revenues adjusted ebitda1 for the quarter was in line with expectations these results reflect lower demand for products and services related to north america drilling and completions due to the annual seasonal slowdown and year end budget exhaustion the results were also negatively impacted by a quality issue on an offshore product at our channelview facility which resulted in rework costs of 7 3 million and the delay of other revenue from the disruption of the event the company has successfully identified the root cause of the issue and is completing the rework the event has been fully addressed to the satisfaction of the customer and mitigation action has been taken to prevent future events on the positive side demand was solid in the quarter for our retail fuel composite tanks and wire and cable products the pipeline and pipe services segment revenues were negatively impacted in the current quarter primarily due to lower demand for the company s products and services in the us land market the us land operators continued focus on capital discipline and delays in land transmission line projects has resulted in a decline for the company s small diameter pipe coating services and call out and project related girth weld inspection services north american pipe coating activity was also impacted by the quality issue at our channelview facility in addition lower pipe coating activity was experienced in the latin america and asia pacific regions partially offset by higher activity in the emar region the composite systems segment experienced lower revenues in the current quarter for composite pipe products and tubular management services due to the lower demand in the us land market and the continued weakness in western canada although demand for its composite tank products for the retail fuel and water markets remains solid the integration of the acquired zcl composites business continued as planned during the quarter and the company has achieved 95 of the 8 million annualized run rate cost synergies targeted by the end of the first quarter 2020 synergies have been realized through the integration of functional experience within the composites systems segment leveraging back office services and realizing operating and procurement efficiencies while still in the early stages the company continues to make progress on expanding the addressable market for composite tanks by the improvement of distribution channels linking discrete components into combined systems of composite pipe and tank development of an integration approach to grow the water market and leveraging the company s global footprint to extend the reach of tank technology the automotive and industrial segment performed as expected with the annual seasonal slowdown which impacted demand for its heat shrink tubing products particularly in automotive and continued solid demand for its wire and cable products in north america 1 ebitda and adjusted ebitda are non gaap measures and do not have standardized meanings under gaap and are not necessarily comparable to similar measures provided by other companies see section 6 0 reconciliation of non gaap measures for further details and a reconciliation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda order backlog the company s order backlog consists of firm customer orders only and represents the revenue the company expects to realize on booked orders over the succeeding twelve months the company reports the twelve month billable backlog because it provides a leading indicator of significant changes in consolidated revenue the order backlog of 513 million as at december 31 2019 was slightly higher than the 509 million as at september 30 2019 this increase is primarily due to pipe coating project wins moving from bid to backlog offset by revenue generated in the quarter from backlog orders the current backlog does not include secured orders to be executed beyond twelve months which is also in line with the prior quarter due to the recent announcements of project awards in addition to the backlog the company closely monitors its bidding activity which represents bids provided to customers with firm pricing and terms and conditions against a defined scope the value of outstanding firm bids is over 1 0 billion as at december 31 2019 in line with the 1 0 billion as at september 30 2019 included in the firm bid but not in the backlog are unsanctioned conditional awards between engineering procurement construction epc companies and shawcor for a scope of work that is estimated at over 240 million in revenue beyond 2019 a similar level as reported in the previous quarter the company is also working with customers on several other projects where budgetary estimates are provided at an earlier stage than bids to assist the customers in preparing their feasibility studies or to consider different potential execution options on projects the budgetary estimates at the end of the fourth quarter were 1 7 billion in line with the previous quarter although the timing of these projects is uncertain the company s bid and budgetary figures represent a diverse portfolio of opportunities to sustain and build the backlog in 2020 and beyond outlook the primary driver of demand for the company s products and services is the level of industry activity and investment in energy and infrastructure for resource development storage and transportation around the globe this investment in infrastructure is driven by economic activity to engineer replace maintain and rehabilitate infrastructure that is at or beyond its useful design life replace production due to reservoir depletion requirements for advanced technologies and non corrosive materials the need to address geopolitical challenges which are affecting several important producing regions and increased global demand for gas and greener alternatives specifically lng development the company continues to expect annual operating results for 2020 will be higher than 2019 results reflecting a return in stable demand for our products and services in the north america upstream and midstream markets higher pipe coating activity from orders secured to date and expected success in winning new awards in the coming quarters and solid demand for our non commodity based businesses of retail fuel composite tanks and automotive and industrial products the company expects the improvement to be staggered over the year with the second half of the year expected to deliver the majority of the growth due to continued softness experienced in us land at the start of 2020 the delay of revenue related to the quality issue at our channelview facility and the cost of preparing for contracted work the company expects results in the first quarter of 2020 could be significantly lower than in the fourth quarter of 2019 the company believes its diversified portfolio of products and services should mitigate some of these headwinds and continues to have confidence that it will secure additional project awards in the coming months to grow backlog for the second half of 2020 and into 2021 pipeline and pipe services segment the demand for the pipeline and pipe services segment is heavily tied to the spending programs of exploration and production operators in north america and international and offshore markets in the u s land market demand for our small diameter coating and girth weld inspection services is expected to remain volatile in 2020 as operators continue to focus on capital discipline and due to regulatory delays on us transmission line projects in western canada the company continues to expect demand will be limited due to lack of off take capacity and new pipeline infrastructure projects the company continues to see positive signs that the international and offshore markets are poised for growth based on the continued level of current bids outstanding and the success the company has experienced in securing work with epc companies conditional on final investment decision fid the company believes that there is a strong likelihood of projects being sanctioned in the near term that together with already booked work will allow the delivery of stronger results in the second half of 2020 and into 2021 in the near term project activity in the first quarter of 2020 is ramping up at our channelview texas indonesia and norway facilities and preparations have begun to restart our facilities in scotland uae and brazil for the execution of booked orders in the second quarter the company remains confident that decisions made to maintain pipe coating capabilities and its strategic efforts to position itself as the partner of choice with epc s in the pursuit of several projects were prudent and will deliver stronger results in 2020 and beyond although the exact timing of when projects are sanctioned is difficult to predict the company believes that there is still a strong likelihood that some of these projects will be sanctioned in the near term and it is well positioned to win additional work which will enable the pipe coating business to deliver positive annual results in 2020 composite systems segment market demand for composite pipe products in north america is closely tied to well completions while demand for octg pipe inspection and refurbishment services is more aligned with drilling activity in western canada similar to the pipeline and pipe services segment the oil and gas related businesses of the composite systems segment are expected to experience continued volatility in us land and limited growth in western canada the company believes its efforts to expand the composite spoolable portfolio into larger diameters and into international markets will mitigate some of this short term volatility in us land the demand for composite tank products is delinked from the dynamics of the oil and gas markets and is expected to remain solid throughout 2020 retail fuel market demand for underground storage tanks will remain strong in 2020 supported by north america commercial and convenience store construction and will experience the normal seasonal profile of lower revenues in the first quarter the company continues to focus on expanding its addressable market in the water storage treatment tanks and early signs are encouraging in this area automotive and industrial segment the automotive and industrial segment businesses continue to deliver stable revenue and operating income supported by the stable european and north american industrial markets and despite some softening of automotive markets these markets generally follow gdp activity however the segment continues to be well positioned to capture the growing trend of electronic content in automobiles with specified sealing insulating and customized application equipment systems for tier 1 assembly customers and the expected increased spending on nuclear facility refurbishment the company expects demand drivers for automotive and industrial related products to be solid for the full year 2020 however some short term volatility is expected due to the impact of the coronavirus in the first quarter results are expected to be driven by growth in global automotive market share demand for integrated systems and increases in electronic content and electric

guidance range of between 445 000 and 455 000 ounces gold production for the year also increased by 4 16 742 ounces over 2018 the operation continued to demonstrate sustained high processing throughput without reduced recoveries for full year 2019 mill throughput was 7 0 million tonnes exceeding budget by 21 and the prior year by 25 the average grade processed was 2 16 grams per tonne g t together with average gold recoveries of 94 2 continuing the trends set in the first half of the year processing of ore with favourable metallurgical characteristics including oxidized saprolite ore combined with finer than budgeted feed size from the primary crusher due to a combination of better ore fragmentation in the pit and softer low grade ore has allowed for the processing of additional lower grade ore from stockpile and run of mine sources beyond what was originally budgeted this has resulted in a lower average processed grade but also a significant increase in gold production along with marginally increased cash operating costs per ounce gold tonnage and grade continue to reconcile well with the resource model for the fourth quarter 2019 the fekola mine produced 119 243 ounces of gold 11 11 714 ounces above original budget and 13 13 963 ounces higher than the fourth quarter of 2018 in december 2019 the fekola mine exceeded one million ounces of gold production since the

agreed to sole fund the first 13 9 million of 2020 budgeted expenditures on the gramalote project in colombia following which b2gold and aga will each hold a 50 ownership interest in the joint venture currently 48 3 b2gold and 51 7 aga and b2gold would continue its role of manager of the gramalote joint venture which it assumed on january 1 2020 the parties will continue to have equal representation on the joint venture management committee following the expenditure of the sole fund amount each joint venture partner will fund its share of expenditures pro rata b2gold and aga have agreed on a budget for the feasibility study on the gramalote project of approximately 37 4 million through the end of 2020 this budget will fund 42 500 metres of infill drilling to confirm and upgrade the existing inferred mineral resources to the indicated category and 7 645 metres of geotechnical drilling for site infrastructure the company currently expects to complete all drilling by the end of may 2020 in addition the budget will fund feasibility work including an updated mineral resource estimate detailed mine planning additional environmental studies metallurgical test work engineering and detailed economic analysis b2gold as manager plans to continue the feasibility work with the goal of completing a final feasibility study by december 31 2020 due to the amount of work completed by aga over the past several years including extensive testing programs the work with local communities and small miners and the high level of engineering performed in 2017 for an internal study the work remaining to reach final feasibility is not extensive the main work program for feasibility is infill drilling to confirm and upgrade the inferred mineral resources to the indicated category on january 21 2020 the company announced positive results from the updated gramalote pea for the gramalote ridge deposit at the gramalote project based on the positive results from the gramalote pea the company believes that the gramalote project has the potential to become a large low cost open pit gold mine subject to completion of ongoing infill drilling which commenced in november 2019 and the results of a final feasibility study expected by the end of 2020 the gramalote project has several key infrastructure advantages including reliable water supply high rainfall region and located next to the nus river adjacent to a national highway which connects directly to medellin and to a major river with port facilities capable of bringing supplies by barge to within 70 kilometres of the site proximity to the national electricity grid with ample low cost power and a stable record of hydroelectric power and a skilled labour workforce within colombia in addition b2gold expects the gramalote project to benefit from several key operational advantages including excellent metallurgical characteristics of the ore which results in high recovery rates at low processing costs relatively low strip ratio in the mine and ability to mine and process higher grade ore in the initial years of the mine life resulting in improved project economics summary and outlook for b2gold 2019 was another record year with record consolidated gold production of 980 219 ounces including record annual production from the large low cost fekola mine in mali and the masbate mine in the philippines cash flows from operations totalled a record 492 million a product of the company s record annual gold production ongoing disciplined cost control at all projects and higher realized gold prices in 2019 b2gold has also continued to execute on its financial strategy of using debt and operating cash flow from existing operations rather than equity to fund the construction of the fekola and otjikoto mines b2gold utilized its cash flows from operations to reduce total debt including equipment loans and leases by 220 million from approximately 480 million at the beginning of the year to 260 million by year end the company also reinforced its commitment to maximizing shareholder value by declaring its first quarterly dividend in the fourth quarter of 2019 and announcing its intention to maintain the payment of a quarterly dividend going forward payment of a dividend is the culmination of the company s rapid and successful growth from an exploration company to a successful globally diverse producer and marks the achievement of another of the company s strategic objectives which was to become a sustainable low cost producer that utilizes cash flow to continue growth and to pay a dividend to its shareholders b2gold ended 2019 with cash and cash equivalents of 141 million in 2019 the company completed infill drilling of the fekola deposit converting mineral resources from inferred category to indicated additional exploration drilling has continued to expand the fekola mineralization to the north and remains open exploration drilling also continues on the highly prospective anaconda zones 20 km north of fekola and the cardinal zone west of fekola following a very successful year for exploration in 2019 the company is planning another year of aggressive exploration in 2020 with a budget of approximately 51 million excluding drilling included in the gramalote joint venture budget focusing predominantly in west africa as well as the other operating mine sites in namibia and the philippines with a budget of 33 million the company has also allocated a further 18 million for its grassroots exploration programs for 2020 on october 15 2019 the

together with average gold recoveries of 94 2 continuing the trends set in the first half of the year processing of ore with favourable metallurgical characteristics including oxidized saprolite ore combined with finer than budgeted feed size from the primary crusher due to a combination of better ore fragmentation in the pit and softer low grade ore has allowed for the processing of additional lower grade ore from stockpile and run of mine sources beyond what was originally budgeted this has resulted in a lower average processed grade but also a significant increase in gold production along with marginally increased cash operating costs per ounce gold tonnage and grade continue to reconcile well with the resource model for the fourth quarter 2019 the fekola mine produced 119 243 ounces

representation on the joint venture management committee following the expenditure of the sole fund amount each joint venture partner will fund its share of expenditures pro rata b2gold and aga have agreed on a budget for the feasibility study on the gramalote project of approximately 37 4 million through the end of 2020 this budget will fund 42 500 metres of infill drilling to confirm and upgrade the existing inferred mineral resources to the indicated category and 7 645 metres of geotechnical drilling for site infrastructure the company currently expects to complete all drilling by the end of may 2020 in addition the budget will fund feasibility work including an updated mineral resource estimate detailed mine planning additional environmental studies metallurgical test work engineering and detailed economic analysis b2gold as manager plans to continue the feasibility work with the goal of completing a final feasibility study by december 31 2020 due to the amount of work completed by aga over the past several years including extensive testing programs the work with local communities and small miners and the high level of engineering performed in 2017 for an internal study the work remaining to reach final feasibility is not extensive the main work program for feasibility is infill drilling to confirm and upgrade the inferred mineral resources to the indicated category on january 21 2020 the company announced positive results from the updated gramalote pea for the gramalote ridge deposit at the gramalote project based on the positive results from the gramalote pea the company believes that the gramalote project has the potential to become a large low cost open pit gold mine subject to completion of ongoing infill drilling which commenced in november 2019 and the results of a final feasibility study expected by the end of 2020 the gramalote project has several key infrastructure advantages including reliable water supply high rainfall region and located next to the nus river adjacent to a national highway which connects directly to medellin and to a major river with port facilities capable of bringing supplies by barge to within 70 kilometres of the site proximity to the national electricity grid with ample low cost power and a stable record of hydroelectric power and a skilled labour workforce within colombia in addition b2gold expects the gramalote project to benefit from several key operational advantages including excellent metallurgical characteristics of the ore which results in high recovery rates at low processing costs relatively low strip ratio in the mine and ability to mine and process higher grade ore in the initial years of the mine life resulting in improved project economics summary and outlook for b2gold 2019 was another record year with record consolidated gold production of 980 219 ounces including record annual production from the large low cost fekola mine in mali and the masbate mine in the philippines cash flows from operations totalled a record 492 million a product of the company s record annual gold production ongoing disciplined cost control at all projects and higher realized gold prices in 2019 b2gold has also continued to execute on its financial strategy of using debt and operating cash flow from existing operations rather than equity to fund the construction of the fekola and otjikoto mines b2gold utilized its cash flows from operations to reduce total debt including equipment loans and leases by 220 million from approximately 480 million at the beginning of the year to 260 million by year end the company also reinforced its commitment to maximizing shareholder value by declaring its first quarterly dividend in the fourth quarter of 2019 and announcing its intention to maintain the payment of a quarterly dividend going forward payment of a dividend is the culmination of the company s rapid and successful growth from an exploration company to a successful globally diverse producer and marks the achievement of another of the company s strategic objectives which was to become a sustainable low cost producer that utilizes cash flow to continue growth and to pay a dividend to its shareholders b2gold ended 2019 with cash and cash equivalents of 141 million in 2019 the company completed infill drilling of the fekola deposit converting mineral resources from inferred category to indicated additional exploration drilling has continued to expand the fekola mineralization to the north and remains open exploration drilling also continues on the highly prospective anaconda zones 20 km north of fekola and the cardinal zone west of fekola following a very successful year for exploration in 2019 the company is planning another year of aggressive exploration in 2020 with a budget of approximately 51 million excluding drilling included in the gramalote joint venture budget focusing predominantly in west africa as well as the other operating mine sites in namibia and the philippines with a budget of 33 million the company has also allocated a further 18 million for its grassroots exploration programs for 2020 on october 15 2019 the company completed a restructuring of its interests in its nicaraguan assets by closing a deal with calibre whereby calibre acquired el limon and la libertad mines in return for gross consideration totaling 100 million plus additional working capital adjustments of approximately 18 million of which 40 million was received in calibre common shares the company still currently retains an approximate 34 indirect interest in the nicaraguan assets through its equity interest in calibre and will continue to share in any exploration success or economic upside realized for those operations late in 2019 the company and aga signed an amended and restated shareholders agreement under which b2gold agreed to sole fund the next 13 9 million of expenditures on the gramalote project following which b2gold and aga will each hold a 50 ownership interest in the joint venture on january 1 2020 b2gold assumed the role of manager of the gramalote joint venture the company recently released the positive gramalote pea for gramalote ridge and expects to complete a final feasibility study by december 31 2020 based on the positive results from the gramalote pea b2gold believes that the gramalote project has the potential to become a large low cost open pit gold mine subject to completion of ongoing infill drilling and the results of a final feasibility study expected by the end of 2020 for 2020 b2gold remains well positioned for continued strong operational and financial performance with production guidance of between 1 000 000 and 1 055 000 ounces of gold including attributable ounces of between 45 000 and 50 000 from calibre with forecast cash operating costs of between 415 and 455 per ounce and all in sustaining costs of between 780 and 820 per ounce in addition the company is on schedule to realize a significant increase in gold production from the fekola mine in 2020 approximately 600 000 ounces based on the addition of a larger mining fleet and the optimization of the mining sequence b2gold s construction team is on schedule to complete the fekola mill expansion in the third quarter of 2020 which will significantly increase mill throughput yielding projected annual production averaging 550 000 ounces of gold over the next five years based on current assumptions looking forward through 2020 and beyond the company will continue to execute on its strategic objectives the company s ongoing strategy is to continue to maximize profitable production from its mines reduce debt expand the fekola mine throughput and annual production further advance its

the geopolitics of oil because russia is a significant producer one of the top three in the world and it s you know it s caused a kind of a reshaping a kind of a remapping of the of oil geopolitics and we ve seen some you know shifts in how countries think about oil security in light of larger questions about broader energy security questions and also on top of that is the ongoing energy transition coupled with you know climate change and the need to decarbonize so there s just it s been quite a you know a year and a half that has really sort of put energy security and oil security very much at the forefront of people s minds faskianos fantastic i thought maybe you had some really interesting data to show us and if you could walk us through those the trends you are seeing and really bring it to life that would be fantastic kissane sure so before i do i have a couple of slides and before i share my slides i think it s really important that sort of we understand how interconnected sort of the global energy system is and how interconnected we are when it comes to the flows of oil you know some countries are very well resourced endowed so they have oil and other countries do not so they need to import oil there s really no country in the world that doesn t need oil for larger national security issues and i think one of things that many people sort of are not necessarily aware of or think about is the amount of oil that gets produced every day so every day the world consumes over 100 million barrels a day and every day that 100 million barrels has to be has to be moved it has to be you know as part of getting it into the system getting it to its respective destinations and what we re not seeing which maybe some people may have thought that we would see at this point is we re not seeing a reduction in demand but we re seeing an expansion in demand and much of that global demand is coming out of asia and we re also of course seeing the with the reopening of china lots of really interesting questions as to what oil demand will be in china for the 2023 2024 years whether or not they will they will sort of put extra pressure on global demand and you know irina just also you know it s i m going to share this in my slides but you know last week s decision from opec to reduce production of course had an impact on the price of oil so when the decision was announced on sunday by monday morning we saw an uptick in the price it s stabilized but we are sort of looking at 80 plus a barrel oil and again lots of uncertainty as to what that s going to mean across economies that are in recessions experiencing sort of the beginnings of a recession and sort of what does it mean for the global economy where we may see sort of more energy inflation so one of the things that i really like to do when i teach the geopolitics of oil is sort of show some visuals because i think again sort of really reinforcing the interconnected nature of our global energy system but also sort of seeing where in the world is oil produced and where in the world are the are the importers and also just a couple of sort of fun pieces on what we have seen just this you know in the last week of course some of this you ll be familiar with those in the audience but this decision on the part of opec to reduce production by 1 2 million barrels a day again happening at a time not when we have an excess supply but when we re seeing a tight supply across the oil market so it came as a bit of a surprise to you know to even the most you know longstanding analysts and opec observers and again part of this is directed probably toward self interests on the part of saudi arabia and the oil producers that are really going to make the cuts but of course it also has an impact here for those of you that are sitting in the united states what does it mean then for prices that americans pay at the gas pump so the biden administration sort of came out after this decision was made in sort of being disappointed surprised that opec would make this decision now it s also important to sort of recognize that this is not just a singular opec decision this is part of now a larger opec and opec does also include russia as well as other countries like kazakhstan and mexico so the opec that we have historically known is now different because you have other countries that are not official members but nonetheless are part of what we now refer to as opec and these are the countries that are part of opec and really the country that s considered to be sort of in the driver s seat of opec is that of saudi arabia because saudi arabia is the largest producer within the opec organization producing anywhere from 10 to 11 million barrels a day venezuela has the largest reserves but it is far from being at capacity in terms of what it can what it can produce so just to kind of put that into perspective these are opec countries and their respective reserves and then non opec the united states being a non opec country but again this sort of this chart to the right shows you know again the world is consuming a little over 100 million barrels a day expected to increase over 2023 and into 2024 question marks as to when we may see peak oil demand but again to sort of link this to energy security energy security especially when it s in the context of oil security is making sure that we have adequate supply at affordable prices so when we see a reduction in supply at a time of tight markets that suggests that we re also going to see higher prices that s going to directly hit vulnerable economies and so again just to sort of point out sort of where in the world sort of are the top three oil producers the united states saudi arabia and russia russia remains in the top three canada as well our you know neighbor to the north and china is also a producer of oil the united states figure here also includes gas liquefied so liquid petroleum which the united states is endowed with a lot of both oil and natural gas and then the top oil consuming countries you have u s china and india now the united states is not the largest importer that position is now held by china but as far as consumption goes we consume over 20 million barrels a day again big question mark about china in terms of whether or not we will see higher demand coming out of china over the next year two years with china s reopening and what is being you know discussed as revenge tourism and more chinese who have accumulated a lot of savings 2 1 trillion how are they going to use that savings and whether or not after three years of being under lockdown restrictions whether or not we ll see impacts to demand and i think russia is there s lots of questions about russia and this is now we re fourteen months into you know russia s reinvasion of ukraine and i emphasize reinvasion because oftentimes we forget that you know russia invaded ukraine in 2014 but russia is still moving its oil and up until you know a few months ago its overall production and exports were as high at some points even higher than pre invasion now you have new countries that are takers of russian oil and they re buying it at discounted prices we see turkey singapore china has been a big buyer as well as india that they have been buying discounted russian oil lots of interesting questions that we could discuss about the oil price cap and seaborne embargo to europe but i think the takeaway from this slide is that russia continues to produce oil continues to sell it selling at a discounted price but there are still many countries in the world that are eager to take russian oil and again i m not going to go into this but i just love this slide to just emphasize the you know the world s pipelines these are the pipelines that help sort of the transit of oil something also that s really unique and interesting to look at is just tanker traffic so the tankers that carry oil around the world but again you know there are a lot of pipelines so twenty three two thousand three hundred and eighty one operational oil and gas pipelines again these are it s moving a lot of the oil that is consumed every day and then finally is this is you know one of the things that we oftentimes we think about the hundred million barrels a day that the world is consuming over 75 percent of the world s oil is controlled managed by state owned oil companies so saudi aramco being one pdvsa of venezuela being another but it s really important to sort of recognize the position that state owned companies have the rest is controlled or managed by international oil companies exxonmobil chevron eni total and a host of other host of other companies but again i think the you know to understand that nocs as they re referred to are very very important for understanding their role in the larger context of the geopolitics of oil and again what we saw last week coming out of opec this decision this is also being driven by state budget concerns this is again it s about the production of oil but it s also about you know governments and their budgets and oftentimes you know there is a desire to add more rather than you know more revenues rather than less so those are the slides that i have and i hope that they sort of provide some sort of context and a little bit of you know that we can discuss in the questions that i really look forward to answering from the audience faskianos thank you carolyn that was great so now we re going to go to all of you for your questions and comments gives queuing instructions all right so i m going to go to the first raised hand in the thing amadine hom go to you first and please accept the unmute yourself pause you are still muted pause ok i don t know are you there oh i think ok let s go to morton holbrook q yes good afternoon dr kissane what a shocking presentation laughs a hundred million barrels a day and it s going up notwithstanding the paris climate agreement of 2015 is that agreement simply a dead letter or is it having any effect on oil on fossil fuel production particularly oil production or what s the best scenario in terms of reducing dependence on fossil fuels considering the oil market thank you kissane well hi morton thank you so much for that excellent question yeah that s kind of why i emphasize that number is because a lot of people sort of just aren t aware of how much oil we continue to consume and again what the demand expectations are moving forward and these demand expectations are you know coming out of forecasts from the international energy agency so i think there s a big question as to when we see peak demand and you know if you look at bp scenarios they expect peak demand to happen you know before 2030 where as you know others kind of contest that they that they think that peak demand won t happen until after 2030 i mean again a lot depends on you know what we are now experiencing in the energy transition and how sort of quickly are we can we transition away from oil i think what s really critical when we re looking at oil is oftentimes we think only about the transportation sector so we re thinking about cars we re thinking about planes you know we re thinking about trucks and tankers and all these things but it s petrochemicals you know there s just a lot of oil that also goes into fertilizer so it really is across our economy and across economies across the global system one of the things that i always tell my students is even during covid where you had many countries right much of the world was experiencing some level of lockdown we did have a reduction in oil demand but it wasn t it wasn t like 20 million barrels it was under ten so the fact that now it s 2023 the world has reopened it s really hard to sort of see or to know with certainty is when we re going to see that see that reduction in demand now i think with the paris agreement what s also important is to note is you know if you re if you re in the oil and gas space and i was just at a conference earlier this morning where this was a point of conversation was you know what are the companies doing to reduce the emissions from production so how are they integrating carbon capture sequestration you know how are they managing the emissions that come from the production of fossil energy in this case that we re talking about oil and i think one of the things that i think if you sort of follow oil markets or a country like saudi arabia they are marketing low emission oil now we could you know we could sort of challenge well what does that you know what does that really mean but you are having you know countries that are now sort of competing to state that they have lower emitting carbon in the production in the production of oil and that s a whole other interesting sort of thing to look at in the context of the geopolitics of oil is to kind of understand the variation across emissions across different countries in the production of oil so we are you know again we are going to be going into cop 28 this fall again we are not seeing you know and we haven t seen a you know reduction in fossil energy demand again lots of people are sort of you know hoping that we ll start to see it sooner rather than later but for the time being and again you know to irina s first question that you know the last fourteen months and with you know with russia s invasion of ukraine it has both shown us that you know europe is sort of seeking to hasten the energy transition by building out more renewable energy and creating more opportunities to buy electric vehicles but there s still big swaths of the world that you know are still and have yet to move towards you know really reducing and that are actually going to see higher demand moving forward as their economies grow faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from jovana vujanic who is a graduate student at lewis university how big of an of an impact will the decision of the saudi energy minister to cut oil production have on the relationship between the united states and saudi arabia kissane love the question thank you so much yeah no it s a great one so my take is that of course this decision came as a bit of a surprise and it wasn t something that the united states you know wanted but i would say that the u s saudi relationship has been very tense for the last ten years and as part of that there are lots of different reasons for that but this is yet kind of another thing that saudi has done and again i think it s also saudi has taken a non alignment policy with relation to its position on russia and ukraine so it continues to you know it continues to have a relationship with russia it also has the relationship with ukraine as we saw you know china just brokered a very significant deal between saudi arabia and iran you know again saudi arabia and iran are two are two important producers for china so china is a large importer of oil so if you go back to world war the end of world war ii that s when the united states established the oil for security relationship with saudi arabia and as we have grown sort of more i wouldn t say independent but our as our own oil production has increased especially through the shale revolution our dependence on the middle east and saudi arabia more specifically has shifted so i think we re seeing a very different saudi arabia today which i think is going to be a challenge for the united states i think it s going to be very interesting to see what the summer holds last summer the biden administration did tap into the u s strategic petroleum reserves the largest the largest take in the history of the reserves which started in 1975 you know taking 180 million barrels out you know not because there was massive supply disruptions but because you know as the administration said it was you know it was it was it was a war it was a war specific decision because the you know russia s invasion of ukraine was causing energy prices to skyrocket and to cushion the american consumer and to better cushion the sort of the global economy the united states withdrew from the spr so i think the summer is going to be very interesting but i think we re going to see definitely much more attention in the years to come between the united states and saudi arabia it s not the relationship of the past this is a kind of a very new relationship that s a great question faskianos thank you thank you let s go curran flynn who has a raised hand q hello faskianos we can hear you but we re getting feedback so you might have two devices open q can you hear me now faskianos yes q that s better ok faskianos that s better thank you thank you so much q so i m here at king fahd university in saudi arabia right next to aramco here with my class from international relations and one of my students has a question nasser al nasir ph here he is q so thank you mrs carolyn my question is how could russia s use of alternative transportation methods such as the east siberian pipeline to china impact the u s market the domestic market and the role of the spr given potential insurance workarounds from russia s side such as ensuring russian tankers through their rdif fund and thank you to mrs irina kissane thank you and dr flynn thank you so much for having your students join this webinar so i m a little so the question is about the east siberian pipeline just could you would you mind repeating it i just want to make sure i have it i m clear on the question q so how could russia s use of alternative transportation methods such as the east siberian pipeline to china impact the u s energy markets i mean domestically and the spr given potential insurance workarounds from russia s side such as ensuring russian tankers to the rdif fund kissane yeah and that s a great question you know i think that you know begs a lot of things that we could be looking at right in terms of you know russia s kind of ability or capacity to sort of work around or find workarounds to the sanctions that were imposed and i think we ve seen sort of new markets so this kind of reshaping of the energy map with oil we see that as kind of in technicolor right whereas you know a lot of russian oil would go west is now going east you know china india being takers and of course you know other countries as well you know what will be its impact on the on the u s market i think that s you know again i do think the sanctions were sort of carefully put into place so that there wouldn t be massive disruptions so we again you know russia produces over 10 million barrels a day and about 7 million of those barrels are exported so you know if we lost all of that that would be a you know that would cause some very significant economic disruption globally we already saw you know impacts to sort of grains grain exports and food security in many different parts of the world so you know russia is finding different ways you have shadow tankers that russia is using to move to move its oil as you pointed out the east siberian pipeline you know i think there s only so much the united states can do or and european countries that are part of the sanctions regime can do to curtail russian exports of oil but i think that you know i think russia again has a has a desire and also you know revenue needs they re funding a very expensive war that they re finding ways to get their to get their oil out i think an interesting question is you know what does this mean in the years ahead the lack of investment for example that s going into russian energy infrastructure a lack of sort of any kind of western investment that is that is going in and what that is going to mean but again you know i think to your question i think we will see some you know we are seeing some impacts right there s a big question as to what you know what the next six months to a year will look like with regards to the reduction from opec and if we were to see a deeper curtailment on russian oil and you know would the united states then tap more into the spr we re now at you know we re down to seven hundred thousand barrels which of course is not insignificant but we also sort of have to be you know judicious about how we use the spr but thank you for the question faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from michael let s see trevett a ph d candidate at the university of southern mississippi china and other countries claim there are petroleum reserves under the south china sea what are your estimates of the potential amount there and has china begun to extract any of this oil kissane michael thank you so much that s a great question so china already is an oil producing country so you do have oil production in china in the south china sea i can t i can t say exactly i know that there have been geological tests that have shown the reserves again you do have you know you do have territorial concerns about sort of where is this you know can china can china tap those or seek to explore and tap those reserves again if there are if there is contention over the territory in which these reserves are located so you know china again one of the things that s very interesting about china is that china is an oil producer but china has seen over the last you know the last decade they have seen that they have experienced peak demand so i mean sorry peak supply so they are not producing as much as they used to and so you re seeing a year on year reduction in the producing capacity you know if you go back maybe five or six years ago there was lots of questions about if china could kind of replicate what happened in the united states around the shale oil revolution i think one of the big challenges for china is that of the you know where the shale reserves are located it s not near water lots of questions as to and some of it basically some of the tests have shown that it s it definitely is proving harder that you know they cannot sort of model the same level of development that we have seen in the united states so yeah no i think in the south china sea again i think we it s potentially possible that we might see it i wouldn t i wouldn t i wouldn t say it s soon faskianos thank you i m taking the next question from rob warren at the anglo american university of prague this question also got an upvote how do you foresee venezuela s role in the global oil market changing moving forward and can it be reintegrated into the global economy kissane oh these are all fantastic questions thank you all so much yeah venezuela is again you know venezuela has they have the largest reserves in the world as part of this webinar right you cfr had a kind of a primer on venezuelan and kind of you know you look at sort of where venezuela is and one of the biggest challenges confronting venezuela is both its politics but it s also it basically you know you don t have you don t have international oil service providers in the country i think the only the only one now that the u s the u s has sort of given a sanctions exemption to is that of chevron but i think yeah i mean if you were to see you know kind of shifts in the political regime and you were to see more openness then i think you could imagine you know venezuela having an opportunity or a pathway forward to be more integrated into the global energy system and the global oil system you know i think one of the big problems that venezuela faces is that most of its infrastructure is really old at this point and it would need a significant amount of reinvestment to get it up to a place that it could sort of meet its potential so you know venezuela is one of these countries that s not producing as much as it could right it has the potential to be producing 2 million plus more barrels per day but you know we ve seen that they really have just they went into freefall so i think that s a big issue and another big issue which god it goes back to an earlier question is that of emissions so the oil that comes out of venezuela is a very very heavy oil so it s it has very large carbon emissions associated with the production of that oil so that i think is again as we you know think about the emissions from oil production in countries that are sort of seeking to kind of market themselves as low emission producers you know venezuela definitely will have a very hard time recouping its where its oil sector was again it has the capacity it has the reserves but getting that getting that oil out of the ground right now you have a lot of significant above ground risks faskianos thank you i m going to go next to clemente abrokwaa raised hand so please unmute yourself q can you hear me please faskianos yes we can q thank you thank you so much for your for your talk i was also very shocked about the amount of barrels that we consume every day laughs i didn t know that but anyway i m from penn state university and my question is you just mentioned about the above ground you know effects and so the movement towards like electric vehicles and so on how do you think it is going to affect the african continent kissane thank you q i am i m thinking you know the economies and then infrastructure it will be very difficult for them to laughs move with the rest of the world in terms of electric vehicles and so on i just wanted your take on that kissane thank you clemente it s an excellent question yeah i mean you have countries across the african continent that not only have oil reserves but are already producing right nigeria is a is an oil producing country also has more capacity but again you have some above ground risks you also have the need for investment of new infrastructure i think one of the things that has been very interesting and i think it s getting it s getting more attention as it deserves is how western governments are some of i think a challenge across africa is that a lot of western governments have sort of said listen we re not going to invest in fossil fuels or also financial institutions western financial institutions we re not going to invest in fossil fuels or new projects that are fossil based and that you know that s problematic when you look across the african continent where you still don t have you know 100 percent energy access you know the idea of the transition to electric vehicles which is taking a very very long time even here across the across developed economies so the need for the infusion of more capital to go into you know across the continent of africa for oil and gas that s for their economies and for their own economic growth i think is really really pivotal and i think this is something that you know is being discussed across multilateral financial institutions and also you know is it hypocrisy right for western banks that have you know kind of funded the oil and gas industry or helped to fund the oil and gas industry in the united states and many different parts of the world and that are now sort of not allowing those funds to flow to africa and they have the again they have the they have the resources so you know is it you know the equity of some of these decisions that are being made i think is one that s is one that s really important and again i you know i said earlier in this talk is that you know all most of the demand for oil is not coming from north america and from europe all of the demand that we re seeing and new demand that we re going to see is coming from asia and is going to come from africa so again you know how are we going to make sure that that demand is met again going back to that idea of energy security so there is there is accessibility so there is reliable sources of energy at affordable prices you know without sort of thinking about kind of a whole of energy approach so i think it s very it s a very complex issue and i think you know western banks who have sort of taken very sharp positions on what they will and will not fund when it comes to new oil and gas projects are getting sort of challenged as to you know what does that mean then for you know countries across africa that are still very much in need of more energy not less and again recognizing that you know evs that again are still are you know we re seeing adoption here in the united states and across europe but it s a big big big adoption in china but it s very uneven so how do we ensure greater energy security for the continent of africa i think is a really critical question faskianos thank you i ll take the next question from kyle bales who is a senior at lewis university in romeoville illinois how is the war between russia and ukraine having an effect on the progress of the european green deal maybe you can tell us what the european define the european green deal for us carolyn give us the context for that kissane yes so again this is another fantastic question yeah the european green deal it s this is this is great yeah i mean a lot of people would say that the european green deal now is that the russia s invasion of ukraine has sort of said hey this is why the green deal is so important this is why we really need to more quickly transition to renewable energy because look what look what happened when we were dependent on russia for over 30 percent of our natural gas and look when russia you know illegally invades ukraine and suddenly weaponizes gas we are left very energy insecure it affects it affects consumers it affects industry across the continent so i think we re seeing not just through the green deal but we re also seeing through sort of european green industrial policy so in some ways akin to what you know we put into effect in this past summer is the inflation reduction act and we re seeing almost kind of this industrial competition around clean energy technologies and so europe is investing you know i think it s about 250 billion the united states it s about 370 billion towards the kind of the energy transition and helping to support domestic industries and companies to you know to be able to you know develop the technologies and to have the you know the opportunity to contribute to the energy transition so i think one thing though whenever i talk about europe it s really important is to sort of recognize that you know when you look across europe you have very different policies and kind of approaches to sort of thinking about energy and how quickly some countries want to transition and can transition whereas others you know are probably going to experience a slower transition so just really interesting example as you talked about the green deal is the eu taxonomy the green taxonomy that went into effect in the january of 2022 and there you had like really a lot of contention between france and germany because france wanted to make sure that nuclear was part of the green taxonomy germany was opposed right but germany wanted to make sure natural gas was part of the green taxonomy so ultimately in the end both natural gas and nuclear and again this was this predated russia s invasion of ukraine but in the eu green taxonomy you have you know you have both nuclear and natural gas in addition to other renewable energies that can make up this taxonomy that includes specific measures towards adaptation and mitigation for climate change so you know i think you re seeing this kind of some people call it a race a competition you know ideally it s you know we re kind of working together to because we re all sort of going in the same direction to you know support the transition and to reduce to reduce carbon emissions and to bring in more sort of cleaner energy technologies into our system faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from dr laeed zaghlami q yes good afternoon this is laeed good afternoon irina good afternoon carolyn i m very pleased to be part of your program just to want to be back to africa and particularly to nigeria how practical the two projects that nigeria is advocating for pipelines one from through algeria and the other one to morocco through western african countries how practical are these pipelines to supply gas to europe and parts of some african countries faskianos and dr zaghlami you are at algiers university correct q indeed irina yes i am professor at university of algiers faculty of information and communication faskianos thank you kissane dr laeed can i can i keep you on for just one second can i ask you what is the what is the status right now is it it s planned under construction where is what is the status of those two pipelines my understanding is that it s they re proposed but q yes well actually in practically the pipeline between algeria and abuja which means through niger and so forth is already in progress whereas the other project through thirteen western african countries they are supposed to be implemented by 2047 but is it is there any political game or something of strategic inaudible how practical how logical how efficiently will be for nigeria to have two similar project s kissane yeah no it s again thank you for the question you know pipelines again that s why i wanted to show the laughs kind of the map of pipelines is because you know a lot of pipelines transverse you know multiple countries right and this is this requires not just you know a lot of cooperation but it requires technically it also can be very complex to build to build pipelines and when you re talking about something like as you as you point out these are you know crossing many countries you know i think one of the again one of the issues is whether or not since you know what already is under construction i think you can you know with confidence that one will be completed anything that s not yet under construction and again the timeline 2047 is way out there a lot of a lot of uncertainty as to what the status of those projects will be moving forward for various reasons in terms of making sure that the investments are there someone i know that studies pipelines he says you know until the steel is in the ground you don t have the pipeline and so until you know that you ve got that you know you ve got all the oks and you feel that kind of security of being able to build it and being able to provide the resources to supply it and to move it i think algeria has been a really interesting case that hasn t gotten enough attention in terms of algerian gas that has that has helped support europe over the last years we ve seen an increase in algerian gas going into europe again a lot of attention on u s lng and the increase of liquefied natural gas exports into europe but also algeria has been you know very important for helping to support european energy security and make up for some of the losses of the of the russian gas and i think we ll see more attention on algeria and algeria s role as a you know as an important source of energy especially you know gas going into going into europe moving forward faskianos so i ll take the next written question from vincent brooks who is at harvard and diamondback energy board of directors how do you view the purchasing of discounted russian oil by india in particular relative to the purchasing by china how are they using the oil purchased and are you seeing more internal usage or external profit making sales in places like africa and what are the implications of all of this kissane right great great question so all of the above laughs in some ways right there is definitely sort of profits that are being made you know i was i was talking about this last week with someone and you know if you sort of put your shoe put yourself in the shoes of india right so india is a is a rapidly growing economy 1 4 billion you know if you had if you have very high energy inflation and high oil prices that s going to have ripples effects across the indian economy and so you know when you have a kind of opportunity to buy you know pretty steep discounted oil which you know they had been able to buy from russia you know for purposes of national security they ve been buying the oil and one of the things that s very interesting about india is that actually india has been building out its refining capacity so a lot of that oil is both for domestic and some of it is being sort of re exported but i think what we ve seen is that they re using that oil to also sort of enhance their capacity and capabilities as a rapidly emerging refining power in asia and we see that in some ways in china too so china even though oil demand was down in 2022 much of the oil that they were buying from russia went into its strategic supplies which you know they now have access to and again i think you know a big question is what we re going to see moving forward around oil demand in china wood mackenzie just published a really interesting piece kind of very bullish on the expectations for oil demand in china so whether or not they re going to continue to buy you know russian oil and again sort of taking advantage of these lower prices you know and i think i think one of the things that it s kind of an inconvenient truth whereas a lot of this oil trading used to happen in europe so european trading houses were kind of the main the main points of russian oil trade a lot of that has been moved out so you know russia has found ways to kind of bypass some of the sanctions and have set up in some cases they ve set up trading houses and some of those trading houses have been sort of set up in places that you know that they can sort of again bypass the compliance to the sanctions and you have some you have some russian oil traders that are making a lot of money laughs selling discounted oil and then reselling it a really interesting case a couple of months ago was out of malaysia malaysia announced or in the you know that they were that 1 5 million barrels were produced and sold but only malaysia doesn t produce that much so those were russian barrels that were sort of being sold under sort of the malaysian under the malaysian barrel so again i think china and india have you know have taken advantage some of this has again as i said has been re exported and some of it you know has been re exported through petroleum products because china and india you know both are building and have refining capacity faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from bhakti mirchandani at columbia university what global trajectory do you see for nuclear the russia ukraine crisis has taken some of the refining capacity offline and nuclear has the potential to change the geopolitics of energy and so what steps can be taken to foster nuclear energy kissane bhakti thank you and i was just at columbia earlier today for the center for global energy policy s conference yeah nuclear is very interesting right so when we re thinking about you know decarbonizing our energy systems you know nuclear plays a very important role because it s zero emitting so in certain parts of the world china being one saudi arabia you know you have a lot of new nuclear build you know in other parts of the world you have a lot of contention about nuclear we saw that even in germany which have you know three remaining nuclear power plants and even in the midst of massive energy crisis over the last year there was still sort of pushback about no those nuclear power plants need to be shut down whereas you would think ok in light of energy insecurity let s keep them open so you know france is an interesting country france had planned to reduce its nuclear capacity by 50 percent but this past year they pivoted and they ve said no we re actually going to build out more nuclear and we re sort of we re totally scrapping that idea of reducing nuclear energy and nuclear is very important for france s electricity system sweden has also announced that they are going to build new nuclear and they re going to increase by i think almost 50 percent again part of this is their to meet their targets of net zero we also see japan japan you know the fukushima disaster really turned japanese the japanese public off of nuclear very very deep opposition to restarting the nuclear power plants but this past year even though there s still safety concerns on the part of the public the public is also very concerned about energy insecurity and higher prices so nuclear being a domestic source of energy so i think when you look at you know net zero pathways i have not seen a net zero pathway that does not include nuclear so here in the united states the net zero america project out of princeton very important place for nuclear we just have a really hard time laughs building nuclear at cost so it s very expensive usually it s significant cost overruns and of course there is the i think they have a really significant pr problem people there s still a lot of concern about the safety of nuclear so i think to your point it s very very important for decarbonizing energy systems but you re going to see i think very disjointed approaches some countries are going are embracing nuclear and other countries are sort of doubling down on their opposition and are not going to allow nuclear to be part of the energy system faskianos we have so many questions and we are just not going to get to them all so i m going to take the next question from christian bonfili who s at torcuato di tella university in argentina so do you think carolyn that the landscape resulting from the ukraine invasion by russia vis à vis securitization of gas and energy between europe and russia could accelerate energy transition toward greener energy kissane great question i think in europe it is and i think you know many analysts would agree that the iea for example you know you had the you know how does europe continue you know to enhance and achieve energy security without the dependence on russia gas and a lot of that is through renewable energy you also have a lot of new attention on hydrogen and the role that hydrogen will play i think i think europe is being cautious and so they are not saying that they are going to completely move away from gas so as earlier questions are they getting gas from algeria or are they getting gas from norway are they getting more gas from the united states in the form of liquefied natural gas and then also an uncomfortable truth is they continue to get liquefied natural gas from russia so we ve seen an increase in lng from russia going into europe that said i think all in you are seeing that you know countries across europe are saying ok you know how can we enhance our energy security how do we build more sort of domestic energy sources solar wind we re seeing you know more rapid deployment you ve got a lot of questions about supply chains and things like that but i think overall i think the answer would be that it s quickening the energy transition faskianos so i will take the moderator prerogative to just ask the final question for you to close on and just to give us your top three what are the major challenges for the geopolitics of oil as you look out over the next five to ten year horizon that you would leave us with to be looking for kissane ok you know so i think what we saw right tensions between saudi arabia and the united states we also have a you know a hot war cold war depending on you know the term you want to use between the united states and china and lots of sort of questions as to what that s going to look like i think there s you know i think there s concern that you know we re not reducing demands but we re seeing tightening supply and so that s going to have you know very significant impacts for economies especially economies that are already very fragile economically fragile politically fragile so that concerns me a lot in terms of you know what happens when you know economies don t have adequate access to energy to make sure that their industries that their that consumers you know are able that the lights can stay on and you can get you know if you re dependent on cars you re depending on trucks like all these kinds of things are really really critical so i think we have to be very cautious moving forward that we don t take more out of the system before we have adequately set up the system to be resilient and to be able to sort of meet the energy security demands that are not are not they re not decreasing i think they are increasing and becoming even more complex so i think there s a lot of concerns and a lot of uncertainty and you know this definitely is going to be an area to watch in the years ahead faskianos carolyn kissane kissane excuse me thank you very much for shaping and sharing this discussion for sharing your terrific insights with us and to all of you for your questions and comments i m really sorry that we could not get to them all

panel recommendations the panel found that alberta has the highest total per capita compensation for all public sector jobs compared to other large provinces mr speaker you cannot discuss a balanced budget without discussing public sector compensation more than half of taxpayer dollars in alberta are spent on staffing it s our largest single expense since 2015 the public sector grew by more than 10 000 full time equivalent positions and salaries grew by an average of 2 3 per cent per year albertans simply cannot afford this alberta can no longer afford to be the outlier in the nation therefore this government is acting on mackinnon panel recommendations to bring public sector compensation in line with comparable provinces we have a goal to reduce the overall cost of public sector staffing by 2 1 per cent over three years this is both responsible and fair and respects the realities of those working outside the public service more importantly it will ensure our ability to deliver the high quality services that albertans expect now and in the future that means that as collective bargaining begins with unions that represent 270 000 public sector workers there is no money for pay increases so again i ask the nurses and teachers and the dedicated professionals who serve albertans everyday work with us as partners to ensure a sustainable future for our public sector and the high quality services you deliver mr speaker for many years alberta has been the economic engine of the nation we have made a massive contribution to the national economy and to canadians standard of living by adding 100 billion to the national treasury in the last five years alone over that same time frame however adverse market conditions have been made worse by federal policies that have created uncertainty damaged conditions for investment and otherwise hindered the province s economic recovery fair deal panel during this most difficult period for the province in a generation our contributions to canada have not been reciprocated alberta is seeking a fair deal to address this imbalance the fair deal panel is listening to people across the province regarding a new arrangement for alberta within canada and will report back to our government this spring while we are challenged with our current federal government we do have a growing number of provincial allies on issues important to alberta with decisive leadership from our premier nine out of 10 provinces are supportive of energy and resource corridors nine out of 10 premiers share our opposition to bill c 69 the no more pipelines law and most provinces have joined us in opposing the federal carbon tax and on our request for a retroactive 2 4 billion fiscal stabilization payment alberta has the support of all 10 provinces after the federal election in october the prime minister offered words of concern for the west and in support of national unity unfortunately they ve only been words and albertans need to see real action so i call on our federal government to unequivocally and tangibly support growth in the canadian energy industry and our fair request for a retroactive fiscal stabilization payment mr speaker balancing the budget is critically important for our future as a province but budget 2020 is more than that it s about continuing the intentional direction set in budget 2019 a direction that s grounded in responsibility and confidence it s about delivering public services to albertans in a more modern cost effective and sustainable manner so they are available for future generations it s about laying a foundation for the future a foundation for economic growth prosperity and opportunity and once again i make a commitment to all albertans that this government will work relentlessly to create job opportunities and to get a fair deal for alberta in confederation mr speaker there are signs that in 2020 we will turn a corner and see real economic growth return to the alberta economy we are on track to balance the budget we are on track to bring investment and jobs back to alberta we are on track to transform service delivery and to protect the most vulnerable albertans are

hiruni a fisherman s wife who has to manage her household of five people with an income of about 2 5 euros 500 sri lankan rupees per day is heavily indebted in order to increase her household income she borrowed 50 000 rupees 250 euros from the lolc bank which specialises in micro credit with this money she started the production of insecticide treated mosquito nets as recommended by foundations such as bill gates which she sold for rs 2 000 eur 10 each for a while this worked but two factors beyond her control worked against her 1 the grossly abusive interest rate charged by lolc over 50 real interest rate and the huge penalties for late payments 2 a powerful commercial firm started selling imported nets at 25 less and payable in two installments hiruni was not able to withstand this competition because the price offered by this firm was lower than her production costs she had to stop production and marketing of nets and was no longer able to continue normal repayments this led her to contract another loan from another bank in order to resume payments to lolc hiruni is desperate and over indebted the imf imf international monetary fund along with the world bank the imf was founded on the day the bretton woods agreements were signed its first mission was to support the new system of standard exchange rates when the bretton wood fixed rates system came to an end in 1971 the main function of the imf became that of being both policeman and fireman for global capital it acts as policeman when it enforces its structural adjustment policies and as fireman when it steps in to help out governments in risk of defaulting on debt repayments as for the world bank a weighted voting system operates depending on the amount paid as contribution by each member state 85 of the votes is required to modify the imf charter which means that the usa with 17 68 of the votes has a de facto veto on any change the institution is dominated by five countries the united states 16 74 japan 6 23 germany 5 81 france 4 29 and the uk 4 29 the other 183 member countries are divided into groups led by one country the most important one 6 57 of the votes is led by belgium the least important group of countries 1 55 of the votes is led by gabon and brings together african countries s actions has a direct impact on the fate of hundreds of thousands of women like hiruni in sri lanka the imf supports the right of credit companies to set the rates they want in the name of freedom of prices and the market for years the imf has been pushing for an end to customs barriers protecting local producers whether farmers fishermen artisans or others this is one of the reasons why hiruni and others like her can no longer make a living out of what they produce the imf together with the world bank world bank wb the world bank was founded as part of the new international monetary system set up at bretton woods in 1944 its capital is provided by member states contributions and loans on the international money markets it financed public and private projects in third world and east european countries it consists of several closely associated institutions among which 1 the international bank for reconstruction and development ibrd 189 members in 2017 which provides loans in productive sectors such as farming or energy 2 the international development association ida 159 members in 1997 which provides less advanced countries with long term loans 35 40 years at very low interest 1 3 the international finance corporation ifc which provides both loan and equity finance for business ventures in developing countries as third world debt gets worse the world bank along with the imf tends to adopt a macro economic perspective for instance it enforces adjustment policies that are intended to balance heavily indebted countries payments the world bank advises those countries that have to undergo the imf s therapy on such matters as how to reduce budget deficits round up savings enduce foreign investors to settle within their borders or free prices and exchange rates and other international institutions also promotes the deregulation of the banking sector and micro credit it supports the right of credit companies to set the rates they want in the name of freedom of prices and the market this is why hiruni and so many others have to pay exorbitant interest rates interest rates when a lends money to b b repays the amount lent by a the capital as well as a supplementary sum known as interest so that a has an interest in agreeing to this financial operation the interest is determined by the interest rate which may be high or low to take a very simple example if a borrows 100 million dollars for 10 years at a fixed interest rate of 5 the first year he will repay a tenth of the capital initially borrowed 10 million dollars plus 5 of the capital owed i e 5 million dollars that is a total of 15 million dollars in the second year he will again repay 10 of the capital borrowed but the 5 now only applies to the remaining 90 million dollars still due i e 4 5 million dollars or a total of 14 5 million dollars and so on until the tenth year when he will repay the last 10 million dollars plus 5 of that remaining 10 million dollars i e 0 5 million dollars giving a total of 10 5 million dollars over 10 years the total amount repaid will come to 127 5 million dollars the repayment of the capital is not usually made in equal instalments in the initial years the repayment concerns mainly the interest and the proportion of capital repaid increases over the years in this case if repayments are stopped the capital still due is higher the nominal interest rate is the rate at which the loan is contracted the real interest rate is the nominal rate reduced by the rate of inflation the imf in collaboration with other international institutions put pressure on governments to privatize or close down public credit banks who were providing loans at reasonable usually subsidized rates i e without making profits which the imf and the world bank abhor this is another reason why hiruni and others cannot find credit from government sources to complete this negative picture one must add several conditionalities imposed by the imf s credit policy handed out to sri lanka like so many other countries the imf wants the government to reduce the public deficit by cutting social spending and reducing government staff as a result hiruni and millions of people in sri lanka witnessed the free education and health care drastically eroded indeed sri lanka is one of the few countries where health and education are still free in principle but the austerity measures imposed by the government in complicity with the imf mean that the real cost of education including primary education and basic health is constantly rising as school books and medicines have to be paid for and parents are also being pushed into private education and health care to escape the falling public service therefore poor families have to go into debt with micro credit agencies to meet school and health expenses and it is women who are most directly affected since they are primary responsible for ensuring education and health for their children the imf states that the government s decision to set a maximum interest interest an amount paid in remuneration of an investment or received by a lender interest is calculated on the amount of the capital invested or borrowed the duration of the operation and the rate that has been set rate of 35 on micro credit loans can only be temporary because the distortion sic of the functioning of the financial market financial market the market for long term capital it comprises a primary market where new issues are sold and a secondary market where existing securities are traded aside from the regulated markets there are over the counter markets which are not required to meet minimum conditions must be avoided the list of neo liberal measures recommended by the imf having a disastrous impact on the daily lives of millions of people in sri lanka and hundreds of millions worldwide is enormous and this will only change if the people get rid of the imf by electing such political forces in the government that have the will to bring radical solutions that ensure respect for social justice the enjoyment of human rights and respect for nature current imf policy in sri lanka in 2016 the neo liberal government of sri lanka appealed to the imf which in return pledged 1 600 million in credit on the condition that it would follow the imf s recommendations this programme is still being implemented and the balance balance end of year statement of a company s assets what the company possesses and liabilities what it owes in other words the assets provide information about how the funds collected by the company have been used and the liabilities about the origins of those funds sheet is entirely negative on 7 february 2020 an imf visit to sri lanka was concluded the press release of the washington based institution is highly significant the imf states that the government s decision to set a maximum interest rate of 35 on micro credit loans can only be temporary because the distortion sic of the functioning of the financial market must be avoided it should be noted that the government set such a ceiling as it was under pressure from the streets thousands of women victims of micro credit and its abusive rates had mobilized in the north of the country to demand that interest rates should not exceed 25 which remains an extremely high rate since the inflation inflation the cumulated rise of prices as a whole e g a rise in the price of petroleum eventually leading to a rise in salaries then to the rise of other prices etc inflation implies a fall in the value of money since as time goes by larger sums are required to purchase particular items this is the reason why corporate driven policies seek to keep inflation down rate is only 4 setting the maximum interest rate at 35 is a limited concession made by the government in view of the scale of the social drama and the risk of extending the mobilizations it should also be noted that in a very clear report the united nations independent expert on debt and human rights sounded the alarm about the dramatic situation experienced by the very many victims of micro credit in sri lanka his report written after completing a field mission was damning for the government financial institutions and other foreign donors he called on the government to act the volume of sri lanka s public debt has risen sharply over the past three years and now exceeds 90 of gdp gdp gross domestic product gross domestic product is an aggregate measure of total production within a given territory equal to the sum of the gross values added the measure is notoriously incomplete for example it does not take into account any activity that does not enter into a commercial exchange the gdp takes into account both the production of goods and the production of services economic growth is defined as the variation of the gdp from one period to another it should be recalled that the current imf arrangement dates back to 2016 however between 2016 and the end of 2018 public debt increased by 30 the government had tried to justify itself by claiming that it was pursuing a policy of poverty reduction and it should also be noted that the independent expert followed with keen interest the proceedings of the 7th south asia cadtm workshop held in colombo in april 2018 and that sri lankan social movements had submitted to him a public document at the time of his visit in august 2018 as a result of various forms of pressure exerted on it the government set a maximum rate of 35 although this rate is still completely exaggerated and must be characterized as usurious the imf has the audacity to state in its press release of 7 february 2020 that it is necessary to soon restore the right to freely set rates the imf also calls on the government to end as soon as possible the moratorium on the payment of debts of small and medium sized enterprises it must be said that following the terror attacks of april 2019 tourists have deserted sri lanka for months which has damaged the economy and in particular small and medium

largest single expense since 2015 the public sector grew by more than 10 000 full time equivalent positions and salaries grew by an average of 2 3 per cent per year albertans simply cannot afford this

is listening to people across the province regarding a new arrangement for alberta within canada and will report back to our government this spring while we are challenged with our current federal government we do have a growing number of provincial allies on issues important to alberta with decisive leadership from our premier nine out of 10 provinces are supportive of energy and resource corridors nine out of 10 premiers share our opposition to bill c 69 the no more pipelines law and most provinces have joined us in opposing the federal carbon tax and on our request for a retroactive 2 4 billion fiscal stabilization payment alberta has the support of all 10 provinces after the federal election in october the prime minister offered words of concern for the west and in support of national unity unfortunately they ve only been words and albertans need to see real action so i call on our federal government to unequivocally and tangibly support growth in the canadian energy industry and our fair request for a retroactive fiscal stabilization payment mr speaker balancing the budget is critically important for our future as a province but budget 2020 is more than that it s about continuing the intentional direction set in budget 2019 a direction that s grounded in responsibility and confidence it s about delivering public services to albertans in a more modern cost effective and sustainable manner so they are available for future generations it s about laying a foundation for the future a foundation for economic growth prosperity and opportunity and once again i

pad at nig in late november increased production while funds flow benefitted from the increase in production and from an improvement in natural gas prices at aeco and station 2 construction continued on the nig gas plant which was completed and started up february 22 2020 previously expected to be in january 2020 production at 22 375 boe per day was an increase of 20 from the previous quarter and was largely unchanged from the previous year production was reduced by approximately 500 boe per day due to curtailments in october as a result of the low station 2 price 0 36 per gj liquids production field condensate plus gas plant ngl increased 2 from last year to total 4 262 barrels per day represented 19 of total production and contributed 33 of production revenue a four well pad at nig started production in late november with initial rates from the three wells in the upper mid montney being the same as earlier wells however longer term rates are expected to be lower given tighter interwell spacing on the newest wells 400 metres versus 465 metres for earlier wells the fourth well in the lower montney has a higher condensate rate while the gas rate is lower ip90 5 5 mmcf per day raw gas plus 315 barrels per day field condensate revenue was 23 64 per boe a decline of 12 60 per boe or 35 from last year mainly from lower ngl and natural gas prices the ngl price declined 83 as a result of lower north american propane prices and a reduction in the contracted plant gate price for propane and butane during the current marketing period from april 2019 to march 2020 the natural gas price declined 41 as a result of lower pricing in the chicago and sumas markets 66 of sales production general and administrative and interest and finance costs were 7 08 per boe a year over year increase of 0 62 per boe with interest expense increasing 0 26 per boe higher debt level associated with funding construction of the nig gas plant and production cost increasing 0 21 per boe inflation escalator increasing third party gas processing fees plus the scheduled increase in bc carbon tax in april 2019 hedging loss of 1 6 million resulted from sumas price hedges that were entered into before a failure on the enbridge t south pipeline in october 2018 which decreased throughput and increased the sumas price repairs completed late november 2019 funds flow was 18 5 million or 0 15 per share with the year over year decrease of 40 per share largely the result of revenue being reduced by lower commodity prices net income was 2 9 million compared to 26 8 million in the prior year with the decline primarily attributable to lower commodity prices reducing revenue and funds flow capital investment of 24 million included 19 million for the nig gas plant project plus 3 million to pipeline connect a four well pad at nig investment was less than guidance 32 to 37 million with 9 million for the construction of the nig gas plant being shifted into the first quarter of 2020 as a result of delays in equipment deliveries damage to a bridge south of fort st john in late november required loads to be rerouted total debt including working capital deficiency was 129 million or 1 7 times annualized quarterly funds flow and represents 63 utilization of the 205 million bank line the year over year increase in total debt is a result of the large investment in the nig gas plant project in 2019 which totaled 61 million 63 of total investment commodity price hedges currently protect approximately 29 of forecast production in the first half of 2020 and 7 in the second half of 2020 2019 year end highlights production and funds flow were below initial guidance provided in november 2018 mainly as a result of unplanned outages lower ngl pricing for the contract year starting april 2019 and from production curtailments due to low natural gas prices during the summer as forecast funds flow declined during 2019 capital investment was reduced which resulted in fewer montney

previous year and was below initial guidance provided in november 2018 21 000 to 24 000 boe per day mainly as a result of 31 days of unplanned outages at the mcmahon gas plant and production

canadian pricing aeco daily index 1 67 per gj and station 2 0 96 per gj as a result of diversified sales during 2019 seven horizontal wells started production and contributed approximately 2 600 boe per day to average annual production and 4 700 boe per day to fourth quarter production production general and administrative and interest and finance costs were 7 48 per boe an increase of 0 59 per boe largely as a result of the year over year decline in production caused by unplanned outages also contributing to the increase is higher interest expense associated with higher debt levels to fund construction of the nig gas plant and higher production cost with the inflation escalator increasing third party gas processing fees funds flow of 60 million 8 09 per boe declined 40 from the previous year mainly from lower commodity prices reducing revenue per boe by 22 net income of 11 million 1 55 per boe declined 72 from the previous year primarily as a result of the decline in funds flow

completing a horizontal well for acid gas injection 11 million in 2018 61 million in 2019 14 million in 2020 the estimated cost was increased to 86 million in november 2019 from 81 million as a result of the cost for site construction being higher than forecast and design changes at full capacity incremental production from the gas plant versus processing at the mcmahon gas plant is expected to be 1 500 boe per day 70 liquids given the higher ngl recovery and reduced gas shrinkage in addition eliminating third party processing fees will result in an operating cost of less than 2 00 per boe

60 of forecast natural gas production in 2020 will be sold into us markets and the remaining 40 in western canadian markets natural gas prices at aeco and station 2 have improved since last september as a result of declining supply and low storage levels in addition the aeco station 2 price differential has improved to average 0 09 per gj to date in 2020 versus 0 70 per gj in 2019 as a result of restoring capacity on the enbridge t south pipeline in late november 2019 after the completion of repairs and inspections following a failure in october 2018 also helping the differential is the start up of the tc energy north montney extension on january 31st which will ultimately increase exports from ne bc by up to 1 5 bcf per day contracted capacity although the pricing outlook has become more optimistic that could reverse if supply growth restarts given the loss of market share in eastern markets lower aeco price is required to incentivise higher exports from western canada to eastern markets storm s ngl price is expected to improve in 2020 based on indications for contracted plant gate pricing for butane and propane for the next contract year which starts in april the ngl price during the current contract period april 2019 to march 2020 has averaged approximately 7 of wti versus 42 of wti in the previous contract period april 2018 to march 2019 this reduced 2019 funds flow by approximately 10 million using the current forward strip the price is expected to improve to approximately 20 of wti for the next contract period april 2020 to march 2021 also contributing to the lower ngl price in 2019 was weaker north american propane prices conway averaged us 0 47 per gallon in 2019 versus us 0 72 in 2018 and is currently approximately us 0 40 the near term growth plan is expected to increase liquids as a proportion of total production and decrease per boe operating costs depending on capital investment and the number of wells drilled and completed in 2020 production is forecast to grow to 25 000 to 30 000 boe per day by the fourth quarter of 2020 at the mid point the year over year increase in fourth quarter total production is forecast to be 23 with liquids production increasing by 36 the start of production from fireweed in late 2020 or early 2021 will further increase liquids production as a proportion of total production with capital investment intended to be approximately equal to funds flow investment may be adjusted depending on commodity prices which would change the timing for growth over the last three years funds flow per share has been largely unchanged as a result of declining commodity prices however production has grown by 26 per share pdp reserves have grown by 28 per share the pdp recycle ratio has averaged 1 6 using the funds flow netback and annual return on capital employed has been between 4 and 10 capital investment decisions will continue to emphasize both per share growth along with a return on invested capital the business plan continues to focus on increasing asset value per share by converting resource into per share growth of funds flow and reserves value this has been challenging in the current price environment where commodity prices have been volatile and have trended lower over the last several years success in this environment is expected to continue being dependent on improving capital efficiencies better wells for the same or lower cost and finding ways to offset the effect of declining commodity prices reducing production costs and or increasing liquids production to increase revenue with 2p reserves recognized only in the upper montney on approximately 25 of the total land position there remains significant longer term upside i appreciate the considerable and relentless

amin stepped into the shower in his home in a suburb of damascus after putting wood logs in the heater to warm the water to bathe the bathroom was lit with a lightbulb connected to a battery as he undressed he saw the black marks still visible on his body ten months have passed since he was held in detention in one secret police facility after another and tortured for suspected anti regime activity memories of the torture rushed through his mind as he showered he got dressed and stepped out into the frigid house the power was off as temperatures dropped to around freezing across syria the electricity is cut off for much of the day like most syrians amin cannot afford to heat his home the latest economic crisis in syria is hitting the population hard syrians have been beset by currency depreciation soaring prices for basic goods and energy shortages that have left people to freeze in the harsh winter leading to growing and increasingly vocal discontent people are struggling to make ends meet as has been made clear by interviews conducted over the phone and via messaging apps with a diverse group of civilians and combatants in different areas under assad regime control syrians like malak a state employee camilla a christian student oubab an alawi supporter of the regime and others many have resorted to working second jobs some of them illicit reducing consumption to the bare minimum even for necessities like food heating and healthcare multiple interviewees described seeing more child laborers beggars prostitutes and people scavenging through dumpsters looking for food than ever before these conversations reveal that despair over the economic situation cuts across boundaries of political loyalty and even encompasses the regime s base syrians whether regime supporters opponents or apolitical express anger toward those on top who are enriching themselves while people starve most syrians do not trust the government s ability to dig the country out of the current crisis but just as many see little hope for an alternative or think the regime will collapse or reform due to economic pressure the belief underlying the wide ranging sanctions imposed by the west the trigger for the latest depreciation of the syrian lira in december and january is the economic crisis in neighboring lebanon on whose banking system syria depends on jan 12 2020 the lira traded on the black market below 1 000 lira to the dollar for the first time the currency has depreciated further since causing the price of basic goods such as sugar tea and vegetables to shoot up all areas of syria have been deeply affected by the economic crisis but areas under damascus direct control have witnessed a particularly sharp rise in prices due to dependency on trade with lebanon and lack of access to other currencies such as the turkish lira and u s dollar which are used more widely in areas under the control of the opposition the turkish backed factions and the syrian democratic forces the recent depreciation of the lira and subsequent decline in living standards follow years of economic deterioration in syria the lira lost about 95 percent of its pre war value against the dollar as exports plummeted foreign direct investment cratered and tourism all but vanished the destruction and unraveling of business ties underpinning syria s useful economy replaced by a war economy and profiteering mass flight of the educated elite and physical destruction of the country all contributed to the economic crisis sanctions imposed by the united states and european union played a less significant role but their impact is felt particularly in the energy products sector contributing to shortages of fuel the sanctions on the banking system imposed by the arab league the eu the u s and other countries also increased syria s dependency on lebanon as a trading and banking hub making it more vulnerable to economic shocks in the small neighboring country pinching pennies the poverty is crushing 83 percent of syria s population was already living below the poverty line before the latest depreciation related crisis even the supposed victors of the war those deemed to be regime loyalists are living in misery as oubab an alawi supporter of the government who lives on the coast explained people are down to the basics they are not cutting entertainment or things like this for the vast majority all of this is gone they are cutting what s on their table for breakfast loubna a state employee who lives near qardaha and is also a member of the alawi sect described the situation in her community people can t even afford to buy bulgur coffee and tea are considered a luxury now extremely poor people would wait until the end of the day for leftover vegetables almost rotten to take them from shops something that animals would barely eat in the city i witnessed children and women scavenging through the garbage for food syrians are now forced to choose between spending money on sustenance and addressing urgent medical needs the state is unable to provide proper services even in major hospitals in the capital which provide the best care available in syria i work in one of the largest hospitals in damascus the state does not have the capacity to provide it with medical equipment said abdul raham a doctor medical gauze injections intubation tubes many types of medicine and other medical goods are missing and the patient is required to bring them if they want to receive care we tell them to go to the pharmacy nearby and buy it wissam an accountant living in damascus whose father is a dentist reported that recently some of my father s patients told him they can no longer come because they don t have enough money they apologize and say they prefer losing their teeth rather than failing to buy food for their children syrian youth with with umbrella walking to get fuel for heating in winter weather february 2020 photo by baderkhan ahmad barcroft media via getty images energy crisis the winter cold is hitting the population particularly hard as in previous winters the country is experiencing prolonged electricity shortages but this winter due to a severe shortage of fuel products especially gas and diesel conditions are even worse there are sometimes fights that end in death between people waiting in line for gas diesel and bread the police break them up by firing into the air reported malak a state employee who lives in deir ezzor city destroyed by years of syrian and russian air force bombing camila a christian student residing in damascus said people here only shower once or twice a week for lack of warm water and electricity oubab the regime supporter described how the population is dealing with the lack of electricity and shortage of gas people cover up using extra blankets and wearing more clothes if you are lucky and have space in your home you would burn some chunks of wood oubab is lucky because he at least has some gas but i don t want to waste the cylinder i have because i m not sure i ll be able to get another one soon we have children coming to visit some days so we save it for when they come i just hope the winter ends soon the fuel shortage is also affecting public transportation widely used by poor and middle class syrians who cannot afford their own vehicle or private taxis many are now forced to rely on walking instead bassam a student from hama who studies in damascus now usually walks to the university 25 minutes away due to the lack of buses it s better to walk than to wait for a bus for one hour or maybe even two he said the drivers always complain about the government not providing them with enough fuel said bassam some drivers simply stop working while others purchase fuel on the black market but prices there are three times as high as the fuel sold by the state the fuel crisis is affecting daily life in more subtle ways forcing uncomfortable male female interactions in the gutted public transport system when the buses do come the competition to land a seat is fierce creating tense moments i don t know how to describe to you the scene when men and women in a conservative society scrambled for a seat on the bus as if it was going to heaven bassam joked rebellious communities particularly affected the physical and economic devastation of syria is having an especially severe impact in former rebel controlled communities reconquered by the regime and its allies these areas were devastated by years of heavy bombing and have not seen any major reconstruction the regime does not prioritize reconstruction or restoration of services in these areas and instead pressures the un to funnel projects to areas it deems loyal services such as water electricity and healthcare have improved only marginally since the armed opposition was expelled with some exceptions in some areas such as eastern ghouta even those who prefer the regime and remained behind complain things have gotten worse due to the cutoff in support provided to these communities by international humanitarian ngos operating cross border omar who lives in western daraa in a town once controlled by the rebels and later by an isis affiliate reported that many locals cannot even afford the subsidized bread sold in government bakeries bread costs 50 lira 5 cents but people cannot even afford that some families simply are unable to afford daily subsistence electricity comes on for two hours after being cut off for 12 hours a significantly worse situation than areas that witnessed little fighting the average there is two hours of electricity after a four hour cutoff people cannot afford to heat their home and schools don t have heating either reported omar significant restrictions on freedom of movement remain in some areas that were once under rebel control for example men in eastern ghouta cannot leave unless they receive security approval which is often not granted even to patients suffering from life threatening illnesses who need care only available in nearby damascus this means that men in the area who fail to obtain security approval are cut off from the capital where many ghouta residents once worked the presence of arrest or conscription warrants for large numbers of men in formerly rebel held areas creates another layer of isolation or disconnection between areas that have historically been economically interconnected amer a former rebel with fursan al jolan an israeli backed free syrian army faction decided to remain in jubatha al khashab after the regime s takeover relying on promises that once he went through the process of settling his status with the regime he would be in the clear but they lied to us they arrested people who left jubatha at checkpoints their fate is still unknown amer and other young men in the village remain trapped inside where work opportunities are incredibly scarce i worked one day per week in the olive groves i received 2 000 lira less than 2 daily this is nothing and now they don t need workers anymore because the olive picking season is over and yet leaving jubatha and seeking work in damascus or elsewhere could mean arrest and torture the regime s reduced ability to support the agricultural sector is preventing locals trapped in their towns from relying on agriculture as a source of income hamoudeh a former rebel in a different faction backed by israel living in heet southern daraa is also unemployed despite the richness of the soil in the area there isn t much work in agriculture because the government is not providing enough fertilizer like before and diesel is extremely expensive when asked if he can go work in damascus he laughed i can t even go to daraa city and you re talking about damascus hamoudeh went through the so called reconciliation process with the regime and settled his status but then it turned out that i am still wanted by multiple secret police branches so we are just scraping by to earn enough to get a packet of cigarettes he said resilience in the face of these challenges syrians have been relying on the ingenuity and social solidarity that have gotten them through the war thus far interviewees described planting vegetables in home gardens or on balconies to reduce reliance on purchased goods malak in deir ezzor city said people are building ovens for wood which they use for heating and then we cook on top of them too we also started making bread at home to save money jassem a regime opponent who lives in the daraa countryside said that his uncle who lives in their town and is relatively well off asked me and a group of activists to identify families in need and purchased diesel for them of course without taking any credit for it as our religion prescribes donations have also come from residents of the town who live in the gulf profiteering corruption and sectarianism the sharp decline in the value of state salaries is prompting state employees to take second jobs but also to demand bribes or increase the amounts they were already extracting maher an employee at one of the un organizations in damascus believes that the reason for the crisis is corruption i see millions in un funds that are supposed to go for aid instead going for bribery this money could have helped the population a great deal according to hussein who works for a technology company but also as a waiter to help make ends meet bribes increased a lot recently we used to pay 4 000 lira just under 4 each month to an employee in the ministry of finance in exchange for paperwork that allows the company to import products and carry out transactions in dollars but recently he asked for 6 500 lira 6 and other employees are doing the same the practice of demanding bribes has become widespread to a scary degree in all of syria s cities said bassam the hamawi university student and regime opponent small kickbacks are often necessary to facilitate paperwork in all government institutions employees are refusing to provide service unless you give bribes bribery affects more important matters as well says bassam based on personal experience i can tell you that judges in civilian cases are asking for bribes to affect their rulings regime supporters opponents and those in between who reside in regime held areas blame profiteers close to the regime for contributing to the crisis the ostentatious display of wealth of the profiteers and particularly their children is the subject of much anger on social media and in private high ranking officials they and their families have more rights they roam the city in fancy cars and do whatever they want half of the country is dying from hunger while the sons of officials are arrogantly showing off their wealth said hassan an alawi resident of lattakia in my job i see how some people come and pay up to 120 000 lira over 100 in one night which is double my monthly income said hussein he supports neither the regime nor the opposition and had to get a second job as a waiter in a fancy restaurant in a posh part of damascus which according to him serves terrible food they come for the social status of this place most of them are alawi young men and women who are not from damascus they come with fancy cars and bodyguards and it is obvious they are from warlords families he says he has to wake up every day at 7am and walk for 40 minutes because public transportation is expensive and i can t find a seat most of the time he then works from 8am until 10 pm between his two jobs the overrepresentation of members of the alawi sect among the impoverished state employees now increasingly relying on bribes to make ends meet and among the profiteers close to the regime is stoking sectarian rumblings among some sunnis three sunnis interviewed for this report incorrectly claimed that electricity is more widely available in coastal alawi areas of syria compared to major sunni towns such as hama and damascus the key role played by alawi men in combat on behalf of the assad regime means that a disproportionate share of them have been killed throughout the war to reward its loyalists the regime provides jobs in the public sector to the immediate relatives of martyrs further boosting the representation of alawis among state employees the benefits they accrue from these jobs are minimal but for impoverished sunnis the alawi state petty bureaucrats demanding small kickbacks are creating further resentment bassam who is sunni lived in a neighborhood in damascus with an alawi majority he believes that demanding bribes is a way for alawis to overcome their living conditions especially if you keep in mind that most state employees are members of the sect while no statistics are available about the sectarian background of state employees it is unlikely that members of a sect that makes up at most 13 percent of syrian society can account for most state employees syria s economic breakdown endows the wealthy and well connected with massive power to shape the economy to their advantage extracting whatever is left in syrians pockets they are not the ones being targeted in the police raids on price gougers though oubab the regime supporter who lives in a coastal city described how prices fluctuate rapidly in the market anyone can price anything for whatever price he wants you go buy 10 eggs with 500 lira only to find out they re now selling them for 600 prices jump daily for no clear reason sometimes it s not related to the dollar he explained if you have a chicken farm the biggest one in tartus and you are close to regime officials you may wake up and say okay i think i will increase the prices today by 20 percent because why not as small and medium sized businesses face financial ruin due to the crisis the government will go after the small shops not after the guy who increased the prices in the first place he added all syrians are left to do is joke about how syrians chickens are getting paid in u s dollars but for those profiteering things couldn t be better he remarked bitterly as he watched his breath condense into vapor in the cold air inside his home the temperature was close to freezing and the electricity was out people responsible for this situation are those in the upper echelons said loubna an alawi state employee speaking from her home near qardaha the birthplace of hafez and bashar al assad frankly it s him and his family immediate or extended they don t care about the people also maybe those few extremely powerful merchants and businessmen a merchant arranges stacks of syrian pounds at a market in qamishli on september 10 2019 the declining value of the pound is a sure sign of syria s ailing economy photo by delil souleiman afp via getty images subsidies the economic crisis has made syrians increasingly dependent on the regime long lines stretch outside state bakeries which sell bread for 50 lira 5 cents as more and more citizens cannot afford to purchase bread from private bakeries or shops which sell it for 100 150 lira 10 15 cents in an attempt to deal with the crisis starting in february 2020 the syrian government began distributing subsidized food products such as sugar and rice using smart cards these were introduced in august 2019 to sell at first petroleum products such as benzene and diesel and later cooking gas the card allows holders to purchase 60 liters of benzene per week for private cars 150 liters for taxis and 400 liters of diesel and one cooking gas cylinder for families the new regulations allow families to purchase up to three kilograms of subsidized rice four kilograms of sugar and one kilogram of tea per month quantities that are insufficient for a typical syrian family the regime also took punitive steps making trade in any other currency punishable by seven years of hard labor and even banning discussions or reporting on the real black market exchange rate police raided and closed shops of profiteers most of them small traders struggling to survive opponents of the regime naturally do not believe the state can handle the crisis but even those who prefer the assad regime over other alternatives see the latest steps as mere band aids on a gaping wound i think after they fell into this deep hole they cannot really solve anything the hole is very deep they are utterly incapable said loubna the alawi state employee syria is a failed state worse than somalia said oubab who supports the regime everyone thinks that there is nothing that can be done to fix it the future plans of most people are to leave the country or help their kids leave the country when they grow up sanctions sanctions have played a role in syria s economic hardship but they have been largely secondary to the effects of the regime s self cannibalizing military and economic policies these have been felt most acutely in the energy sector where they have contributed to shortages of fuel in december the u s congress passed the caesar syria civilian protection act which imposes sanctions on companies involved in reconstruction and syria s energy sector as well as any entities involved in the war effort the impact of the law will likely be felt in the medium and long term according to economic experts preventing reconstruction and the return of direct foreign investments the thinking among u s officials articulated in public and private indicates that they believe that a popular uprising is unlikely to emerge in syria instead they are hoping that immense economic pressure is eventually going to take money away from the war machine and that the declining value of state salaries will starve the regime into collapsing from within the war machine does not appear to be significantly affected as the regime channels its limited resources to combat god help the people who don t have heating in this cold weather said jamil a syrian army soldier posted in palmyra he was sitting in a warm room heated by diesel provided by the army his family back home in homs city where he participated in the peaceful protests in 2011 as a child was not so lucky he survived six years of siege under the regime yet did not appear to be contemplating defection his family relied on his meager salary for survival those who defect from the service are shot dead if caught and their relatives are arrested laith a member of a pro regime syrian militia reported that while syrians are struggling to feed themselves their service rations have not been affected the use of fuel for transportation has been restricted but only far from the front lines at the beginning of february the syrian government announced it was increasing the rations of syrian army soldiers by 33 percent abdul rahman a doctor employed in a state hospital for a monthly salary of 70 and an ardent regime opponent does not believe the sanctions will be effective however even people who hate the regime will not defect from it we have lost hope in the countries that abandoned the syrian people including the united states in iraq following the imposition of sanctions and years of war the iraqi dinar depreciated to such an extent that monthly public worker salaries were worth just 2 3 between 1993 and 1999 state employees worked multiple jobs and slacked off at their official place of employment but no mass defections occurred there do not appear to be cracks in the leadership of the regime even as they increasingly complain to confidants about challenges in carrying out their business dealings those at the top of syria s economic pyramid continue benefitting from the war economy and the growing impunity it affords looting of areas recaptured from the rebels or isis has been systematized to a great degree benefiting ordinary soldiers but even more so high ranking officers and businessmen the top raw material export from syria in 2017 was copper in a country with no copper deposits syrian regime forces systematically rip copper pipes cables and wiring from areas they loot to extract underground power cables soldiers set gasoline alight on the asphalt to melt it and make it easier for bulldozers to dig the cables out the smoke from the burning asphalt can be seen for miles even once the war is over the core of the regime s oppressive apparatus the secret police and military police will likely be able to continue sucking the population dry a major source of income for members of the secret police is accepting enormous bribes in exchange for information promises of proper treatment or release of political detainees umm abdallah a former resident of maarat al numan spoke of selling her family home to pay a bribe to secure the release of her son only to find out in 2019 that he was killed under torture five years earlier the military police often arrests men wanted for military service for the purpose of extracting bribes from their relatives in exchange for their release the sanctions will cripple almost everyone but bashar and his crew said laith the pro regime militiaman when asked about the challenges the elite is facing in doing business he responded everyone is of course struggling at some level these people are struggling but they still have a suit on while poor people have no clean or warm clothing to put on the lower rungs of the regime and state apparatus do not appear to see any alternatives but sustained financial pressure could potentially lead to a palace coup if those around assad come to believe that they would be financially better off without him the crippling sanctions regime placed on baghdad in the 1990s led to an increase in coup attempts particularly among officers from al anbar increasingly marginalized by saddam all the coups failed while coups are difficult to predict the leadership of the syrian regime dominated by secret police commanders is invested in maintaining the repressive apparatus in whose crimes they are all deeply implicated the damascus regime also created multiple secret police branches and various militias to prevent any one actor from amassing too much power and being able to overthrow its head popular discontent the widespread dissatisfaction with the regime s economic policies has become more visible yet is circumscribed by a clear red line that those living in regime held areas see no benefit in crossing namely calls for a change in the regime itself many of the interviewees mention that complaining online and offline about services and corruption has become normalized and even speaking about the role of the regime in the crisis is becoming more acceptable people have started cursing the regime in the streets said omar who lives in western daraa comments on pro regime facebook pages and groups also often include quite explicit criticism of the regime for its economic policies and corruption protests also broke out in sweida a druze majority area under loose regime control and there have been small protests in latakia city and damascus as well the protests and online comments however pertain to the government s economic policies and do not call for political rights or regime change they are simply demanding better living conditions foreswearing what seem like the unachievable goal of political change such change is even seen as a threat and source of destabilization for a beaten down population that craves stability above all else after years of war on the second day of protests in shahba sweida when a protester shouted we want to call for freedom the microphone was quickly taken away from him the protesters wanted to focus only on their simple chant we want to live others avoid calls for the fall of the regime due to fear even those in sweida who merely called for improvements in living conditions avoided showing their faces in photos posted online nearly all of those interviewed regardless of political preferences did not believe a new uprising is likely any protests in syria will be met with maximum force right away they are preparing for every scenario and now have much better experience at crushing protests said oubab in the eyes of his community he says the destabilization of the regime through sanctions is intended to install an opposition that is hostile to the mere existence of alawis we will not accept the opposition no matter how bad things get the opposition is basically threatening us with genocide people are demoralized they think that by imposing sanctions these countries including the united states want us to move into the streets only to be killed said abdul rahman the doctor who lives in damascus and has been jailed multiple times for anti regime activities camila the christian student in damascus believes that that the people who are still living in syria in government areas are too scared to do or say anything and eight years of living like it has made people numb to it the people who were brave enough to speak up either lost their lives or had to leave syria all names of syrians in the report have been altered to protect them from regime reprisal elizabeth tsurkov is a fellow at the foreign policy research institute follow her on twitter elizrael suhail al ghazi is a syrian

telbec innergex renewable energy inc ine innergex or the corporation today released its operating and financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended december 31 2019 the increases in revenues and adjusted ebitda for continuing operations are mainly due to the acquisition of the remaining 62 in the cartier wind farms in october 2018 and the commissioning of the foard city wind farm and the phoebe solar farm in 2019 i am extremely proud of the many successes we achieved in 2019 we began the year with the strategic divestment of our icelandic interests and seamlessly integrated the seven large acquisitions we made in 2018 into our operations we ended the year thrilled with our many accomplishments including the commissioning of two major projects in texas and the advancement of seven other projects in various stages of development said michel letellier president and chief executive officer of innergex while 2020 has just kicked off we are already excited for the year ahead with the recent strategic alliance signed with hydro québec in february that will accelerate our mutual growth objectives and share the benefits from our complementary skills experience and knowledge additionally hydro québec has invested 661 million in innergex through a private placement of 34 6 million shares we are eagerly looking forward to pursue our strategic growth with the support of such

22 compared with the same quarter last year production was 93 of the lta hydroelectric facilities 73 of their lta wind farms 102 of their lta and solar farms 97 of their lta the 4 increase in revenues mainly stems from the contribution of the foard city wind farm commissioned on september 27 2019 and the phoebe solar farm commissioned on november 19 2019 and to higher production at the french wind facilities partly offset by lower production at the british columbia hydro facilities and lower average selling price and lower production at some quebec hydro facilities the adjusted ebitda was stable mainly due to higher revenues in the wind power generation segment and the solar power generation segment offset by a decrease in the hydroelectric power generation segment from lower revenues in british columbia and quebec the adjusted ebitda margin decreased from 74 7 to 72 2 for the three month period due mainly to lower production at the hydro facilities and lower revenues at the mesgi g ugju s n facility due to lower production the 5 increase in revenues proportionate and 14 increase in adjusted ebitda proportionate are mainly due to higher contribution from the wind facilities in texas and british columbia partly offset by lower revenues from the chile hydro facilities the increase in adjusted ebitda proportionate is also due to ptcs generated by the foard city wind project following its commissioning on september 27 2019 and higher ptc contribution from higher production at the wind facilities in texas for the three month period ended december 31 2019 the corporation recorded a net loss from continuing operations of 48 0 million basic and diluted net loss from continuing operations of 0 35 per share compared with net earnings from continuing operations of 18 8 million basic and diluted net earnings from continuing operations of 0 11 per share for the corresponding period in 2018 the 66 9 million variation can be explained by a 91 0 million increase in income tax expenses a 49 8 million unfavourable variation in unrealized net loss gain on financial instruments a 10 7 million increase in depreciation and amortization a 10 0 million decrease in the share of earnings of joint ventures and associates a 8 2 million impairment of project development costs and a 6 0 million increase in finance costs these items were partly offset by a 108 9 million increase in other net revenues and a 0 1 million increase in adjusted ebitda twelve month period ended december 31 2019 production increased 28 and production proportionate increased 26 compared with the same period last year production was 96 of the lta hydroelectric facilities 88 of their lta wind farms 103 of their lta and solar farms 99 of their lta the 16 increase in revenues mainly stems from the contribution of the 62 remaining interest in the cartier wind farms acquired in october 2018 higher production at the french wind facilities the contribution of the recently commissioned foard city wind farm and the phoebe solar farm partly offset by lower production at most british columbia and quebec hydro facilities the 16 increase in adjusted ebitda is mainly due to higher revenues in the wind and solar power generation segments partly offset by lower revenues in the hydroelectric power generation segment the adjusted ebitda margin increased from 73 2 to 73 5 for the twelve month period mainly explained by changes in the mix of segments as wind generation now represents a higher proportion of adjusted ebitda wind activities typically have a better return on revenues than hydro due to lower operating costs the 17 increase in revenues proportionate and 21 increase in adjusted ebitda proportionate are mainly due to the investment in energía llaima higher contribution from the british columbia hydro facilities and higher revenues at the wind facilities in texas and british columbia the increase in adjusted ebitda proportionate is also due to higher ptc contribution from higher generation at the wind facilities in texas and to the ptcs generated by the foard city wind project following its commissioning on september 27 2019 for the twelve month period ended december 31 2019 the corporation recorded a net loss from continuing operations of 53 0 million basic and diluted net loss from continuing operations of 0 40 per share compared with net earnings from continuing operations of 26 2 million basic and diluted net earnings from continuing operations of 0 20 per share for the corresponding period in 2018 the 79 2 million variation can be explained by a 91 6 million increase in income tax expenses a 62 9 million unfavourable variation in unrealized net loss gain on financial instruments a 43 3 million increase in depreciation and amortization a 35 9 million increase in finance costs an 11 1 million decrease in the share of earnings of joint ventures and associates and an 8 2 million impairment of project development costs these items were partly offset by a 116 8 million increase in other net revenues and a 57 0 million increase in adjusted ebitda free cash flow and payout ratio for the trailing twelve month period ended december 31 2019 the corporation generated free cash flow of 93 3 million compared with 105 1 million for the corresponding period last year the decrease in free cash flow is due mainly to greater scheduled debt principal payments and a decrease in cash flows from operating activities before changes in non cash working capital items for the trailing twelve month period ended december 31 2019 the dividends on common shares declared by the corporation amounted to 102 of free cash flow compared with 86 for the corresponding period last year this change results mainly from higher dividend payments as a result of the issuance of 24 327 225 shares on february 6 2018 related to the alterra acquisition an increase in the quarterly dividend additional shares issued under the

operating head the technology employed and the reserved aesthetic and ecological flows for wind energy the historical wind and meteorological conditions and turbine technology and for solar energy the historical solar irradiation conditions panel technology and expected solar panel degradation other factors considered include without limitation site topography installed capacity energy losses operational features and maintenance although production will fluctuate from year to year over an extended period it should approach the estimated lta on a consolidated basis the corporation estimates

failure or unexpected operations and maintenance activity natural disasters and force majeure regulatory and political risks affecting production health safety and environmental risks affecting production variability of installation performance and related penalties availability and reliability of transmission systems litigation projected revenues for each facility expected annual revenues are estimated by multiplying the lta by a price for electricity stipulated in the ppa secured with a public utility or other creditworthy counterparty in most cases these ppas stipulate a base price for electricity produced and in some cases a price adjustment depending on the month day and hour of its delivery this excludes facilities that receive revenues based on the market or spot price for electricity including the foard city shannon and flat top wind farms the phoebe solar farm and the miller creek hydroelectric facility which receives a price based on a formula using the platts mid c pricing indices and the horseshoe bend hydroelectric facility for which 85 of the price is fixed and 15 is adjusted annually as determined by the idaho public utility commission in most cases ppas

alternative to net cash provided by operating activities which is determined in accordance with gaap subsidiary distributions are important to the parent company because the parent company is a holding company that does not derive any significant direct revenues from its own activities but instead relies on its subsidiaries business activities and the resultant distributions to fund the debt service investment and other cash needs of the holding company the reconciliation of the difference between the subsidiary distributions and net cash provided by operating activities consists of cash generated from operating activities that is retained at the subsidiaries for a variety of reasons which are both discretionary and non discretionary in nature these factors include but are not limited to retention of cash to fund capital expenditures at the subsidiary cash retention associated with non recourse debt covenant restrictions and related debt service requirements at the subsidiaries

parent company plus available borrowings under existing credit facility plus cash at qualified holding companies qhcs aes believes that unconsolidated parent company liquidity is important to the liquidity position of aes as a parent company because of the non recourse nature of most of aes indebtedness 3 the cash held at qhcs represents cash sent to subsidiaries of the company domiciled outside of the us such subsidiaries had no contractual restrictions on their ability to send cash to aes the parent company cash at those subsidiaries was used for investment and related activities outside of the us these investments included equity investments and loans to other foreign subsidiaries as well as development and general costs and expenses incurred outside the us since the cash held by these qhcs is available to the parent aes uses the combined measure of subsidiary distributions to parent and qhcs as a useful measure of cash available to the parent to meet its international liquidity needs view source version on businesswire com

have much to celebrate with this milestone from rather humble beginnings as a single pipeline in alberta with 31 people and an enterprise value of 20 million pembina has grown into one of canada s largest companies today we are nearly 3 000 people strong with an enterprise value in excess of 40 billion as proud as we are about the past our stakeholders are more interested in the future the keys to our success to date our unwavering commitment to long term value creation rather than chasing trends or fads combined with solid core values and consideration of all stakeholders will continue to propel us to new successes furthermore we have put forth a number of financial rules or guardrails which are our commitment to continue to grow both the depth and breadth of our value chain in a disciplined way this approach results in greater synergy value added service and diversification this is the pembina way and it will not change from a financial perspective a number of new records were set in 2019 earnings in 2019 of 1 5 billion were 17 percent higher than the previous year record adjusted ebitda of 3 1 billion exceeded the high end of our guidance range and our 2019 adjusted cash flow per share of 4 36 was another all time high in 2019 we placed in excess of 600 million of projects safely and successfully into service including duvernay ii burstall ethane storage as well as other infrastructure at our redwater complex furthermore we are excited about the 1 2 billion of additional fee based projects which are expected to enter service in 2020 with these new projects coming online in conjunction with the contribution from the kinder acquisition assets we anticipate generating 2020 adjusted ebitda of between 3 25 and 3 55 billion the most significant single event this year was the 4 25 billion kinder acquisition at our 2019 investor day we talked about our focus on getting better not just bigger and this acquisition clearly make us better the majority of the assets we acquired are already directly connected to our system the edmonton terminals connect our pipeline systems with the major trunkline third party export pipelines based on their location and connectivity these assets sit at the nexus of the canadian oil market and are essentially impossible to replicate by owning these assets pembina gains another premium franchise thereby enhancing the longevity and stability of our earnings stream in addition in the current political and regulatory environment pipe in the ground and particularly cross border pipelines possess considerable scarcity value the cochin pipeline which transports premium condensate from the u s midwest to fort saskatchewan alberta offers access to another condensate supply basin is connected to pembina s canadian diluent hub and strengthens our existing condensate franchise finally the assets we acquired have considerable upside by overlaying pembina s exiting commercial models in addition to the strategic benefits the acquisition also has a positive financial impact enhancing the diversification in our business and providing opportunities for future growth these assets are predominantly supported by long term fee for service take or pay contracts which are underpinned by strong investment grade counterparties enhancing pembina s financial guardrails we have identified meaningful financial upside available from a portfolio of small capital projects and the integration of the acquired assets within pembina s existing businesses over the next five years we expect to realize additional annual adjusted ebitda of 100 million a roughly 30 percent increase with only modest capital spending as we look to the future we are excited about our continued progress in accessing global markets in early 2019 we took a major step forward with the approval of the integrated propane dehydrogenation pdh plant and polypropylene pp upgrading facility pdh pp facility through our 50 percent owned joint venture entity canada kuwait petrochemical limited partnership ckpc this project is true to our strategy of trying to do more with the hydrocarbon molecules we touch and leverages our position as the largest supplier of propane in western canada more recently we were pleased to announce that we have executed a lump sum engineering procurement and construction epc contract relating to the construction of the pdh plant with this contract we have locked in approximately 60 percent of the cost of the pdh pp facility thus far reflecting our disciplined and prudent approach to spending in addition to advancing our petrochemical facility we also are very excited about our prince rupert terminal this project is important as it represents our first export facility demand for propane

variety of reasons which are both discretionary and non discretionary in nature these factors include but are not limited to retention of cash to fund capital expenditures at the subsidiary cash retention associated with non recourse debt covenant restrictions and related debt service requirements at the subsidiaries retention of cash related to sufficiency of local gaap statutory retained

officer clear thank you eileen good morning everyone and thank you so much for taking the time to join today s call now please turn to slide four in the investor presentation as many of you know 2019 was a transformative year for clear channel outdoor as we separated from iheartmedia in the 10 months since we separated and became an independent publicly traded company we have strengthened clear channel s capital structure delivered exceptionally strong results in our americas division which now accounts for about 70 of oibdan and delivered 7 revenue 16 operating income a 9 oibdan growth in 2019 and established a new path forward which we believe will position the company for long term success these achievements could not have been accomplished without the contribution from our teams around the globe through their unwavering dedication talent and hard work they ve positioned us to achieve our vision as a unique mass reach global media platform that delivers our clients messages across our distinctive portfolio of digital and printed displays we ve been able to capitalize on the expansion of the out of home industry particularly in the u s as well as in some of our largest international markets we believe the strength in these key markets is the result of the progress we have made on the four key pillars of our strategy growing the out of home medium technology leadership customer focus and opportunistic expansion please turn to slide number five and we have good reason to be optimistic about the out of home industry based on data from magna in 2019 the u s out of home industry increased over 6 the u k was up 8 and theglobal marketgrew 6 and the industry outlook is strong as well magna believes out of home will continue growing faster than traditional media and digital out of home will grow faster than online advertising globally out of home is projected to grow at 4 cagr from 2020 to 2024 and digital out of home is expected to grow 14 in the u s magna expects out of home to grow at a 3 cagr and digital out of home to grow 14 from 2020 to 2024 in addition groupm the world s largest advertising media company expects global spending on outdoor advertising excluding china and japan to grow faster than any other medium other than online advertising groupm expects outdoor ad spending in the u s to grow mid single digits over the next five years expanding its share of total ad spend please turn to slide six our strategy is first and foremost to grow out of home share of total media spend by leading the technology driven transformation of the medium and to grow our share of total out of home spending by leveraging our distinctive asset base our digital network is a dynamic medium which enables our customers to engage in real time tactical contextual and flexible advertising and we believe digital display technology opens out of home to new advertisers increases spend from brands that already advertise with us and enables yield maximization and our results support this strategy with our technology investments driving notable growth in 2019 digital which accounts for about 1 3 of total revenues excluding china which has limited digital was up 14 breaking that down a bit further in the u s we have increased the number of digital billboards by 35 during the quarter and 92 over the course of 2019 we now have more than 1 400 digital billboards in the u s including street furniture displays there are more than 1 700 digital displays digital revenue accounted for approximately 32 of our americas revenue and was up 15 in 2019 in our international markets we installed 792 new digital displays during the quarter and 2 103 over the course of 2019 for a total of more than 15 000 digital revenue accounted for approximately 31 of total international revenue and was up 12 in 2019 excluding china moving to slide seven on the americas business one of our strategic pillars customer focus remained a key differentiator for us within the u s not only in winning and renewing contracts but also as we build out our advertising technology platforms like cco radar as a reminder cco radar is a proprietary suite of solutions that efficiently leverages aggregated anonymized opt in mobile data analytics to deliver highly targeted and memorable advertising campaigns radar solution works with both our roadside digital and printed displays and are available today across our entire roadside footprint radar has evolved over the last few years and with the use of mobile analytics across the out of home industry growing we are seeing increasing adoption of our industry leading solutions across the broad array of verticals and among new and existing national and local advertisers notably even certain technology companies are utilizing radar for example radarsync which offers brands the ability to seamlessly integrate and align their own data into the out of home planning process enabled us to secure a recent out of home buy from a leading digital streaming service by leveraging our radar solution to drive app downloads and awareness this specific customer learned how out of home performs when compared to other digital and performance marketing channels in the end the campaign saw 50 of app downloads coming from devices solely exposed to out of home meaning that on its own out of home was able to drive measurable behavior in the digital world in programmatic we continue to see triple digit growth although of a small base still in its early stages but delivering real functionality and revenues our programmatic platform enables marketers to buy our out of home inventory in audience based packages giving them the ability to manage their campaigns on a self service basis we believe programmatic buying empowers our clients with a level of flexibility closest to online platforms among traditional media and we intend to focus on further developing it of course while technology remains central to our transformation we continue to improve our printed business which generated mid single digit growth in 2019 this includes our premier panels which addresses advertisers growing demand for large scale printed street level out of home media as brands continue evaluating ways to better leverage a mixed media approach to drive results we are positioning ourselves at the center of that discussion with tangible and impactful solutions with both our digital and printed inventory supported by our radar solutions we also continue expanding the technology our airport authority partners can use to measure performance in november clear channel airports launched an industry first web app for fast financial and occupancy reporting with their u s airport media partners now on to slide eight within our international business we saw continued momentum in a variety of international markets with opportunities to expand our digital offerings both through winning contracts and continuing our digital rollout in the u k we continue to benefit from the strength of our digital platform which accounted for approximately 60 of revenue in 2019 based on the most recent information the out of home industry in the u k grew 8 faster than traditional ad spending and is taking a bigger share of the ad dollars driven in large part by the growth of digital out of home which was up 15 in 2019 with our most recent win in the u k we will operate one of its biggest digital malls advertising networks with 700 screens across 57 leading u k malls winning this hammerson contract will expand our malls live network with 223 full motion digital advertising screens across hammerson s 12 flagship u k shopping malls beginning in june 2020 we also won contracts that will expand our digital presence in key cities in many of our international markets including 24 digital screens in zurich switzerland and 20 digital screens in seville spain and in brazil we won a 20 year street furniture contract in porto alegra which will include 168 clocks 50 of which are digital as we continue to increase the number of digital screens in our international business we ve been able to use our expanded digital platform to transform our media proposition our digital strategy is more than building displays it is part of a broader strategy that includes automating the sales process developing tools to manage campaign performance revenue management to optimize the yields from our assets and working with our partners and advertisers to leverage the use of digital screen capabilities in even more flexible and creative ways we now have the ability to sell flexible campaign solution based on audience enabling advertisers to deliver contextually relevant and targeted messages at the right time in the right place to the right audience optimizing how our inventory is used the automation technology which allows us to sell flexibly continues to be developed across the european region during the fourth quarter we launched the first campaign for our new street furniture displays in the city of paris this is one of the largest contracts in europe and provides our french team with the opportunity to transform our business in france the ability to expand our assets enhances our strong national footprint as well as giving advertisers a highly compelling premium position in paris we look forward to continuing working with the city of paris as we expand our footprint looking ahead our top priorities within our international business are winning new contracts expanding our digital capabilities to more effectively address consumer demand built on our expertise and to drive growth brian will go through the financials in more detail but as he will discuss the exceptional results we delivered as a result of our digital investments and execution primarily in the americas has been offset by the impact of the continued weakness in china s consumer economy on clear media with their revenues down 20 in 2019 as reported in clear media s trading update issued this morning they expect coronavirus could further slow china s economic growth and negatively impact consumer advertising spend in 2020 now before handing the call over to brian i do want to update you on our global strategy and plans to improve our capital structure which have been ongoing since we separated from iheartmedia as you may know clear media has already disclosed that we have initiated a strategic review of our investment in china and our continuing discussions with a potential purchaser as of today no decision has been made and no definitive agreement has been entered into but in addition to that to further improve our capital structure pay down debt and unlock shareholder value we will actively evaluate additional opportunities including potential dispositions to the extent we have an opportunity to accelerate this path to value that fairly reflects the future value of a business or region our focus is on taking the necessary steps to delever our balance sheet enhance our financial flexibility and invest in technology to drive growth in our higher margin markets particularly in united states now i d like to turn it over to brian to discuss our fourth quarter and the full year 2019 results brian brian coleman chief financial officer and treasurer thank you william and good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call this morning as william mentioned it has certainly been an eventful and transformational year for the company and we are excited about the future we believe we are taking the right steps to strengthen our capital structure and provide strategic flexibility to deliver strong results while continuing to invest in our business and as william stated we remain open to all options to strengthen our balance sheet including possible dispositions to the extent that any potential transaction fairly reflects the future value of the business or region moving on to the results on slide nine as in the past during our gaap results discussion i ll also talk about our results adjusting for foreign exchange we believe this improves the comparability of our results to the prior year i will refer to these results as adjusted revenues adjusted expenses and adjusted oibdan as i mentioned last quarter this will be the last quarter we use oibdan in 2020 we are transitioning to a new reporting metric replacing oibdan with adjusted ebitda as we believe this metric is more useful to the investment community a full reconciliation of adjusted ebitda for each quarter and the full year 2019 is available on slide 22 and 23 in the investor presentation for your reference however the difference between these two metrics is restructuring and other costs which had been included in oibdan but are not included in adjusted ebitda as we have seen throughout the year our excellent results in the americas have been offset by a decline in international due to the impact of the continued weakness in china s consumer economy on clear media ltd s revenue and oibdan in the fourth quarter consolidated revenue decreased slightly by 0 3 to 745 million adjusting for foreign exchange revenue was up 1 the increase in adjusted revenue is due to continued strength in the u s offset by a decline in china s revenue consolidated operating income decreased 2 4 to 114 million in the quarter consolidated adjusted oibdan was up 1 1 with growth in americas offset by continued weakness in international due to china for the full year consolidated revenue decreased 1 4 to 2 7 billion consolidated adjusted revenue increased 1 2 americas delivered an exceptional year with 7 growth which was offset by the decline in international due to the weakness in china which was down 20 consolidated operating income was up 0 4 to 253 million consolidated adjusted oibdan was up 0 7 with over 9 growth in americas largely offset by china please turn to slide 10 for a review of the americas results in the fourth quarter americas delivered another strong performance with revenue of 345 million an increase of 4 5 the increase in the quarter was driven by digital which was up 10 8 and accounted for 34 of total revenue as a result of both new digital displays and organic growth national was up 3 8 local was up 4 9 which is impressive given the performance delivered by most other traditional media companies we believe our strength in local is due in large part to the americas team s ability to deliver value to the customer through enhanced service faster posting cycles and more sophisticated revenue management tools the team remains committed to strengthening relationships with our local advertisers to further promote a better understanding of the out of home medium and our other solutions the combination of the changing media landscape our innovative tools and customer centric teams are fueling our momentum direct operating and sg a expenses increased 4 1 driven by higher site lease expense related to higher revenue and a slight increase in both employee compensation and property taxes operating income increased 7 7 to 107 million and oibdan increased 5 to 145 million fourth quarter margins were up slightly driven in large part by top line growth in the second half of 2019 we met our revenue guidance range of mid to high single digits growth in revenue and oibdan growth in the americas with revenue up 6 2 and oibdan up 7 6 in the full year americas revenue was 1 3 billion up 7 driven by a 15 increase in digital revenues which accounted for 30 of revenue digital saw more organic growth and new digital deployments national which accounted for 39 of revenue was up just over 9 in the year with local up 5 7 direct operating and sg a expenses increased 5 7 as a result of higher site lease expenses in part driven by higher revenues and higher compensation expense operating income was up 16 3 to 347 million and oibdan increased 9 1 to 507 million margins were up about 70 basis points due primarily to the increase in revenues next please turn to slide 11 for the international segment as we mentioned the weakness in the consumer economy in china has had a negative impact on clear media s results with the remaining markets in international up slightly more specifically revenue of 400 million was down 4 1 in the fourth quarter with adjusted revenue down 7 million or 1 7 our adjusted revenue from china was down 14 million excluding china adjusted revenue increased as a result of growth from new contracts in france and digital expansion in various markets including the u k and was partially offset by the impact from the nonrenewal of certain contracts in several international markets digital which accounted for 34 of revenues excluding china was up 11 8 adjusted expenses were basically flat operating income was down 20 to 47 million and adjusted oibda declined 8 8 to 85 million due to china in the second half of the year adjusted revenue was up 1 2 and achieved the guidance we set in august of low single digit growth however we did not achieve our adjusted international oibdan guidance of low single digit adjusted oibdan was down 1 8 which is lower than we expected due to the 3 5 million increase in the reserve related to the italy investigation for the full year international revenue of 1 4 billion was down 7 9 and adjusted revenue was down 51 million or 3 3 adjusted revenue was down due to the 54 million decline in adjusted revenue from china excluding china adjusted revenue was up the increase is attributed to revenue from digital display expansion in various markets particularly the u k and new contracts in france this was partially offset by the nonrenewal of certain contracts in several international markets digital revenue was up 12 and accounted for 31 of revenue excluding china adjusted direct operating and sg a expenses were flat operating income of 65 million was down 44 and adjusted oibdan of 212 million was down 19 due to china turning to slide 12 to discuss capex capital expenditures totaled 232 million in 2019 which is in line with our guidance of 225 million to 235 million our capital expenditures in our americas segments of 83 million mainly consisted of constructing and sustaining our billboards and other out of home advertising displays including digital billboards in our international segment we spent 136 million constructing and sustaining our street furniture and other out of home advertising displays including digital displays as a reminder our reported capex includes 100 of china s capex corporate capex of 14 million primarily relates to the build out of the new san antonio office and it infrastructure which is a result of the separation from iheartmedia now onto slide 13 clear channel outdoor s consolidated cash and cash equivalents totaled 399 million as of december 31 2019 this balance includes 111 million of cash held outside of the u s by our subsidiaries a portion of which is held by non wholly owned subsidiaries or is otherwise subject to certain restrictions and not readily accessible to us as we discussed earlier this year we successfully reduced our total debt from 5 3 billion to 5 1 billion due to the net proceeds from the capital market transactions last summer the weighted average cost of debt was 6 8 in 2019 down from the prior year due to the refinancings we completed in 2019 cash interest payments were debt for the year with 321 million this was lower than the prior year due to the timing of cash payments following the separation from iheartmedia and the subsequent refinancing completed in the third quarter lastly looking at slide 14 let me discuss our guidance for 2020 we expect americas revenue to grow mid single digits and adjusted ebitda to grow mid to high single digits in 2020 this is on top of a very strong 2019 international revenue and adjusted ebitda excluding foreign exchange in china is expected to grow low to mid single digits we are anticipating capital expenditures excluding china to be between 200 million and 210 million and cash interest payments are expected to be 347 million in 2020 now before i turn the call back to william i do want to comment on the planned change in our u s tax filing status when we file our 2019 taxes later this year we plan to make the election to be an operator of real property assets for purposes of federal income tax this status was created in the tax cuts and job act passed in 2018 this code section will allow us to treat certain billboards as real property and all debt related to the real property assets is not subject to the interest expense deduction limitation as a result of this planned election we did not pay cash taxes in the u s in 2019 although we did have cash taxes of 25 million related to our international operations in 2020 we expect a small amount of cash taxes in the u s as we look to strengthen our cash flow this will be in addition to the cash taxes we will pay in our international operations and now let me turn the call back to william for his closing remarks william eccleshare worldwide chief executive officer clear thank you brian i continue to be confident about 2020 and the long term outlook for our company as brian stated we anticipate our americas segment will deliver mid single digit growth in revenue and mid to high single digit growth in adjusted ebitda that is growth on top of the 7 revenue and 9 oibdan growth that we delivered in 2019 we have a unique value proposition as a mass reach medium and are confident in the fundamental strength and growth drivers in our industry and our ability to capitalize on them we re focusing on driving continued revenue growth by building out our technology capabilities through platforms like radar as well as our programmatic offering through our investments we are continuing to improve audience insights and data solutions to unlock significant value as well as empowering clients with a level of flexibility closest to online platforms among traditional media at the same time we continue to be opportunistic about chances to further strengthen our capital structure and reduce our net leverage this may include potential dispositions if these transactions provide us with greater financial flexibility to further invest in our higher margin businesses particularly in the u s as we are maintaining our disciplined approach to drive sustainable profitable value for our shareholders in short we continue to recognize the inherent strength of out of home as a brand building medium and are committed to executing our vision to deliver a leading platform in the industry in 2020 we plan to continue transforming our business and i look forward to providing regular updates regarding our progress and now scott will join brian and myself in taking your questions questions and answers operator our first question comes from the line of kannan venkateshwar of barclays dev barclays analyst guys this is dev here on behalf of kannan so one question for will and then i have a follow up for brian so will can you help us compare and contrast the u k and the u s digital markets we re just trying to understand from a longer term perspective is it possible for the u s digital penetration to be reaching something like the u k or are there any structural differences in that market that we should be thinking about william eccleshare worldwide chief executive officer clear well there are both structural and format differences i would say and thanks for the question dev i mean i think the u s digital market is the large format market whereas in europe we are generally speaking talking about a smaller format roadside digital the two square meter signs and the real difference in terms of penetration of screens is around permitting and availability of sites to convert to digital in the u s so they are they re structurally different in terms of the way the markets would operate so i don t think you can directly compare them either the way in which the markets operate or indeed the format that we re operating scott wells chief executive officer of clear channel outdoor americas could i add one thing on that william william eccleshare worldwide chief executive officer clear yes scott wells chief executive officer of clear channel outdoor americas it s scott here dev william is exactly right on the regulatory aspect but i think we have mentioned this on prior calls as well we do have markets individual markets within the u s that are north of 50 in terms of digital revenue so the ability to get to those kind of levels is certainly not something that s impossible here the issue is one of the ability to get the permitting and the ability to convert the quantity of assets dev barclays analyst okay got it and then one for brian i think one thing which i d like to understand is how much flexibility you have both in opex and capex in case the coronavirus spreads more broader and in the u s and europe and how should we think of the margin profile in that scenario brian coleman chief financial officer and treasurer well look we have a great deal of flexibility in capex there s a certain amount that could be committed due to contract concessions that you won previously but by and large a significant percentage of the capex is discretionary and so you can see us manage that in fact we excluded clear media s capex guidance just for that reason i think in this current environment they re going to be they re separate publicly traded company i don t want to speak for their behalf but they re obviously going to be very thoughtful about how they commit and deploy capex we can do the same opex we manage that on an ongoing basis and we have to be flexible we have plans in place as anticipated economic macroeconomic changes occur we need to be flexible and we have some flexibility there but particularly on capex a great deal of discretion the majority of our capex is discretionary and so i think we can have both those levers and can pull them if we need to dev barclays analyst alright operator your next question comes from the line of steven cahall of wells fargo steven cahall wells fargo analyst yeah thank you maybe first scott on the guidance so let s just say ebitda is kind of flat to up this year you ve got capex going down i think your cash interest is maybe slightly up and cash taxes may be slightly up anything else we need to think about as we re bridging 2020 free cash flow from 2019 brian coleman chief financial officer and treasurer i m going to interject just for a second because it may not have been clear when we gave our capex guidance we included we excluded china steven so i think if you look at capex for the remaining business the americas and international it s actually going up and we do see an opportunity in the u s really to invest in the business so i want to make sure you have the right base it might not have been clear but the guidance for capex this year excludes china steven cahall wells fargo analyst got you okay and then maybe that leads me to my second question so but how should we think about the cash that s going into or coming out of china at the moment as that market is under a bit more pressure is clear media limited sort of a ring fenced entity and how much flexibility do you have on that cash coming in and out of china brian coleman chief financial officer and treasurer well you know there hasn t been a lot of distributions from china over the past couple of years when they were the historically there had been and they go through a budget cycle and to the extent they ve built up cash they can make an annual dividend and historically i can remember a couple of occasions where cash had built up and they made a special dividend but over the past couple of years and certainly given the more recent economic climate they haven t made distributions to their shareholders which is how we would receive cash out of china you mentioned cash going into china we don t fund china china has its own separate public company and while again i don t want to speak for them they are looking at i m sure their liquidity position they have the same levers they can pull with respect to capex and opex and i m sure they are the management team there is thinking very carefully about the environment they re operating in steven cahall wells fargo analyst great and then last one it seems like maybe your comments on potential divestitures or maybe i don t know a little mediar than what they ve been in the past it sounds like maybe the pipeline could potentially be a little more active so any more color you can give there and if we think about the transaction pipeline is it a lot of potential smaller transactions are there potential for big transactions any color would be appreciated scott wells chief executive officer of clear channel outdoor americas right well first of all i would say i think your interpretation is a pretty fair one in terms of what you said at the start of that question i don t want to get into any further detail in terms of which markets and whether there will be more and more large once we have any news on that you will be the first to know but as i said we are continuing to evaluate opportunities to support our growth in the high margin businesses i don t really want to say more than that at this point steven cahall wells fargo analyst great thank you operator our next question comes from the line of lance vitanza of cowen chris cowen analyst good morning this is chris on for lance i have two on china and the tax status you had just talked about distributions the capacity for distributions to and from china and if you re not really funding clear media then how are you thinking about the possibility if at all of losing a majority interest in that entity if they were to seek third party funding are they thinking about liquidity issues and the need for third party funding are they thinking about months left of cash and how to meet those significant fixed cost obligations anything you can speak to that effect would be helpful and then on the tax status and the potential savings there how let me back into this how much interest were you not able to deduct before making this election and what exactly would that save you if you already weren t paying cash taxes in the u s does it just increase your ability to accumulate nols from here is that it that s all for me brian coleman chief financial officer and treasurer yes i ll take two very different questions i ll take the first one and again i d like to reiterate clear media is a separately publicly traded company on the hong kong stock exchange they have a full management team and i m sure they re all over their liquidity risks china has been a challenging environment their board and management team is actively monitoring the situation i previously mentioned they have levers in their business much like we have in ours with respect to capex and opex remediation and i don t know that i can speak much more than that obviously we re watching it but that s their company and i m sure they are watching it very closely the second question about taxes i think the way i ll respond to that is the new tax law limited interest deductibility and for a highly levered company like ourselves there was a significant amount of interest expense that we could not shelter our income with what this election will do is enable us to lift the interest deduction cap on the amount of interest expense that we have that is ratably associated with the percentage of business we have is real property so our u s billboard plant a significant percentage of our business the interest expense related to that and this is a nontax person description but this is what you get is no longer capped and as a result whatever you modeled for cash taxes in the u s is 0 and so i think that this is a positive election for the company from a free cash flow perspective and i think most people who had done their calculations and attributed cash taxes in the u s can take those out this year and then take all but a small amount out for next year and that is a significant election it will contribute to free cash flow and it is something that we will benefit from for the next couple of years now obviously it s a complicated formula the amount of real property you have affects the formula the amount of cash interest expense you have effects the formula but for the next couple of years we will be a beneficiary of this election chris cowen analyst that s helpful thank you operator our next question comes from the line of jim goss of barrington research jim goss barrington research analyst thanks a couple more things on the guidance you re indicating basically margin improvement in the united states but margins flat and a lower growth level internationally wondering within the international markets are there certain markets within the international space that are driving the concern about lower margins and then related to the fx challenge typically the revenues and expenses have had sort of offsetting factors so it hasn t really come it sort of come out in the wash but are there any comments you can make as to if the exchange rates stayed at current levels what those impacts might be in your overall international business brian coleman chief financial officer and treasurer yes i ll tell you what i ll take a stab at the international margins william may add some color and then i ll come back to the fx question on the international margins i wouldn t assume just because of the way we provide guidance that because the revenue and the adjusted ebitda are in the same low to mid single digit ranges that there isn t margin or that there is margin depression there you can be at one end of the spectrum and the other and still be in the same range i expect that we ll continue to see margin improvement internationally it just so happened on the americas side there was a break and we could say revenues came in at one place and and you saw a margin improvement but the way that we provide guidance i don t think you can just default to one has margin improvement and one doesn t i think we will see positive margins in both business and continue to work to improve those margins and william i didn t know if you had a any info on like what countries maybe are driving that obviously the paris contract is driving that william eccleshare worldwide chief executive officer clear yes i would just add jim that we as you know and we talked many times in the past we run the international business it s the portfolio of businesses operating in a number of markets and a number of continents so the overall figure hikes some pretty significant variations in performance and we saw some very strong performances and margin improvements in some significant market toward the end of 2019 and into this year so i called out particularly the u k where we had an exceptional year in 2019 and a very strong finish strong performance in spain strong performance in finland and switzerland and others as well so it is a varied picture across the portfolio brian coleman chief financial officer and treasurer and then jim on the fx question i think it s probably worthwhile to kind of explain how we think about it and that really isn t the translation risk on where forex is moving on our balance sheet it really is to the extent that we have free cash flow in a foreign currency that we anticipate utilizing somewhere else in a different currency and that s the real exposure that we look at and to the extent we would hedge we would hedge that exposure but your question i think is where we operate do we see fx headwinds look if i could predict where fx rates were going i d probably be in a different job making more money i think that euro exposure is a significant amount of the exposure we have so your view on euros could help guide you to what kind of headwinds we see but again our focus is on making sure we don t have exposure to cash flow not balance sheet risk jim goss barrington research analyst okay maybe one separate question is there an optimal balance between print and digital displays you re increasing your digital exposure but at some stage maybe print is still going to be more appropriate to certain applications or do you think that s not true and that everything eventually goes to digital displays scott wells chief executive officer of clear channel outdoor americas jim it s scott here i ll take a crack at that and give the other guys a chance to chip in we think print is a very important part of our business and we think that there is absolutely a balance the earlier question where i was referring to some of our markets have gone to more than 50 digital revenue we still have very meaningful print positions and there are definitely advertisers that prefer that format they like to own a location so i think that you re going to see us working to optimize across those two and that that will be sort of a perpetual feature of the business over the next bunch of years i don t see print being something that we would be looking to take a step back because customers do value it william eccleshare worldwide chief executive officer clear yes i d absolutely echo that i mean across our global footprint print is absolutely at the heart of our business it represents in the sense the core values of out of home is being a mass reach medium digital ad value in some cases but we certainly don t see us becoming a 100 digital business jim goss barrington research analyst okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of stephan bisson of wolfe research stephan bisson wolfe research analyst good morning first behind the strong americas guide are you guys seeing really any kind of dichotomy in performance of markets or larger markets doing better than smaller markets as local ahead of national and are there any categories that are particularly strong scott wells chief executive officer of clear channel outdoor americas so from a guidance perspective we are looking at our channels we re looking at our product lines and we re looking at our geography trends i think what we have been seeing over the last 18 months has been strength across the channels so airports national and local are all seeing good strength we ve seen strength across both printed and digital and as we ve looked at guidance we have to take into account supply demand balance and things along those lines as we re looking downstream but there s not a particular category or a particular product line that s coming into play certainly our anticipated digital conversion is something that we take into account and we re expecting our level of conversion in the states to be the same or maybe a little bit higher than it was in 2019 but there s not any one particular thing that s driving the business the key to having the business perform well and you saw it in our 2019 results we talked a lot about our digital conversions and the things we were doing with data but we also talked about what we did with premier panels and converting that and so innovation and across the whole product line is important to keep the customers engaged and what we re looking at is we guide is the combination of what we re able to see in terms of deals that we ve already done what we know we re going to do in terms of product innovation and capacity and what we believe in terms of how the market is going to develop over the course of the year hopefully that sheds some light for you stephan bisson wolfe research analyst it does and then would it be fair to assume that most of the revenue growth is driven by pricing rather than occupancy scott wells chief executive officer of clear channel outdoor americas i wouldn t say that that s fair to assume we do focus on yield particularly if the business becomes more digital and we were 34 digital in q4 the concept of yield is a more driving concept than focusing just on price or just on occupancy because you can do different things with the product so as i look back at 2019 and really the last couple of years it s been a balanced growth driver that we ve had because we ve seen both occupancy and our achieved rates go up and frankly we don t really focus on that we focus on the yield aspect stephan bisson wolfe research analyst you gotta thank you so much operator your next question comes from the line of alexia quadrani of jp morgan anna lizzul jp morgan analyst hi this is anna lizzul on for alexia just building upon the previous question did you see any strengths or weaknesses in any particular verticals such as technology retail financial services or any others brian coleman chief financial officer and treasurer so are you asking for 2019 or you asking as we sort of look at 2020 ahead anna lizzul jp morgan analyst for 2019 particularly in the americas business brian coleman chief financial officer and treasurer okay so in 2019 our biggest category growth was in insurance that was a very strong category technology was a very strong category business services performed well food and food products performed well entertainment was a good category for us so those are the ones that we re leading and i m sure your related question would be what were the ones that we re lagging and the ones that were most challenged in 2019 were travel and transportation telecom and beverages beyond that it starts to get pretty small it was a pretty strong year across all the categories and our growers greatly exceeded our shrinkers which was obviously key in delivering the results anna lizzul jp morgan analyst great and just as a follow up what impact have you seen so far from the coronavirus across your business segments and does your guidance incorporate any potential hit to the results and what gives you confidence in the full year outlook william eccleshare worldwide chief executive officer clear so i think on coronavirus the truth is this is rapidly evolving situation and we re obviously monitoring it very closely we re particularly concerned about any of our people who might be infected both in china and elsewhere it is moving very quickly i would say and we have so far as we announced this morning from china we ve certainly seen an impact on the china business in the first quarter we have seen some limited instances of it having an impact in a small number of the european markets to date but it s really i think way too early to try to evaluate what the impact would be across the full year operator at this time there are no further questions i will now turn the call to management for any closing comments brian coleman chief financial officer and treasurer thank you i want to ask the question that wasn t asked and that is how do you intend to attack your leverage profile and i want to talk about that a minute first and foremost fundamentals we want to grow the business we want to manage cost effectively and by that i mean we re going to continue to invest in the high margin operations particularly in the u s we have opportunities for opportunistic refinancings the term loan b market is attractive but primarily i m referring to the opportunity in february of next year to refinance our expenses 9 25 notes if the market environment that we have today holds until then that s a significant amount of savings that we can achieve and grow free cash flow you ve seen effective tax planning strategies we re implementing that that also increases free cash flow and as william mentioned and as i kind of weighed in on as well the potential for accretive dispositions it is something that we are considering as long as we get fair value for whatever it is that we re looking at so in closing i wanted to kind of point that out and william i ll turn it over for you if you have any remarks william eccleshare worldwide chief executive officer clear thank you brian for underlying those really important points that i think we have made it very clear the direction we re moving in i think we ve given very clear sense of the huge momentum that we have in the business particularly in united states and really appreciate everybody joining the call and your interest in the company and we look forward to updating you through the year thank you very much and good morning operator duration 54 minutes

by niccolò battistini and giovanni callegari with monetary policy constrained by the effective lower bound elb the debt sustainability implications of a fiscal expansion are a pressing concern in a general equilibrium model of fiscal limits we find that the adverse impact of a fiscal expansion on sustainability is muted at the elb compared with normal times getting the timing of public spending increases right however is essential for containing sustainability risks monetary fiscal interactions at the effective lower bound risk free interest rates are the main instruments used by central banks in normal times to achieve their inflation objectives and pursue economic stabilisation by steering risk free rates however central banks also affect the government s capacity to service its debt both directly through interest payments and indirectly through growth inflation and thus tax revenues in the wake of the great recession a binding effective lower bound elb on interest rates constrained the regular conduct of monetary policy thus enhancing the stabilisation role of fiscal policy however large stocks of debt accumulated by governments during the prolonged recession dramatically reduced their room for manoeuvre as a result in the current low rate environment assessing the trade off between the active use of a fiscal expansion with the potential to boost economic activity and raise inflation and the risk of triggering unsustainable public debt dynamics is of key importance blanchard 2019 in our working paper we analyse the key ingredients for capturing the trade off currently faced by fiscal and monetary authorities specifically our model considers a fiscal authority s limited ability to collect revenues as higher distortionary taxes reduce output and limited commitment to repay as the government can restructure its debt at the same time we also take into account the ability of monetary policy to affect real economic activity due to price rigidities although this ability is limited at sufficiently low rates by an endogenously binding elb constraint the debt sustainability cost of the elb in our model a government honours its obligations if it is able to do so in other words public debt is sustainable whenever it is below the government s maximum ability to repay this is what we call its fiscal limit technically the fiscal limit is computed as the present discounted value of all current and future maximum primary surpluses as the economy is hit by unexpected shocks there is no such thing as one fiscal limit stochastic sequences of future shocks instead originate a distribution of fiscal limits this distribution gauges the probability of a debt restructuring associated with a specific debt to output or gdp ratio moreover the distribution of fiscal limits is state contingent because new shocks arrive every period and therefore the distribution shifts every period bi 2012 and leeper and leith 2016 to evaluate the increase in the probability of a debt restructuring due to the elb what we call the debt sustainability cost of the elb and how central banks can reduce it we conduct two exercises first we explore the debt sustainability implications of a binding elb constraint on monetary policy to this end we assume that a negative demand shock lowers the level of consumption desired by households increases their savings and depresses economic activity depending on whether monetary policy is constrained or not the nominal risk free rate is then either pushed to its elb set to zero for practicality or allowed to freely plunge below the elb to stabilise the economy respectively chart 1 fiscal limit distributions in normal times and at the elb note reproduced from battistini callegari and zavalloni 2019 figure 1 the chart illustrates how the fiscal limit distribution i e the probability of a debt restructuring for a given debt to output ratio in the following quarter varies in response to different initial unexpected shocks and under different assumptions for monetary policy in particular the chart shows the impact of the negative demand shock on the steady state fiscal limit distribution solid line both when monetary policy is constrained dashed line and when it is not constrained by the elb dashed dotted line the difference between the latter two cases can be interpreted as the debt sustainability cost of the elb as shown in chart 1 in the absence of constraints on monetary policy the negative demand shock improves debt sustainability the reason is that monetary policy responds by reducing the risk free rate the effect of a lower risk free rate implying a higher discounted value of future primary surpluses more than offsets the lower economic activity implying lower tax revenues thus shifting the fiscal limit distribution to the right from the solid line to the dashed dotted line introducing the elb constraint however clearly worsens debt sustainability as the binding elb impedes the beneficial effect of lower interest rates and amplifies the detrimental impact of lower taxes shifting the fiscal limit distribution to the left from the dashed dotted line to the dashed line ultimately this shift constitutes the debt sustainability cost of the elb there are ways however for monetary policy to tame the adverse consequences of the elb for debt sustainability in our second exercise we look at the debt sustainability implications of a higher degree of activeness of monetary policy defined as the responsiveness of the risk free rate to deviations of inflation from its target as in our first exercise we concentrate on a situation in which monetary policy is constrained and a negative demand shock pushes the economy to the elb chart 2 fiscal limit distributions at the elb with degrees of monetary policy activeness note reproduced from battistini callegari and zavalloni 2019 figure 3 the chart on the right shows the implications of different degrees of monetary policy activeness on the fiscal limit distribution given the baseline calibration dashed line and low value dotted line for the inflation targeting coefficient in the taylor rule chart 2 shows that the degree of activeness of monetary policy despite affecting the behaviour of the central bank only away from the elb also matters during periods of constrained monetary policy in fact a more active central bank reduces the economic distortions generated by future inflation fluctuations its effect is also visible when the economy is initially at the elb as a higher degree of monetary policy activeness shifts the fiscal limit distribution to the right from the dashed line to the dotted line what is the trade off for public spending at the elb our analysis above shows that all else equal debt is harder to sustain at the elb this is particularly consequential for high debt countries which should take advantage of low rates to rein in excessive deficits and reduce debt nevertheless our model indicates that taking into account all the general equilibrium effects the low rate environment of the elb both enhances the macroeconomic impact of a public spending shock and at the same time largely mutes debt sustainability concerns yet without removing them entirely especially for high debt countries chart 3 impact of government spending shocks with different timing at the elb note reproduced from battistini callegari and zavalloni 2019 figure 8 in all the charts the x axis refers to time expressed in quarters output as a percentage deviation from its steady state level and inflation are reported in percentage point differences from their values at the elb their dashed dotted red lines are at zero moreover all variables are expressed in annualised terms looking at chart 3 in our calibration targeting an average eu 14 country we let a series of unexpected negative demand shocks hit the economy and push the risk free rate down to its elb for four quarters dashed dotted line the ensuing recession and deflation not directly observable in the chart force the government to increase public debt thus raising the risk spread for a long time however a series of deficit financed public spending shocks during the prolonged period at the elb dashed yellow line would support both inflation and output and at the same time reduce the risk spread compared to a situation without fiscal expansion importantly our model shows that this concurrent improvement in macroeconomic stabilisation and debt sustainability through an unanticipated fiscal expansion occurs because of the large long run fiscal multiplier of public spending in times of binding elb as highlighted by christiano eichenbaum and rebelo 2011 and despite the debt sustainability cost of the elb getting the timing of the spending increase right is however essential an excessively delayed series of public spending shocks solid blue line starting when the risk free rate is still low but continuing well into a period when monetary policy can react to inflationary pressures would not benefit from the large fiscal multipliers of the elb in contrast a delayed fiscal expansion could lead to soaring sovereign spreads and debt levels and eventually long run output losses as these dynamics would be further amplified in the presence of higher initial debt levels the right timing for a fiscal expansion is crucial especially for highly indebted countries concluding remarks the active use of fiscal policy for stabilisation purposes should always follow a careful assessment of the impact on public debt sustainability this assessment however changes during periods of binding elb and depends on the degree of activeness of the central bank a muted trade off in times of binding elb may imply the possibility for a government to obtain gains in terms of both sustainability and stabilisation after a fiscal expansion but getting the timing right that is avoiding excessive delays in its implementation is essential our results are specific to a closed economy model and do not necessarily apply to a currency union setting where the stabilisation sustainability trade off is also influenced by the strategic behaviour of the member countries including inter alia their possible incentives to free ride on the safety premium of

rates as of 05 00 gmt market recap well it wasn t so long ago that we were bemoaning the fall in volatility in the fx market we got our wish but even so looking at how fx markets have compared to other markets we re still not that volatile the jp morgan g7 fx volatility index is calculated much like the equity market vix index using three month at the money forward option vols we re still well below average for the last several years although climbing back up meanwhile vol in stocks bonds and gold has exploded you can t see the last point for the grey line us treasuries very well but it s up about as much as the blue line which is gold vol these lines have been standardized that is they show how many standard deviations above or below average the vol is the actual vol for each asset is very different the behaviour of the trump administration is indescribable as i mentioned yesterday trump appointed vp pence to head the government s task force on the coronavirus pence a guy with no medical background who doesn t believe in science pence quickly took two steps 1 he appointed treasury secretary mnuchin and national economic council head kudlow to the task force and 2 ordered everyone in the government including cabinet ministers to clear all statements on the subject with the task force before speaking to the public to be fair the task force does include us surgeon general dr jerome adams dr adams is an anesthesiologist who previously served as health commissioner of indiana when pence was governor of the state it s frightening that the government is trying to muzzle people and prevent them from giving anything but the official view on the crisis this administration has zero credibility no one has any confidence whatsoever that they will tell the truth and if investors don t know what s happening they re going to assume the worst and move their money accordingly i think the collapse in markets yesterday was as much a response to the administration s handling of the crisis as it was a response to the crisis itself those of you who read my weekly comment may remember the japanese phrase gongo doodan 言語道断 that i used recently to describe the impeachment proceedings originally it s a buddhist term that means the ultimate truth of buddha s teaching cannot be expressed by mere words but now it s used pejoratively to mean words cannot express or according to my textbook unspeakable unutterable unmentionable outrageous unpardonable inexcusable preposterous absurd abominable shocking scandalous beyond description i find this phrase coming to mind more and more getting back to the fx market i think there were two main interesting points of the day one the euro gained and the dollar fell there are several reasons behind this the us has more room to cut rates than the ecb does the us market is now pricing in three cuts of 25 bps each for the us this year vs only one cut of 10 bps for the ecb with the lowest interest rates in the g10 the euro has been used as a funding currency in carry trades recently market participants tend to unwind carry trades during times of uncertainty like now probably there s a significant amount of carry trade unwind that s helping to push eur back up the talk of a fiscal response in germany has encouraged sentiment towards europe even though it s by no means certain that they ll be able to pass the necessary legislation the us however is already running a massive budget deficit the odds of a further fiscal boost seem slim which means the monetary policy will have to play the major role in supporting the economy meanwhile the us administration is doing everything it can to undermine whatever tiny fig leaf of credibility it might still have left with the markets the other interesting point was the continued fall in gbp gbp is about the only independent non virus story in the market nowadays uk pm johnson told the eu that he ll walk away from the negotiating table in june if it s not clear he s going to get a canada style free trade agreement the differences between the two sides aren t all that great but still the idea that they have to reach even the basis for an agreement in four months when it took them over three years to agree on the terms of the withdrawal agreement seems to be setting a hopeless deadline that s likely to lock them into no deal at all gbp negative meanwhile i d like to call your attention to this morning s japan industrial production ip figures japan s monthly ip figures are unique in that at the same time as the government gathers data on past production it also asks about current and future production so while ip for january beat estimates handily 0 8 mom vs forecasts of 0 2 previous 1 2 the key points were the forecast of a surprisingly healthy 5 3 mom increase in february followed by wait for it a 6 9 plunge in march this would be the largest drop since the march 2011 earthquake a fall of that degree would bring the level of ip back to where it was in 2013 when the much touted abenomics was just getting started not much of an achievement is it it looks like japan is headed to recession that s likely to be negative for the yen if economics can overcome the hedging behavior of japanese investors today s market note there will be no market comment on monday a national holiday in cyprus that comment would usually cover the reserve bank of australia meeting that takes place tuesday morning in australia please see our weekly outlook for information concerning that meeting the day starts with two german indicators german unemployment is expected to be fairly stable the market expects the unemployment rate to remain at 5 for the 10th consecutive month 14 out of 16 which makes me think there s either a problem with the statistics or a problem with my bloomberg data feed because most statistics are just not that steady the forecast is for a small 4 5k increase in the number of unemployed people but this is not significant i expect the steady employment picture in the face of the economic difficulties that germany is facing will be positive for the euro germany s inflation rate is expected to remain unchanged at a level below the ecb s target of close to but below 2 it s debatable whether headline inflation would be negative for eur though because the ecb focuses on core inflation nonetheless these are the last inflation figures that the governing council will get before its 23 march meeting continued below target inflation even at the headline level could prompt some discussion about whether further measures were necessary when the us starts up there s a whole slew of indicators coming out at the same time the personal consumption expenditure pce deflator and its sub index the core pce deflator are the most important indicators out this week in my view because they re the fed s preferred inflation gauges both deflators are forecast to accelerate somewhat bringing them nearer to the fed s 2 inflation target that s pretty good considering everything else that s going on in the world with the unemployment rate at a 50 year low and growth around what the fed assumes is the potential growth rate for the country it means the current situation does not warrant a cut in interest rates by any means although given the uncertainty facing the economy because of the virus the committee may still choose to cut for insurance purposes usd positive the pce deflators are released as part of the personal income and spending data incomes are expected to rise at an above trend rate during the month while spending is expected to continue to rise at the trend level these data should reassure the fed that the us consumer can continue to carry the us economy on his or her broad shoulders or in their pockets perhaps would be a better way of putting it the us advance trade balance gives the trade balance usually deficit on merchandise trade excluding trade in services where the us has a surplus the deficit is expected to remain about the same it seems to be on a narrowing trend but unfortunately for the wrong reason imports are falling faster than exports canada s december gdp will include the overall figure for q4 it s expected to be pretty grim but that shouldn t come as any surprise at its january meeting the bank of canada estimated that q4 growth would be 0 3 qoq rising to 1 3 qoq in q1 2020 it won t surprise anyone then that the market median estimate for q4 growth is wait for it 0 3 qoq although the range of estimates is surprisingly wide from 0 0 to an astonishing 0 8 only one person at 0 8 the next highest is 0 5 and frankly that estimate seems so wild i wonder if the person at bloomberg who entered the data into the system didn t misread a 3 for an 8 since this is expected to be exactly in line with the boc s forecast it should be neutral for cad over the weekend we get some of the most important data we ll see nowadays the china purchasing managers indices pmis the official ones come out on saturday while the caixin markit manufacturing pmi comes out monday and the service sector pmi on wednesday while this is important i don t know how the market is going to take the numbers whether they ll compare them to the forecasts or to each other or judge simply by how big the gap is for that matter i don t have any idea how economists forecast it either they may just be wild guesses the estimates for the official manufacturing pmi range from 30 0 to 50 1 while for the service sector pmi it s from 35 0 to 53 5 i e no one has a clue the numbers are clearly important but they will clearly be difficult to evaluate too

by call him an upper class etonian twit if you like but the reality is that boris johnson not donald trump might be the 21st century s first genuine blue collar conservative since becoming prime minister johnson has represented a profound break from the prevailing market fundamentalist ideology of the past 40 years in terms of both his rhetoric and more importantly his actions his policies evoke a 1970s style economic corporatism much derided by margaret thatcher or in more historic terms a reversion to a kinder gentler form of one nation conservatism in the words of uk born u s residing pundit andrew sullivan the core of johnson s ideology is an appeal to the working poor and aspiring middle classes tough on immigration and crime but much more generous in spending on hospitals and schools and science is it for real recall that this was also the promised policy formula that helped elect donald trump president in 2016 but which he hasn t implemented while in office by contrast johnson s actions suggest a more serious intent which could have long lasting consequences for british politics and beyond the center left of europe and the u s ignores this phenomenon at its collective peril to caricature johnson as a british trump is a lazy narrative that grossly mischaracterizes what he has done already during his comparatively short tenure leading the united kingdom when donald trump first entered the white house his then chief domestic policy adviser steve bannon pushed the president to raise taxes on the wealthy and embark on a big program of infrastructure reconstruction to consolidate his political gains with white working class voters who provided him with his margin of victory in 2016 of course we now know that trump rejected this advice as the president hewed instead to paul ryan s austerity politics attacking existing health care plans and government social welfare programs all the while promoting corporate tax reform where the benefits skewed heavily toward the top tier similarly on infrastructure trump has done nothing and so far as immigration policy goes his signature proposal to build a wall has been a case of sound and fury signifying nothing trump and the gop accordingly paid the price in the midterm elections of 2018 one of the biggest congressional wipeouts over the past half century perhaps johnson is mindful of this in his victory speech he acknowledged that voters in the traditional labor heartlands merely lent their votes to him and that more needed to be done to consolidate their long term support with that in mind he has already backed off his party s original plan to cut corporate taxes by 2 percent so that his government could spend more on voters priorities including the state funded national health service on health care johnson s conservative party is farther to the left of most of the democrats now running for president other than bernie sanders let alone trump and the gop on infrastructure johnson has greenlit approval for the construction of a high speed train line to the midlands and northern england a 130 billion venture that many have derided as a wasteful money pit but which the pm views as a crucial means of regenerating these depressed regions outside the home counties as a transport concept the high speed 2 hs2 benefits might be marginal huge expenditure and big dividends to builders in reality light rail is all the uk probably needs but the proposal was symbolically important of course and the amounts approved represent something well beyond tokenism as the project constitutes one of the largest infrastructure spends of its kind anywhere in the world at the same time johnson has been able to culturally connect with voters in the post industrial midlands and northern england who wanted nothing to do with labor s woke identity politics historic indifference to their deep often unstated misgivings about where the country and its culture were going was often dismissed as racism much as hillary clinton derided a large chunk of trump supporters in 2016 as a basket of deplorables even on immigration where we see echoes of trump and the charges of racism have become most pronounced it should be acknowledged that johnson s prioritization of a skills based immigration policy is not inherently restrictionist in fact both canada and australia the models for his new immigration policy have high net immigration rates unlike margaret thatcher or ronald reagan the new british pm s goal is not to roll back the frontiers of the state but rather to use it to mitigate inequality by enhancing middle and working class wage growth arrest the stagnation of dying communities and above all else reassert the primacy of the nation state as the central organizing foundation for society as opposed to subsuming it into a larger supranational political grouping in johnson s vision the state labor and business would all play major roles in the promotion of national economic development as well as restoring the social contract long shredded by economic neoliberalism on the left and radical free market libertarianism on the right of course a range of powerful trend lines are working against this model the scale of challenge to make necessary advances in scientific and medical research to sustain a human population in the billions requires international collaboration the tidal wave of merged investors and industry continues at a rapid clip and the globalized telecommunication process is homogenizing culture and taste across the planet in fiscal policy terms johnson s rejection of the treasury s prevailing austerity bias has been particularly noteworthy the former chancellor sajid javid had repeatedly insisted that the uk should run a balanced budget by 2023 the maintenance of which would have severely hampered the johnson administration s ability to offset potential trade shocks emerging from a more restrictive trade relationship with the eu as well as mitigating the government s ability to embrace a robust national industrial policy post brexit the resultant clash was brought to a head when johnson forced out his chancellor by issuing an ultimatum to javid to fire all his advisers a condition that the chancellor later said no self respecting minister would accept the clipping of the treasury s wings and the corresponding resignation of britain s chancellor of the exchequer has been caricatured by johnson s opponents in both parliament and the press as the actions of an insecure power hungry prime minister seeking to centralize power but in reality the move represents a long overdue move to cut down the treasury s stranglehold over the totality of economic policy relative to other government departments and paves the way for an expansionary post brexit budget it is true that government spending under donald trump has not been marked by deficit fetishism but unlike trump much of boris johnson s anticipated spending bonanza is largely being directed toward the working and middle classes as opposed to society s top tier by and large johnson s policy reflects the embrace of a national industrial policy that collides with the prevailing neoliberal notion that the government should be nothing but a neutral umpire delegating all entrepreneurial activity and innovation to the private sector that is an idea akin to holy writ in brussels the problem with this view as i have written before is that it arbitrarily restricts the range of fiscal activity that can be undertaken for broader public purpose when governments occasionally find a way to redistribute the benefits of to the broader population whether via a minimum wage tighter regulation state intervention or similar policy these measures are invariably castigated as wrongheaded inevitably leading to less efficiency sub optimal growth and lower standards of living the johnson government s prioritization of redistributing fiscal resources to the country s poorer northern regions runs in the face of these neoliberal shibboleths the regions on which he is focusing have long been the losers of globalization at the expense of london and the southern home counties which boomed as communities in the rest of the country began to wither away johnson s measures also send profoundly important political signals they are designed to build on his recent political success where he breached labor s red wall the party s traditional working class base in the manufacturing and mining districts of northern england which largely supported brexit and turned to the tories during the december election for the first time in decades johnson s political endgame is to ensure that these newly acquired working class constituencies are converted to long term electoral strongholds for the tories the consequences of that kind of electoral success could have long lasting implications with his policy actions so far the british pm is appealing to a mass of working class constituencies long alienated by successive governments both tory and labor that prioritized the european union s technocratic market fundamentalism to put it in u s terms the equivalent would be the republicans converting the midwest into a permanent gop regional stronghold which would almost certainly relegate the democrats to perpetual minority party status in the meantime the opposition labor party experienced its worst result since 1935 and more recently lost a municipal by election in northeast england where a 20 year old tory candidate decisively took almost 50 percent of all votes cast on the immigration policy front the new conservative government has introduced a new policy that prioritizes skill largely modeled after the australian and canadian points based systems whereby a non resident who is able to score above a threshold number of points in a scoring system that might include such factors as education level income skills in high demand language fluency existing job offer etc is given priority for immigration this policy too has predictably engendered charges of the tories pandering to racists what has many critics up in arms is that among the essential criteria is being able to speak english even though proficiency in a country s native tongue helps to engender more social cohesion less cultural alienation easier links to studies and other such benefits it should also be noted that language requirements are not unique to the uk canada likewise prioritizes fluency in its two official languages english and french other provisions of the new immigration law include having a job offer to qualify for entry and being above a designated skills threshold again there is nothing particularly novel about these features virtually all eu countries demand economic self sufficiency as a prerequisite to the free movement of people nor is a points system that prioritizes skilled labor inherently restrictive to mitigate short term disruption to businesses the new proposed legislation does provide alternative social safety valves retaining existing youth mobility schemes and family reunification from the existing immigration laws finally even though the law might create short term disruption for service industries notably in food and beverage as they wean themselves off cheap sources of external labor there are long term benefits to the proposed new policy as the telegraph s matthew lynn notes in truth curbing low skilled immigration can change the economy for the better why because it will force the economy into higher productivity higher wage industries just take a look at the evidence from the places where it has been tried according to oecd data each of the main countries with a points system has done significantly better than the uk at increasing output per worker taking 2010 as 100 gdp per worker has risen to 110 in australia to 107 in canada and 103 in new zealand but only to 102 in britain the oecd average is 106 our output person has barely grown over the past 10 years it will also revalue these service jobs as a smaller labor pool makes those job openings harder to fill a skills based system also changes the migration pattern from the same regions we are seeing evidence of this in the u s as professor michael lind highlights in his new book the new class war saving democracy from the managerial elite lind notes for example that an increasing number of south americans in the u s are educated professionals world bank officials from uruguay etc and in neither the u s nor europe is there a backlash against indian doctors or chinese engineers except in the case of h1bs but that is a matter of labor exploitation as matt taibbi highlighted in a recent rolling stone piece boris versus eu what about the big elephant in the room namely brexit and the uk s future trading relationship with the eu boris johnson s domestic political jiujitsu has understandably discombobulated his negotiating interlocutors in the eu which likely means a much more contentious negotiation about the evolution of the post brexit relationship between the uk and eu hints of the challenges lurking became evident when boris johnson s chief brexit negotiator david frost warned brussels that the uk would not under any circumstances sign up to eu rules in a trade deal with brussels which circumscribed the former s sovereignty and enforced the eu s regulatory and legal framework via the european court of justice to be sure these are but the opening shots in what is likely to be a difficult negotiation but in contrast to the previous administration of former prime minister theresa may johnson s government is reversing the government s priorities national sovereignty over the maintenance of frictionless trade rather than the opposite the reality is that johnson s nationalism represents a vision that is ultimately irreconcilable with that of brussels a fact that the eu is only beginning to grasp as it establishes its negotiating brief brexit was never an end in itself but a means to a very different sort of destination for the uk as such not only is the uk a regulatory rival of the eu but also in a broader sense it presents an ideological challenge to much of the prevailing framework that has dominated policymaking globally for over half a century but which is likely ending johnson will succeed if he can re establish a social contract among business labor and government constituents a modern day tripartism that replaces today s incipient caste system characterized by a steadily growing underclass often foreign born in menial dead end personal service jobs rather than simply deriding him the left would do well to pay

related derivatives lower general and administrative expense and the impact of the adoption of ifrs 16 offset by lower margins ngl sales volumes of 190 mboe d in the fourth quarter and 189 mboe d for the full year represent a five percent decrease and eight percent increase respectively compared to the same periods in 2018 volumes for the fourth quarter were negatively impacted by lower supply volumes at redwater combined with higher butane sales made in the fourth quarter of 2018 partially offset by increased volumes at aux sable volumes for the full year were positively impacted by increased ngl sales volumes primarily driven by higher butane volumes partially offset by lower ethane volumes at aux sable executive overview this past year pembina marked its 65th anniversary and we have much to celebrate with this milestone from rather humble beginnings as a single pipeline in alberta with 31 people and an enterprise value of 20 million pembina has grown into one of canada s largest companies today we are nearly 3 000 people strong with an enterprise value in excess of 40 billion as proud as we are about the past our stakeholders are more interested in the future the keys to our success to date our unwavering commitment to long term value creation rather than chasing trends or fads combined with solid core values and consideration of all stakeholders will continue to propel us to new successes furthermore we have put forth a number of financial rules or guardrails which are our commitment to continue to grow both the depth and breadth of our value chain in a disciplined way this approach results in greater synergy value added service and diversification this is the pembina way and it will not change from a financial perspective a number of new records were set in 2019 earnings in 2019 of 1 5 billion were 17 percent higher than the previous year record adjusted ebitda of 3 1 billion exceeded the high end of our guidance range and our 2019 adjusted cash flow per share of 4 36 was another all time high in 2019 we placed in excess of 600 million of projects safely and successfully into service including duvernay ii burstall ethane storage as well as other infrastructure at our redwater complex furthermore we are excited about the 1 2 billion of additional fee based projects which are expected to enter service in 2020 with these new projects coming online in conjunction with the contribution from the kinder acquisition assets we anticipate generating 2020 adjusted ebitda of between 3 25 and 3 55 billion the most significant single event this year was the 4 25 billion kinder acquisition at our 2019 investor day we talked about our focus on getting better not just bigger and this acquisition clearly make us better the majority of the assets we acquired are already directly connected to our system the edmonton terminals connect our pipeline systems with the major trunkline third party export pipelines based on their location and connectivity these assets sit at the nexus of the canadian oil market and are essentially impossible to replicate by owning these assets pembina gains another premium franchise thereby enhancing the longevity and stability of our earnings stream in addition in the current political and regulatory environment pipe in the ground and particularly cross border pipelines possess considerable scarcity value the cochin pipeline which transports premium condensate from the u s midwest to fort saskatchewan alberta offers access to another condensate supply basin is connected to pembina s canadian diluent hub and strengthens our existing condensate franchise finally the assets we acquired have considerable upside by overlaying pembina s exiting commercial models in addition to the strategic benefits the acquisition also has a positive financial impact enhancing the diversification in our business and providing opportunities for future growth these assets are predominantly supported by long term fee for service take or pay contracts which are underpinned by strong investment grade counterparties enhancing pembina s financial guardrails we have identified meaningful financial upside available from a portfolio of small capital projects and the integration of the acquired assets within pembina s existing businesses over the next five years we expect to realize additional annual adjusted ebitda of 100 million a roughly 30 percent increase with only modest capital spending as we look to the future we are excited about our continued progress in accessing global markets in early 2019 we took a major step forward with the approval of the integrated propane dehydrogenation pdh plant and polypropylene pp upgrading facility pdh pp facility through our 50 percent owned joint venture entity canada kuwait petrochemical limited partnership ckpc this project is true to our strategy of trying to do more with the hydrocarbon molecules we touch and leverages our position as the largest supplier of propane in western canada more recently we were pleased to announce that we have executed a lump sum engineering procurement and construction epc contract relating to the construction of the pdh plant with this contract we have locked in approximately 60 percent of the cost of the pdh pp facility thus far reflecting our disciplined and prudent approach to spending in addition to advancing our petrochemical facility we also are very excited about our prince rupert terminal this project is important as it represents our first export facility demand for propane export capacity was significant and we were pleased to approve an expansion of this export terminal increasing capacity to approximately 40 mbpd we are entering a new decade with significant momentum and abundant growth opportunities in fact some of the hardest decisions we must make are what projects are we not going to pursue our continued focus on being better and not just bigger in addition to our financial guardrails and strategic investment criteria based on long term thinking will remain our guiding principles for future growth ensuring we continue to create long term sustainable value

this week partly reflects increasing fears among many economists that the u s and global economies could take a bigger hit from the coronavirus than they previously thought earlier assumptions that the impact would largely be contained in china and would temporarily disrupt manufacturing supply chains have been overtaken by concerns that as the virus spreads more people in numerous countries will stay home either voluntarily or under quarantine vacations could be canceled restaurant meals skipped and fewer shopping trips taken a global recession is likely if covid 19 becomes a pandemic and the odds of that are uncomfortably high and rising with infections surging in italy and korea said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics the market rout will also likely weaken americans

investor presentation as many of you know 2019 was a transformative year for clear channel outdoor as we separated from iheartmedia in the 10 months since we separated and became an independent publicly traded company we have strengthened clear channel s capital structure delivered exceptionally strong results in our americas division which now accounts for about 70 of oibdan and delivered 7 revenue 16 operating income a 9 oibdan growth in 2019 and established a new path forward which we believe will position the company for long term success these achievements could not have been accomplished without the contribution from our teams around the globe through their unwavering dedication talent and hard work they ve positioned us to achieve our vision as a unique mass reach global media platform that delivers our clients messages across our distinctive portfolio of digital and printed displays we ve been able to capitalize on the expansion of the out of home industry particularly in the u s as well as in some of our largest international markets we believe the strength in these key markets is the result of the progress we have made on the four key pillars of our strategy growing the out of home medium technology leadership customer focus and opportunistic expansion please turn to slide number five and we have good reason to be optimistic about the out of home industry based on data from magna in 2019 the u s out of home industry increased over 6 the u k was up 8 and the global market grew 6 and the industry outlook is strong as well magna believes out of home will continue growing faster than traditional media and digital out of home will grow faster than online advertising globally out of home is projected to grow at 4 cagr from 2020 to 2024 and digital out of home is expected to grow 14 in the u s magna expects out of home to grow at a 3 cagr and digital out of home to grow 14 from 2020 to 2024 in addition groupm the world s largest advertising media company expects global spending on outdoor advertising excluding china and japan to grow faster than any other medium other than online advertising groupm expects outdoor ad spending in the u s to grow mid single digits over the next five years expanding its share of total ad spend please turn to slide six our strategy is first and foremost to grow out of home share of total media spend by leading the technology driven transformation of the medium and to grow our share of total out of home spending by leveraging our distinctive asset base our digital network is a dynamic medium which enables our customers to engage in real time tactical contextual and flexible advertising and we believe digital display technology opens out of home to new advertisers increases spend from brands that already advertise with us and enables yield maximization and our results support this strategy with our technology investments driving notable growth in 2019 digital which accounts for about 1 3 of total revenues excluding china which has limited digital was up 14 breaking that down a bit further in the u s we have increased the number of digital billboards by 35 during the quarter and 92 over the course of 2019 we now have more than 1 400 digital billboards in the u s including street furniture displays there are more than 1 700 digital displays digital revenue accounted for approximately 32 of our americas revenue and was up 15 in 2019 in our international markets we installed 792 new digital displays during the quarter and 2 103 over the course of 2019 for a total of more than 15 000 digital revenue accounted for approximately 31 of total international revenue and was up 12 in 2019 excluding china moving to slide seven on the americas business one of our strategic pillars customer focus remained a key differentiator for us within the u s not only in winning and renewing contracts but also as we build out our advertising technology platforms like cco radar as a reminder cco radar is a proprietary suite of solutions that efficiently leverages aggregated anonymized opt in mobile data analytics to deliver highly targeted and memorable advertising campaigns radar solution works with both our roadside digital and printed displays and are available today across our entire roadside footprint radar has evolved over the last few years and with the use of mobile analytics across the out of home industry growing we are seeing increasing adoption of our industry leading solutions across the broad array of verticals and among new and existing national and local advertisers notably even certain technology companies are utilizing radar for example radarsync which offers brands the ability to seamlessly integrate and align their own data into the out of home planning process enabled us to secure a recent out of home buy from a leading digital streaming service by leveraging our radar solution to drive app downloads and awareness this specific customer learned how out of home performs when compared to other digital and performance marketing channels in the end the campaign saw 50 of app downloads coming from devices solely exposed to out of home meaning that on its own out of home was able to drive measurable behavior in the digital world in programmatic we continue to see triple digit growth although of a small base still in its early stages but delivering real functionality and revenues our programmatic platform enables marketers to buy our out of home inventory in audience based packages giving them the ability to manage their campaigns on a self service basis we believe programmatic buying empowers our clients with a level of flexibility closest to online platforms among traditional media and we intend to focus on further developing it of course while technology remains central to our transformation we continue to improve our printed business which generated mid single digit growth in 2019 this includes our premier panels which addresses advertisers growing demand for large scale printed street level out of home media as brands continue evaluating ways to better leverage a mixed media approach to drive results we are positioning ourselves at the center of that discussion with tangible and impactful solutions with both our digital and printed inventory supported by our radar solutions we also continue expanding the technology our airport authority partners can use to measure performance in november clear channel airports launched an industry first web app for fast financial and occupancy reporting with their u s airport media partners now on to slide eight within our international business we saw continued momentum in a variety of international markets with opportunities to expand our digital offerings both through winning contracts and continuing our digital rollout in the u k we continue to benefit from the strength of our digital platform which accounted for approximately 60 of revenue in 2019 based on the most recent information the out of home industry in the u k grew 8 faster than traditional ad spending and is taking a bigger share of the ad dollars driven in large part by the growth of digital out of home which was up 15 in 2019 with our most recent win in the u k we will operate one of its biggest digital malls advertising networks with 700 screens across 57 leading u k malls winning this hammerson contract will expand our malls live network with 223 full motion digital advertising screens across hammerson s 12 flagship u k shopping malls beginning in june 2020 we also won contracts that will expand our digital presence in key cities in many of our international markets including 24 digital screens in zurich switzerland and 20 digital screens in seville spain and in brazil we won a 20 year street furniture contract in porto alegra which will include 168 clocks 50 of which are digital as we continue to increase the number of digital screens in our international business we ve been able to use our expanded digital platform to transform our media proposition our digital strategy is more than building displays it is part of a broader strategy that includes automating the sales process developing tools to manage campaign performance revenue management to optimize the yields from our assets and working with our partners and advertisers to leverage the use of digital screen capabilities in even more flexible and creative ways we now have the ability to sell flexible campaign solution based on audience enabling advertisers to deliver contextually relevant and targeted messages at the right time in the right place to the right audience optimizing how our inventory is used the automation technology which allows us to sell flexibly continues to be developed across the european region during the fourth quarter we launched the first campaign for our new street furniture displays in the city of paris this is one of the largest contracts in europe and provides our french team with the opportunity to transform our business in france the ability to expand our assets enhances our strong national footprint as well as giving advertisers a highly compelling premium position in paris we look forward to continuing working with the city of paris as we expand our footprint looking ahead our top priorities within our international business are winning new contracts expanding our digital capabilities to more effectively address consumer demand built on our expertise and to drive growth brian will go through the financials in more detail but as he will discuss the exceptional results we delivered as a result of our digital investments and execution primarily in the americas has been offset by the impact of the continued weakness in china s consumer economy on clear media with their revenues down 20 in 2019 as reported in clear media s trading update issued this morning they expect coronavirus could further slow china s economic growth and negatively impact consumer advertising spend in 2020 now before handing the call over to brian i do want to update you on our global strategy and plans to improve our capital structure which have been ongoing since we separated from iheartmedia as you may know clear media has already disclosed that we have initiated a strategic review of our investment in china and our continuing discussions with a potential purchaser as of today no decision has been made and no definitive agreement has been entered into but in addition to that to further improve our capital structure pay down debt and unlock shareholder value we will actively evaluate additional opportunities including potential dispositions to the extent we have an opportunity to accelerate this path to value that fairly reflects the future value of a business or region our focus is on taking the necessary steps to delever our balance sheet enhance our financial flexibility and invest in technology to drive growth in our higher margin markets particularly in united states now i d like to turn it over to brian to discuss our fourth quarter and the full year 2019 results brian brian coleman chief financial officer and treasurer thank you william and good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call this morning as william mentioned it has certainly been an eventful and transformational year for the company and we are excited about the future we believe we are taking the right steps to strengthen our capital structure and provide strategic flexibility to deliver strong results while continuing to invest in our business and as william stated we remain open to all options to strengthen our balance sheet including possible dispositions to the extent that any potential transaction fairly reflects the future value of the business or region moving on to the results on slide nine as in the past during our gaap results discussion i ll also talk about our results adjusting for foreign exchange we believe this improves the comparability of our results to the prior year i will refer to these results as adjusted revenues adjusted expenses and adjusted oibdan as i mentioned last quarter this will be the last quarter we use oibdan in 2020 we are transitioning to a new reporting metric replacing oibdan with adjusted ebitda as we believe this metric is more useful to the investment community a full reconciliation of adjusted ebitda for each quarter and the full year 2019 is available on slide 22 and 23 in the investor presentation for your reference however the difference between these two metrics is restructuring and other costs which had been included in oibdan but are not included in adjusted ebitda as we have seen throughout the year our excellent results in the americas have been offset by a decline in international due to the impact of the continued weakness in china s consumer economy on clear media ltd s revenue and oibdan in the fourth quarter consolidated revenue decreased slightly by 0 3 to 745 million adjusting for foreign exchange revenue was up 1 the increase in adjusted revenue is due to continued strength in the u s offset by a decline in china s revenue consolidated operating income decreased 2 4 to 114 million in the quarter consolidated adjusted oibdan was up 1 1 with growth in americas offset by continued weakness in international due to china for the full year consolidated revenue decreased 1 4 to 2 7 billion consolidated adjusted revenue increased 1 2 americas delivered an exceptional year with 7 growth which was offset by the decline in international due to the weakness in china which was down 20 consolidated operating income was up 0 4 to 253 million consolidated adjusted oibdan was up 0 7 with over 9 growth in americas largely offset by china please turn to slide 10 for a review of the americas results in the fourth quarter americas delivered another strong performance with revenue of 345 million an increase of 4 5 the increase in the quarter was driven by digital which was up 10 8 and accounted for 34 of total revenue as a result of both new digital displays and organic growth national was up 3 8 local was up 4 9 which is impressive given the performance delivered by most other traditional media companies we believe our strength in local is due in large part to the americas team s ability to deliver value to the customer through enhanced service faster posting cycles and more sophisticated revenue management tools the team remains committed to strengthening relationships with our local advertisers to further promote a better understanding of the out of home medium and our other solutions the combination of the changing media landscape our innovative tools and customer centric teams are fueling our momentum direct operating and sg a expenses increased 4 1 driven by higher site lease expense related to higher revenue and a slight increase in both employee compensation and property taxes operating income increased 7 7 to 107 million and oibdan increased 5 to 145 million fourth quarter margins were up slightly driven in large part by top line growth in the second half of 2019 we met our revenue guidance range of mid to high single digits growth in revenue and oibdan growth in the americas with revenue up 6 2 and oibdan up 7 6 in the full year americas revenue was 1 3 billion up 7 driven by a 15 increase in digital revenues which accounted for 30 of revenue digital saw more organic growth and new digital deployments national which accounted for 39 of revenue was up just over 9 in the year with local up 5 7 direct operating and sg a expenses increased 5 7 as a result of higher site lease expenses in part driven by higher revenues and higher compensation expense operating income was up 16 3 to 347 million and oibdan increased 9 1 to 507 million margins were up about 70 basis points due primarily to the increase in revenues next please turn to slide 11 for the international segment as we mentioned the weakness in the consumer economy in china has had a negative impact on clear media s results with the remaining markets in international up slightly more specifically revenue of 400 million was down 4 1 in the fourth quarter with adjusted revenue down 7 million or 1 7 our adjusted revenue from china was down 14 million excluding china adjusted revenue increased as a result of growth from new contracts in france and digital expansion in various markets including the u k and was partially offset by the impact from the nonrenewal of certain contracts in several international markets digital which accounted for 34 of revenues excluding china was up 11 8 adjusted expenses were basically flat operating income was down 20 to 47 million and adjusted oibda declined 8 8 to 85 million due to china in the second half of the year adjusted revenue was up 1 2 and achieved the guidance we set in august of low single digit growth however we did not achieve our adjusted international oibdan guidance of low single digit adjusted oibdan was down 1 8 which is lower than we expected due to the 3 5 million increase in the reserve related to the italy investigation for the full year international revenue of 1 4 billion was down 7 9 and adjusted revenue was down 51 million or 3 3 adjusted revenue was down due to the 54 million decline in adjusted revenue from china excluding china adjusted revenue was up the increase is attributed to revenue from digital display expansion in various markets particularly the u k and new contracts in france this was partially offset by the nonrenewal of certain contracts in several international markets digital revenue was up 12 and accounted for 31 of revenue excluding china adjusted direct operating and sg a expenses were flat operating income of 65 million was down 44 and adjusted oibdan of 212 million was down 19 due to china turning to slide 12 to discuss capex capital expenditures totaled 232 million in 2019 which is in line with our guidance of 225 million to 235 million our capital expenditures in our americas segments of 83 million mainly consisted of constructing and sustaining our billboards and other out of home advertising displays including digital billboards in our international segment we spent 136 million constructing and sustaining our street furniture and other out of home advertising displays including digital displays as a reminder our reported capex includes 100 of china s capex corporate capex of 14 million primarily relates to the build out of the new san antonio office and it infrastructure which is a result of the separation from iheartmedia now onto slide 13 clear channel outdoor s consolidated cash and cash equivalents totaled 399 million as of december 31 2019 this balance includes 111 million of cash held outside of the u s by our subsidiaries a portion of which is held by non wholly owned subsidiaries or is otherwise subject to certain restrictions and not readily accessible to us as we discussed earlier this year we successfully reduced our total debt from 5 3 billion to 5 1 billion due to the net proceeds from the capital market transactions last summer the weighted average cost of debt was 6 8 in 2019 down from the prior year due to the refinancings we completed in 2019 cash interest payments were debt for the year with 321 million this was lower than the prior year due to the timing of cash payments following the separation from iheartmedia and the subsequent refinancing completed in the third quarter lastly looking at slide 14 let me discuss our guidance for 2020 we expect americas revenue to grow mid single digits and adjusted ebitda to grow mid to high single digits in 2020 this is on top of a very strong 2019 international revenue and adjusted ebitda excluding foreign exchange in china is expected to grow low to mid single digits we are anticipating capital expenditures excluding china to be between 200 million and 210 million and cash interest payments are expected to be 347 million in 2020 now before i turn the call back to william i do want to comment on the planned change in our u s tax filing status when we file our 2019 taxes later this year we plan to make the election to be an operator of real property assets for purposes of federal income tax this status was created in the tax cuts and job act passed in 2018 this code section will allow us to treat certain billboards as real property and all debt related to the real property assets is not subject to the interest expense deduction limitation as a result of this planned election we did not pay cash taxes in the u s in 2019 although we did have cash taxes of 25 million related to our international operations in 2020 we expect a small amount of cash taxes in the u s as we look to strengthen our cash flow this will be in addition to the cash taxes we will pay in our international operations and now let me turn the call back to william for his closing remarks william eccleshare worldwide chief executive officer clear thank you brian i continue to be confident about 2020 and the long term outlook for our company as brian stated we anticipate our americas segment will deliver mid single digit growth in revenue and mid to high single digit growth in adjusted ebitda that is growth on top of the 7 revenue and 9 oibdan growth that we delivered in 2019 we have a unique value proposition as a mass reach medium and are confident in the fundamental strength and growth drivers in our industry and our ability to capitalize on them we re focusing on driving continued revenue growth by building out our technology capabilities through platforms like radar as well as our programmatic offering through our investments we are continuing to improve audience insights and data solutions to unlock significant value as well as empowering clients with a level of flexibility closest to online platforms among traditional media at the same time we continue to be opportunistic about chances to further strengthen our capital structure and reduce our net leverage this may include potential dispositions if these transactions provide us with greater financial flexibility to further invest in our higher margin businesses particularly in the u s as we are maintaining our disciplined approach to drive sustainable profitable value for our shareholders in short we continue to recognize the inherent strength of out of home as a brand building medium and are committed to executing our vision to deliver a leading platform in the industry in 2020 we plan to continue transforming our business and i look forward to providing regular updates regarding our progress and now scott will join brian and myself in taking your questions questions and answers operator our first question comes from the line of kannan venkateshwar of barclays dev barclays analyst guys this is dev here on behalf of kannan so one question for will and then i have a follow up for brian so will can you help us compare and contrast the u k and the u s digital markets we re just trying to understand from a longer term perspective is it possible for the u s digital penetration to be reaching something like the u k or are there any structural differences in that market that we should be thinking about william eccleshare worldwide chief executive officer clear well there are both structural and format differences i would say and thanks for the question dev i mean i think the u s digital market is the large format market whereas in europe we are generally speaking talking about a smaller format roadside digital the two square meter signs and the real difference in terms of penetration of screens is around permitting and availability of sites to convert to digital in the u s so they are they re structurally different in terms of the way the markets would operate so i don t think you can directly compare them either the way in which the markets operate or indeed the format that we re operating scott wells chief executive officer of clear channel outdoor americas could i add one thing on that william william eccleshare worldwide chief executive officer clear yes scott wells chief executive officer of clear channel outdoor americas it s scott here dev william is exactly right on the regulatory aspect but i think we have mentioned this on prior calls as well we do have markets individual markets within the u s that are north of 50 in terms of digital revenue so the ability to get to those kind of levels is certainly not something that s impossible here the issue is one of the ability to get the permitting and the ability to convert the quantity of assets dev barclays analyst okay got it and then one for brian i think one thing which i d like to understand is how much flexibility you have both in opex and capex in case the coronavirus spreads more broader and in the u s and europe and how should we think of the margin profile in that scenario brian coleman chief financial officer and treasurer well look we have a great deal of flexibility in capex there s a certain amount that could be committed due to contract concessions that you won previously but by and large a significant percentage of the capex is discretionary and so you can see us manage that in fact we excluded clear media s capex guidance just for that reason i think in this current environment they re going to be they re separate publicly traded company i don t want to speak for their behalf but they re obviously going to be very thoughtful about how they commit and deploy capex we can do the same opex we manage that on an ongoing basis and we have to be flexible we have plans in place as anticipated economic macroeconomic changes occur we need to be flexible and we have some flexibility there but particularly on capex a great deal of discretion the majority of our capex is discretionary and so i think we can have both those levers and can pull them if we need to dev barclays analyst alright operator your next question comes from the line of steven cahall of wells fargo steven cahall wells fargo analyst yeah thank you maybe first scott on the guidance so let s just say ebitda is kind of flat to up this year you ve got capex going down i think your cash interest is maybe slightly up and cash taxes may be slightly up anything else we need to think about as we re bridging 2020 free cash flow from 2019 brian coleman chief financial officer and treasurer i m going to interject just for a second because it may not have been clear when we gave our capex guidance we included we excluded china steven so i think if you look at capex for the remaining business the americas and international it s actually going up and we do see an opportunity in the u s really to invest in the business so i want to make sure you have the right base it might not have been clear but the guidance for capex this year excludes china steven cahall wells fargo analyst got you okay and then maybe that leads me to my second question so but how should we think about the cash that s going into or coming out of china at the moment as that market is under a bit more pressure is clear media limited sort of a ring fenced entity and how much flexibility do you have on that cash coming in and out of china brian coleman chief financial officer and treasurer well you know there hasn t been a lot of distributions from china over the past couple of years when they were the historically there had been and they go through a budget cycle and to the extent they ve built up cash they can make an annual dividend and historically i can remember a couple of occasions where cash had built up and they made a special dividend but over the past couple of years and certainly given the more recent economic climate they haven t made distributions to their shareholders which is how we would receive cash out of china you mentioned cash going into china we don t fund china china has its own separate public company and while again i don t want to speak for them they are looking at i m sure their liquidity position they have the same levers they can pull with respect to capex and opex and i m sure they are the management team there is thinking very carefully about the environment they re operating in steven cahall wells fargo analyst great and then last one it seems like maybe your comments on potential divestitures or maybe i don t know a little mediar than what they ve been in the past it sounds like maybe the pipeline could potentially be a little more active so any more color you can give there and if we think about the transaction pipeline is it a lot of potential smaller transactions are there potential for big transactions any color would be appreciated scott wells chief executive officer of clear channel outdoor americas right well first of all i would say i think your interpretation is a pretty fair one in terms of what you said at the start of that question i don t want to get into any further detail in terms of which markets and whether there will be more and more large once we have any news on that you will be the first to know but as i said we are continuing to evaluate opportunities to support our growth in the high margin businesses i don t really want to say more than that at this point steven cahall wells fargo analyst great thank you operator our next question comes from the line of lance vitanza of cowen chris cowen analyst good morning this is chris on for lance i have two on china and the tax status you had just talked about distributions the capacity for distributions to and from china and if you re not really funding clear media then how are you thinking about the possibility if at all of losing a majority interest in that entity if they were to seek third party funding are they thinking about liquidity issues and the need for third party funding are they thinking about months left of cash and how to meet those significant fixed cost obligations anything you can speak to that effect would be helpful and then on the tax status and the potential savings there how let me back into this how much interest were you not able to deduct before making this election and what exactly would that save you if you already weren t paying cash taxes in the u s does it just increase your ability to accumulate nols from here is that it that s all for me brian coleman chief financial officer and treasurer yes i ll take two very different questions i ll take the first one and again i d like to reiterate clear media is a separately publicly traded company on the hong kong stock exchange they have a full management team and i m sure they re all over their liquidity risks china has been a challenging environment their board and management team is actively monitoring the situation i previously mentioned they have levers in their business much like we have in ours with respect to capex and opex remediation and i don t know that i can speak much more than that obviously we re watching it but that s their company and i m sure they are watching it very closely the second question about taxes i think the way i ll respond to that is the new tax law limited interest deductibility and for a highly levered company like ourselves there was a significant amount of interest expense that we could not shelter our income with what this election will do is enable us to lift the interest deduction cap on the amount of interest expense that we have that is ratably associated with the percentage of business we have is real property so our u s billboard plant a significant percentage of our business the interest expense related to that and this is a nontax person description but this is what you get is no longer capped and as a result whatever you modeled for cash taxes in the u s is 0 and so i think that this is a positive election for the company from a free cash flow perspective and i think most people who had done their calculations and attributed cash taxes in the u s can take those out this year and then take all but a small amount out for next year and that is a significant election it will contribute to free cash flow and it is something that we will benefit from for the next couple of years now obviously it s a complicated formula the amount of real property you have affects the formula the amount of cash interest expense you have effects the formula but for the next couple of years we will be a beneficiary of this election chris cowen analyst that s helpful thank you operator our next question comes from the line of jim goss of barrington research jim goss barrington research analyst thanks a couple more things on the guidance you re indicating basically margin improvement in the united states but margins flat and a lower growth level internationally wondering within the international markets are there certain markets within the international space that are driving the concern about lower margins and then related to the fx challenge typically the revenues and expenses have had sort of offsetting factors so it hasn t really come it sort of come out in the wash but are there any comments you can make as to if the exchange rates stayed at current levels what those impacts might be in your overall international business brian coleman chief financial officer and treasurer yes i ll tell you what i ll take a stab at the international margins william may add some color and then i ll come back to the fx question on the international margins i wouldn t assume just because of the way we provide guidance that because the revenue and the adjusted ebitda are in the same low to mid single digit ranges that there isn t margin or that there is margin depression there you can be at one end of the spectrum and the other and still be in the same range i expect that we ll continue to see margin improvement internationally it just so happened on the americas side there was a break and we could say revenues came in at one place and and you saw a margin improvement but the way that we provide guidance i don t think you can just default to one has margin improvement and one doesn t i think we will see positive margins in both business and continue to work to improve those margins and william i didn t know if you had a any info on like what countries maybe are driving that obviously the paris contract is driving that william eccleshare worldwide chief executive officer clear yes i would just add jim that we as you know and we talked many times in the past we run the international business it s the portfolio of businesses operating in a number of markets and a number of continents so the overall figure hikes some pretty significant variations in performance and we saw some very strong performances and margin improvements in some significant market toward the end of 2019 and into this year so i called out particularly the u k where we had an exceptional year in 2019 and a very strong finish strong performance in spain strong performance in finland and switzerland and others as well so it is a varied picture across the portfolio brian coleman chief financial officer and treasurer and then jim on the fx question i think it s probably worthwhile to kind of explain how we think about it and that really isn t the translation risk on where forex is moving on our balance sheet it really is to the extent that we have free cash flow in a foreign currency that we anticipate utilizing somewhere else in a different currency and that s the real exposure that we look at and to the extent we would hedge we would hedge that exposure but your question i think is where we operate do we see fx headwinds look if i could predict where fx rates were going i d probably be in a different job making more money i think that euro exposure is a significant amount of the exposure we have so your view on euros could help guide you to what kind of headwinds we see but again our focus is on making sure we don t have exposure to cash flow not balance sheet risk jim goss barrington research analyst okay maybe one separate question is there an optimal balance between print and digital displays you re increasing your digital exposure but at some stage maybe print is still going to be more appropriate to certain applications or do you think that s not true and that everything eventually goes to digital displays scott wells chief executive officer of clear channel outdoor americas jim it s scott here i ll take a crack at that and give the other guys a chance to chip in we think print is a very important part of our business and we think that there is absolutely a balance the earlier question where i was referring to some of our markets have gone to more than 50 digital revenue we still have very meaningful print positions and there are definitely advertisers that prefer that format they like to own a location so i think that you re going to see us working to optimize across those two and that that will be sort of a perpetual feature of the business over the next bunch of years i don t see print being something that we would be looking to take a step back because customers do value it william eccleshare worldwide chief executive officer clear yes i d absolutely echo that i mean across our global footprint print is absolutely at the heart of our business it represents in the sense the core values of out of home is being a mass reach medium digital ad value in some cases but we certainly don t see us becoming a 100 digital business jim goss barrington research analyst okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of stephan bisson of wolfe research stephan bisson wolfe research analyst good morning first behind the strong americas guide are you guys seeing really any kind of dichotomy in performance of markets or larger markets doing better than smaller markets as local ahead of national and are there any categories that are particularly strong scott wells chief executive officer of clear channel outdoor americas so from a guidance perspective we are looking at our channels we re looking at our product lines and we re looking at our geography trends i think what we have been seeing over the last 18 months has been strength across the channels so airports national and local are all seeing good strength we ve seen strength across both printed and digital and as we ve looked at guidance we have to take into account supply demand balance and things along those lines as we re looking downstream but there s not a particular category or a particular product line that s coming into play certainly our anticipated digital conversion is something that we take into account and we re expecting our level of conversion in the states to be the same or maybe a little bit higher than it was in 2019 but there s not any one particular thing that s driving the business the key to having the business perform well and you saw it in our 2019 results we talked a lot about our digital conversions and the things we were doing with data but we also talked about what we did with premier panels and converting that and so innovation and across the whole product line is important to keep the customers engaged and what we re looking at is we guide is the combination of what we re able to see in terms of deals that we ve already done what we know we re going to do in terms of product innovation and capacity and what we believe in terms of how the market is going to develop over the course of the year hopefully that sheds some light for you stephan bisson wolfe research analyst it does and then would it be fair to assume that most of the revenue growth is driven by pricing rather than occupancy scott wells chief executive officer of clear channel outdoor americas i wouldn t say that that s fair to assume we do focus on yield particularly if the business becomes more digital and we were 34 digital in q4 the concept of yield is a more driving concept than focusing just on price or just on occupancy because you can do different things with the product so as i look back at 2019 and really the last couple of years it s been a balanced growth driver that we ve had because we ve seen both occupancy and our achieved rates go up and frankly we don t really focus on that we focus on the yield aspect stephan bisson wolfe research analyst you gotta thank you so much operator your next question comes from the line of alexia quadrani of jp morgan anna lizzul jp morgan analyst hi this is anna lizzul on for alexia just building upon the previous question did you see any strengths or weaknesses in any particular verticals such as technology retail financial services or any others brian coleman chief financial officer and treasurer so are you asking for 2019 or you asking as we sort of look at 2020 ahead anna lizzul jp morgan analyst for 2019 particularly in the americas business brian coleman chief financial officer and treasurer okay so in 2019 our biggest category growth was in insurance that was a very strong category technology was a very strong category business services performed well food and food products performed well entertainment was a good category for us so those are the ones that we re leading and i m sure your related question would be what were the ones that we re lagging and the ones that were most challenged in 2019 were travel and transportation telecom and beverages beyond that it starts to get pretty small it was a pretty strong year across all the categories and our growers greatly exceeded our shrinkers which was obviously key in delivering the results anna lizzul jp morgan analyst great and just as a follow up what impact have you seen so far from the coronavirus across your business segments and does your guidance incorporate any potential hit to the results and what gives you confidence in the full year outlook william eccleshare worldwide chief executive officer clear so i think on coronavirus the truth is this is rapidly evolving situation and we re obviously monitoring it very closely we re particularly concerned about any of our people who might be infected both in china and elsewhere it is moving very quickly i would say and we have so far as we announced this morning from china we ve certainly seen an impact on the china business in the first quarter we have seen some limited instances of it having an impact in a small number of the european markets to date but it s really i think way too early to try to evaluate what the impact would be across the full year operator at this time there are no further questions i will now turn the call to management for any closing comments brian coleman chief financial officer and treasurer thank you i want to ask the question that wasn t asked and that is how do you intend to attack your leverage profile and i want to talk about that a minute first and foremost fundamentals we want to grow the business we want to manage cost effectively and by that i mean we re going to continue to invest in the high margin operations particularly in the u s we have opportunities for opportunistic refinancings the term loan b market is attractive but primarily i m referring to the opportunity in february of next year to refinance our expenses 9 25 notes if the market environment that we have today holds until then that s a significant amount of savings that we can achieve and grow free cash flow you ve seen effective tax planning strategies we re implementing that that also increases free cash flow and as william mentioned and as i kind of weighed in on as well the potential for accretive dispositions it is something that we are considering as long as we get fair value for whatever it is that we re looking at so in closing i wanted to kind of point that out and william i ll turn it over for you if you have any remarks william eccleshare worldwide chief executive officer clear thank you brian for underlying those really important points that i think we have made it very clear the direction we re moving in i think we ve given very clear sense of the huge momentum that we have in the business particularly in united states and really appreciate everybody joining the call and your interest in the company and we look forward to updating you through the year thank you very much and good morning operator

what key insights have emerged from development economics in the past decade and how should they impact the work of the world bank a new working paper toward successful development policies insights from research in development economics from the bank s research department captures 13 of the most significant insights in the world of development economics here s insight 4 on how macroeconomic and microeconomic insights need to be understood from the ground up at the moment of policy design see all previous insights here thirteen insights for successful development policies traditionally macroeconomic outcomes such as growth economic fluctuations and reactions to policies and shocks have been studied using aggregate data at the country level a flurry of new research over the past decade has centered on using micro data at the product firm and sector level to shed new light on aggregate outcomes macro insights from firm dynamics one approach analyzes the macroeconomic implications of firm level dynamics and the misallocation of inputs and production across firms ref1 by studying macroeconomic performance as a result of the interaction of individual firms and the surrounding business environment we have learned how policy distortions at the firm level affect firms behavior and lead to worse aggregate outcomes one example is the allocation of credit traditionally the effect of financial conditions on economic growth was studied by comparing economic performance across countries with different credit market institutions developed financial markets foster prosperity by allocating capital efficiently across the various production possibilities in the economy even if the cross country comparison could uncover a positive relation between financial development and growth it would be silent about the mechanism through which such a positive relation works the new firm level approach to the question proves to be very revealing recent research shows that financial markets benefit growth by directly providing credit to firms with good opportunities ref2 although the overall functioning of financial markets is important the allocation of credit across firms matters for economy wide growth small as well as young firms that create novel products and technologies but that lack the financing to scale up tend to be harmed the most by misallocation of credit in countries where credit is expensive and hard to access firms typically are small leading to a misallocation of credit large firms that are relatively less productive end up producing a significant share of the output while smaller more productive firms are unable to grow and to contribute as much as they could credit frictions tend to discourage firm entry and creative destruction leading to poor economic performance ref3 a policy implication is that just developing financial markets might not be enough to generate growth ensuring that credit flows to the firms that have growth potential is as important ref4 ref5 beyond financial markets public policy should take into account how different economic agents respond differently to policies the regulation of entry for instance should consider the incentives for low scale entrepreneurship to become informal ref6 similarly tax policy should anticipate distortions to firm growth that happen when firms of different sizes face differential enforcement ref7 these are examples that illustrate the breadth of the importance of understanding the aggregate impact of policies at a more disaggregated level micro evidence on the aggregate welfare effects of trade micro level evidence yields important new insights on aggregate outcomes in the field of international trade as well influential recent research shows that the aggregate welfare gains from trade may not be as big as previously thought particularly for large countries with a smaller share of trade in gdp ref8 however subsequent research based on micro data on products firms and industries shows that there are subtle but important nuances in the calculations of aggregate welfare gains from trade that could depend on sectoral linkages and the structure of the tariffs if the products of one sector are used as inputs in other sectors then the aggregate welfare gains from trade could be higher as expansion in one sector indirectly benefits the other sectors through these linkages ref9 on the other hand for those countries where higher tariffs are imposed on imported products that respond less to tariff changes the aggregate welfare gains from trade could be less ref10 this could be because firms are locked into fixed import patterns in global value chains and may not switch inputs in response to tariff changes in the short run all these nuances are missing when we only focus on aggregate statistics such as average tariff rates the bottom up approach yields insights on how trade affects workers firms and localities differently for example low cost imports from china increase unemployment lower labor force participation and reduce wages in some local labor markets in the united states contributing to one quarter of the contemporaneous aggregate decline in u s manufacturing employment even though the aggregate welfare gains from trade with china are positive ref11 the firm level approach also reveals that there are significant downward biases in aggregate measures of domestic value added embodied in exports this is because aggregate statistics are mainly constructed based on data from large firms which tend to use more imported material inputs and therefore produce less domestic value added the new firm level approach aggregates firms domestic value added from the ground up based on customs transaction data for all firms not just large ones based on this firm level evidence new research shows that the domestic value added of china s exports is higher than previously thought and rising over time due to trade and fdi liberalization ref12 one important policy implication from the micro approach to trade is to have targeted redistribution policies in place when countries experience

industries therefore labor market policies focusing on industries such as u s trade adjustment assistance can be less effective than location based or active labor market policies such as denmark s flexicurity ref13 the world bank has already taken steps in the direction of helping policy makers design policy based on insights from this ground up approach it has been doing so by developing statistical tools that enable countries to track the heterogeneous effects of existing policies such as the exporter dynamics database and the enterprise surveys moreover it has increasingly showcased the importance of a firm level and sectoral level approach to macroeconomic variables in its various analytical and research products such as the latest world development report on global value chains
