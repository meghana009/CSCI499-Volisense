home search ich de dollarizing the american financial empire by michael hudson and bonnie faulkner i mperialism is getting something for nothing it is a strategy to obtain other countries surplus without playing a productive role but by creating an extractive rentier system an imperialist power obliges other countries to pay tribute of course america doesn t come right out and tell other countries you have to pay us tribute like roman emperors told the provinces they governed u s diplomats simply insist that other countries invest their balance of payments inflows and official central bank savings in us dollars especially u s treasury ious this treasury bill standard turns the global monetary and financial system into a tributary system that is what pays the costs of u s military spending including its 800 military bases throughout the world i m bonnie faulkner today on guns and butter dr michael hudson today s show de dollarizing the american financial empire dr hudson is a financial economist and historian he is president of the institute for the study of long term economic trend a wall street financial analyst and distinguished research professor of economics at the university of missouri kansas city his most recent books include and forgive them their debts lending foreclosure and redemption from bronze age finance to the jubilee year killing the host how financial parasites and debt destroy the global economy and j is for junk economics a guide to reality in an age of deception we return again today to a discussion of dr hudson s seminal 1972 book super imperialism the economic strategy of american empire a critique of how the united states exploited foreign economies through the imf and world bank we discuss how the united states has dominated the world economically both as the world s largest creditor and then later as the world s largest debtor and take a look at the coming demise of dollar domination july 12 2019 information clearing house bonnie faulkner michael hudson welcome back michael hudson it s good to be back bonnie bonnie faulkner why is president trump insisting that the federal reserve lower interest rates i thought they were already extremely low and if they did go lower what effect would this have michael hudson interest rates are historically low and they have been kept low in order to try to keep providing cheap money for speculators to buy stocks and bonds to make arbitrage gains speculators can borrow at a low rate of interest to buy a stock yielding dividends and also making capital gains at a higher rate of return or by buying a bond such as corporate junk bonds that pay higher interest rates and keep the difference in short low interest rates are a form of financial engineering trump wants interest rates to be low in order to inflate the housing market and the stock market even more as if that is an index of the real economy not just the financial sector that is wrapped around the economy of production and consumption beyond this domestic concern trump imagines that if you keep interest rates lower than those of europe the dollar s exchange rate will decline he thinks that this will make u s exports more competitive with foreign products trump is criticizing the federal reserve for not keeping interest rates even lower than those of europe he he thinks that if interest rates are low there will be an outflow of capital from this country to buy foreign stocks and bonds that pay a higher interest rate this financial outflow will lower the dollar s exchange rate he believes that this will increase the chance of rebuilding america s manufacturing exports this is the great neoliberal miscalculation it also is the basis for imf models how low interest rates lower the dollar s exchange rate raising import prices trump s guiding idea is that lowering the dollar s value will lower the cost of labor to employers that s what happens when a currency is devalued depreciation doesn t lower costs that have a common worldwide price there s a common price for oil in the world a common price of raw materials and pretty much a common price for capital and credit so the main thing that s devalued when you push a currency down is the price of labor and its working conditions workers are squeezed when a currency s exchange rate falls because they have to pay more for goods they import if the dollar goes down against the chinese yen or european currency chinese imports are going to cost more in dollars so will european imports that is the logic behind beggar my neighbor devaluations are you tired of the lies and non stop propaganda get your free daily newsletter how much more foreign imports will cost depends on how far the dollar goes down but even if it plunges by 50 percent even if the dollar were to become a junk currency like the argentinian or other latin american currencies that cannot really increase american manufacturing exports because not much american labor works in factories anymore workers drive cabs and work in the service industry or for medical insurance companies even if you give american workers in manufacturing companies all their clothing and food for nothing they still can t compete with foreign countries because their housing costs are so high their medical insurance is so high and their taxes are so high that they re priced out of world markets so it won t help much if the dollar goes down by 1 percent 10 percent or even 20 percent if you don t have factories going and if you don t have a transportation system a power supply and if our public utilities and infrastructure are being run down there s nothing that currency manipulation can do to enable america to quickly rebuild its manufacturing export industries american parent companies have already moved their factories abroad they have given up on america as long as trump or his successors refrain from changing that system as long as he gives tax advantages for companies to move abroad there s nothing he can do that will restore industry here but he s picked up international monetary fund s junk economics the neoliberal patter talk that it s given to latin america pretending that if a country just lowers its exchange rate more it will be able to lower its wages and living standards paying labor less in hard currency terms until at some point when its poverty and austerity get deep enough it will become more competitive that hasn t worked for fifty years in latin america it hasn t worked for other countries either and it never worked in the united states the 19th century american school of political economy developed the economy of high wages doctrine i review this in my book on america s protectionist takeoff 1815 1914 they recognized that if you pay labor more it s more productive it can afford a better education and it works better that s why high wage labor can undersell low wage pauper labor trump is therefore a century behind the times in picking up the imf austerity idea that you can just devalue the currency and reduce labor s wages and living standards in international terms to make the economy more profitable and somehow work your way out of debt what currency depreciation does do when the dollar is devalued is to enable wall street firms to borrow 1 and to buy european currencies and bonds yielding 3 percent or 4 percent or 5 percent or stocks yielding even more the guiding idea is to do what japan did in 1990 have very low interest rates to increase what s called the carry trade the carry trade is borrowing at a low interest rate and buying bonds yielding a higher rate making an arbitrage gain on the interest rate differential so trump is creating an arbitrage opportunity for wall street investors he pretends that this is pro labor and can rebuild manufacturing but it only helps hollow out the u s economy sending money to other countries to build them up instead of investing in ourselves so the effect of what trump s doing is the opposite of what he says he s doing bonnie faulkner exactly what is the point of driving investment into foreign countries away from the united states michael hudson if you re an investor you can make more money by dismantling the u s economy you can borrow at 1 percent and buy a bond or a stock that yields 3 or 4 percent that s called arbitrage it s a financial free lunch the effect of this free lunch as you say is to build up foreign economies or at least their financial markets while undercutting your own finance is cosmopolitan not patriotic it doesn t really care where it makes money finance goes wherever the rate of return is highest that s the dynamic that has been de industrializing the united states over the past forty years bonnie faulkner from what you re saying it sounds like donald trump s policies are leading to doing to the united states what the imf and world bank have traditionally done to foreign economies michael hudson that s what happens when you devalue the financial sector will see that interest rates are going down so the dollar s exchange rate also will decline investors will move their money or will borrow into euros gold or japanese yen or swiss francs whose exchange rate is expected to rise so you re offering a financial arbitrage and capital gain for investors who speculate in foreign currencies you re also hollowing out the economy here and squeezing real wage levels and living standards why devaluation will not help re industrialize the u s economy bonnie faulkner do you think that donald trump understands what he s doing michael hudson i don t think he understands i think he has an oversimplified view of how the world works he thinks that if we devalue the dollar we can undersell china and europe but you can only undersell them if you have car making factories available if you don t have a factory you re not going to be able to undersell foreign carmakers no matter how low the dollar goes and if you don t have a set of computer manufacturing factories and local suppliers already in the united states you re not going to have production capacity able to undersell china most of all you need public infrastructure and affordable housing education and health care so trump s view is a fantasy it s like saying if we had some ham we could have some ham and eggs if we had some eggs it leaves the causes of america s de industrialization out of account if we had unemployed car makers computer makers and other manufacturers here factories that were idle in an economy that was pretty competitive then devaluation might make some sense but americans are not just a bit uncompetitive the housing costs in america are so high the medical and health insurance costs the taxes and wage withholding on labor and prices for basic infrastructure that there s no way that we can compete with foreign countries simply by currency manipulation since 1980 the u s economy has been made very high cost yet there also has been a huge squeeze on labor by raising the prices it has to pay for basic needs even if wages go up people can t afford to live as well as they did thirty years ago a radical restructuring is needed in order to restore a full employment industrial economy you need de privatization you have to break up monopolies you need the kind of economy and economic reform that america had under franklin roosevelt in the 1930s i don t see that happening bonnie faulkner do you think that donald trump was installed as u s president to oversee the bankruptcy of the united states and dismantling the u s empire michael hudson nobody installed him he installed himself i don t think most people expected him to win if you look at the odds that professional bookies and oddsmakers gave from the time he announced his candidacy most people thought that sleepy jeb bush would get the nomination and that bush then would lose to hillary so there were indeed attempts an attempt to install hillary or bush but nobody tried to install trump he made an end run around them by straight talk humor and celebrityhood he didn t have advisors that he would listen to because he s always been a one man show and he doesn t really know what he s doing economically he knows how to cheat people victimize suppliers and how to make money in real estate simply by not paying suppliers and by borrowing from banks and not paying them but he has no idea that you can t run an economy this way being a real estate mafioso isn t the same thing as running a whole economy trump has no idea and i don t think anyone knows how to control him except maybe fox news wall street vs the real economy which turns out to be more real bonnie faulkner what is going on with the ruling class in the united states does anybody in its ranks know how to run an economy michael hudson the problem is that running an economy to help the people and raise living standards and even to lower the cost of living and doing business means not running it to help wall street if someone knows how to run an economy the financial sector wants to keep them out of any public office high finance is short term not long term it plays the hit and run game not the much harder task of creating a framework for tangible economic growth you can do one of two things you can help labor or you can help wall street if running the economy means helping labor and improving living standards by giving better medical care this is going to be at the expense of the financial sector and short term corporate profits so the last thing you want to do is have somebody run the economy for its own prosperity instead of for wall street s purpose at issue is who s going to do the planning will it be elected public officials in the government or wall street wall street s public relations office is the university of chicago it claims that a free market is one where rich wall street investors and the financial class run an economy but if you let people vote and democratically elect governments to regulate that s called interference in a free market this is the fight that trump has against china he wants to tell it to let the banks run china and have a free market he says that china has grown rich over the last fifty years by unfair means with government help and public enterprise in effect he wants chinese to be as threatened and insecure as american workers they should get rid of their public transportation they should get rid of their subsidies they should let a lot of their companies go bankrupt so that americans can buy them they should have the same kind of free market that has wrecked the us economy china doesn t want that kind of a free market of course it does have a market economy it is actually much like the united states was in its 19th century industrial takeoff with strong government subsidy u s changing monetary strategy from payments surplus to deficit status bonnie faulkner in your seminal work from 1972 super imperialism the economic strategy of american empire you write whereas us domination of the world economy stemmed from 1920 through 1960 from its creditor position its control since the 1960s has stemmed from is debtor position not only have the tables been turned but us diplomats have found that their leverage as the world s major debtor economy is fully as strong as that which formerly had reflected its net creditor position this sounds counter intuitive could you break it down let s start with 1920 through 1960 how was the united states able to dominate the world economy from its creditor position michael hudson the u s creditor position really began after world war i based on the money it lent to the allies before it joined the war when the war ended u s diplomats told england and france to pay us for the arms they had bought early on but in the past for centuries the victors usually forgave all the debts among each other once a war was over for the first time america insisted that the allies pay for the military support it had sold them before joining them the european allies were pretty devastated by the war and they turned to germany and insisted on reparations that quickly bankrupted germany german bankrupted its economy trying to pay england and france which simply sent it on to pay the united states their balance of payments was in deficit and their currencies were going down american investors saw an opportunity to buy up their industry gold was the measure of power the backing for domestic money and credit and hence capital investment america was much more productive not having suffered war damage here between the end of world war ii and 1950 when the korean war broke out america accumulated over 75 percent of the world s monetary gold the united states had heavy agricultural exports growing industrial exports and enough money to buy up the leading industries of europe and latin america and other countries but beginning in 1950 with the korean war the u s balance of payments moved into deficit for the first time it got even worse when president eisenhower decided that america had to support french colonialism in southeast asia in french indochina vietnam and laos by the time the vietnam war escalated in the 1960s the dollar was running large balance of payments deficits every week on wall street we would watch the gold supply go down losing gold to countries that weren t at war like france and germany they were cashing in the excess dollars that were being spent by the u s military by the 1960s it became clear that america was on a trajectory to run out of gold within a decade because of this overseas war spending it finally did by august 1971 when president nixon stopped selling bold on the london exchange and the price was allowed to soar far above 35 an ounce the u s balance of payments was still running a deep deficit because of the fighting in southeast asia and elsewhere creating a permanent balance of payments deficit the private sector was just in balance during the 1950s and 1960s the entire deficit was military when america went off gold people began to wonder what was going to happen many predicted an economic doomsday it was losing its ability to rule the world through gold but what i realized and was the first to publish was that if countries no longer could buy and hold gold in their international reserves what were they going to hold there was only one asset that they could hold u s government securities that is treasury bonds a treasury bond is a loan to the us treasury when a foreign central bank buys a bond it finances the domestic u s budget deficit so the balance of payments deficit ends up financing the domestic budget deficit the result is a circular flow of military spending recycled by foreign central banks after 1971 the united states continued to spend abroad militarily and in 1974 the opec countries quadrupled the price of oil at that time the united states told saudi arabia that it could charge whatever it wanted for its oil but it had to recycle all its net dollar earnings the saudis were not to buy gold the saudis were told that it would be an act of war if they didn t recycle into the american economy the dollars they received for their oil exports they were encouraged to buy u s treasury bonds but could also buy other u s bonds and stocks to help push up the stock and bond markets here while supporting the dollar the united states kept its own gold stock while wanting the rest of the world to hold its savings in the form of loans to the united states so the dollar didn t go down other countries that were receiving dollars simply recycled them to buy u s financial securities what would have happened if they wouldn t have done this let s say you re germany france or japan if you don t recycle your dollar receipts back to the u s economy your currency is going to go up dollar inflows from export sales are being converted into your currency increasing its exchange rate but by buying u s bonds or stocks bid the price of dollars back up against your own currency so when the united states runs a balance of payments deficit under conditions where other countries keep their foreign reserves in dollars the effect is for other countries to keep their currencies exchange rates stable mainly by lending to the u s government that gives the united states a free ride it can encircle the world with military bases and the dollars that this costs are returned to the united states imagine writing ious when you go out to spend at a store or restaurant but your ious are never going to be collected the store might say we have an iou from bonnie faulkner let s keep it as our savings instead of putting it in the bank or asking for payment in real money we re just going to keep collecting these ious from bonnie faulkner corporations call such ious and trade credit receivables now suppose you went on a spending spree and gave the store a billion dollars worth of your ious there s no way that you could pay off this billion dollars in that case the stores receiving these ious would say well we really don t want to foreclose on bonnie because we know that she can t pay we d lose the value of receivables on the asset side of our balance sheet all these ious that we ve been collecting that s essentially what foreign countries are saying about their buildup of dollars the u s position is in effect that we are not going to repay any foreign country the dollar debt we owe them as treasury secretary john connolly said it s our dollars but your problem other countries have to pay us or else we ll bomb them the military dimension to this arrangement is the u s position that it would be an act of war if other countries don t keep spending their export earnings on loans or u s stocks and bonds that s what makes the united states the exceptional country the value of our currency is based on other countries savings the money they save has to be held in the form of dollars or securities that we re never going to repay even if we could this is a huge free ride you d think that donald trump would want to keep it going but he claims that china is manipulating its currency by recycling its dollars into loans to the u s treasury what does he mean by that china is earning a lot of dollars by exports its goods to the united states what does it do with these dollars it tried to do what america did with europe and south america it tried to buy american companies but the united states blocked it from doing this on specious national security grounds the government claims that our national security would be threatened if china would buy a chain of filling stations as it wanted to do in california the united states thus has a double standard claiming that it is threatened if china buys any company but insisting on its right to buy out the commanding heights of foreign economies with its electronic dollar credit that leaves china with only one option it can buy u s treasury bonds lending its export earnings to the u s treasury trump is now driving other countries out of the dollar orbit china now realizes that the u s treasury isn t going to repay even if it wanted to recycle its export earnings into treasury bonds or u s stocks and bonds or real estate donald trump now is saying that he doesn t want china to support the dollar s exchange rate and keep its own exchange rate down by buying u s assets we re telling china not to do what we ve told other countries to do for the past forty years to buy u s securities trump accuses countries of artificial currency manipulation if they keep their foreign reserves in dollars so he s telling them and specifically china to get rid of their dollar holdings not to buy dollars with their export earnings anymore so china is buying gold russia also is buying gold and much of the world is now in the process of reverting to the gold exchange standard meaning that gold is used to settle international payments imbalances but is not connected to domestic money creation countries realize that there s a great advantage of the gold exchange standard there s only a limited amount of gold in the world s central banks this means that any country that wages war is going to run such a large balance of payments deficit that it s going to lose its gold reserves so reviving the role of gold may prevent any country including the united states from going to war and suffering a military deficit the irony is that trump is breaking up america s financial free ride its policy of monetary imperialism by telling counties to stop recycling their dollar inflows they ve got to de dollarize their economies the effect is to make these economies independent of the united states trump already has announced that we won t hire chinese in our it sectors or let chinese study subjects at university that might enable them to rival us so our economies are going to separate in effect trump has said that if we can t win in a trade deal if we can t make other countries lose and become more dependent on u s suppliers and monopoly pricing then we re not going to sign an agreement this stance is driving not only china but russia and even europe and other countries all out of the u s orbit the end result is going to be that the united states is going to be isolated without being able to manufacture like it used to do it s dismantled its manufacturing so how will it get by some population figures were released a week ago showing the middle of america is emptying out the population is moving from the midwestern and mountain states to the east and the west coasts and the gulf coast so trump s policies are accelerating the de industrialization of the united states without doing anything to put new productive powers in place and not even wanting other countries to invest here the german car companies see trump putting tariffs on the imported steel they need to build cars in the united states it built them here to get around america s tariff barriers against german and other automobiles but now trump is not even letting them import the parts that they need to assemble these cars in the non unionized plants they ve built in the south what can they do perhaps they ll propose a trade with general motors and chrysler the europeans will get the factories that american companies own in europe and give them their american factories in exchange this kind of split is occurring without any attempt to make american labor more competitive by lowering its cost of housing or the price of its health insurance and medical care or its transportation costs or the infrastructure costs so america is being left high and dry as a high priced economy in a nationalistic world while running a huge balance of payments deficit to support its military spending all over the globe bonnie faulkner so it sounds like when the united states went off the gold standard the dollar basically replaced gold as the main asset in which foreign governments could hold their assets now you re saying that when there was no more gold standard if foreign economies didn t buy u s treasuries the price of their currency would rise and make them uncompetitive michael hudson yes imagine if americans would have to pay more and more dollars to buy german cars there s going to be a larger demand for german currency the euro whose exchange rate would rise that was happening throughout the 1960s and 1970s before the euro the only way that germany could keep down the value of its mark was to buy something that cost dollars it didn t buy american exports because america already was making and exporting less and less except for food and germany can only eat so much wheat and soybeans so the only thing that germany could buy that was priced in dollars were u s treasury bonds that kept the german mark from rising even more rapidly and kept the balance of payments in balance japan had a similar problem the japanese tried to buy u s real estate but they didn t have any idea of what made real estate valuable here they lost a reported billion dollars on buying rockefeller center not realizing that the building was separate from the land value and the land was owned by columbia university the building itself was running at a deficit most of the rental value paid was to the owner of the land s groundrent the japanese had no idea of how american real estate worked the euro is only a satellite currency of the u s dollar some americans worried that the euro might become a rival to the dollar after all europe is not de industrializing it is moving forward and producing better cars airplanes and other exports so the united states persuaded foreign politicians to cripple the euro by making it an austerity currency creating so few government bonds that there s no euro vehicle large enough for foreign countries to keep their foreign reserves in the united states can create more and more dollar debt by running a budget deficit we can follow keynesian policies by running a deficit to employ more labor but the eurozone refuses to let countries run a budget deficit of more than 3 percent of its gdp now running more than 3 percent of their gdp that level is very marginal compared to the united states and if you re trying not to run any deficit at all and even if you keep it less than 3 then you re imposing austerity on your country keeping your employment down you re stifling your internal market cutting your throat by being unable to create a real rival to the dollar that s why donald rumsfeld called europe a dead zone and why the only alternatives for a rival currency are the chinese yuan they re moving into a gold based currency area along with russia iran and other members of the shanghai cooperation organization bonnie faulkner the european union not allowing european countries within the eurozone to not run deficits more than 3 percent was basically cutting their own throat why would they do such a thing michael hudson because the heads of the central bank are fighting a class war they look at themselves as financial generals in the economic fight against labor to hurt the working class lower wages and help their political constituency the wealthy investing class europe always has had a more vicious class war than the united states does it s never really emerged from its aristocratic post feudal system its central bankers and universities follow the university of chicago free market school saying that the way to get rich is to make your labor poorer and to create a government where labor doesn t have a voice that s europe s economic philosophy and it s why europe has not matched the growth that china and other countries are experiencing bonnie faulkner so it sounds like then the united states has been able to dominate the world economy since 1971 from a debtor position michael hudson when it was losing gold from 1950 to 1971 that wasn t dominating that was losing america s gold supply to france germany japan and other countries only when it stopped the gold exchange standard and left countries with no alternative for their international savings but to buy u s treasury bonds or other securities was it able to pay for its military spending without losing its power since 1971 world diplomacy has essentially been backed by american military power it s not a free market military power keeps countries in a financial strait jacket in which the united states can run into debt without having to repay it other countries that run payments deficits are not allowed to expand their economies either to rival the united states or even to improve living standards for their labor force only countries outside the u s orbit china and in principle russia and some other countries in asia are able to increase their living standards and capital investment and technology by being free of this globalized financial class war bonnie faulkner in super imperialism you write that pressures to create a new international economic order collapsed by the end of the 1970s are you saying that other countries simply gave up and acquiesced to american monetary imperialism what happened michael hudson i m told that there was wholesale bribery officials in the reagan administration told me that they just paid off foreign officials to support the u s position not a new international economic order u s agencies maneuvered within the party politics of european and near eastern countries to promote pro american officials and sideline those who did not agree to act as u s satellites a lot of money was involved in this meddling so the united stateshas corrupted democratic politics throughout europe and the near east and much of asia that has succeeded in sterilizing foreign independence in the united states meanwhile thatcher s and reagan s neoliberal ideas were promoted instead of the kind of mixed economy that roosevelt and social democracy had been pressing for fifty years who will plan economies financial managers or democratic governments bonnie faulkner if there were pressures to create a new international economic order in the 1970s what was this new order looking to achieve michael hudson other countries wanted to do for their economies what the united states has long done for its own economy to use their governments deficit spending to build up their infrastructure raise living standards create housing and promote progressive taxation that would prevent a rentier class a landlord and financial class from taking over economic management in the financial field they wanted governments to create their own money to promote their own development just like the united states does the role of neoliberalism was the opposite it was to promote the financial and real estate sector and monopolies to take economic management away from government so the real question from the 1980s on was about who would be the basic planning center of society would it be the financial sector the banks and bondholders whose interest is really the one percent that own most of the banks bonds and stocks or is it going to be governments trying to subsidize the economy to help the 99 percent grow and prosper that was the social democratic view opposed by thatcherism and reaganism the international drive to de dollarize bonnie faulkner was this pressure that blocked a new international economic order brought on by the united states going off the gold exchange standard michael hudson no it was a reaction against the u s policy of siphoning off the commanding heights of foreign economies the united states wants to control their raw materials exports especially their oil and gas it wants to control their financial system so that all of their economic gains will go to foreign investors mainly u s investors it wants to turn other economies into service economies to the united states and to make them into a kind of super nato military alliance that will oppose any country that does not want to be part of the u s centered unilateral global order bonnie faulkner how does today s monetary imperialism super imperialism differ from the imperialism of the past michael hudson it s a higher stage of imperialism the old imperialism was colonialism you would come in and use military power to install a client ruling class but each country would have its own currency what has made imperialism super is that america doesn t have to colonize another country it doesn t have to invade a country or actually go to war with it all it needs is to have the country invest its savings its export earnings in loans to the united states government this enables the united states to keep its interest rates low and enable american investors to borrow from american banks at a low rate to buy up foreign industry and agriculture that s yielding 10 percent 15 percent or more so american investors realize that despite the balance of payments deficit they can borrow back these dollars at such a low rate from foreign countries paying only 1 percent to 3 percent on the treasury bonds they hold while pumping dollars into foreign economies by buying up their industry and agriculture and infrastructure and public utilities making large capital gains the hope is that and soon we ll earn our way out of debt by this free ride arrangement imperialism is getting something for nothing it is a strategy to obtain other countries surplus without playing a productive role but by creating an extractive rentier system an imperialist power obliges other countries to pay tribute of course america doesn t come right out and tell other countries you have to pay us tribute like roman emperors told the provinces they governed u s diplomats simply insist that other countries invest their balance of payments inflows and official central bank savings in us dollars especially u s treasury ious this treasury bill standard turns the global monetary and financial system into a tributary system that is what pays the costs of u s military spending including its 800 military bases throughout the world and its foreign legion of isis al qaeda fighters and color revolutions to destabilize countries that don t adhere to the dollar centered global economic system bonnie faulkner you write today it would be necessary for europe and asia to design an artificial politically created alternative to the dollar as an international store of value this promises to become the crux of international political tensions for the next generation how does the world break out of this double standard dollar domination michael hudson it s already coming about and trump is a great catalyst speeding departing guests china and russia are reducing their dollar holdings they don t want to hold american treasury bonds because if america goes to war with them it will do to them what it did to iran it will just keep all the money not pay back the investment china has kept in u s banks and the treasury so they re getting rid of the dollars that they hold they re buying gold and are moving as quickly as they can to be independent of any reliance on u s exports they are building up their military so that if the united states tries to threaten them they can defend themselves the world is fracturing bonnie faulkner what are foreign countries like china and russia using to buy gold are they buying it with dollars michael hudson yes they earn dollars or euros from what they re exporting this money goes into the central bank of china because chinese exporters want domestic yuan to pay their own workers and suppliers so they go to the bank of china and they exchange their dollars for yuan the bank of china the central bank then decides what to do with this foreign currency they may go into the open market and buy gold or they may spend it in foreign countries on the belt and road initiative to build a railway and steamship infrastructure and port development to help china s exporters integrate their economy with others and ultimately with europe replacing the united states as customer and supplier they see the united states as a dying economy bonnie faulkner can the chinese build up their belt and road infrastructure projects with dollars michael hudson no they are getting rid of dollars they already are receiving such a large surplus each year that they only use the dollars to buy gold or some goods such as boeing airplanes but mostly food and raw materials when china buys iron from australia for instance they sell dollars from their foreign exchange reserves and buy australian currency to pay australians for the iron ore that they import they use dollars to pay other countries that are still part of the dollar area and still willing to keep adding these dollars to their official monetary reserves instead of holding gold bonnie faulkner well it is kind of surprising michael that countries haven t started doing this a lot sooner michael hudson there has been political pressure not to withdraw from the dollar debt system if countries act independently they risk being overthrown it takes a strong government to resist american interference and dirty tricks to put its own country first instead of following the u s advisors and agents who pay them to serve the u s economy rather than their own or to resist brainwashing by university of chicago s junk economics bonnie faulkner how far along is the dollar s demise as the world s reserve currency michael hudson it s already slowing trump is doing everything he can to accelerate it by threatening that if foreign countries continue to recycle their export earnings into dollars raising the dollar s exchange rate we ll accuse them of manipulating their currency so he would like to end it all by the end of his second term in 2024 bonnie faulkner what would the united states look like if the dollar is no longer the world s reserve currency michael hudson if it continues to let wall street do the economic planning the economy will look like that of argentina bonnie faulkner and what does argentina look like michael hudson a narrow oligarchy at the top keeping labor at the bottom taking away labor s rights to unionize an economy whose financial and military sectors have won the class war bonnie faulkner china with its belt and road infrastructure project is now buying gold on the open market as are a number of other countries has the western banking system penetrated china and if so how would you characterize china s banking system michael hudson there s an attempt by the united states to penetrate china in the recent trade agreements china did permit u s banks to create their own credit i m not sure that this is going to really take off now that trump is accelerating the trade war but basically in america you have private banks extending credit to corporations in china you have the government banks extending the loans that saves china from having a financial crisis in the way that the united states does about 12 percent of american companies are said to be zombie companies they re already insolvent not able to make a profit after paying their heavy debt service but banks are still giving them enough credit to stay in business so they won t have to go bankrupt and create a crisis china doesn t have that problem because when chinese industry and factories are not able to pay the public bank of china can simply forgive the debt its choice is clear either it can let companies go bankrupt and be sold at a low price to some buyer mainly an american or it can wipe the bad debts off the books if china had been crazy enough to have student loans and leave its graduates impoverished instead of providing free universities china s central bank could simply write off the student loans no investors would lose because the banks are owned by the government its position is if you re a factory we don t want you to have to close down and unemploy your labor we ll just write down the debt and if your employees are having a really hard time we ll just write down their debts so that they can spend their money on goods and services to help expand our internal market america s banks are owned by the stockholders and bondholders who would never let chase manhattan or citibank or wells fargo just forgive their various categories of loans that s why public banking is so much more efficient from an economy wide level than private banks it s why banking should be a public utility not privatized bonnie faulkner can you explain further how writing down debts is good for the economy michael hudson well think of the alternative to writing down debts if you don t write down america s student debts the graduates are going to have to pay so much of the student debt service now to the government that they re not going to have enough money to be able to buy a house they won t have enough money to get married they won t have enough money to buy goods and services it means that most people who can buy houses are graduates with trust funds students whose parents are rich enough that they didn t have to take out a student loan to pay for their children s education these hereditary families are rich enough to buy them their own apartment that s why the american economy is polarizing between people who inherit enough money to be able to have their own housing and budgets free of student loans and other debts compared to families that are debt strapped and running deeper into debt and without much savings this financial bifurcation is making us poorer yet neoliberal economic theory sees this as a competitive advantage for them and for employers poverty is not a problem to be solved it is the solution to their own aim of profitability bonnie faulkner so is this whole privatization scheme particularly the privatization of the banking system and privatizing a lot of infrastructure what s bankrupting the united states michael hudson yes just as it s bankrupted england and other countries that followed thatcherism or the neo liberal philosophy since about 1980

three things we re thinking about today the united states and china agreed to resume trade talks at the g20 summit in late june the united states also decided against imposing new tariffs and easing some restrictions on chinese telecommunications company huawei while china agreed to substantial purchases of agricultural and other products from the united states although this truce has reduced the likelihood of further escalation in the short term we expect prolonged discussions in view of the pending issues between the two countries markets globally and especially the technology sector reacted positively to the news meanwhile in addition to diversifying its trading relationships china in general has been turning less dependent on trade in contrast domestic consumption now makes up the lion s share of china s economic growth accounting for 76 of gross domestic product gdp in 2018 up from 59 in 2017 1 net exports however were a 9 drag on growth in 2018 compared to a 9 contribution in 2017 2 further with only 19 3 of chinese exports destined for the united states in 2018 we have thus far seen limited impact from us tariffs on chinese exporters as widely expected index provider msci promoted kuwait to em status in june kuwait s msci emerging markets em index weighting is expected to be about 0 5 with implementation in may 2020 with substantial reserves low levels of debt and a stable banking sector kuwait stands out in an em context kuwait also continues to make significant progress in terms of fiscal and structural reforms and is committed to developing a dynamic and vibrant private sector and while there is still some way to go the results of kuwait s move to reduce the role of the public sector in the economy are encouraging in our view the country is moving away from oil dependence by developing its infrastructure investing in human capital and promoting private sector involvement despite trading at a premium to its em peers valuations in kuwait remain reasonable in our estimation moreover we believe the earnings outlook for listed kuwaiti companies supports a valuation premium on a sector view we remain particularly upbeat about kuwait s banking sector which is showing improving profitability on the back of falling provisioning and improving asset quality the em small cap space remains attractive to us we continue to find investment opportunities in the health care sector as well as companies that stand to benefit from long term secular trends relating to consumption and innovation demographic shifts and aging populations in many em countries are intensifying pressures on health care systems in our view these factors will continue to be a boon for hospitals dietary supplements medical devices and pharmaceuticals the health care landscape is also changing with growing consumer awareness fueling medical and wellness needs we are seeing more consumers embrace preventive health care out of a desire to look and feel better rising domestic consumption also remains a long term secular driver for ems em companies have not only embraced the use of technology but have become global market innovators in many areas we expect technology to continue to reshape ems as technology disruptors become the norm by transforming industry landscapes and companies continue to embrace technology and innovation outlook em equities marched higher in the first half of 2019 supported by the us federal reserve s fed s dovish pivot attractive em valuations and a search for higher yielding assets volatility however remained an overarching feature as negotiations between the united states and china progressed early in the year but then stalled in may a decision to restart talks in late june however provided some immediate relief we expect the us china trade conflict to remain a major headwind even as we welcome a temporary truce in the trade battle we believe it is unlikely to mark the end of longer term tensions in our view investors should be prepared for more market volatility as the two major powers continue to iron out outstanding differences across a wide range of economic and geopolitical issues we continue to stand by our bottom up investment approach in this uncertain environment we believe that it takes first hand research proprietary insights and an extensive network across ems to analyze the impact of the trade war beyond tariffs and identify attractive investment opportunities we remain focused on seeking companies that demonstrate sustainable earnings power and trade at a discount relative to their intrinsic worth and other investments available in the em investment universe emerging markets key trends and developments em equities finished a volatile quarter with modest gains and lagged developed market stocks global trade relations and central bank rhetoric dominated investor sentiment the united states and china agreed in june to restart trade talks after negotiations

stocks fell amid a flare up in us china trade tensions and weak economic data market losses were capped by hopes for a truce in the trade war ahead of a meeting between us president donald trump and

the dollar fell for a third consecutive day on friday as stronger than expected u s inflation data failed to shake convictions that the federal reserve will start cutting interest rates at a policy meeting later this month against a basket of other currencies the dollar fell 0 1 to 96 94 and was on track for its biggest weekly drop in three weeks the core u s consumer price index excluding food and energy rose 0 3 in june the largest increase since january 2018 data on thursday showed the reading pushed u s treasury yields higher but money markets still indicated one rate cut at the end of july and a cumulative 64 basis points in cuts by the end of 2019 cutting interest rates when inflation data is weakening makes sense but signalling a dovish stance when inflation is rising is a bit weird and suggests there are political pressures weighing on the fed said ulrich leuchtmann the head of currency research at commerzbank the dollar s weakness revived carry trades where hedge funds borrow in low yielding currencies such as the swiss franc and the euro to purchase higher yielding ones such as the australian or new zealand dollars on friday the nz dollar gained 0 3 to 0 6665 other currencies which benefited from a weaker dollar were in markets whose central banks signaled a relatively confident outlook to interest rates the canadian dollar was one such beneficiary the loonie rallied to a 10 month high versus the u s dollar after canada s central bank said this week it had no intention of easing monetary policy even as it highlighted the risks that trade wars posed to the global economy higher oil prices also helped the canadian dollar sweden s crown also benefited from a relatively optimistic assessment of its economic outlook after minutes of the central bank s policy meeting the euro trimmed earlier gains after european central bank governing council member ignazio visco said on friday the ecb will need to adopt further expansionary measures if the euro zone economy does not pick up and will consider its options in the coming weeks the single currency was flat at 1 1258 below an intraday high of 1 1275 in early london trading market attention will be focused on comments by chicago fed president charles evans later on friday and new york fed president john williams on monday which will provide a chance to gauge how dovish the u s central bank will be if these fed officials are not as dovish as federal reserve chair jerome powell and if the new york fed s manufacturing survey on monday proves stronger than forecast they could show that the dollar weakening in response to powell s congressional testimony was overdone said masafumi yamamoto chief forex strategist at mizuho securities powell indicated again on thursday that an interest rate cut from the u s central bank is likely at its next meeting later this month as businesses slow investment due to trade disputes and a global growth slowdown
state of the us economy as laffer gets laughable while the willingness to abandon long held beliefs for political gain has always been a common trait among public figures the spectacle has recently taken on shocking levels of casual audacity the contempt for even minimal levels of intellectual consistency has allowed kamala harris to condemn joe biden for his past opposition to federally mandated busing while simultaneously taking the exact same position herself these somersaults are particularly common with former economic conservatives seeking to curry favor with president trump s decidedly non conservative policies we have seen former free trader larry kudlow awkwardly embrace high tariffs and big deficits and economist stephen moore disavow decades of monetary hawkishness to position himself as a potentially reliable trump loyalist but the most dizzying reversal came this week when supposedly conservative reagan administration economist arthur laffer in what i believe to be an audition for a job in the trump administration hit the airwaves to make the case that the federal reserve should be run directly by the president not by the fed s supposedly independent governors come again direct political control of a central bank has always been the bogeyman of any conservative economist was he serious readers of my commentaries would expect me to be the last person to defend the status quo at the federal reserve let me be clear i believe that giving a group of economists the power to set interest rates and regulate the availability of money and credit is a bad idea i would prefer that there were not a fed at all and that interest rates were set by the same free market forces that so successfully regulate other areas of the economy since its establishment more than a century ago the federal reserve has only succeeded in destroying the u s dollar hollowing out american industry massively increasing the size of the federal government and creating a bubble economy completely addicted to borrowing and spending but just because something is bad doesn t mean that it couldn t be far far worse and that certainly would be the case if we were to put the powers of the federal reserve into the hands of politicians whose only goal is to pander to as many constituencies as possible in order to get reelected among the political elite of both parties there has never been nor will there ever be any sustained support for monetary or fiscal discipline for politicians the near term perception of success is all that matters warnings about the dangers of deficits and debt monetization only arise from whatever party is in in the opposition where their meaningless protests serve only as easy rhetoric politicians in power will always consider what is politically expedient over risking the wrath of voters by doing what s unpopular even if they believe such actions to be in the best interest of the nation and while all the members of the federal reserve board are political actors otherwise they never would have been nominated at least they are not habitually threatened by primary challenges and attacks from the white house an independent fed is at least in theory able to set policy based on the consensus of dispassionate analysis of the national and global data applied against a backdrop of economic theory and even though most of the economists at the fed have fully ingested the snake oil of keynesian economic nonsense at least their process is deliberative and somewhat consistent imagine what would happen if the fed were controlled by a single politician under the direction of the president trump the federal reserve would become little more than a campaign satellite office tasked with doing whatever necessary to make the economy look good at least until the next election just think for a second how little a politician like trump cares about principles of good policy during the campaign he excoriated the fed for keeping interest rates too low he argued correctly that the fed s easy money policies had created bubbles in the stock and real estate markets made the obama economy look better than it was exacerbated income inequality and laid the foundation for another economic crash but as soon as he took office those criticisms vanished all trump wants now is for the fed to do for him precisely what he criticized it for doing for obama trump has taken positions with regard to fed policy that are as unprecedented as they are incoherent he simultaneously describes the economy as the greatest in history while demanding that the fed slash rates from already historically low levels this is like a doctor saying that his care has created the healthiest person in human history who incidentally still needs greater doses of life support if president trump directly controlled the fed could anyone doubt that rates would have been taken to zero or even below zero the day after he was inaugurated trump sees stock market returns as the nielsen ratings of his presidential reality show and nothing would push share prices up faster than negative real interest rates control of the fed would mean that trump could order the fed to create money at will which would free him from the hassle of negotiating with congress he could order the fed to fully fund the deficits that his tax cuts and increased spending have created not to mention the building of the border wall trump knows that the average voter would be in favor of lower taxes and free stuff but will show little concern for academic concepts like a growing national debt or the fed s rapidly expanding balance sheet he would exploit that to the hilt the same dynamic would exist if congress were to control the fed perhaps even worse representatives face re election every two years putting them in a state of perpetual pandering there is simply no way that congress could ever allow the fed to do anything that could inflict even temporary economic pain the stimulus would have to always grow and would never stop it s sobering enough to imagine what donald trump or nancy pelosi would do if they were to control the fed but imagine the same powers handed to bernie sanders elizabeth warren or alexandria ocasio cortez they could use the fed to fully realize their socialist vision for america this is precisely what has happened in every country where politicians have direct control of money and so while trump supporters may relish the prospect of their dear leader getting the keys to the monetary kingdom they must understand that such a nirvana may only last for two or six more years after that it s anybody s guess who will wield that power but i can virtually guarantee it will be someone who you wouldn t want within a thousand miles of a monetary printing press the problem with the fed other than the fact that it substitutes the collective wisdom of the free market for the selective and often skewed judgement of a handful of elite economists is that it s already too political while in theory the fed governors are independent it must be understood that truly independent non political actors are never appointed the president nominates and the senate confirms all fed appointees no one gets a seat at that table unless they can be expected to deliver the free goodies that politicians want and for the most part that has been the case while the fed has occasionally dragged its feet when the drum beats grew louder for cheap money it has almost always caved to the pressure eventually but the safety of tenured appointment does allow the fed some degree of insulation from the day to day demands of the crowd and as a result i would vastly prefer the current system to the one proposed by art laffer in his rounds on tv laffer makes the simplistic case that elected representatives control our fiscal and social policies and we should also expect them to control our monetary policy squawk box cnbc 7 8 2019 while such a sentiment makes for a good bumper sticker it would absolutely destroy the economy the fed s balance sheet would balloon out of control sending long interest rates spiking upwards and the u s dollar plunging downward but since a great many people have come of age without encountering such hardships we have forgotten how bad these things can be our confidence will be our undoing but the greatest risk may be one of perception the dollar serves as the world s primary reserve currency in large part due to the confidence the world has in the independence of the federal reserve while this confidence is wholly underserved it nonetheless exists and is key to the dollar maintaining its coveted status maintaining that status is the only way the u s can continue living beyond its means and the only way to keep the entire house of cards built on the foundation of reserve currency status from collapsing the mere consideration of laffer s suggestion could be enough to topple it the fact that laffer is taken seriously at all is news in and of itself back in 2006 and 2007 i was often paired with him on television to discuss the state of the u s economy under bush while i argued that the housing market which had just begun to collapse would bring down the financial system and the economy at large laffer insisted that there was no trouble brewing anywhere on the horizon in fact on one particularly noteworthy segment in august 2006 he bet me a penny that the economy would not slow due to pressures from the housing market suffice it to say he lost that bet his blindness to the last bubble is strikingly similar to his inability to see an even larger bubble today and although laffer never managed to scrape up the penny to pay me he seems more than willing to let his pal donald trump print trillions i hope that one day we will once again allow the supply of savings and the demand for credit to set interest rates such a mechanism will work to allocate capital efficiently and could help the economy repair itself after decades of central bank distortions but i ve been around long enough to recognize that is not going to happen at least not until a crisis leaves those in power with no other choice until that time i would much prefer a quasi independent group of bureaucratic eggheads to a pack of self serving socialists and egomaniacs if we can t kill it entirely we should be thinking about ways to make the fed less political not more read the original article at euro pacific capital best selling author peter schiff is the ceo and chief global

q what does the imf want in return for 6 billion the imf s 6 billion dh22 billion bailout comes with a lot of strings attached which will not be easy for pakistan to adhere to either economically or politically of the 6 billion the lending institution has so far released 1 billion but with the imf extending support the belief is that this will prompt other multilateral and bilateral creditors to provide pakistan with 38 billion and more which is crucial for pakistan to meet its large financing needs in the coming years in return pakistan must move decisively to reduce public debt and build resilience while at the same time create a flexible market determined exchange rate to restore competitiveness and rebuild official reserves the imf will also be driving efforts to eliminate quasi fiscal losses in the energy sector and strengthen institutions and enhance transparency q what is the target on inflation the stated inflation objective is 5 7 per cent of gdp q how has the pakistan rupee fared the difficulties in meeting these requirements are steep indeed the pakistan rupee had been through bouts of volatility in recent times and was quoting at rs150 to a dollar after the imf announced the bailout at one time it was even going for slightly over rs160 since may 16 the state bank of pakistan has allowed the exchange rate to be market determined going forward the sbp might intervene to prevent a possible overshooting or disorderly market conditions while at the same time not suppressing an underlying trend and in a manner consistent with rebuilding reserves finally to remove future drains on its reserves the sbp has agreed to gradually scale back its short swap forward foreign exchange position to us 4 billion by the end of the programme q when should pakistan start working on the turnaround plan the imf wants pakistan to show its intent to clean up with the 2020 federal budget the adjustment will be supported by comprehensive efforts to drastically increase revenue mobilisation by 4 to 5 per cent of gdp at the federal and the provincial level over the programme period it will also be hoping that pakistan will not end up repeating the same mistakes that blighted past bailout programmes the authorities recognise that incomplete policy implementation derailed past adjustment efforts and allowed for repeated cycles of economic and financial stress the imf states their steadfast commitment including their ability to overcome entrenched resistance to reforms will be critical for this new program to succeed in this regard the bold and front loaded actions already undertaken demonstrate the authorities commitment to the programme and the significant external support is key to mitigate risks and allow the programme to achieve its objectives q how has the pakistan economy fared in recent times economic growth has averaged close to 5 per cent over the past five years but it is on the deficit that pakistan is hurting the most the financial year 2018 fiscal deficit ballooned to 6 5 per cent of gdp 2 5 per cent of gdp higher than budgeted and pushing public debt to 75 per cent of gdp the fiscal stimulus together with an accommodative monetary policy and the defence of an overvalued exchange rate fuelled the current account deficit to 6 3 per cent of gdp last year the imf notes q how have state owned enterprises fared beyond the energy sector losses in the three largest state owned enterprises pakistani international airlines pakistan steel mills and pakistan railways have continued to accumulate now totalling over 2 per cent of gdp according to the imf according to a dubai based financier loss making enterprises need to be privatised or closed widening the tax base means more than just levying indirect taxes that end up being regressive
the expansion of banks such as citigroup into cuba haiti and beyond reveal a story of capitalism built on blood labor and racial lines scrubbed from the pages of glossy coffeetable books the history of u s imperialism can be found in the archives of wall street s oldest largest and most powerful institutions a deep dive into the vaults and ledgers of banking houses such as citigroup inc and j p morgan chase and co reveals a story of capitalism and empire whose narrative is not of morally pure and inspiring economic growth technological innovation market expansion and shareholder accumulation but rather of blood and labor stolen sovereignty and pilfered resources military occupation and monetary control sugar comingles with blood chain gangs cross spur lines and the magical abstractions of finance are found vulgarized in the base manifestations of racial capitalism the caribbean archipelago was ground zero for u s imperial banking this history of bankers and empire is also a caribbean history the caribbean archipelago was ground zero for u s imperial banking wall street s first experiments in internationalism occurred in cuba haiti panama puerto rico the dominican republic and nicaragua often with disastrous results for those countries and colonies and often for the imperial banks themselves yet where there was expansion there was also pushback the internationalization of wall street was met with local resistance refusal and revolt and just as the history of imperialism has been excised from popular narratives so too has this history of caribbean anti imperialism and autonomy section separator the history of imperial banking and racial capitalism begins at the end of the nineteenth century at the historical horizon where the project of u s settler colonialism that

victory over spain in the caribbean and the pacific new york city s bankers and merchants believed that the organization of an imperial banking system one that could compete with europe s long established institutions was critical to the global rise of the city and to the consolidation of wall street s position in international ﬁnance trade and commerce with these ambitions bankers and business people set their sights on asserting control over the trade and ﬁnance of the americas they sought to control local central banks establish u s branch banks take over commodity financing reorganize monetary systems on a dollar basis and refinance european funded sovereign debt this project of internationalization was explicitly encouraged and supported by the u s government the war and state departments required ﬁscal agencies to support the infrastructure of u s colonialism and ﬁnancial institutions were an important conduit of colonial policy and ﬁnancial and commercial diplomacy bankers however needed little prodding to move overseas extending their inﬂuence into the sugar plantations railroads and financial systems of haiti cuba santo domingo and nicaragua the u s state made both implicit and explicit assurances that it would intervene should local conditions turn against u s business interests or disrupt the payments of interestor customs revenue founded in 1812 city bank the precursor to today s citigroup emerged as the largest and most important imperial ﬁnancier in the united states at the center of this story was the national city bank of new york the precursor to today s citigroup inc founded in 1812 it emerged as the largest and most important imperial ﬁnancier in the united states through most of the nineteenth century it was a powerful but staid merchant bank whose cautious lending and massive cash reserves helped it ride the nation s economic roils it took on a more aggressive entrepreneurial and activist strategy for expansion and growth under james stillman and frank a vanderlip who carried it into the twentieth century stillman and vanderlip transformed city bank from a merchant bank into a modern financial department store creating a new managerial structure expanding into new financial markets and exploring the possibilities of foreign expansion and international banking the most important theater of internationalization was the american mediterranean as one city banker described the countries and colonies ringing the caribbean sea and the gulf of mexico there the bank experimented with the issuance of sovereign debt the ﬁnancing of international trade the funding of industrial infrastructure and the organization of regional state banks and currency systems beginning in 1914 it also made the caribbean the centerpiece of the largest foreign branch bank system of any u s banking house with cuba the jewel in its crown law was critical to city bank s internationalization and expansion as part of its efforts city bank hammered away at the banking regulations shackling its activities and pushed for regulatory reform while creating new subsidiary organizations that could navigate the complex regulatory geographies of international finance or simply evade existing legal constraint wall street lawyer john sterling of shearman and sterling worked closely with stillman and vanderlip while other firms worked to devise the colonial methods by which the imperial banks operated race was central to city bank s work too in its encounters with the nations and colonies of the caribbean and latin america wall street helped reorder those economies along racial lines exporting the u s racist imaginaries in which wall street was embedded and through which it functioned when conducting business in the caribbean u s bankers understood people of color whether africans or indigenous peoples through the same racist lenses they viewed them through at home white representations of african americans in particular were exported to the west indies and inscribed in a vast and diffuse archive of pamphlets reports circulars press releases prospectuses and journal articles produced by wall street about the caribbean and latin america at the same time in their dispatches back to the united states bankers translated the caribbean to u s businesspeople investors and the general public in some cases they debunked stereotypes as a means to encourage investment in others they replicated and reconstituted racial stereotypes in order to further the expansion of white supremacist control of the region with returns to investment found not in the extraction of capital values but in the ledger of white racial dominance wall street helped reorder the economies of the caribbean and latin america along racial lines one example of this practice can be found in city bank vice president john h allen one of the new slate of managers and vice presidents appointed by vanderlip as part of the bank s modernization of its bureaucracy allen aided the bank s expansion into cuba and argentina and was the manager of the city bank controlled banque nationale de la république d haiti in the 1910s in the city bank s foreign trade journal the americas allen evoked a picture of haiti that would have been recognizable to white u s audiences but for its tropical setting cock ﬁghting and card playing allen asserted are the national pastimes and these together with a supply of haitian rum are all that is necessary for a haitian citizen s perfect day he claimed that during his visits to haiti he found that humorous incidents were of almost daily occurrences for allen such incidents showed the naivete and also the restricted mentality of the people which latter was plainly noticeable even among the more highly educated these anecdotes did not exist in a vacuum they were not an incidental cultural membrane stretched over the inner workings of banking racial capitalism and imperialism instead they contributed to the fundamental ideological and cultural rationales that made the caribbean the target of wall street s imperial aims and at the same time helped fashion the terms through which the caribbean was encountered these representations were underwritten by both direct and indirect forms of violence by coercive diplomacy military force and labor impressment as well as by the terms and conditions of credit and debt the imbalanced application of law and legal regulation and the imposition of modern forms of post emancipation ﬁnancial governance indeed allen himself was deeply involved with the decision to send u s marines to haiti in 1915 in what would become a nineteen year military occupation city bank had been interested in haitian investments since about 1910 and vanderlip sought to use some initial railway and dock investments as a springboard to control the republic s financial system haiti s internal political conflicts fueled in part by outside agitation and interference from both u s and european speculators created disastrous terms for business in response city bank s roger l farnham who viewed the haitian people as nothing but grown up children who required the paternalistic guidance of a stronger power drafted a document arguing for u s military intervention to stabilize the country and protect u s financial and commercial interests the farnham plan as it was dubbed was realized in 1915 when marines landed to restore order following the assassination of haitian president vilbrun guillaume sam the occupation provided the platform for city bank s takeover of the banque nationale while making city bank s imposition of a 30 million loan to the haitian government almost risk free vanderlip described haiti as a small but profitable piece of business for city bank but such profits came at a cost the suppression of a series of peasant insurgencies that left thousands of haitians dead and dozens of villages burned hundreds of haitians were jailed or forced to work on chain gangs serving as a reminder to many haitians of the days of slavery city bank was not the only u s ﬁnancial institution charting an imperial turn it was joined by its neighbors on wall street sometimes as collaborators involved in a collective project to consolidate the ﬁnancial realms of the u s imperium sometimes as rivals embroiled in bitter competition chase manhattan bank for instance made an aggressive push to displace city bank in panama while fighting city bank for pride of place in the financing of the dictatorship of gerardo machado y morales in cuba meanwhile wall street s unincorporated and private investment banks including j p morgan and co speyer and co and kuhn loeb and co began ﬂoating the public debt of caribbean latin american and asian countries states and municipalities and ﬁnancing railroad and port projects these private bankers had initially grown in prominence by using their strong european networks and their close family ties as the conduit to market u s government bonds and corporate securities across the atlantic now increasingly they sold caribbean and latin american debt in the united states the domestic crisis of ﬁnance capitalism in the united states became a crisis of racial capitalism in the caribbean private bankers came to play an important role in the policy of dollar diplomacy initiated by president william howard taft and his secretary of state philander knox in the 1910s in the attempt to displace european inﬂuence and extend u s capitalism in the caribbean which purported to replace military intervention with ﬁnancial diplomacy private bankers worked with ﬁnancial experts and local governments to refund sovereign debt reorganize customs collection and currency systems and organize nominally national government banks the disordered global ﬁnancial and economic conditions unleashed by world war i accelerated the internationalization of wall street and intensiﬁed the relationship between banking bankers and imperialism but the expansion and this initial experiment in imperial banking was short lived the sharp economic crisis following the postwar commodity boom forced a brief retreat from internationalization prompting many wall street institutions including city bank to rethink their strategies for expansion meanwhile the local banking sector in cuba was completely destroyed of course by the end of the 1920s another crisis had occurred the concussions of the october 1929 stock market crash were felt not only domestically but throughout the international branch and subsidiary networks of wall street perhaps most acutely in the caribbean the domestic crisis of ﬁnance capitalism in the united states became a crisis of racial capitalism in the caribbean as wall street s financial edifice imploded so too did the racial bolsters on which it was constructed a wave of anti imperialist and anti wall street sentiment rose across the caribbean manifested in the withdrawal of funds from foreign banks editorials in local newspapers attacking the monopoly presence worker takeover of foreign controlled sugar mills bombings of bank buildings calls for the nationalization or indigenization of foreign owned banks and in the case of cuba calls for the renunciation of foreign debt these assertions of sovereignty were not only a claim for economic independence they were also a rejection of the governing tropes of racial paternalism moreover the rejection of ﬁnance capitalism and imperial banking served as a rejection of white supremacy and the obliteration of the circular logic associating whites with wealth and wealth with whites the desire to break the hold and allure of city bank and other u s banking and investment firms meant a challenge to the divine laws of racial capitalism in these calls for the nationalization or indigenization of state banking and in the cries to default on sovereign debt was a refusal to be governed through the implicitly hierarchal and implicitly racialized international orders that had subordinated these countries to the united states it was also an effort to critique the registers of proﬁtmaking and accumulation through which the caribbean labor that produced products especially sugar was obscured shrouded and hidden in the commodity form itself the radical journalist carleton beals captured this process in the crime of cuba 1933 his account of u s ﬁnance capital of chase bank and city bank and the machado dictatorship early in the book in his discussion of the racialized political economy of sugar beals evokes karl marx s description of the commodity as a social hieroglyphic whose meaning is only revealed through exegetical means for most americans cuba is but the hieroglyphic of a ticker beals writes amer sugar 26 5 8 cub amer sugar 17 1 7 cub am pfd 18 1 5 he goes further unpacking or deciphering the meaning of sugar as the story of the capture of black labor power but for me beals writes all this inner mystery is forever imprisoned in each cube of white sugar i drop into my morning coffee black cuba and black sweat and black song and dance crystallized into a snow cube held in silver prongs the caribbean s rejection of ﬁnance capitalism and imperial banking served as a rejection of white supremacy often such critiques occurred under the guises of the communist party and the comintern especially through their efforts to build a global movement of radical black labor the literature and propaganda of black communists at this time linked racial or what was called national oppression of black workers to ﬁnance capital and imperialism the pages of the negro worker for instance contained denunciations of city bank s involvement in haiti alongside accounts of black labor exploitation and colonial oppression across the african diaspora the magazine was published under the auspices of the international trade union s committee of negro workers a branch of the red international labour union and an appendage of the comintern tasked with mobilizing black labor in worldwide class struggle against global capitalism the paper s one time editor george padmore also cataloged global conditions of black exploitation in his life and struggles of negro toilers published in 1931 padmore was a young black trinidadian functionary for the communist party s negro wing and a proliﬁc writer life and struggles of negro toilerspresents a sweeping comparative account of the conditions suffered by black people in africa and the african diaspora and includes attacks on early twentieth century u s expansionism overseas and with it the transformation of haiti and the dominican republic and liberia and abyssinia into colonies of u s ﬁnance capital padmore assails city bank s imposition of debt on the dominican republic and the transformation of haiti into an american slave colony during the u s occupation he lambasts the black ivory trade the conscription of haitian workers to the cuban plantations of the general sugar company and the united fruit company he argues that haitians were brought to the country in the same ways as chattel slaves of former days haitians were underpaid indebted to their contractors and housed in segregated and unsanitary barracoons in padmore s writing ﬁnance capitalism was racial capitalism similar critiques were implicit in jacques roumain s novel masters of the dew 1941 the founder of the haitian communist party roumain was jailed during the waning days of the u s occupation masters of the dewcenters on a haitian bracerowho returns to his country from cuba and attempts to rebuild haiti through collective labor and a call for black autonomy for roumain the collective pull of the coumbite farmers cooperative replaces the coercive push of the corvée forced labor gang at the same time u s banking and corporate interests became the subject of a radical anti imperialist caribbean literature a literature that can be viewed as a counterpoint to the rhetoric of city bank and attempts by wall street to visualize the caribbean to borrow allen s term for the purposes of exploitation and accumulation cuban poet nicolás guillén s west indies ltd 1934 for instance satirically attacks the corporate transformation of the caribbean into the grotesque headquarters of companies and trusts in nicaraguan novelist s hernán robleto s los estrangulados 1933 the brown brothers and j w seligman controlled banco nacional de nicaragua and the mercantile bank of the americas compañía mercantil de ultramar feature as dominant and domineering institutions undermining the economic independence of the nicaraguan elite through its loaning practices langston hughes wrote of the role of city bank not only in haiti but also in cuba he evokes the transitions from mercantilism to imperialism and colonialism to neocolonialism in cuba s history and offers a glum assessment of the ability of the little fort of san lazaro standing sentinel at the entrance to havana s harbor facing the caribbean sea and the united states to repel the pillaging of ﬁnance capitalism but now writes hughes against a pirate called the national city bank what can you do alone pushback against racial capitalism did not occur only under the auspices of the communist party caribbean intellectuals also turned inward to seek out an autochthonous anti imperial critique that was the precursor to the philosophy of négritude this phenomenon was perhaps most pronounced in haiti for the haitian elite the utter humiliation of the u s occupation forced them to rethink their identities their longstanding identiﬁcations with france and european enlightenment thought and culture proved an absurdity in the face of the brutal racism of the u s occupation many among them realized they were suffering from what jean price mars called a collective bovarism a deluded and misrecognized sense of self the haitian elite slowly realized that europe was not their home africa was price mars s ainsi parla l oncle an ethnological exploration of the culture and folklore of the haitian peasantry and its african origins published in port au prince in 1927 helped spur the development of insurgent literary and national cultures in the caribbean and throughout the african diaspora cuba turned to blackness as an alternative to racial capitalism in cuba this turn to blackness as an alternative to racial capitalism took on multiple and contradictory forms in the early 1920s writers such as jesús masdeu in la raza triste 1924 depicted the black workers in the cuban sugar mills in sentimental romantic and often paternal tones the racial paternalism began to slip away in la danza de los millones 1923 venezuelan expatriate rafael antonio cisneros s experimental novel with its efforts at narrating the effects of the banking crisis of 1920 21 on his black characters in la zafra 1926 a collection of combat poems cuba s agustín acosta recounted the effects of the sugar boom and bust on the country linking ﬁnance capital to racial capitalism and sugar to blackness money and the poison of u s empire acosta made this explicit in the poem la danza de los millones it evokes the incursion of the instruments and techniques of u s ﬁnance capital into the cuban economy portraying it as a turbulent sea threatening to capsize the ship of cuba s sovereignty acosta warned of wall street with its usurious bankers in the novel écue yamba ó written by a young alejo carpentier while in machado s prison in 1927 blackness was rendered as the soul of cuban culture and an african alterity became the terms of a critique of imperialism and white ﬁnance el bongo carpentier wrote antídoto de wall street the antidote to wall street did not prove to be a cure certainly changes occurred and the crises of the 1930s forced wall street to rethink the organization of ﬁnance capital and the project of internationalization in a new era of governance regulation and sovereignty in haiti city bank sold the banque nationale to the haitian government but kept its management structure and its ties to wall street in place in the dominican republic city bank s branches became the basis for a national banking system but u s capital still dominated the country in cuba attempts to renounce chase bank s debts and default on amortization payments were stalled by the cuban courts and it would take another three decades before wall street was finally expelled from the country meanwhile city bank and chase bank would spend the next decades struggling to return to the heady days of unregulated expansion and unbounded freedom that characterized the early twentieth century history of imperial banking

the commander of us central command centcom told the house armed services committee just how concerned he is about china projecting its silk road influence from gwadar to africa through s cpec and consequently establishing a permanent naval presence in the western end of the afro asian ocean cpec is increasingly being appreciated as the game changing geostrategic megaproject that it is after the commander of us central command centcom told the house armed services committee just how concerned he is about its terminal port of gwadar being used as china s launching pad for expanding its silk road influence into africa and consequently establishing a permanent naval presence along the routes connecting several sea lines of communication sloc between them this outlook isn t a unique one and was most recently elaborated upon by the author last week in his piece about how pakistan s indian sub interception proves the importance of the country s navy but it appears to be the first time that a high level american military official publicly confirmed the likelihood of this scenario unfolding and expressed concern about it according to reports joseph votel told the committee that as they develop that land route what they are attempting to do and then we expect then be looking for ports they can connect that to ports in southern pakistan leading to ports in africom us africa command and for us it s going to lead to a permanent presence of chinese maritime military maritime activity in the region that we will need to be concerned with author s note reproduced exactly as reported by the times of india grammatical errors and all this brief statement is loaded with a lot of strategic significance firstly it implies that the joint indian american hybrid war on cpec has failed and that the chinese built megaproject is proceeding apace in turning pakistan into the global pivot state for facilitating transcontinental multipolar integration secondly it draws attention to the southern branch of cpec s logical expansion that the author earlier coined s cpec thirdly votel is convinced that this will also take on military dimensions as china is compelled to defend its slocs all along this route possibly through the clinching of lemoa like deals with pakistan and coastal african countries and finally the fourth main point that can be drawn from the centcom commander s statement is that china s cpec assisted expansion of influence into the western afro asian ocean poses a multidimensional cross theater challenge to american hegemony in the eastern hemisphere what s less clear however is how the us intends to counter this after the failure of the indian american hybrid war on cpec resorting to similar measures against the horn of africa and east african states might backfire for several reasons not least of which is that the interests of the us partners overlap with china s own in this space and would therefore be adversely affected by regional destabilization it s possible that the us might weaponize comparatively low level chaos dynamics such as those embodied by al shabaab but this could inadvertently create opportunities for russia to export its democratic security model from the central african republic to the african coastland and actually safeguard the long term strategic viability of s cpec hence why non kinetic methods will probably be relied upon at this point in time it s very likely that the us will intensify its infowar against china s belt road initiative bri with specific focus being given to the narrative that beijing is more interested in extracting resources through so called debt trap diplomacy than in sincerely developing its partners economies there might also be more underhanded efforts to incite mob violence against chinese citizens in order to bait the people s republic into costly mission creep that it s both militarily unprepared for and which could exacerbate some of the angry locals negative perceptions about it in addition the us could use economic pressure to dissuade african governments from signing lemoa like deals with china and entice them into embracing trumpism instead of silk road led globalism fearmongering about china s speculative military motives the us might use this as the pretext for launching indian led multilateral freedom of navigation patrols the most likely outcome that the us hopes to achieve is to encourage friendly competition between bri and the nascent indo japanese asia africa growth corridor while manipulatively working behind the scenes to influence the rules of the game in such a way as to favor its proxies and their french and emirati partners prior to using their multilateral economic platform as the basis for the creation of a new african centric security bloc for more comprehensively containing china accordingly it would be to the benefit of the emerging multipolar world order if china partnered with pakistan turkey and russia to preemptively thwart this scenario with the first protecting s cpec s slocs the second sharing its widespread soft power in sub saharan africa and the last using its democratic security model to safeguard everything in the most ideal win win arrangement between them all disclaimer the author writes for this publication in a private capacity which is unrepresentative of anyone or any

royal thrones and ancestral stools in nigeria are no longer the exclusive preserve of grassroot elders of the communities who from time immemorial had been custodians of culture customs and tradition bequeathed from one generation to another in a deliberate and determined move to spread the gospel of civilization to the nooks and crannies of the nation the academia professors technocrats professionals captains of industry accomplished and articulate educationists etc had invaded royal palaces of the six geo political zones to effectively represent the voice of their subjects and ensure fair share of the socio economic equation in the nigerian project standing shoulder high above the multitude of those traditional patriots is muhammadu sanusi ii con the 14th emir of kano who bluntly told president buhari that nigeria would become bankrupt if the outrageous payment of 70 of the total generated revenue on debt servicing persisted because no nation could survive in an economy where expenditure on basic social infrastructure depended on a paltry 30 of its total income he made this assertion at the 3rd national treasury workshop organised by office of the accountant general of the federation held on 25thjune 2019 in kano north west nigeria although the accountant general of the federation believed that maintenance servicing of the nation s debt profile which was put at n 24 4 trillion a sharp rise of 12 5 increase from the 2017 status was sustainable the emir maintained that the country s balance sheet was already overstretched he also said that if the president would keep his promise of june 12 2019 to lead millions of nigerians out of poverty all of the common patrimony being appropriated as subsidies on petroleum and electricity should be diverted to education health and other critical infrastructures in his words the nation could soon witness the worst case of insolvency unless the federal government eliminated the huge resources being spent on the subsidy of petroleum and other commodities the very outspoken emir who was the governor of the central bank of nigeria from 2009 2014 vehemently opposed the subsidy regime and opined that subsidies must be totally removed for such monies to be diverted to education health facilities employment and shelter for the masses the emir s stand on boko haram terrorism being an islamic scholar sanusi condemned the boko haram false indoctrinations and urged his followers to resist such the terrorist reacted violently to the new emir s advocacy and bombed the kano mosque the seat of the emirate in which 150 faithfuls lost their lives in november 2014 the terrorist commander abubakar shekau accused sanusi of deviating from islam and threatened the emir s life but he was undaunted and told shekau that he sanusi was safe with allah and likened shekau s statement to those of heretical islamic preacher maitatsine should traditional leaders get involved in partisan politics there is a general consensus that traditional institutions headed by monarchs should be completely insulated from partisan politics in view of the highly revered and influential positions over their subjects to whom they owed absolute neutrality in the dispensation of social administration justice and equity consistently although there are no hard and fast rules nor specific constitutional clauses to check traditional rulers disposition to politics state governments in nigeria have established ministries for local government and chieftaincy affairs to properly administer processes of choosing traditional heads from among the people according to their customs through orderly procedures that would ultimately enjoy the blessings of state governors who hands over staffs of office to successful candidates during official coronations state governments play pivotal roles in chieftaincy affairs through payment of regular salaries allowances provision of vehicles for smooth administration through the traditional rulers at the grassroots more and in view of this intervention most traditional rulers have been nothing else other than partisan to the one who pays the piper kano state as a case study of the piper who dictates the tune it is not in contention that the kano emirate is funded through taxes and subventions by the kano state government who pays salaries allowances and other emoluments that were legitimate monthly annual expenses of the monarch and his retinue of palace workers during his first tenure apc governor umar ganduje tried unsuccessfully to dethrone emir sanusi through some trumped up accusations that he wasted public funds through extravagant opulence lifestyle and through federal government s diplomatic interventions all charges and inquisitions were dropped but back in the saddle for a second tenure as governor ganduje took up the gauntlet again and on wednesday 8th may 2019 he decided to whittle down the emir s powers when he signed into law the creation of four new emirates gaya bichi karaye and rano the new bill stated that the emir of kano would henceforth preside over ten local government areas instead of the former 44 lgas but the kano state kingmakers who were aggrieved by ganduje s high handedness had filed a suit against the governor kano state house of assembly the attorney general and four others over the creation of new emirates in kano state they claimed that action was aimed at decentralizing the main kano emirate led by sanusi and condemned his decision to sign the kano state emirs appointment and deposition amendment 2019 bill into law there had been public outrage against the action which the kano state high court ordered ganduje to suspend the case was adjourned till 16th july 2019 sanusi s role in governance and as a traditional leader his royal highness muhammadu sanusi ii con the highly revered 14th emir of kano north west nigeria born sanusi lamido sanusi is blue blood a noble aristocrat a man of sterling impeccable and untainted character an outstanding personality with exemplary charisma and laudable traits that are traceable to his antecedent and pedigree the 57 year old was crowned on 8th june 2014 following the death of his granduncle ado bayero a very intelligent banker and brilliant economist who attended the prestigious kings college lagos where he graduated in 1977 proceeded to ahmadu bello university zaria 1978 1983 and obtained both bachelors and masters degrees taught for two years in the school and later studied islamic law at the international university of africa in khartoum sanusi did not allow the silver spoon to becloud his ambition for relevance among the highly educated and in the course of time distinguished him as a worthy ambassador in his chosen discipline sanusi lamido sanusi even as a prince did not count himself better than his peers but worked assiduously to reach the pinnacle of his profession in the banking industry as he was first crowned governor of the central bank before he received the kano royal crown as birth right as governor of central bank of nigeria cbn between 3rd june 2009 and 20th february2014 he was not just the chancellor of the exchequer but also doubled as the official watchman whistle blower over the enormous funds that were dispensed on daily basis for smooth execution of the nation s foreign and local policies of the economy like none before him had ever done he had a blue print predicated on enhancement of quality of banks establishment of healthy financial stability and the imperative contribution of the financial sector to the real sector sanusi has to his credit several local and international awards of distinction which singled him out not only as a very outstanding scholar but also as a banking guru he did not waste time to sanitize the banking industry through radical anti corruption strategy following mrs cecilia ibru s mismanagement of the oceanic bank in which billions of naira of public funds were fraudulently looted and could not be accounted for during his tenure several bank managers including ceo mrs ibru were convicted by the law courts and sent to prison terms sanusi accused jonathan s government of 20 billion us dollar fraud for the very first time in the history of nigeria s financial transactions at the apex level of the executive arm in 2014 sanusi lamido sanusi moved against the norm and the protocol to blow the whistle over unremitted missing funds from the vaults of the apex bank under his watch and that audacity caused him his plum job because ex president ebele jonathan did not waste time in relieving him of the exalted post without completing his five year tenure his offence he accused jonathan s government of a 20 billion us dollar fraud in the oil sector of the economy under the watch of the nigerian national petroleum corporation nnpc in 2014 sanusi had earlier disclosed in 2013 that nigeria lost one billion dollars on monthly basis due to diversion of funds under the ex president s watch while american and british stakeholders in the oil industry were quoted to have disclosed that former petroleum minister diezani allison madueke might have organized a diversion of 6 billion us dollars an equivalent of n 1 2 trillion from the nigerian treasury allison madueke was arrested in london on 2nd october and still facing interrogation and prosecutions for sundry financial offences at the british courts though the present change apc administration has put up pressure for her extradition to nigeria to face several financial crime charges as an economist sanusi had always favoured removal of subsidies citing the high level of corruption engendered by the practices the inefficiency of subsidizing consumption instead of consumption leading to slower economic growth and the fact that government borrows money to finance the subsidy thereby taxing future generations so that present nigerians can consume more fuel like other economists and development practitioners sanusi believes that subsidy was biased in favour of the middle upper classes who consume most of the fuel to personal advantages including illicit commercialisation of the product in neighbouring west african states quote from sanusi if you will not allow me to speak my mind don t invite me again ripple effects of total removal of petroleum subsidy without creating palliatives poverty ratio would increase the products will become out of reach too exorbitant for the masses to access unemployment percentage will rise as employers lay off workers labour sector would demand for more salaries and allowances for government employees and resist of any form of down sizing or right sizing by the administration governments would come and go but the royal traditional thrones remain permanent because the traditional stools must not be polluted with any form of political partisanship military governments used to curry favours from traditional rulers for the purpose of reaching out to citizens at the grassroot to deepen socio economic development but politicians must not convert the sacred custodians of culture tradition to politicians for any reasons traditional stools must be insulated from politics for them to earn the honour and respect due to them at all times but being critical of government would not amount to political partisanship especially by monarchs who love their subjects and are determined to keep them abreast with the social amenities of the civilized world we encourage more professional to mount the royal stools to make the difference by me kings reign and princes decree justice prov 8 15 i am yours sincerely dr david b a olufon 08130669886 08098194390

july 13 2019 07 22 pm updated july 14 2019 03 36 pm ist the story so far the government finance minister nirmala sitharaman announced in the budget speech plans to raise a portion of its gross borrowing from overseas markets the government and the reserve bank of india rbi will reportedly finalise the plans for the overseas issue of sovereign bonds by september while several commentators have argued that this is a risky move the government itself is convinced that it will help boost private investment in the country what is an overseas bond issue a government bond or sovereign bond is a form of debt that the government undertakes wherein it issues bonds with the promise to pay periodic interest payments and also repay the entire face value of the bond on the maturity date so far the government has only issued bonds in the domestic market according to ms sitharaman india s sovereign external debt to gdp ratio is among the lowest around the world at less than 5 against this background the government will start raising a part of its gross borrowing programme in external markets in external currencies this she said would also have a beneficial impact on the demand for government securities in the india the market estimates that the government will only test the waters and borrow about 10 billion which works out to about 10 of its gross market borrowing what are the benefits of an overseas bond issue the government has been arguing that the quantum of its borrowing within india is crowding out the private sector in other words it is saying that government borrowing is at such a level that there are not enough funds available for the private sector to adequately meet its credit and investment needs if the private sector cannot borrow adequately then it cannot invest as it wants to and that cripples one major engine of economic growth according to finance secretary subhash chandra garg government borrowing accounts for about 80 85 of domestic savings he also said that the overseas borrowing programme allows the government to maintain its gradual reduction of the fiscal deficit had the government listened to some commentators and relaxed its fiscal deficit to say 4 4 then this would have allowed it to borrow an additional 2 lakh crore from the domestic market however this would have been 2 lakh crore that would not be available now to the private sector for borrowing purposes therefore borrowing overseas allows the government to raise funds in such a way that there is enough domestic credit available for the private sector the appetite of the international market for indian bonds and their price will also say a lot about how india is viewed globally on the risk factor for example if the rate at which india can borrow overseas is low then this would mean the global market assigns a low risk to india defaulting this would undoubtedly be something the narendra modi government would take pride in what are the risks several economists have expressed their concerns over the fact that india might follow the path of some central and south american countries such as mexico and brazil in the 1970s several of these countries borrowed heavily overseas when the global market was flush with liquidity but then when their currencies depreciated sharply a decade later these countries were in big trouble as they could not repay their debt india is not likely to be viewed as a risky proposition by the international market and so is likely to fetch an attractive rate for the bonds cheap and plentiful funds however should not encourage the government to borrow too heavily from abroad another risk to india from overseas borrowings is that this would lead to a quicker increase to its foreign exchange reserves which would lead to a stronger rupee at a time when it is already appreciating against the dollar this many experts say would be an adverse outcome a stronger rupee would encourage imports at a time when the government is trying to curb them and discourage exports at a time when they are being encouraged on the other hand a rupee depreciation for whatever external reason would prove even more disastrous as it would make it far more expensive for india to repay its external debt the third problem with an overseas bond issue is that the government would not be able to inflate itself out of trouble that is in the domestic market if the government does ever reach the stage where it is finding it difficult to repay its debt it can simply print more money let inflation rise quickly and repay its debt this is not an option in an overseas bond issue the indian government cannot print foreign currency to repay its debt what does it mean for the domestic market according to the government s own reasoning there are not enough funds in the domestic market to cater to its needs as well as those of the private sector this shallowness of the bond market is not a good thing especially at a time when the government needs the bond market to finance several of its commitments the ujwal discom assurance yojana uday scheme for example involves state governments taking over the debt of state power distribution companies and issuing bonds to repay that debt or take the government s budget announcement of a further 70 000 crore capital infusion in public sector banks a shallow bond market would make it difficult for the government to expand any of these schemes ideally the government should have enough revenue that it does not need to borrow as much however at a time when both direct and indirect tax collections have disappointed the government is forced to borrow to finance its expenditure in such a scenario it is a welcome move for the private sector that the government is leaving it room to borrow in the domestic market
the african star an african on online news organ reported that on july 9 2019 in the wake of liberia s crippling economic situation where the country s finance minister samuel tweah is apparently hoping that remittances from diasporas will salvage the country s failing economy minister tweah said recently that all remittances to individuals in liberia through western union moneygram and other foreign transfer agencies be paid to the recipients in the liberian dollars in my previous articles i pointed out that there exists a prevailing perception among liberians that when a liberian becomes a naturalized us citizen the individual loses his liberian citizenship this point of view is indeed incorrect according to bella consultants naturalized us citizens are not legally obligated to give up their citizenship of their country the united states has never ordered newly naturalized citizens to formally renounce their original citizenship legally there is nothing in the constitution and none from the u s supreme court preventing the united states via the state department from requiring all naturalized citizens to officially renounce their citizenship to their native country as a condition for naturalization and now the money gifted from the diaspora to their families the government wants to convert their us dollars to the local liberian dollars the best action is the immediate passage of the liberia dual citizenship bill the heading of this article is an idiom which means that you cannot escape the consequences and repercussions of evil deeds that you have done to other people the bill for the passage of dual citizenship has been around for some time now and the members of the liberian legislature continue to undermine its passage as liberians we need each other the importance of the diaspora in today s global economy developing countries like liberia and others in africa must endeavor to engage their nationals in the diaspora to help with economic developments other countries like israel nigeria sierra leone etc have realized the importance of the diaspora s economic role in fostering national development through its annual remittances and project oriented initiatives individuals in the diaspora who enjoyed dual nationality have become a blessing to their respective countries of origin the diaspora has become gold mines for most developing countries most countries are encouraging their nationals residing in developed countries to obtain naturalized status of their host countries the economist in its november 2011 issue published an article the magic of diasporas outlined how migrant business networks are changing the world especially in developing countries according to usaid report many of liberia s educated elites either fled or were killed during the civil war the educational system was demolished and the country lost a generation in which to educate and train its citizens to make productive contributions to development progress government the private sector civil society and international partners still are desperately short of qualified local talent the existing small cadre of highly qualified and motivated leaders struggles to have policies and decisions carried out by a low paid workforce that often lacks basic literacy numeracy and other critical work skills to be frank liberians with dual nationalities are seemingly liberia s best hope when it comes to economic development the world bank s report of 2012 relevant to global remittances pointed out that liberians in the diaspora out beat per gdp other africans living abroad by remitting 378 million in 2012 an increase of 18 million from 2011 remittance of 360 million a more than 31 of global remittances and third of liberia s gdp in 2012 the new dispensation 6 february 2013 the usd explorer also provided its statistical information relevant to the remittances received by liberia during the period of 2011 through 2015 liberia accordingly received 360 million in 2011 516 million in 2012 383 million in 2013 us 495 million in 2014 and us 693 million in 2015 as remittances from other countries here these statistics demonstrate and show that liberia as a nation has benefited economically from its nationals in the diaspora and this includes liberians with dual nationality status let me reflect the following attributes relevant to china and india as they relate to their engagements with their nationals residing in the diaspora economist devesh kapur outlined each of the following first the indian diaspora was largely professional while the chinese diaspora was more entrepreneurial hence although the former was well off in the aggregate for instance it is one of the wealthiest ethnic groups in the u s it did not have substantial numbers of high net worth individuals who would serve as potential investors second india was hostile to foreign investment until the early 1990s while china opened up a decade earlier third china unlike india did not have a strong capitalist class when it opened up and hence faced little domestic opposition to incentives granted to diaspora sic investors finally local governments have played a much more proactive role in china relative to india although this is changing in the latter the involvement of diaspora indians in the software boom of the late 1990s has altered this equation to some extent at least in this sector indian born and indian origin entrepreneurs in the united states particularly acquired the capital and business connections to play an important role in foreign direct investment and technology transfer liberian diaspora forming partnerships perhaps liberians in the diaspora need to join partnership with the initiatives of afford the african foundation for development accordingly this organization started by african expats short for expatriate in the uk to broaden the diaspora s contribution to african development liberians in the diaspora could also explore the activities of an organization called international entrepreneurship intent this is a dutch nongovernmental organization which for over twelve years has assisted expatiates in holland to start business in their respective countries of origin the ngo is continually expanding its activities which began in countries from which sizable populations in the netherlands that emigrated from countries such as ghana ethiopia morocco cape verde sierra leone and others international entrepreneurship intent conclusion liberians on the ground need to perceive the diaspora liberians as a national asset not as an adversary the engagement of citizens in the diaspora is certainly not a new phenomenon countries such as israel india ireland and china are constructively engaged and have led the field of reaching out to their nationals in the diaspora what is new however is the number of countries who are now realizing they have exciting possibilities if they can engage their overseas populations in innovative and creative ways few years ago countries like uganda indonesia and vietnam have taken initiatives in this field liberians in the diaspora need to also shy away from job seeking initiatives in the liberian government and form business partnerships while the liberian government needs to harness the entrepreneurial drive of diaspora communities especially those in the united states and the uk on the other hand those in the diaspora must realize that criticizing the actions of government all the time is wrong and it is not in the best interest of the nation the diaspora should always endeavor to conduct a constructive engagement with government and get involved with the affairs not just politics of national development it is disturbing when some liberians on the ground in liberia perceived their fellow brothers and sisters residing in the diaspora as foreigners ignoring the fact that these so called foreigners continue to send thousands upon thousands of us dollars to their relatives through remittances annually it should not and it is not a burden to accept or encourage the participation of people that left their homeland for whatever reasons liberia belongs to all liberians both those on the ground in liberia and those residing in the diaspora as i reflected in one of my articles in the daily observer liberians in the diaspora have the necessary academic and professional preparations to help liberia solve her problem of brain drain the liberian government needs to encourage all its nationals to return home closing the doors on others due to their dual citizenship status is not in the best interest of the socio economic development of the nation other countries in africa ghana for example are increasingly engaged in strategies and programs to reverse the brain drain to retain skilled professionals at home perhaps liberia s lawmakers need to understand and emulate the wisdom of ghana nigeria and other countries within the sub region and encourage dual citizenship participations at all levels of the liberian government indeed finance minister samuel tweah and others in government have realized that liberians in the diaspora continue to make contributions relevant to liberia s economic recovery and development leopold senghor of senegal was correct when he said to build a nation to create a new civilization which can lay claim to existence because its humane we shall try to employ not only enlightened reason but also dynamic imagination
by independenttrader europe is rebelling against the united states more than a year ago we reported that the united states had unilaterally withdrawn from a nuclear agreement with iran shortly after this decision americans began to impose sanctions on iran as a consequence trade with this country has been prohibited more important countries of the european union quickly began to indicate that u s sanctions are considerable obstacle the problem was due to the swift system used for international settlements which is controlled by the united states thus europe could not announce overnight that it would not comply with u s demands why because of lack of alternatives to the swift in january however information appeared suggesting that some western europe countries germany france united kingdom are preparing to create a platform that will enable european companies to trade with iran now these announcements are coming into effect the eu countries launched the instex system which is enabling european companies to further trade with iran instex however does not work in the same way as swift under the new platform transfers between european and iranian banks will not be carried out the exchange will rather resemble barter in this way instex is mainly to enable iran to purchase key goods such as medicines food and medical equipment as you can see instex is far from replacing swift we also do not know how many european companies will reject the instex platform due to fears of u s sanctions either way we observe a significant hit on dollar s dominance and the american swift and this does not come from the enemies of the u s but from the ally i e the european union shares in the u s on symbolic tops during this week the u s s p 500 index has reached an all time high this type of information slowly ceases to arouse greater emotions among investors mainly because since january 2018 index has reached new highs three times each time market correction followed in effect despite the new high the index has gained only 7 since the end of january 2018 it seems that the new record of the s p 500 index will not be reflected in the company s results let s start with the analysts expectations over the last months of a given quarter march june september december analysts make last forecasts revisions for individual companies before publication of official results usually there are more companies for which forecasts are reduced rather than improved all not to make investors disappointed during the results publication for example let us assume that among the s p 500 companies 200 forecasts have been improved 250 have been deteriorated and 50 remained unchanged in this case the net change is 50 in june it amounted to 116 it was the second worst june since such measurements were carried out over the last 3 years such negative changes just before the results publication has been recorded only once in september 2017 furthermore 113 of the largest u s companies announced their own profit expectations 77 of enterprises reported that their results would be even worse than analysts expectations for comparison the average level for the last 5 years is 70 the recently reported result 77 is the second weakest since factset started to collect this type of data we dealt with the worse situation only in the first quarter of 2016 at that time it was 80 prospects for the stock market would obviously be better if the next months were to bring improvement in the companies results will this happen global economic data described below suggests that this is unlikely on the other hand shares will probably be supported by more buybacks companies purchases of their own shares and growing hopes for re introduction of asset purchases by central banks dramatic economic data around the world in january economic data from germany china and japan have been giving some alarming signs in the u s we have seen the beginning of slowdown while the global recession was only just looming on the horizon today it is knocking on the door and maybe even standing at the doorstep to start with let us refer to the pmi which to some extent reflects the economic situation of individual countries if its value exceeds 50 then we can assume in a large generalization that the economy is growing however if it falls below 50 then the economy is shrinking below the pmi indices for the industry are divided into two charts on the left we can see pmi for key regions usa eu china japan and on the right for the largest eu economies germany france italy spain in the best case pmi is 50 which indicates stagnation at the same time services pmis are still slightly better anyway the direction in which we are heading is quite clear you can see this in the table below where manufacturing pmi of many different countries is included please note that the following data should be read from right to left from july 2018 to june 2019 source daniel lacalle as you can see a year ago the green color dominated the table that meant a good situation in the industry today we have dominance of the red color only greece and vietnam recorded result more than 52 in the first case we are talking about a country which has lost the last 10 years and its significance is negligible in turn vietnam is gaining due to a trade war between the u s and china it is also worthwhile to look at the united states where many different indicators are published that work on a similar basis like pmi below you can see them gathered on one chart the trend is quite clear and the scale of declines over recent months gigantic deteriorating economic situation is reflected for example in growing inventories of enterprises demand is decreasing which will have to translate into lower production and layoffs so far we hear mainly about the mass job reductions in the automotive sector it is no coincidence that despite the u s stock market has set a new high everyone expects interest rate cuts support for the economy a well oriented part of the market already knows that macroeconomic data for the united states will look poor in the coming months in other regions of the world it will not be better natural consequence of the current situation is the escape of investors capital to safe assets which we wrote about last month we mentioned then that the u s dollar and u s bonds are expensive but after a small correction they can grow further why because for most investors they are a safe haven our predictions have been confirmed after the fed s release dollar index fell slightly and bonds barely moved recently however they started to grow again what we ve written right now does not mean that we encourage investors to invest in u s bonds as of today the optimism around them is too high at the end a small curiosity at the beginning of 2019 u s 10 year bond yields was around 2 7 albert edwards decided to check how many economists asked by the wall street journal in january predicted that the yields would fall to around 2 no one not only that nobody even suspected that the yields would fall below 2 5 source wall street journal we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us remember that these experts were questioned in january and like everyone else they had macroeconomic data at their disposal and yet not one of them came up with the idea that a worse economic situation could bring capital fly to u s bonds which pay higher interest than for example italian bonds the un sends spoiled food to starving yemeni people there is the ongoing war in yemen and a humanitarian crisis with it tens of thousands of people have died of hunger death of many more people in the following years is possible country is regularly bombed by saudi arabia and its allies media are not willing to inform about the situation because the saudis have good relations with the united states thanks to this they do not have to deal with attacks of journalists few exceptions confirm the rule recently the information has been released about the help that the united nations provides to yemeni citizens as it turns out over the last 4 years the consumer protection office in yemen has returned a total of 24 thousand tons of aid which consisted of spoiled food and supplements for pregnant women as well as expired medicines if the un wanted to effectively help yemeni citizens there would probably be a fuss around the blockade imposed on that country currently all parcels have to go to neighboring countries e g djibouti where they are checked by the authorities most often related with saudi arabia the united nations however does not see a problem in the blockade un officials believe that the huti movement yemeni rebels is guilty of wasted food this way in the era of globalization where media allegedly reaches everywhere the humanitarian crisis is maintained in turn people in the world know at most the concept of its scale but they completely do not know the details trump s defensive stance at the g20 summit the last g20 summit in japan was another meeting where the world awaited a breakthrough in the us china relations nothing extraordinary has happened although president donald trump s defensive attitude is worth noting one of its symptoms was the change of decision regarding the cooperation of american companies with the asian company huawei few weeks ago trump announced a ban on the sale of products to huawei while during the g20 summit the u s president withdrew from that declaration he also admitted that the ban caused considerable dissatisfaction among u s companies it is difficult to say whether the withdrawal from the trade ban with huawei was more to improve the atmosphere around us china talks or rather to build support before next year s presidential election during the g20 trump was also kind to turkey recall that the turks are a member of nato and yet they are about to buy russian s 400 missiles trump said that he puts america first in all matters but the unjustified treatment of turkey by the previous administration can not be ignored in other words the u s president decided that the purchase of russian missiles by the turks is the result of mistakes made by barack obama it is worth noting that tensions between the u s and iran somewhat subsided at this moment what we wrote earlier has been confirmed both the u s military industrial complex and the largest banks would be happy to see a new armed conflict and an opportunity to expand their influence in turn the current u s president is balancing in such a way to avoid initiating wars while not losing credibility its priority is to properly play rivalry with china perhaps this is also the reason why trump decided not to make an argument about the purchase of russian missiles by turkey this would worsen u s russia relations gold is holding tight after gold broke through key area of 1360 1380 usd we published an article when will the gold raise beyond 1500 usd we pointed out that banks are betting very hard on metal price decreases and may try to take advantage of the holiday period in the u s between july 1 and 5 gold price drops often occur on holidays and fridays we also wrote that in our opinion the most likely scenario is that gold is going down to 1380 usd and then start to rise again we dealt with the first declines on monday 1 july when the price fell around 1385 usd in the following days gold regained strength and again found itself above 1 400 usd a big influence on the bounce of the metal prices was the information that christine lagarde the current head of the international monetary fund will become a new head of european central bank lagarde announced several years ago that the introduction of negative interest rates is positive for the economy there is no doubt that the new ecb president will continue mario draghi s policy lowering rates and currency printing or will apply even more radical monetary policy both the lower interest rates especially negative ones as well as the ecb printing in the past translated into increases in gold prices the former issue was recently explained by mark faber who wrote one of the functions of money is to store value currencies are also treated by most people as money however if the cost of this value storage is too high due to negative interest rates people will start abandoning currencies in favor of alternatives gold and cryptocurrencies recent central banks announcements introduce us to the process explained by faber the same is the case with lagarde nomination as the head of the ecb it s not the fact that under her rule the ecb will cut rates significantly below zero if this happens it will be used by the federal reserve as an argument for loosening monetary policy in the u s market is already discounting these changes through gold strengthening returning to the general market situation we will be curious to watch what will happen by the end of this week if there will be no sudden drops the gold may start marching towards 1 500 usd in the following days google interferes in american elections recently google director statements appeared in the network who directly admitted that her company is trying to influence the outcome of the next year s elections in the u s we wrote a short text on this subject which has been published on facebook we completely understand that some people avoid facebook so we also put the text here a few days ago in the network we have spotted a movie called edward bernays and the art of public manipulation edward bernays was one of the pioneers of public relations and propaganda as one of the first he not only knew but also used on a large scale the fact that in order to convince the crowd one should appeal to human emotions instead of using facts one of the most characteristic quotes of bernays are we are governed our minds are molded our tastes formed our ideas suggested largely by men we have never heard of if it were to put the aforementioned video on facebook probably some people would write about conspiracy theories or paste photos of plastic caps this is how the displacement mechanism works which means that people do not want to accept the truth they prefer to be cheated these people need much more to be convinced perhaps the something more is a recent publication of conversation with jen gennai the director of google material was prepared by the project veritas website recall that google controls 92 of the search engine market and is also the owner of youtube we do not therefore need to explain how great impact this corporation has in the conversation google director explicitly admitted that one of the important elements of her work is to ensure that situation from 2016 will not repeat next year of course this is about donald trump s electoral victory according to gennai any antitrust proceedings against google would be a tragedy as smaller companies in the market do not have enough power to prevent trump reelection in other words google director claims that the corporation she represents knows best who should become the next president of the united states now think about how many times you have heard about russia s influence in the u s elections no evidence has been provided in this case meanwhile when google admits to manipulate election results it is difficult to find any material on the web at all e g youtube removes relevant videos separately the material also revealed how google manipulates algorithms so that the content and hints displayed to users are in line with the company s ideology clear example is on the picture below as you can see after entering a men can you get a hint of get pregnant in summary brainwashing is happening on a gigantic scale google is trying to shape the society youtube removes valuable channels may this be met with a specific response from users independent trader team
yet even after a full decade of uninterrupted economic growth the richest americans now hold a greater share of the nation s wealth than they did before the great recession began in 2007 and income growth has been sluggish by historical standards leaving many americans feeling stuck in place those trends help explain something unique about this expansion it s easily the least celebrated economic recovery in decades as public discontent has grown the issue has become one for political candidates to harness beginning with donald trump in 2016 now some of the democrats running to challenge trump for the presidency have built their campaigns around proposals to tax wealth raise minimum wages or ease the financial strain of medical care and higher education america s financial disparities have widened in large part because the means by which people build wealth have become more exclusive since the great recession fewer middle class americans own homes fewer are invested in the stock market and home prices have risen far more in wealthier metro areas on the coasts than in more modestly priced cities and rural areas the result is that affluent homeowners now sit on vast sums of home equity and capital gains while tens of millions of ordinary households have been left mainly on the sidelines
happy friday traders and welcome to our recap of the week in gold markets as we anticipated the action on gold charts was pretty heavily condensed to the middle of the week and we ve seen a wide 30 trading range over the last five sessions at the time of writing gold prices are holding steadily just below 1410 oz in the sport markets prices are largely unchanged from thursday morning and represent a fall from the weekly highs but a somewhat bullish net gain for the week so what kind of week has it been gold prices had a calm start to the week monday and tuesday played out quietly as expected in the metals markets following the selling in gold priced that began the week as we moved into the second half of 2019 aside from a brief dip below 1390 oz in the early hours of tuesday morning in new york trading was choppy by mostly sideways spot prices per ounce mostly clung to 1395 as the value of the yellow metal competed against a resurgent us dollar which by tuesday has reached a 3 week high there was some light gold adjacent news flow with reports that many central banks most importantly china have continued increasing their gold holdings while fearful headlines out of the persian gulf have dramatically tailed off over the last week gold probably found some support from safe haven buyers on an announcement from iran that it will continue pushing it s uranium enrichment beyond the bounds of the now practically defunct nuclear agreement gold s 5 week uptrend was still holding but its bulls were in search of another push from fundamentals to restart momentum they got it on wednesday morning fed chair jerome powell nailed a july cut to the table wednesday as predicted is where we found most of our action this week ahead of his semi annual testimony to congress the federal reserve published the text of his prepared opening remarks later that afternoon markets also got their first look at the discussion minutes from the fomc s june meeting but surprisingly it would be this first publishing of powell s statement that dominated market movement gold in particular on the release of chairman powell s remarks at 8 30am edt gold spot priced surged from heavy support at 1392 to once again surpass 1400 oz the move was entirely driven by the re trenching of market certainty that the fed will implement an interest rate cut at their july meeting in june s statement the committee made it clear that there was an amassing uncertainty around global and domestic economic factors effect of the us china trade war slowing growth globally and the fomc s would be tracking whether these pressures would have enough of an effect to call for additional monetary policy easing it was language like that which solidified market anticipation for at minimum a 25 basis point insurance cut that confidence was wobbled a bit last friday as a banger jobs report raised the issue that maybe the economy had already righted itself before any policy easing was necessary jay powell s remarks on wednesday reaffirmed the market s interpretation of the june meeting and underlined it first chairman powell specifically touched on the language of the june statement in his prepared language saying it appears that uncertainties continue to weigh on the us economic outlook later in his testimony before the house powell was asked if the outstanding non farm payrolls data from june improved the fed s assessment at all powell s response was as clear as can be the straight answer to your questions is no to fully drive the point home the chairman reiterated the bottom line for me is that the uncertainties around global growth and trade continue to weigh on the outlook in addition inflation continues to be muted and those things are still in place most major assets would continue to move throughout the latter half of the us trading session as equities surged and the us dollar s recent strength waned gold priced would make their way back to 1420 oz that level would find support throughout the asian and european trading sessions as those markets digested the central bank headlines in much the same way jerome powell suggested that the fed has room to cut interest rates as the tie between the inflation and jobless rates has broken down bloomberg economics economics july 12 2019 us inflation data surprised as the market shifts its valuation of gold prices gold spot prices would breakdown from that re elevated level on thursday morning as updated us inflation data beat expectations with the core number coming in just above the all important 2 target as sellers stepped in at least some of them likely to be short term profit takers prices for the yellow metal dropped through 1410 and settled a few dollars below for the most part through mid day on friday the price has remained in a sideways chop around the same levels it s obvious that if a blowout jobs report wasn t enough to shake powell and co s seemingly inexorable drive towards a rate cut then a 0 1 annualized surprise in core inflation not even the fed preferred assessment of inflation that s pce isn t going to change things either so we can assume that gold s drop on thursday morning was not a result of the bond markets cutting their odds of a rate cut what then what i think is that we re seeing the markets move on from pricing handicapping the odds of some kind of rate cut on july 31 now the question is no longer will powell cut in july but rather how much will the cut be the usual 0 25 a one timer worth 0 5 and how many cuts is the fed considering how i think this is reflected in the gold market specifically is as follows the near certainty of an interest rate cut in july clearly justifies for the market gold spot prices above 1400 oz but the yellow metal s reaction to thursday s improved inflation data suggests that for prices to trade consistently north of 1420 would require confidence that a the fed s july cut will be larger than 25 basis points and or b there will be at least one more cut before the end of 2019 until either of those additional moves are more priced into markets i think gold will have a hard time maintaining the uptrend on monetary policy alone of course other factors like further trade war escalation could prove other drivers for higher gold prices for the time being gold price movement seems to largely be a reaction function of us and global central bank policy next up next week s macroeconomic calendar is a pretty vanilla edition with a few scheduled fomc appearances including more words from chairman powell and a few new looks at the manufacturing survey data that took such a beating in june enjoy your weekend traders i ll see you back here on monday for a look at the new week ahead
here are the answers with discussion for this weekend s quiz the information provided should help you work out why you missed a question or three if you haven t already done the quiz from yesterday then have a go at it before you read the answers i hope this helps you develop an understanding of modern monetary theory mmt and its application to macroeconomic thinking comments as usual welcome especially if i have made an error question 1 if the household saving ratio rises and there is an external deficit then modern monetary theory tells us that the government must increase net spending to fill the private spending gap or else national output and income will fall the answer is false this question tests one s basic understanding of the sectoral balances that can be derived from the national accounts the secret to getting the correct answer is to realise that the household saving ratio is not the overall sectoral balance for the private domestic sector in other words if you just compared the household saving ratio with the external deficit and the fiscal balance you would be leaving an essential component of the private domestic balance out private capital formation investment to understand that in macroeconomics we have a way of looking at the national accounts the expenditure and income data which allows us to highlight the various sectors the government sector and the non government sector and the important sub sectors within the non government sector to refresh your memory the balances are derived as follows the basic income expenditure model in macroeconomics can be viewed in at least two ways a from the perspective of the sources of spending and b from the perspective of the uses of the income produced bringing these two perspectives of the same thing together generates the sectoral balances from the sources perspective we write 1 gdp c i g x m which says that total national income gdp is the sum of total final consumption spending c total private investment i total government spending g and net exports x m expression 1 tells us that total income in the economy per period will be exactly equal to total spending from all sources of expenditure we also have to acknowledge that financial balances of the sectors are impacted by net government taxes t which includes all tax revenue minus total transfer and interest payments the latter are not counted independently in the expenditure expression 1 further as noted above the trade account is only one aspect of the financial flows between the domestic economy and the external sector we have to include net external income flows fni adding in the net external income flows fni to expression 2 for gdp we get the familiar gross national product or gross national income measure gnp 2 gnp c i g x m fni to render this approach into the sectoral balances form we subtract total net taxes t from both sides of expression 3 to get 3 gnp t c i g x m fni t now we can collect the terms by arranging them according to the three sectoral balances 4 gnp c t i g t x m fni the the terms in expression 4 are relatively easy to understand now the term gnp c t represents total income less the amount consumed less the amount paid to government in taxes taking into account transfers coming the other way in other words it represents private domestic saving the left hand side of equation 4 gnp c t i thus is the overall saving of the private domestic sector which is distinct from total household saving denoted by the term gnp c t in other words the left hand side of equation 4 is the private domestic financial balance and if it is positive then the sector is spending less than its total income and if it is negative the sector is spending more than it total income the term g t is the government financial balance and is in deficit if government spending g is greater than government tax revenue minus transfers t and in surplus if the balance is negative finally the other right hand side term x m fni is the external financial balance commonly known as the current account balance cad it is in surplus if positive and deficit if negative in english we could say that the private financial balance equals the sum of the government financial balance plus the current account balance we can re write expression 6 in this way to get the sectoral balances equation 5 s i g t cab which is interpreted as meaning that government sector deficits g t 0 and current account surpluses cab 0 generate national income and net financial assets for the private domestic sector conversely government surpluses g t s by 20 whatever currency units we like so the fiscal drag from the public sector is coinciding with an influx of net savings from the external sector while private domestic spending can persist for a time under these conditions using the net savings of the external sector the private domestic sector becomes increasingly indebted in the process it is an unsustainable growth path so if a nation usually has a current account deficit x m 0 then the fiscal deficit has to be large enough to offset the current account deficit say x m 20 as above then a balanced fiscal position g t 0 will force the private domestic sector to spend more than they are earning s i 20 but a government deficit of 25 for example g 55 and t 30 will give a right hand solution of 55 30 10 20 15 the private domestic sector can net save note households can still have positive savings with the private domestic sector net dissaving overall if i s so by only focusing on the household saving ratio in the question i was only referring to one component of the private domestic balance clearly in the case of the question if private investment is strong enough to offset the household desire to increase saving and withdraw from consumption then no spending gap arises typicall though when households reduce the growth in consumption spending private investment growth also tapers off as a consequence a major spending gap emerge that can only be filled in the short to medium term by government deficits if output growth is to remain intact the following blog posts may be of further interest to you question 2 even though the money multiplier found in macroeconomics textbooks is a flawed description of the way the monetary system operates having some positive minimum reserve requirements does constrain credit creation activities of the private banks more than if you have no requirements other than the rule that balances have to be non zero the answer is false while many nations do not have minimum reserve requirements other than reserve account balances at the central bank have to remain non zero other nations do persist in these gold standard artefacts the ability of banks to expand credit is unchanged across either type of country these sorts of restrictions were put in place to manage the liabilities side of the bank balance sheet in the belief that this would limit volume of credit issued it became apparent that in a fiat monetary system the central bank cannot directly influence the growth of the money supply with or without positive reserve requirements and still ensure the financial system is stable the reality is that every central bank stands ready to provide reserves on demand to the commercial banking sector accordingly the central bank effectively cannot control the reserves that are demanded but it can set the price however given that monetary policy mostly ignoring the current quantitative easing type initiatives is conducted via the central bank setting a target overnight interest rate the central bank is really required to provide the reserves on demand at that target rate if it doesn t then it loses the ability to ensure that target rate is sustained each day imagine the central bank tried to lend reserves to banks above the target rate immediately banks with surplus reserves could lend above the target rate and below the rate the central bank was trying to lend at this would lead to competitive pressures which would drive the overnight rate upwards and the central bank loses control of its monetary policy stance every central bank conducts its liquidity management activities which allow it to maintain control of the target rate and therefore monetary policy with the knowledge of what the likely reserve demands of the banks will be each day they take these factors into account when they employ repo lending or open market operations on a daily basis to manage the cash system and ensure they reach their desired target rate the details vary across countries given different institutional arrangements relating to timing etc but the operations are universal to central banking while admitting that the central bank will always provide reserves to the banks on demand some will still try argue that by the capacity of the central bank to set the price of the reserves they provide ensures it can stifle bank lending by hiking the price it provides the reserves at the reality of central bank operations around the world is that this doesn t happen central banks always provide the reserves at the target rate so as i have described often commercial banks lend to credit worthy customers and create deposits in the process this is an on going process throughout each day a separate area in the bank manages its reserve position and deals with the central bank the two sections of the bank do not interact in any formal way so the reserve management section never tells the loan department to stop lending because they don t have reserves the banks know they can get the reserves from the central bank in whatever volume they need to satisfy any conditions imposed by the central bank at the overnight rate allowing for small variations from day to day around this if the central bank didn t do this then it would risk failure of the financial system the following blog posts may be of further interest to you question 3 with fiscal and monetary policy tied by the emu arrangements the only adjustment mechanism left for eurozone member states is to reduce wages and prices to restore external competitiveness while harsh eventually the competitive position improves if wages and prices are successfully cut the answer is false the temptation is to accept the rhetoric after understanding the constraints that the emu places on member states and conclude that the only way that competitiveness can be restored is to cut wages and prices that is what the dominant theme in the public debate tells us it is the imf s main selling point for austerity in the eurozone however deflating an economy under these circumstance is only part of the story and does not guarantee that a nation s competitiveness will be increased we have to differentiate several concepts a the nominal exchange rate b domestic price levels c unit labour costs and d the real or effective exchange rate it is the last of these concepts that determines the competitiveness of a nation nominal exchange rate e the nominal exchange rate e is the number of units of one currency that can be purchased with one unit of another currency there are two ways in which we can quote a bi lateral exchange rate consider the relationship between the a and the us option 1 the amount of australian currency that is necessary to purchase one unit of the us currency us1 in this case the us is the one unit reference currency and the other currency is expressed in terms of how much of it is required to buy one unit of the reference currency so a1 60 us1 means that it takes 1 60 australian to buy one us option 2 the amount of us dollars that one unit of australian currency will buy a1 in this case the a is the reference currency so in the example above this is written as us0 625 a1 thus if it takes 1 60 australian to buy one us then 62 5 cents us buys one a i is just the inverse of ii and vice versa so to understand exchange rate quotations you must know which is the reference currency in the remaining i use the first convention so e is the amount of a which is required to buy one unit of the foreign currency international competitiveness are australian goods and services becoming more or less competitive with respect to goods and services produced overseas to answer the question we need to know about movements in the exchange rate ee and relative inflation rates domestic and foreign clearly within the emu the nominal exchange rate is fixed between nations so the changes in competitiveness all come down to the second source and here foreign means other nations within the emu as well as nations beyond the emu there are also non price dimensions to competitiveness including quality and reliability of supply which are assumed to be constant we can define the ratio of domestic prices p to the rest of the world pw as pw p for a nation running a flexible exchange rate and domestic prices of goods say in the usa and australia remaining unchanged a depreciation in australia s exchange means that our goods have become relatively cheaper than us goods so our imports should fall and exports rise an exchange rate appreciation has the opposite effect but this option is not available to an emu nation so the only way goods in say greece can become cheaper relative to goods in say germany is for the relative price ratio pw p to change if pw is rising faster than p then greek goods are becoming relatively cheaper within the emu and if pw is rising slower than p then greek goods are becoming relatively more expensive within the emu the inverse of the relative price ratio namely p pw measures the ratio of export prices to import prices and is known as the terms of trade the real exchange rate movements in the nominal exchange rate and the relative price level pw p need to be combined to tell us about movements in relative competitiveness the real exchange rate captures the overall impact of these variables and is used to measure our competitiveness in international trade the real exchange rate r is defined as r e pw p 2 where p is the domestic price level specified in a and pw is the foreign price level specified in foreign currency units say us the real exchange rate is the ratio of prices of goods abroad measured in a epw to the a prices of goods at home p so the real exchange rate r adjusts the nominal exchange rate e for the relative price levels for example assume p a10 and pw us8 and e 1 60 in this case r 8 1 6 10 1 28 the us8 translates into a12 80 and the us produced goods are more expensive than those in australia by a ratio of 1 28 ie 28 a rise in the real exchange rate can occur if the nominal e depreciates and or pw rises more than p other things equal a rise in the real exchange rate should increase our exports and reduce our imports a fall in the real exchange rate can occur if the nominal e appreciates and or pw rises less than p other things equal a fall in the real exchange rate should reduce our exports and increase our imports in the case of the emu nation we have to consider what factors will drive pw p up and increase the competitive of a particular nation if prices are set on unit labour costs then the way to decrease the price level relative to the rest of the world is to reduce unit labour costs faster than everywhere else unit labour costs are defined as cost per unit of output and are thus ratios of wage and other costs to output if labour costs are dominant we can ignore other costs for the moment so total labour costs are the wage rate times total employment w l real output is y so unit labour costs ulc w l y l y is the inverse of labour productivity lp so ulcs can be expressed as the w y l w lp so if the rate of growth in wages is faster than labour productivity growth then ulcs rise and vice versa so one way of cutting ulcs is to cut wage levels which is what the austerity programs in the emu nations ireland greece portugal etc are attempting to do but lp is not constant if morale falls sabotage rises absenteeism rises and overall investment falls in reaction to the extended period of recession and wage cuts then productivity is likely to fall as well thus there is no guarantee that ulcs will fall by any significant amount that is enough for

u s review fed rate cut approaching in july fed chair powell did nothing during his semiannual monetary policy testimony to congress this week to push back against the market s view that the fed will cut rates at its july 30 31 meeting we expect that ongoing crosscurrents facing the u s economy will compel the fed to cut rates both in july and again later this year likely in october the core cpi rose 0 3 in june the largest monthly increase since january 2018 yet the generalized weakness in inflation this expansion further supports the fed s rate cut case to call something hot you need to see some heat fed chair powell confirmed the market s view that the fed will cut rates at its july 30 31 meeting during his semiannual monetary policy testimony to congress this week some had speculated that powell would push back against market expectations if not regarding the expected timing of cuts then at least the magnitude yet with markets expecting a total of more than 100 bps of cuts powell opted to instead merely reiterate the messaging from the june fomc meeting that the uncertainties surrounding the trade environment and deteriorating global fundamentals are sufficient to compel an insurance cut the minutes from that meeting were also released this week and pointed to the strong consensus behind a rate cut in july as we expected the strong 224k june jobs number did not significantly affect the fed s view powell did not mention it or the latest trade truce we expect that ongoing crosscurrents facing the u s economy will compel the fed to cut rates both in july and again later this year likely in october perhaps more interestingly powell spoke surprisingly candidly about the fed s success meeting the full employment portion of its dual mandate and added to the growing chorus of questions regarding the viability of traditional macroeconomic models of the relationship between unemployment and inflation powell stated that we don t have any evidence for calling this a hot labor market and argued that the economy has further room to run particularly by drawing people back into the labor force and boosting wages for those who were late to join the expansion which is now the longest on record powell reiterated that inflation pressures remain muted and wryly stated that to call something hot you need to see some heat we did in fact get a few blips of heat this week the core cpi rose 0 3 the largest monthly increase since january 2018 yet this follows four consecutive 0 1 readings meanwhile the nfib survey of small businesses reported that the proportion of firms raising prices jumped an eye catching seven points the selling prices measure is often viewed as a leading indicator for broad cpi inflation perhaps suggesting some upside potential in coming months yet this number comes off of a low base as the prior month s reading was the lowest since december 2017 the core producer price index also rose an above consensus 0 3 but the trend is still moderate the inflation story remains the same gradually rising towards the fed s 2 target but unlikely to break meaningfully higher what is more recent is the fed s impatience with this painfully slow convergence to its target worried about the downward drift in inflation expectations policymakers see a cut as the best way to bring inflation decisively up notwithstanding the added justification to ease stemming from trade uncertainty thus while the s p 500 opened at an all time high this morning and the unemployment rate sits at 3 7 the fed has all but locked in a july rate cut while this may contradict conventional wisdom the current fed chair testified to congress this week that the phillips curve or the relationship between unemployment and inflation that has underlain monetary policymaking for decades is now just a faint heartbeat these are unconventional times u s outlook retail sales tuesday on tuesday we receive retail sales estimates for june which will provide us with a complete look at how sales fared over the second quarter we have recently nudged our q2 personal consumption expenditures pce forecast higher to 3 4 from 2 9 previously as spending is already on solid footing for the period indeed following two solid monthly gains retail sales rose 0 5 in may this pushed control group sales which exclude volatile components and are a good proxy for consumer spending up 8 5 on a three month annualized rate this is the fastest pace since 2006 and suggests pce growth is tracking well north of 3 in the second quarter higher frequency data such as the redbook index for same store sales which covers a sample of u s retailers suggest sales remained solid in june but given a more recent wilting of confidence we expect retail sales rose a more modest 0 2 last month previous 0 5 wells fargo 0 2 consensus 0 2 month over month industrial production tuesday later on tuesday we will get a look at the production side of the economy reflecting slower global growth and ongoing trade uncertainty manufacturing production has floundered this year and weighed on total industrial production ip the latest ip print for may however did show a rebound of 0 4 with manufacturing production posting its first monthly increase this year the ism manufacturing index eased slightly in june but suggested a continued expansion in manufacturing activity weakness in the new orders component of the index suggests production growth should remain modest uncertainty about the structure of future trading relations continues to linger even despite presidents trump and xi agreeing to further trade negotiations which also suggests manufacturing will remain under pressure in coming months we forecast that total industrial production rose 0 1 in june as challenges remain for the factory sector previous 0 4 wells fargo 0 1 consensus 0 1 month over month housing starts wednesday on wednesday attention will turn to the housing market new residential construction has struggled to gain momentum despite lower building costs and improved buying conditions on a year todate basis through may housing starts are 5 3 below their prioryear pace that said the 1 269 million unit pace hit in may is slightly above the pace averaged over the past six months the increase in may permits was encouraging single family permits rose 3 7 ending a five month streak of declines the gain in permits alongside more favorable buying conditions point to gradually improving activity over the summer but despite lower mortgage rates a surge in activity remains unlikely the nahb housing market index fell last month after hitting a seven month high in may builders were likely discouraged by the prospects of an escalating trade war we expect starts to notch a 1 246 million unit pace in june previous 1 269k wells fargo 1 246k consensus 1 260k global review temporary reprieve on the global front there were some mildly encouraging elements in this week s international economic figures although we believe this represents a temporary reprieve rather than the start of a sustained improvement u k gdp rose 0 3 month over month in may reversing most of its april decline however the gain was led by the manufacturing sector with activity in the important services sector flat on the month eurozone industrial production rose in may but soft orders data and pmi surveys suggest further declines can be expected european economies still sluggish overall the news this week from some of europe s key economies portrayed a picture of growth that is still sluggish overall across the region may industrial activity data were released across the eurozone and showed a slight improvement from april eurozone may output rose 0 9 month over month while by country german output rose 0 3 french output jumped 2 1 and italian output rose 0 9 that said the may increase does not represent a decisive turnaround for the european industrial sector eurozone industrial output was still down 0 5 year over year and the eurozone manufacturing pmi remains entrenched in contraction territory while germany s factory orders suggest further declines for european manufacturing can still be expected there was a brief reprieve on the u k economic front as gdp rose 0 3 month over month in may although that comes after a large april decline moreover the increase was largely led by a jump in manufacturing output with service sector activity flat on the month with services accounting for the bulk of the economy and growth in that sector subdued the consensus currently forecasts a small 0 1 quarter over quarter fall in q2 latin american central banks looking to ease this week s figures from latin america have arguably moved two of the region s central banks closer to cutting interest rates the case is likely strongest for mexico where the policy interest rate is still high at 8 25 the latest batch of data shows mexico s june cpi slowing to 3 9 year over over while may industrial output declined 2 1 month over month and 3 3 year over over following a more dovish tone at the bank of mexico s late june monetary policy announcement we think there is a decent chance the central bank will lower rates at its next monetary policy meeting in mid august the case for lower interest rates in brazil is not quite as compelling with the central bank s policy rate the selic rate already at a record low of 6 50 that said this past week saw june cpi inflation slow noticeably to 3 4 year over year while activity growth remains relatively subdued as evidenced by a slowing in may retail sales to 1 year over year while brazilian central bank easing is not part of our base case forecast we think a rate cut cannot be ruled out news from the trade war frontlines china s june trade balance improved to a surplus of us 50 98b although the underlying details were less encouraging exports fell 1 3 year over year compared to the small gain seen in may while imports fell a larger 7 3 the external sector has of course been a key area of concern for china given its trade dispute with the united states although the truce achieved on the sidelines of the june g20 meeting may help improve sentiment in the months ahead singapore s economy has arguably been a casualty of the trade war with q2 gdp unexpectedly slumping 3 5 quarter on quarter annualized and slowing to 0 1 year over year with most of the softness concentrated in the manufacturing sector global outlook china gdp monday next week sees the release of some chinese economic figures for the second quarter which will give the latest reading on the health of the economy following the solid start in q1 most notable will be q2 gdp data which the consensus expects to rise 1 5 quarter over quarter but slow to 6 2 year over year we forecast growth will slow a bit more quickly to 6 1 while within that overall growth figure we expect that activity in the service sector held up better than in the manufacturing sector mixed confidence surveys and activity data during q2 and uncertainty stemming from trade tensions with the united states likely contributed to slower growth q2 activity data for june are also on the schedule growth in retail sales is expected to ease to 8 5 year over year while growth in industrial output should rebound modestly to 5 2 after a soft may reading overall economic trends remain subdued however and a further growth slowdown seems likely previous 6 4 consensus 6 2 year over year canada cpi wednesday canadian consumer prices jumped more than expected in may led by increases in several transportation related costs and the main focus next week will be to what extent that jump is reversed with the release of the june cpi lower gasoline prices will probably partly weigh on the cpi and overall we expect most if not all of the may jump to be reversed with our forecast for the headline cpi to slow to 1 9 year over year we expect the central bank s core cpi inflation measure s to print close to or above the 2 inflation target midpoint given a quickening in wage inflation we would not be surprised to see canadian inflation trends remain modestly elevated in the near term the bank of canada held its policy rate steady this week and while we don t expect cpi trends will prompt the central bank to tighten the bank of canada appears unlikely to join other g10 central banks in easing monetary policy previous 2 4 wells fargo 1 9 consensus 1 9 year over year u k retail sales thursday after a surprisingly resilient start for the u k economy in 2019 the focus during the second quarter has shifted to the extent to which growth has subsequently slowed a reversal of ahead of the initial end march brexit deadline has likely contributed to the downshift in growth although consumer spending also appears to have weakened perceptibly during the second quarter retail sales fell on a sequential basis in april and may after three straight monthly increases during q1 recent confidence surveys suggest the underlying trend in the retail sector remains soft and the consensus expects another decline of 0 3 month over month in june the june cpi is also on next week s schedule but should have little market impact the headline cpi should rise 2 0 year over year and the core cpi 1 8 both close to the inflation target previous 0 5 consensus 0 3 month over month point of view interest rate watch policy is on the right track powell s congressional testimony this week came in very close to expectations the fed chair highlighted the fed s primary areas of concern most of which centered on deteriorating economic conditions overseas and the continued uncertainty surrounding trade negotiations and brexit powell added in his concerns about how congress and the president will come to terms with the debt ceiling for good measure and also stated that they were not dissuaded at all by june s strong employment report we see little in the way of economic news that is likely to get in the way of a quarter percentage point cut in the federal funds rate at the july 31 fomc meeting while a quarter point rate cut now appears certain the stronger economic news and slightly higher than expected core inflation data have likely killed the idea of a half percentage point cut at the july meeting such talk always seemed simplistic to us at face value a half percentage point cut in the federal funds rate would steepen the yield curve because the funds rate would fall back below the 10 year treasury note but a half point move might also spook markets and cause treasury yields to decline leaving the yield curve flat or even inverted the fed would then have fewer viable options the stock market appears to like the idea of a more dovish fed the major stock indices have also risen solidly since powell s testimony as the recent inversion of the yield curve looks less menacing powell and congress also earned some style points this week powell made his major points about the need to cut interest rates succinctly and convincingly and made a strong case that the risks from slower global growth and major unresolved issues like brexit trade talks and the impending u s debt ceiling more than outweigh concerns about easing at a time that the economy appears to be at or beyond full employment powell also expressed little concern on inflation despite the bounce back in some core inflation measures the bottom line on inflation is that it is lower than it should be for this point of the business cycle which gives the fed the leeway to cut 25 bps in both july and again later this year credit market insights developments in consumer credit u s consumer debt increased in may to 17 1b expanding at a solid pace for the second straight month revolving credit including credit card borrowing reached a new high climbing 7 2b from the previous month the largest increase since october however the non revolving sector which includes educational and automobile loans increased only 9 9b the smallest increase since june 2018 after rising 10 5b in april the data suggest that consumer borrowing has remained strong mainly due to higher wages and job growth household debt ticked up in the first quarter of 2019 increasing for the 19th consecutive quarter mortgage balances and auto loans also increased in q1 2019 expanding 1 3 and 0 5 respectively while total credit card balances fell 2 5 meanwhile the total amount of outstanding student loans increased to 1 49t in the first quarter up 29b from the previous quarter the growth in student loan debt continues to be a concern among some analysts as one of the country s 2most widespread financial burdens personal income and spending was also firmer in may and pce growth is now on track to come in above 3 in q2 consumer fundamentals remain strong supported by stronger job growth which helps to increase spending despite the strong consumer data it will likely not be enough to dissuade the fed from cutting interest rates at its july meeting topic of the week recent volatility in the asi previously we have introduced an index to quantify keynes animal spirits our animal spirits index asi is constructed using five variables to capture sentiment of major economic agents in major sectors of the economy to shed light on economic agents expectations about the near term economic outlook we utilize a dynamic factor modeling approach in constructing our index an asi value above zero positive animal spirits suggests optimism while a value below zero negative animal spirits indicates pessimism the lowest value of the asi was during the great recession in october 2008 when the index fell to 1 65 top chart the index proceeded to stay in negative territory until january 2014 consistent with the slow recovery from the great recession the index has since remained in positive territory for the majority of the time since february 2014 as the economic expansion has gained steam and optimism has returned this week we updated our model finding that the asi has been volatile in the first half of 2019 starting the year at 0 25 the index climbed to its highest level in the post great recession era 1 02 in april before falling back to 0 54 in june the volatility in the asi was a result of fluctuations in the equity market and policy tension the policy uncertainty index fell to 98 7 in april after jumping to 201 in january bottom chart meanwhile the vix has remained relatively calm in 2019 the two components of the asi that are still under stress are the yield spread and the consumer confidence index the yield spread has remained negative while the consumer confidence index dropped in june to 121 5 from 131 3 the previous month although the yield curve has inverted in recent months the asi shows that economic agents are comfortable with the recent developments in the economic and financial worlds it seems the economic policy environment along with the equity market recovery have driven the asi higher for now we will continue to update our asi and report any significant changes in the index

the actions mark a broad escalation of trump s trade wars the new tariffs on chinese and mexican imports amount to potentially 190 billion a year in new taxes paid by u s importers and typically passed on to consumers for american households this means higher prices on fruits and vegetables autos electronic components and other necessities what s more exporters especially farmers can expect to suffer retaliation when china and mexico hit back with tariffs or other sanctions on exports from the united states advertisement 3 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the tariffs inflict other damage that is harder to measure they generate uncertainty for american businesses over where to buy supplies sell goods or situate factories and offices and they rattle investors and undercut consumer and business confidence researchers at ubs calculate that a 25 tariff on all chinese imports would shave a full percentage point from u s growth over the next year the economy grew 2 9 in 2018 and will likely be weaker for 2019 add a 25 tax on mexican goods they say and the united states could tumble into recession for the first time since 2009 the federal reserve has taken notice chairman jerome powell made clear this week that the fed is prepared intervene likely by lowering interest rates if the trade wars were deemed to threaten the expansion still it s far from sure that trump s trade conflicts even if they escalate will imperil the economy pinelopi goldberg chief economist of the world bank and economists pablo fajgelbaum of ucla patrick kennedy of the university of california berkeley and amit khandelwal of columbia university calculated that the economic loss from the trade wars last year amounted a minuscule 0 04 of gross domestic product the broadest gauge of economic output their figure doesn t include the latest tariff threats advertisement 4 story continues below this advertisement has not

world bank calculates the share is lower in only seven other countries none of them an industrial power like the u s yet despite its modest economic role trade punches above its weight in american political discourse consider the revamped version of the politically contentious north american free trade agreement that the u s negotiated last year with canada and mexico one of trump s policy achievements trump said the new pact the u s mexico canada agreement would create jobs and restore america s status as a manufacturing powerhouse by drawing factories back to the u s from low wage mexico but the independent u s international trade commission analyzed the new agreement and concluded that it would boost the economy by just 68 billion and add 176 000 jobs over six years negligible gains in a 21 trillion economy and a job market exceeding 150 million people likewise said jason furman who served as chairman of president barack obama s council of economic advisers to date most of trump s trade war has been too small to have a large aggregate economic impact advertisement 5 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content that said furman warned that if the china tariffs were extended to all products and if tariffs were also imposed on mexico we could start to actually see the trade war in jobs gdp and other aspects of the economy furman who is now at the harvard kennedy school said he doubts the new tariffs would tip the united states economy into recession but they would certainly help push it in that direction for months businesses and investors have largely convinced themselves that trump would deploy his tariffs only temporarily as leverage to pry concessions from china mexico and others and just over a month ago it looked as if the u s and china were nearing a resolution in their conflict over beijing s aggressive push to overtake american technological dominance but negotiations collapsed and trump ramped up tariffs after the u s side accused beijing of reneging on commitments made earlier in the negotiations even more unsettling was trump s sudden decision to tax mexican imports this came less than two weeks after he d lifted tariffs on mexican and canadian steel and aluminum which had seemed an effort to ease tensions with america s neighbours and persuade their lawmakers to ratify the revamped north american trade agreement advertisement 6 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content people were

klingner ceo of the holding company palindromes the conflict is complicating plans to buy a meat processing plant in the midwest the operation faces a tariff double whammy its pork goes to mexico where workers cut the meat then returns to america crossing the border twice means the pork will likely be hit twice once by trump s tariffs and once by mexico s retaliation we re having to put together plan a plan b plan c klinger said some companies had sought to avoid the tariffs on chinese imports by switching to mexico only to see trump hit mexican imports too there is this creeping

finance minister union budget interest rate risk kerala thepresented thelast week it contained a proposal to spend about 28 trillion of your money over this fiscal year that s 28 followed by 12 zeros how will this amount be raised by taxing you the taxes will include income tax on individuals and corporations custom duties on imported items excise on petrol and diesel and the ubiquitous goods and services tax gst the gst is collected like a sales tax on almost all non agricultural goods and services and is shared by both the centre and states the centre also collects a special tax called a cess on various items like coal which is not shared with the states in addition to taxes and cesses it is hoping to get nearly rs 1trillion as dividend i e profit share from the reserve bank of india and public sector enterprises the rbi not only literally mints money but is also a major contributor to bridging the fiscal gap another rs 1 trillion will come from disinvestment i e selling the government s shares in various government companies including possibly air india despite all this the centre is short by rs 7 trillion which it has somehow got to find this is the size of the fiscal deficit the only way to pay for this shortfall is by borrowing because you can t simply print money to get out of this fiscal hole you borrow and then you repay maybe 20 years later you borrow by selling government bonds to the public who are eager buyers only if the bonds have attractive interest rate attached to them but higher the borrowing need then higher is the interest rate to be offered this puts upward pressure on interest rates for all borrowers of which the biggest borrower is the government then this will spell bad news to home loan borrowers or small and big businesses who are trying to raise funds from the banks and debt market this is the main reason why high fiscal deficit is bad news for the economy it can cause interest rates to go up and also be inflationary but because there is only so much capacity to lend and borrow in the country the interest rate also acts like a discipline device if the government cares about helping private business and entrepreneurs then it should reduce its borrowing and leave some room for private borrowers without disrupting the interest rate scenario too much oh by the way the government also bypasses the banking system and borrows using the small savings scheme sold in the post offices since those interest rates are higher the public savings and deposits get diverted from banks to post offices so how to ease the pressure and get out of a fiscal tight corner go and borrow from abroad for the first time in our history the government will borrow directly in dollars from foreigners by selling a sovereign dollar bond since it will be repayable in dollars only it exposes the government to not just but also the risk of a drop in the exchange rate suppose it borrows at 6 per cent when dollar is at 70 but when it is time to repay the rupee dollar rate has dropped to 80 then there is that additional burden of repayment ultimately all debt obligations have to be repaid from taxes collected in rupees even in the crisis year of 1991 the then government preferred to pledge its gold rather than sell a dollar bond with an uncertain future liability many a latin american country has come to grief for committing the sin of borrowing in dollars from abroad but in proposing to borrow about 10 billion i e rs 0 7 trillion at present exchange rates the government of india is following in the footsteps of kerala theinfrastructure investment finance board kiifb recently raised about rs 2 000 crore by selling bonds in london this was the first time a sub sovereign entity from india has raised bond finance from overseas the only difference is that the bond was denominated in rupees not dollars so investors had to be paid 9 7 per cent interest rate free from taxes a rate even higher than our rock solid public provident fund the foreign investors have invested by converting their dollars to rupees so even if it looks like kerala has only a rupee liability indirectly it is a dollar liability for the country since kerala got a foot in the door with a rs 2 000 crore foreign bond the government of india is following up and opening the door wide open with rs 70 000 crore and more next year it exposes the country to dangerous exchange rate risk lets off the government from domestic fiscal discipline and can potentially cause interest rate volatility in domestic market the original sin of kerala should not be repeated hope the centre resists this temptation

there are many challenges facing the united states there is a resurgent russia testing the will of nato and trying to break the u s relationship with europe then there are the actions of china in the south china sea where china has constructed several artificial islands and is trying very hard to militarily force the united states out of asia there is the polarization of politics in the united states with its people are finding it difficult and at times impossible to select a government that is functional yet the greatest long term danger the united states faces is its addiction to deficit spending and its refusal for it to live within its means currently the united states has a debt of 22 trillion with no end in sight of more deficit spending and less and less fiscal responsibility the american people demand certain goods and services from its government yet are unwilling to tax themselves to pay for these goods and services and so ad infinitum yet unnoticed by u s citizens is the fact that they currently have from 123 8 trillion to 200 trillion of physical assets on federal land this valuation includes the untapped potential of the green river formation and the 3 trillion barrels of shale oil yet the american people very rarely see a 13th of the value of these assets due to the paltry royalties paid to the u s government from private companies who mine and extract wealth from federal lands if the u s were to adopt a development fund based on the mineral wealth that is on federal land then the issues on financing the u s government would be a thing of the past such a fund would require a reversal of the roles that currently define the dynamics between private companies and the federal government which holds federal lands in trust for the citizens of the united states instead of the current policies where private companies pay the u s government 0 125 cents for every 1 of wealth extracted the u s would pay private companies to extract wealth from federal land and then sell the extracted mineral wealth on the open market the fund would also have the authority to invest these funds in private industries worldwide such as the global norwegian government pension fund and the alaskan permanent fund the guiding principle of such an investment fund would be of a conservative nature with the view of long term benefits as opposed to short term benefits all of this is commercially and technologically possible what is lacking is the political will to do this successful development funds there are two diverse types of sovereign wealth funds swf or development funds that should be examined before discussing a proposed development fund that this article proposes the alaskan permanent fund the alaska permanent fund apf is an established permanent fund managed by a state owned corporation the alaska permanent fund corporation apfc the fund was set up for the benefit of the people of alaska the fund was created in 1976 to take advantage of the leasing of state land to the oil companies that were developing the oil riches of prudhoe bay the fund receives at least 25 of the oil revenue generated from oil extraction on state lands the fund is divided into two parts the principal and the earnings reserve the principal is non spendable while the earnings reserve is spendable it is from the earnings reserve that the alaskan dividend is paid the fund grew from a first investment of 734 000 in 1977 to approximately 65 3 billion as of april 30 2019 some growth was due to good management some to inflationary re investment and some via legislative decisions to deposit extra income during boom years each year the fund s realized earnings are split between inflation proofing operating expenses and the annual permanent fund dividend the fund itself is now part of the alaskan state constitution placed on the state ballot in april of 1976 the voters approved of the amendment to the alaskan state constitution placing the apf off limits to the state house and state senate the alaskan permanent fund is the only swf that is protected by a constitutional amendment each year every citizen of alaska receives a dividend check which is called the permanent fund dividend pfd for the year 2018 the pfd was 1 600 for the year 2019 the estimated pfd will be 3 000 government pension fund of norway the government pension fund of norway consists of two different sovereign wealth funds swf the first is the government pension fund global and the second is the government pension fund norway the government pension fund norway invests only in scandinavian countries and it only invests in those stocks and bonds that are listed on the oslo stock market the global fund invests in companies globally and outside of the scandinavian countries the norwegian global fund is the largest investor of stocks in the european union and its value as of march 2019 was over 1 trillion the global part of the swf of norway has an ethics committee and will remove and add companies to the fund depending upon the guidelines of the global fund for example in the past few years the swf has disinvested from 53 companies that derive at least 30 of its earnings from coal mining and usage since 1998 the fund has been allowed to invest up to 40 percent of its portfolio in the international stock market in june 2009 the ministry decided to raise the stock portion to 60 percent in may 2014 the central bank governor proposed raising the rate to 70 percent the norwegian government planned that up to 5 percent of the fund should be invested in real estate beginning in 2010 a specific policy for the real estate investments was suggested in a report the swiss partners group wrote for the norwegian ministry of finance the fund s current investment strategy dictates 65 equities and 35 among other investment instruments since its inception the global norwegian swf has recorded a profit of 5 83 return on investment its average return has been 3 9 this is only the profit made from investments in stocks and securities from the norwegian swf norway has also expanded into funding large corporate mergers a recent article in the los angeles times describes the increasing popularity of development funds or sovereign wealth funds among several countries a proposed u s development fund by setting up a development fund for the united states united states economic and fiscal difficulties would soon become an issue of the past while the united states should continue to tax its citizens the profits from the development of its natural resources would help the population of the united states rather than the private companies which currently extract wealth from federal land and pay the u s taxpayer 0 125 cents while keeping 0 875 cents for themselves as with the alaskan permanent fund a constitutional amendment would be necessary to guarantee that the house and senate cannot change the charter of a development fund and guarantee that the fund will be available for the use of future generations the bureau of land management blm is the governmental agency which currently manages the real property of the government of the united states its charter is to sustain the health diversity and productivity of the public lands for the use and enjoyment of present and future generations since the blm s charter is to supervise public land for the use and enjoyment of present and future generations it is not inconceivable for the u s congress to change the wording to reflect the following to sustain the health diversity productivity and fiscal management of the public lands for the use and enjoyment of present and future generations the charter for a development fund for the united states would be bound by the santiago principles governing the use of any sovereign wealth fund the profits from the development of federal land would belong to the charter for the development fund as opposed to the profits to be disbursed to the u s treasury a definition of capitalism some people will attack this proposal as socialism or communism when it is really capitalism to frame my argument in proper terms i have described the classical definition of capitalism and proposed a new wording of the definition of capitalism the definition of capitalism as defined by the merriam webster is an economic system characterized by private or corporate ownership of capital goods by investment that are determined by private decision and by prices production and the distribution of goods that are determined mainly by competition in a free market if we slightly alter this sentence and make the definition of capitalism as an economic system characterized by private corporate or governmental ownership of capital goods by investment that are determined by independent decision and by prices production and the distribution of goods that are determined mainly by competition in a free market while we have altered the words of the original definition we have not altered the meaning of the original definition the owners of land and natural resources have the right to develop these resources for their own benefit this meaning would apply to individual people corporations or government entities that are the representatives of the economic and commercial interests of the owner of the resource even if that entity is a government agency representing the economic and fiscal interests of the population of a country defined by its political borders by doing so we have provided a new understanding of the meaning of the word capitalism
the rapid urbanization of the worldâ s population is well under way by 2050 68 percent of the global population will live in urban areas emerging countries and regions will see the greatest increase in their urban populations and china india and nigeria represent slightly more than a third of the projected growth in that time frame as city populations swell municipal governments face increasing pressure from citizens and businesses to improve service delivery performance furthermore the funding that municipalities receive from other government entities is decreasing from 2010 to 2016 for example central government funding as the share of total municipal revenue fell by approximately 12 percent on average across all countries in the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd exhibit 1 1 as a result of these twin trends a majority of the municipalities around the world are struggling to increase revenues while facing structural budget shortfalls that threaten service delivery and quality beyond central government funding the primary revenue streams for municipal governments are service fees fines taxes and assets such as buildings and properties and these sources tend to be far from optimized local governments are often unaware of how to get more from existing sources and lack the resources to mount such efforts in addition elected officials must strike a tricky balance between raising taxes and fees and maintaining public support to meet rising expectations for service delivery amid tight budgets municipal governments must increase revenues from existing sources as well as create new revenue streams elected officials have four primary revenue sources each containing multiple levers the challenge is identifying and prioritizing the opportunities that will have the greatest impact and are relatively feasible in our experience governments that pursue a practical approach to revenue generation can capture up to 50 percent of incremental revenues this can be accomplished through moves that wonâ t adversely affect public opinion or a cityâ s competitiveness in attracting businesses and economic development understanding municipal revenue streams before cities can begin to optimize their revenues they must first compile an inventory of existing revenue streams in general cities draw from four types of sources that each include numerous levers exhibit 2 2 service fees municipalities raise revenues by charging for services such as public parking toll roads waste management and building permits among others fines cities use fines as both a deterrent for behavior at odds with the public goodâ for example the accumulation and nondisposal of garbage or building construction without a temporary fenceâ and a revenue source charges and taxes municipalities often levy charges and taxes on property owners as well as on income sales and other transactions these activities such as hospitality charges and taxes on plastic bottles and bags carbon from vehicles and vacant land do not involve the delivery of services from the government city assets and investments through leases joint ventures and joint development agreements municipalities can generate additional income assets can include land monetization such as land used by telcos for cell towers appreciating land values and commercial advertisements in public spaces public markets and shopping centers to increase the flow of revenues from these sources cities can select from four interventions exhibit 3 some are widely practiced while others represent emerging and innovative options for city governments to pursue since residents often react negatively to actions that increase the cost of living efforts to raise revenue through additional fees and taxes can be considered more acceptable when they also have a perceived public benefit for instance some cities have implemented a refundable deposit for beverage containers to encourage recycling or sought to enhance public safety by issuing speeding tickets to motorists 3 1 charge more perhaps the simplest and most straightforward approach across each of the four revenue streams would be to charge more municipalities could increase service fees such as those on parking and construction permits as well as fines taxes and the cost of accessing city assets such as beaches to guide price hikes cities could use benchmarks to determine the acceptable range this intervention is typically most applicable to service feesâ specifically utility services such as water sewage or electricity as an alternative to benchmarking cities could also determine the cost of services and then establish a cost plus pricing model to generate additional revenues would you like to learn more about our public sector practice cities could also revise their pricing models by using differentiating factors specific to each revenue lever these factors often include volume of activity location and period of validity in finland for example fines for speeding are broadly linked to the income of violators and how far over the speed limit they were traveling when caught this approach has the potential to not only fairly penalize offenders and reduce instances of speeding but also to generate more revenue a 2016 study conducted by the australia institute concluded that the finnish model would yield a 12 percent increase on average in the value of fines issued by five states in australia last municipalities could increase revenues by implementing higher fees for faster processing times or better service this intervention is typically applicable to any paper based transactions or services such as business license fees construction permit fees or land registration fees in los angeles for instance developers can obtain an expedited engineering permit for a surcharge of 40 percent of the permitâ s cost 2 increase number of transactions cities can also raise revenues by increasing the number of transactions through various approaches this intervention includes expanding the sheer quantity of service offerings and assets extending charges to a larger user base or increasing the frequency of surveillance and inspection for selected fine sources to maximize detection of violations furthermore technological advancements can aid increased surveillance for example new yorkâ s nassau county installed red light cameras at 86 intersections in 2016 and produced more than 500 000 tickets for motorists which generated 48 million these cameras are controversial and enhanced efficiency is one reason why many municipalities haven t taken this approach 3 improve collections a third lever is optimizing collection and audit processes to increase collection rates and minimize leakage one strategy that cities have followed is introducing an amnesty program for delinquent parking tickets that waives penalties and additional fines as an incentive for motorists to pay up the city of chicago has instituted such a program several times over the past two decades each time the city brought in 7 million to 9 million in revenue other strategies such as payment plans can also reduce leakage and increase collections 4 create new revenue streams finally cities could introduce new types of service fees fines and chargesâ and in so doing create new sources of revenue in general this intervention represents the horizon for innovation across all revenue streams for example cities could institute new charges for the disposal of food waste these fines would promote environmentally responsible behavior as well as create a viable revenue stream for the city in 2013 seoul introduced a volume based food waste disposal charge that succeeded in reducing its daily food waste significantly similarly london has instituted a congestion charge that drivers must pay when traveling within the city center this charge generates more than 100 million in revenue each year optimizing land monetization has the potential to double baseline revenue from income generating assets for existing land lease contracts cities could maximize value through renegotiation or cancellation and retender based on tenant response when renegotiating existing leases several levers can be utilized such as increasing allowable floor to area ratio far collecting penalties for violations amending contract duration and payment terms and modifying plot use cities could also increase value from unused land plots through monetizing them either as lease contracts or through other more innovative publicâ private partnership structures such as joint development agreements or joint ventures exhibit 4 4 how to design a city revenue optimization strategy once cities have identified their field of options they must consider several questions before jumping into implementation which streams and interventions can generate the most revenues with a limited impact on stakeholders what is the size of the opportunity and what is feasible to achieve there is no one route that cities can or should take to boost revenues indeed each cityâ s situation is inherently different and will require a unique combination of interventions and careful consideration to ensure the program is both economically and politically feasible the following steps provide a structured process for cities to determine a tailored and effective solution taking into account the distinctive characteristics of each city first to identify the relevant revenue streams and which interventions to apply cities should determine the relevant data and revenue baselines this preparatory work generally consists of collecting the relevant data and developing the current revenue baseline in addition to help gauge the likelihood and tenor of social acceptance prior to forging ahead with implementation cities could consider conducting a citizen sentiment survey to understand how receptive residents might be to specific changes in fee structures and charges next cities should perform a thorough gap analysis to define the potential revenue impact for any given stream this exercise involves analyzing the cityâ s revenue baseline to determine current revenue generation across all streams and then comparing revenue streams against benchmarks for peer cities to identify any gaps with initial adjustments for relevance and size of potential revenue impact cities can select the most promising streams as revenue generators following the clear identification of interventions and opportunities cities can set priorities based on social acceptance economic impact and ease of implementation these three dimensions can be further broken down into factors for evaluation exhibit 5 cities should then establish a revenue committee that adopts a strategic perspective to assess the impact of revenue levers and understand the interlocking factors 5 social acceptance how receptive citizens and businesses are to a given intervention in a revenue stream can have significant impact on the interventionâ s long term viability therefore the following three areas should be examined visibilityâ the significance of the changes and their impact on citizens and businesses are changes concentrated within a specific group or area of the city or are they highly visible and applied to the entire population potential public benefitâ the positive impact of the chosen revenue lever does the lever provide clear public benefit while inducing positive behavior are these interventions applied fairly to various socioeconomic segments price against benchmarksâ a comparison of current prices for government services against data from comparable cities that have similar levels of competitiveness is the level of fees fines or charges higher or lower than the regional average in addition the city should refer back to the results of the citizen sentiment survey conducted during the preparatory stage to help inform the assessment of social acceptance impact on economy of course feasibility depends in part on the impact of an action on the city and its residents areas to be assessed may include the following metrics gdpâ whether the lever impacts the economic sectors and activity in the city inflationâ whether the lever increases the cost of living for residents competitivenessâ the cityâ s position on various competitiveness indexes and how certain factors such as government services and safety compare with other urban centers ease of implementation an effective assessment will analyze a given interventionâ s technical feasibility and implementation cities should consider the following areas technical readinessâ the familiarity of the municipality with the technical requirements behind the suggested revenue lever and its implementation resources requirementsâ the resources needed to implement the selected lever alignment with government agendaâ the relevance and fit of the suggested revenue lever when mapped across the government plan collectively these assessments will help cities to produce a prioritized list of levers for implementation guiding principles for implementing revenue optimization programs fix the home this category involves enhancing internal effectiveness of city teams to generate more revenues without visible impact to the public in our experience governments can capture significant valueâ up to 50 percent of potential additional revenuesâ by implementing measures linked to effectiveness such as enhancing collections and audit processes or better asset monetization cover cost to serve where possible governments should ensure that fee levels cover the costs of services being provided in the majority of cases this applies to administrative services as well as other city services such as utility provision smart cities digital solutions for a more livable future introduce innovative fees and charges cities that want to implement new charges will be more likely to build public support if such measures both induce positive behavior and have a clear equitable and risk averse public benefit a new tax on plastic would raise revenues and also benefit the environment vip services can also be offered where increased fee levels guarantee higher quality los angeles for example charges higher fees for expedited permitting and licensing processes bundle charges a limited number of charges and taxes ensures higher social acceptance and minimal collection leakage dubai instituted a knowledge dirham a flat charge that applies to all government services how to implement the program in our experience cities that fare the best in their revenue generation efforts create an internal dedicated unit that is responsible for the strategyâ s implementation these cities typically adopt one of two archetypes an independent revenue monetization department that focuses on commercial aspects and acts as a strategic unit for generating revenues or a commercial unit integrated into the finance department that is responsible for tracking progress of revenue targets to establish this dedicated unit cities could create a cross functional workforce with representatives from different departments including finance planning property legislation and key municipalities this unit has several responsibilities as such it should have a seat on the revenue committee as well as the authority to define roles and responsibilities to track the revenue generated across different municipalities it should also prepare reports on the performance of various initiatives and their respective owners or entities and update revenues studies based on changing market conditions in saudi arabia the ministry of municipal and rural affairs has a control unit that monitors the performance of regions and the regional government authorities that oversee municipalities we have found that this effort has led to a year over year increase in municipal revenues of 30 percent to instill a culture of performance organizations should set targets for net revenues and select key performance indicators kpis for example revenue kpis could include the annual increase in revenue per lever while nonrevenue kpis could define targets for each lever and its corresponding interventions such as the annual increase in the number of violations detected performance meetings should be scheduled on a weekly basis to track revenue generation and build ownership these meetings serve as a way to monitor progress and enable proper implementation the involvement of leadership as well as all relevant departments and municipalities would help to ensure proper implementation across all levels most cities have yet to unlock the full potential of their existing revenue sources let alone tap into new streams despite the numerous options available to generate more funding for city operations elected officials must proceed carefully maintaining public support is critical to the longer term viability of such efforts and cities must create an attractive business climate cities that successfully cultivate a mixture of actions can dramatically improve their fiscal health and improve services for their residents

finance minister union budget interest rate risk kerala in following the state s decision to raise money from abroad the centre is making a big mistakethepresented thelast week it contained a proposal to spend about 28 trillion of your money over this fiscal year that s 28 followed by 12 zeros how will this amount be raised by taxing you the taxes will include income tax on individuals and corporations custom duties on imported items excise on petrol and diesel and the ubiquitous goods and services tax gst the gst is collected like a sales tax on almost all non agricultural goods and services and is shared by both the centre and states the centre also collects a special tax called a cess on various items like coal which is not shared with the states in addition to taxes and cesses it is hoping to get nearly rs 1trillion as dividend i e profit share from the reserve bank of india and public sector enterprises the rbi not only literally mints money but is also a major contributor to bridging the fiscal gap another rs 1 trillion will come from disinvestment i e selling the government s shares in various government companies including possibly air india despite all this the centre is short by rs 7 trillion which it has somehow got to find this is the size of the fiscal deficit the only way to pay for this shortfall is by borrowing because you can t simply print money to get out of this fiscal hole you borrow and then you repay maybe 20 years later you borrow by selling government bonds to the public who are eager buyers only if the bonds have attractive interest rate attached to them but higher the borrowing need then higher is the interest rate to be offered this puts upward pressure on interest rates for all borrowers of which the biggest borrower is the government then this will spell bad news to home loan borrowers or small and big businesses who are trying to raise funds from the banks and debt market this is the main reason why high fiscal deficit is bad news for the economy it can cause interest rates to go up and also be inflationary but because there is only so much capacity to lend and borrow in the country the interest rate also acts like a discipline device if the government cares about helping private business and entrepreneurs then it should reduce its borrowing and leave some room for private borrowers without disrupting the interest rate scenario too much oh by the way the government also bypasses the banking system and borrows using the small savings scheme sold in the post offices since those interest rates are higher the public savings and deposits get diverted from banks to post offices so how to ease the pressure and get out of a fiscal tight corner go and borrow from abroad for the first time in our history the government will borrow directly in dollars from foreigners by selling a sovereign dollar bond since it will be repayable in dollars only it exposes the government to not just but also the risk of a drop in the exchange rate suppose it borrows at 6 per cent when dollar is at 70 but when it is time to repay the rupee dollar rate has dropped to 80 then there is that additional burden of repayment ultimately all debt obligations have to be repaid from taxes collected in rupees even in the crisis year of 1991 the then government preferred to pledge its gold rather than sell a dollar bond with an uncertain future liability many a latin american country has come to grief for committing the sin of borrowing in dollars from abroad but in proposing to borrow about 10 billion i e rs 0 7 trillion at present exchange rates the government of india is following in the footsteps of kerala theinfrastructure investment finance board kiifb recently raised about rs 2 000 crore by selling bonds in london this was the first time a sub sovereign entity from india has raised bond finance from overseas the only difference is that the bond was denominated in rupees not dollars so investors had to be paid 9 7 per cent interest rate free from taxes a rate even higher than our rock solid public provident fund the foreign investors have invested by converting their dollars to rupees so even if it looks like kerala has only a rupee liability indirectly it is a dollar liability for the country since kerala got a foot in the door with a rs 2 000 crore foreign bond the government of india is following up and opening the door wide open with rs 70 000 crore and more next year it exposes the country to dangerous exchange rate risk lets off the government from domestic fiscal discipline and can potentially cause interest rate volatility in domestic market the original sin of kerala should not be repeated hope the centre resists this temptation
for the sake of positive national image all pakistanis are expected to keep their cool let us think positively to have a clear understanding of what is happening around and what is good for pakistan on domestic and international scene and that what should be our reaction and line of action opinion is important to know and reflect on no matter what is your profession and standing in the society freedom of expression is important along with a positive and effective role of media to point out what is wrong and where correcting wrongs is moral social and legal responsibility of all citizens watch against a culture of intrusiveness being inducted which has to be checked failure to do so is risking the danger of dismantling the entire operational economic structure of the country pakistan s main problem is that of its external account deficit devaluation can never be a help in fixing it there is no empirical evidence to suggest real correlation between devaluation and sustainable growth in a country s exports instead of going the wrong way pakistan has to follow taxation policies such as sales tax etc of successful countries like thailand japan and malaysia we have to keep the cost of doing business competitive at the same time government has to provide incentives and facilitate exports and the refund system to help exporters so that they don t have to face liquidity crunch think what could already cash starved exporters do in crisis situation the government has to focus on real issues and get set to performance rather than blaming past government and their policies pti government is in authority it has to demonstrate responsibility and accountability the people want results performance now as 6 billion imf loan is approved for 39 months with an upfront payment of 1 billion it is expected that a further 38 billion dollars will be available for pakistan from external sources with imf recommendations over the programme period which is a good sign for the economy having huge external payments it means an average of billion dollar per month may be available for government to finance its external payments in previous regime facility extended by imf to pakistan no amount of additional funding from other sources as a consequence of imf approval was specially pointed out by the fund now with these expected inflows the position of foreign reserves will be stable and will definitely control rupee depreciation it is expected that the rupee will further appreciate and take place around rs 148 152 per dollar in near future meanwhile on the other side mr shabarzaidi is determined to achieve a huge target of tax collection while broadening the base of tax payers by taking strict measures for documentation of economy inflation will come down after touching a 13 peak which should result in decreasing policy rate accordingly a stable rupee and availability of cheap funds or anyone from these two can reduce the pressure on industries heavily dependent on these twin input costs if these twin input costs are not controlled the situation of slow down of economy may result in complete shutdown experts in finance and economy have varying views some do not at all recommend devaluation of rupee road forward starts with a conversation we wish the united states and pakistan to have a constructive dialogue to further strengthen the long standing ties between the two countries a recent report by imf suggests that previous pml government as well as the current pti government have failed to adopt expected measures during implementation in both cases imf discipline and suggested steps were not followed with some seriousness imf report on economy is a damning indictment of the lopsided policies and insufficient policy action by incumbent pakistan tehreek e insaf pti unreasonably depreciated pak rupee is not in favour of even exporters which can get gain in short run but in longer time span it can hurt the going concern this scenario is resulting in inflation in the economy in such difficult time could we manage to get free of cost loan for the country as well as small and medium size enterprises this is suggested for imports specially according to a pti source only 1 of 220 million population pay tax if everyone contributes a little revenue target of rupee 5 500 billion is no big deal prime minister imran khan urged the people the other day to pay taxes and asked the business community to work with the government as partners for prosperity of the country he reiterated his pledge to hold accountable all the corrupt elements who had burdened the country with whopping debt of rupee thirty thousand billion it is worth mentioning that the government collects only ten percent of the tax the rest is done by slave unpaid labour who are subjected to coercion and penalties and other punishing behaviour an example here is withholding tax and may be some other indirect taxes for which government should provide assistance and cost of handling the thankless job the united states confirmed that prime minister imran khans s meeting on july 22 with president donald trump has been fixed officially the visit will focus on strengthening cooperation between the united states and pakistan to bring peace stability and economic prosperity to a region that has seen far too much conflict the statement said that prime minister khan and president trump will discuss a range of issues including counter terrorism defence energy and trade with the objective of creating conditions for a peaceful south asia the visit will help renew and reinvigorate long standing ties between pakistan and the united states says foreign office during the visit imran khan and donald trump would have wide ranging interaction at the white house on july 22 2019 covering bilateral and regional matters during his engagements in washington prime minister will underscore the importance pakistan attaches to a broader and multi faceted relationship with the united states pakistan s commitment to peace and stability and the importance of constructive engagement to promote a political solution in afghanistan he will also highlight pakistan s policy of peaceful neighbourhood aimed at resolving disputes through dialogue and promoting the vision of peace progress and prosperity in south asia and beyond road forward starts with a

zimbabwe does not have an interbank market because the reserve bank of zimbabwe continues to meddle otherwise if the interbank market were operating transparently the exchange rate of the zimbabwe dollar to the united states would drop to 4 to 1 currently the zimbabwe dollar is trading at about 9 to 1 economist eddie cross said zimbabwe was on the right track policy wise our macro economic fundamentals are fine we have a fiscal surplus and are holding down government expenditure and we now have a foreign exchange surplus he wrote on his personal blog but the problem was that the central bank was not allowing the interbank market to operate transparently there should be no crisis our foreign exchange earnings come from three main sources exports of goods and services income from tourism and what we call invisibles or net transfers and remittances from the diaspora he says exports last year were us 4 3 billion the other income about us 1 6 and the diaspora who knows what i know is that we have 5 million or more adult zimbabweans living and working outside the country 3 million in south africa the rest overseas money transfer agencies have millions of zimbabwean clients none report transfers on average below us 50 per month 50 x 5 million is us 3 billion per annum mukuyu reports average transfers in 2018 of us 78 per transfer in my view diaspora remittances are not less than us 3 billion look around you queues of people collecting money house building worth billions every year 3 million tonnes of cement school fees groceries and chema payments if this is the case we have about us 9 billion in forex available to meet our needs for imports and other things our imports have declined nearly 25 per cent because of low domestic demand at crazy prices these inflows of foreign currency are being managed by three institutional sectors the banks the reserve bank and the open market money traders in each sector they are motivated not by determining the real market price on a willing seller buyer basis but by getting the highest return for the dollar the banks are chasing their tails driven by their clients and the money changers make money on every turn and their clients want top dollar so the exchange rate runs the major impact of the de dollarization and si 142 was to bring the foreign exchange in the informal market more into the banks and this is what has reduced the exchange rate in the past 10 days from 15 to 1 to 8 to 12 to 1 but the reserve bank remains at the centre of this brewing storm in its inexplicable reluctance to implement stated policy over the past two weeks they are supposed to have put half their retentions from exports onto the interbank market for trading purposes that is nearly us 1 5 billion a year or us 6 million a day a considerable sum banks report no such activity i can understand why because we continue to see the reserve bank doing crazy things they are issuing letters of credit to support purchases of fuel and electricity and raw materials for the food industry all good you say but if we are selling fuel at half the landed cost of the stuff maize at 30 per cent of its real value wheat at the same rate and electricity at 2 us cents a kwh we are going broke rapidly when we give government us 21 million to buy luxury cars from croco motors at 1 to 1 we have bought that foreign exchange at 8 or 9 to one the entire loss of z 150 million goes into the rbz overdraft the most inflationary form of borrowing that is available despite denials i see new bond notes in the market still smelling of printer s ink what ae they doing with that they are buying gold and then using the gold to settle the banks external liabilities it is months since we saw any significant statistics on anything from the bank what are they hiding the truth is the rbz is totally out of control why is this important what has it got to do with the perfect storm everything if we had an interbank market say a daily gathering of traders of foreign exchange in the basement of the rbz building in harare if all foreign exchange from all sources was placed on that table every morning at say 10 00hrs if all banks came to the market with their client s needs a price would emerge from that table which would reflect real supply and demand if i am right about the supply and demand of hard currency in zimbabwe the rate would come down immediately my colleagues on the economists round table a local think tank agree it would fall below 4 to 1 we need to maintain a relatively weak local currency and if that happened we would recommend the reserve bank buys foreign exchange to keep the rate at say 4 to 1 full blog below continued next page 317 views

yves here this personal account of the rise and fall and hopeful rebirth of unions correctly gives prominent play to the right wing anti labor effort whose strategy was set forth in the 1971 powell memo by leo w gerard the international president of the united steelworkers union usw produced by the independent media institute in march 2010 a rally by thousands of striking usw workers at the vale mine and smelter in sudbury canada was joined by allies from brazil australia and countries around the world photo courtesy of united steelworkers i was raised in a company house in a company town where the miners had to buy their own oilers that is rubber coveralls drill bits and other tools at the company store that company inco limited the world s leading producer of nickel for most of the 20th century controlled the town of sudbury ontario but never succeeded in owning the souls of the men and women who lived and worked there that s because these were union men and women self possessed a little rowdy and well aware that puny pleas from individual workers fall on deaf corporate ears as i prepare to retire in a couple of days 54 years after starting work as a copper puncher at the inco smelter the relationship between massive multinational corporations and workers is different unions represent a much smaller percentage of workers now so few that some don t even know what a labor organization is or what organized labor can accomplish that is the result of deliberate decades long attacks on unions by corporations and the rich they intend to own not only workers time and production but their very souls i d like to tell you the story of inco because it illustrates the arc of labor union ascendance and attenuation over the past 72 years since i was born in sudbury when i was a boy the inco workers about 19 000 of them were represented by the international union of mine mill and smelter workers the union was gathering strength my dad wilfred gerard was among the rabble rousers we lived just a few miles from the mine and workers would gather at the house someone would bring a case of beer and my mom would make egg salad or bologna sandwiches conditions in the mine were terrible and these workers were organizing to achieve change i recall them talking about a work stoppage over safety glasses i was amazed that they would have to take action like that to get essential work equipment the company i thought should voluntarily take this simple step to ensure workers were not unnecessarily injured on the job i learned two important lessons from sitting on the steps and listening to those meetings one was that the company would do nothing for the workers unless forced by collective action the other was that labor unions were instruments of both economic and social justice i started work in the smelter at age 18 after graduating high school my mother told my girlfriend susan my future wife not to let me get involved in the union because if i did i would be gone all of the time for a few years i resisted union activism still i carried a copy of the labor contract in my pocket pulled out just high enough so the boss could see it i knew what it said and i wanted him to know i knew in 1967 when i was 20 the international union of mine mill and smelter workers merged with the united steelworkers usw and i became a usw member it didn t take long for the guys at the smelter to see that i had a big mouth and in 1969 they petitioned for me to become a shop steward that was the beginning my mom was right it did mean i was gone much of the time i got myself demoted so i could work day shifts and attend college at night on day shift i noticed the company was using a bunch of contractors many were performing work that was supposed to be done by union members other contractors sat in their trucks parked behind the warehouse doing nothing so i got about six guys to help me track and record the violations every day then we would file grievances against the company we could not win because the contract language was weak at that point but we took it through all the stages of grieving and it cost inco money that made the bosses furious so they took it out on me you have to be prepared for that if you are going to be an activist they made me rake rocks that had fallen off the mine trucks onto the road they made me pick up trash in the parking lot they tried to humiliate me but i always found a way to comply without bowing to them the advantage we had in those days was that they thought they were smarter than us they didn t understand that we were a team and we stuck together so there was no way they were going to own us that was the 1960s a different time union membership in the united states rose through 1965 when nearly one in three workers belonged in canada the rise continued through 1985 when the rate was 38 percent the drop off in the united states was fairly slow until 1980 when it plummeted to 23 2 percent it has now fallen to 10 5 percent in canada the decline was steady but much slower the rate there remains 30 1 percent close to the all time high in the united states the difference is that in the united states corporations and conservatives engaged in a successful campaign beginning in 1971 to seize power from workers and propagandize for what they euphemistically called free enterprise really it s cutthroat capitalism the upshot is that u s workers have more difficulty forming unions than canadians and u s corporations can more easily lock workers out of their jobs and hire strikebreakers the intent is to enable corporations to own their workers lock stock and soul lewis powell the late u s supreme court justice launched this drive to crush labor the left and environmentalists in the united states with a memo he wrote in 1971 for the u s chamber of commerce and distributed to corporate leaders powell told the chamber that it had to organize businesses into a political force because he claimed corporations and the free market system were under broad attack and in deep trouble he inveighed against regulations sought by car safety activist ralph nader by environmentalists petitioning for clean air and water and by unions demanding less deadly mines and manufacturing he castigated those on the left pursuing a fairer safer and more humane society businesses must cultivate political power and wield it powell said to secure free market advantages such as tax breaks and loopholes specifically for corporations and the rich powell also told the chamber strength lies in organization in careful long range planning and implementation in consistency of action over an indefinite period of years in the scale of financing available only through joint effort and in the political power available only through united action and national organizations that is exactly what the chamber achieved it catalyzed a business movement funded by wealthy conservative family and corporate foundations including those of coors olin scaife and koch to name a few the foundations sponsored conservative professors at universities and right wing non profits such as the heritage foundation the cato institute americans for prosperity and the american legislative exchange council alec which provides junkets for right wing lawmakers at which it encourages them to champion anti union and anti worker legislation these groups bankrolled conservative candidates and secured appointments of conservative judges between the end of world war ii and 1970 during the rise of unions workers incomes rose with productivity income inequality declined and north america became home to the largest middle class in history after 1970 and the chamber effort to implement the powell manifesto unions declined and workers wages stagnated virtually all new income and profits went to ceos stockholders and the already rich the middle class dwindled as income inequality rose to gilded age levels this occurred at the same time that corporations expanded becoming massive multinationals with facilities sprawled across the world and without allegiance to any country this happened to inco vale a brazilian corporation bought it in 2006 and now vale is a true multinational with facilities worldwide multinationals spurned their obligation to serve workers consumers communities and shareholders instead they focused only on shareholders the rest be damned they closed factories in the united states and canada and moved them to places like mexico and china with low wages and lax environmental laws they exploited foreign workers and destroyed north american workers lives and communities as far back as the 1970s the usw the afl cio as well as the textile shoe steel and other industry leaders warned congress about what this trend combined with increasing imports meant for american workers and their neighborhoods in 1973 after the united states experienced its first two years of trade deficits in a century i w abel then president of the usw urged congress to slow the massive flood of imports that are sweeping away jobs and industries in wholesale lots congress failure to heed this alarm resulted in the collapse of the u s textile and shoe industries and many others it very nearly killed the steel industry which has suffered tsunami after tsunami of bankruptcies gunpoint mergers and mill closures tens of thousands of family supporting jobs were lost and communities across both the united states and canada hollowed out in 1971 and 1972 the trade deficit totaled 8 4 billion last year it was 621 billion every imported toy shoe bolt of cloth and ingot of steel means fewer u s factories and jobs and more struggling towns the usw presidents who followed abel lloyd mcbride and lynn r williams escalated the battle against offshored factories and unfairly traded imports the usw even filed suit to try to stop the north american free trade agreement nafta because williams like independent presidential candidate ross perot saw that it would suck canadian and u s factories and jobs south of the mexican border the late usw president george becker and i agitated for change confronting and cajoling presidents and prime ministers and members of congress and parliament the usw martialed all of its forces including activists in its women of steel and nextgen programs the steelworkers organization of active retirees and its rapid response coordinators tens of thousands of workers rallied camped out in washington d c harangued lawmakers and sent postcards working with allies in the community such as environmental and human rights groups faith and food safety organizations together we have won some short term relief measures these include the tariffs on imported steel and aluminum imposed last year and the defeat of the proposed new trade deal the trans pacific partnership that would have extended nafta problems across pacific rim countries in the decades that the usw battled bad trade i moved through the ranks from staff representative to district director to canadian national director to usw secretary treasurer among my goals was to forge international workers alliances to combat the corporate cabals that always got seats at the table to write the trade deals that worked against workers when i was elected usw president in 2001 one of my top priorities was expanding the union s coalitions now the usw participates in three global unions which together represent more than 82 million workers in more than 150 countries worldwide the usw and partner unions also created more than two dozen global councils of workers including those for workers at arcelormittal basf bridgestone dowdupont and gerdau these employers quickly learned that taking on workers at one factory meant taking on workers at all of their workplaces internationally in 2005 the usw and the mexican miners union known as los mineros formed a strategic alliance and the usw gave los mineros general secretary napoleon gomez sanctuary in canada when he was unjustly accused of wrongdoing by a mexican government intent on shutting him up after a mine disaster in 2008 the usw joined with unite the union the second largest union in the uk and ireland forming workers uniting to fight exploitation and injustice globally and the usw formed alliances with union federations in australia and brazil where the organization is known as the cut this international brotherhood and sisterhood stood with canadian mine and smelter workers for a year beginning in july 2009 during its first negotiations with the usw vale the brazilian corporation that bought inco demanded harsh concessions from its thousands of canadian workers though vale was highly profitable it said it wouldn t even bargain with the usw unless the workers first accepted the cuts that forced them out on strike i started talking regularly with the head of the cut in brazil to strategize and plan joint actions brazilian workers and community groups wholeheartedly supported their canadian brothers and sisters they demonstrated in front of the vale headquarters and threw red paint symbolizing blood on the building they shut down traffic with all sorts of street actions they protested at the vale shareholders meeting inside and out they also traveled to canada in force with flags for a rally in sudbury in march of 2010 when the strike was eight months old and banks were repossessing some workers cars and foreclosing on homes by then vale had 100 000 workers in mines and smelters across the world supporters from many of those communities in asia africa europe and australia joined thousands of canadians who marched through the streets that cold day vale could see that its canadian workers in sudbury port colborne and voisey s bay were not alone they had allies from around the world willing to stand up to the giant multinational the strike ended 12 long months after it started we didn t get everything we wanted but we certainly didn t accept vale s concessionary demands vale failed to accomplish its mission which was to spread to all of its operations worldwide the authoritarian top down nasty management practices that it had honed in brazil the proof of that is the next round of negotiations with vale went fairly well and we got an honorable settlement now for labor to secure gains in the united states or canada or anywhere workers must mobilize we have to bring everyone together women men poor people people of color gay people all working people none of us is big enough or developed enough to win this fight alone if we fight together i can t guarantee we will win but if we don t fight for justice i can guarantee we will lose

h ross perot famously had a way with words that galvanized ordinary americans and helped him become the most successful third party candidate since 1912 he hurled one of his most well known lines during a 1992 debate with bill clinton and george h w bush when he assailed the north american free trade agreement which had just been tentatively agreed to by canada the u s and mexico he predicted americans would soon hear a giant sucking sound as production operations and factories packed up in the united states and moved to mexico perot said something similar a year later in a debate with vice president al gore the most high profile in a series of debates on the trade pact a few of which i participated in as an adviser to key democratic leaders in congress who opposed it economists business leaders clinton and most republicans dismissed perot s worries as overblown despite the fact that most had never read the agreement they argued free trade would create jobs period over the objections of perot most democrats in the house and other critics like me nafta was ratified and went into effect on jan 1 1994 a quarter century later another populist billionaire is promoting an updated expanded and renamed nafta which he rebranded as the united states mexico canada agreement in an effort to avoid any association with the giant sucking sounds many americans experienced from free trade as it turns out perot who died on july 9 had a point his projections were often fanciful but his warning turned out to be prescient perot s warning you implement that nafta the mexican trade agreement where they pay people a dollar an hour have no health care no retirement no pollution controls perot said during the second presidential debate in october 1992 and you re going to hear a giant sucking sound of jobs being pulled out of this country the response to that remark was fierce and immediate economists argued he was dead wrong as they sang the praises of free trade perot s warning however resonated with workers unions environmentalists and people in manufacturing towns across the country helping him earn 20 million votes or about 19 of the total after clinton became president he took over the ratification of nafta and managed to add a side agreement with language for labor rights and the environment to bolster support from some democrats in congress when he finally signed it into law in december 1993 he declared nafta will tear down trade barriers between our three nations and create 200 000 jobs in the u s by 1995 alone he was emphatic that the agreement would become a force for social progress as well as economic growth perot s vindication it didn t quite turn out that way scholars and policymakers often disagree about the impact that nafta has had on economic growth and job generation in the u s that impact they say is not always easy to disentangle from other economic social and political factors that have influenced u s growth it is true that leaders of all three countries did tear down trade barriers and insert effective protections for corporations and investment but critics like perot were right and clinton was wrong about the warning on jobs the economic policy institute a left leaning think tank concluded that the u s lost about 850 000 jobs from 1993 to 2013 as a result of nafta and that number has undoubtedly risen and the social progress as well as economic growth in relation to the agreement never seemed to appear despite strong productivity growth in u s and mexican manufacturing real wages sank by 17 in mexico from 1994 to 2011 and slid in the u s as well in key manufacturing industries such as the auto industry nafta has had a clear impact global auto producers built 11 new assembly plants in north america from 2009 to 2017 all but three were sited in mexico even though they all primarily made vehicles for the u s market as a result mexican employment in the sector has soared while american auto jobs have declined last year mexico had almost the same number of people working in its motor vehicle industry as the u s did with about 800 000 in each country mexican employment in this sector has almost doubled since 2007 while u s employment has slightly slipped an even more significant impact has been pushing down on u s manufacturing wages as a result of suppressed wages in mexico due largely to a lack of independent unions in the export sector with the threat of shifting production to mexico a factor real autoworker wages in the u s plummeted 26 from 2002 to 2013 and have stagnated since ultimately it s not just manufacturing workers who are affected by the sucking sound families and entire communities can be devastated when a worker loses a job as a result the usmca and perot s legacy so will the new nafta the united states mexico canada agreement end the sucking of jobs south not likely mexico has a new reform minded president but the obstacles are daunting they include powerful and often corrupt company unions in mexico who profit off the status quo and employers who have become accustomed to rock bottom wages what americans need is trade between the u s and mexico that benefits people in both countries to do that labor rights need to be harmonized to the best standards in north america not slide to the lowest workers and communities throughout north america should be the beneficiaries of expanded trade not its victims while mexico has pledged and passed positive labor reforms it doesn t have the capacity to implement them an important lesson from nafta is promises often evaporate once a deal goes into effect the original nafta included similar promises but failed to deliver americans have heard enough of perot s giant sucking sound over the last 25 years what they need now is broadly shared prosperity i m sure that will sound a lot better to the ear
by yawen chen and kevin yao beijing reuters china s exports fell in june as the united states ramped up trade pressure while imports shrank more than expected pointing to further weakness in the world s second largest economy and slackening global growth the gloomy trade readings added to a string of recent downbeat economic data which have fueled expectations that beijing needs to announce more stimulus measures soon to ward off a sharper slowdown china is expected to report on monday that growth in the second quarter was the weakest in at least 27 years other data released on friday showed new bank loans rose to a three month high in june as policymakers sought to keep ample funds in the financial system though the tally was less than analysts had expected overall imports and exports are declining quarter by quarter and weak foreign demand will be the biggest challenge in the second half of this year said zhang yi chief economist at zhonghai shengrong capital management in beijing short term policy stimulus should be brought forward china s manufacturers are struggling with sluggish demand at home and abroad and a sharp u s tariff hike announced in may threatens to crush already thin profit margins an official june survey showed factories were shedding jobs at the fastest pace since the global crisis a major worry for beijing june exports fell 1 3 from a year earlier not as much as the 2 drop analysts had expected but reversing a surprise gain in may when shippers rushed to beat more u s tariffs customs data showed imports fell 7 3 a sharper drop than the 4 5 expected and following a 8 5 contraction in may suggesting domestic demand remains tepid despite a flurry of growth measures since last year that left china with a trade surplus of 50 98 billion last month compared with a 41 66 billion surplus in may we don t expect global growth to bottom out until next year and while the truce reached between presidents trump and xi at the g20 late last month removes the immediate threat of further u s tariffs our base case remains that trade talks will break down again before long capital economics wrote story continues highlighting industrial weakness china s imports of copper used in electrical gear from wiring to motors plunged 27 from a year earlier imports of other key commodities such as iron ore crude oil coal and soybeans also fell from a month earlier copper demand is still weakening for most of the sectors especially air conditioning said he tianyu an analyst at consultancy cru in shanghai the trade war could be one of the factors but the bigger problem is actually china s domestic demand this summer is weaker than last year economy still losing steam so far beijing has relied on a combination of fiscal stimulus and monetary easing to weather the slowdown including hundreds of billions of dollars in infrastructure spending and tax cuts for companies the central bank has also slashed banks reserve requirements six times since early 2018 freeing up more money to lend with more cuts expected in coming quarters some analysts believe it could also trim short term borrowing rates if the u s federal reserve eases policy later this month but the economy has been slow to respond and business confidence remains shaky weighing on investment policy easing is still nudging up broad credit growth capital economics wrote in a note but the pick up in lending has been modest relative to previous loosening cycles and is unlikely to prevent economic growth from slowing further in the coming quarters the note said chinese banks made 1 66 trillion yuan 241 47 billion in new loans last month but the figure was less than the same month last year china s economic growth is expected to slow to a near 30 year low of 6 2 this year from 6 6 in 2018 a reuters poll showed on wednesday growth next year will likely cool further to 6 0 the poll showed and some analysts say it could be even weaker if trade talks blow up again and washington imposes more tariffs on goods and restrictions on chinese technology companies china s overall hi tech imports slipped 6 0 in june on year the eighth consecutive month of decline according to anz awaiting next round of talks june marked the first full month of higher u s tariffs on 200 billion of chinese goods which washington imposed after trade talks between the world s largest economies broke down though the countries leaders agreed in late june to resume negotiations and the u s said it would hold off on additional levies existing tariffs remain in place producing a long slow burn for the chinese economy according to ing some exporters which lowered prices for u s customers after earlier tariffs have reportedly said they cannot absorb the new stiffer levies and still make money no timeframe has been set for a new round of face to face trade talks and the two sides remain at odds over significant issues raising the risk of a longer and costlier battle that could trigger a global recession china s trade surplus with the united states a major source of friction rose 11 in june from may to 29 92 billion for the first half the surplus with the u s rose around 5 to 140 48 billion from the same period a year earlier china s exports to u s fell 7 8 in june on year while its imports from america plunged 31 4 reporting by yawen chen kevin yao huizhong wu se young

home search ich the five stages of collapse by dmitry orlov july 12 2019 it s been a while since i ran a guest post due to a lack of good candidates but this article by user h_h from zerohedge caught my eye it uses my book the five stages of collapse as a jumping point and nicely outlines the case studies i used to examine each stage of collapse stage 1 financial collapse faith in business as usual is lost in the case of financial collapse the example is iceland the only country so far that had successfully fought off international efforts to saddle its people with the debts incurred by its defunct private banks allowing it to recover economically even as the us and the eu which bailed out their failed banks continue to sink deeper and deeper stage 2 commercial collapse faith that the market shall provide is lost commercial collapse is shown as seen through the eyes of the russian mafia and criminal syndicates explaining how the free market in order to be able to operate requires at the very least a protection racket be it the mafia or the government for those brought up on the pablum of nonviolence this case study offers a useful lesson on the constructive uses of violence stage 3 political collapse faith that the government will take care of you is lost political collapse as a steady state condition is described through the example of the pashtuns one of the world s largest ethnic groups inhabiting parts of afghanistan and pakistan whose code of honor pashtunwali or the pashtun way has allowed them to fight off and in some cases help destroy every empire that ever blundered into their habitat they are known to the consumers of western propaganda primarily as the taleban the pashtuns allow us to clearly see the dividing line between a hierarchical imperialist collapse bound society and that of a steady state entrenched well organized anarchy stage 4 social collapse faith that your people will take care of you is lost social collapse or rather a very stable lack thereof is studied with reference to the roma or gypsies who have survived intact over many centuries and who now number in the millions both in europe and the us in spite of being shut out financially commercially and politically in every country they inhabit this case study allows us to ponder what it means to be marginalized for to be marginalized by a collapse bound society can be a blessing in disguise stage 5 cultural collapse faith in the goodness of humanity is lost cultural collapse is explored with the help of the ik an african tribe of hunter gatherers who once they were prevented from hunting and gathering survived by mutating into a cultural form that we may not wish to recognize as human yet they persist the ik allow us to explore an important question is survival at all cost really worth it the article s author claims that the scenario he describes has something to do with what he calls full retard collectivism this is incongruous for at least three good reasons are you tired of the lies and non stop propaganda get your free daily newsletter july 12 2019 information clearing house it s been a while since i ran a guest post due to a lack of good candidates but this article by user h_h from zerohedge caught my eye it uses my book the five stages of collapse as a jumping point and nicely outlines the case studies i used to examine each stage of collapse the article s author claims that the scenario he describes has something to do with what he calls full retard collectivism this is incongruous for at least three good reasons 1 collectivism is a higher form of culture exhibited by tight knit groups that share a common ideology or faith possess a great deal of solidarity or ésprit de corps and have it within their cultural dna to put the interests of the community ahead of those of the individual all the way to suicidal altruism if the conditions warrant does that describe the us no it doesn t americans primary allegiance is not to each other but to little green pieces of paper with pictures of dead presidents on them under such conditions sudden spontaneous appearance of a wellspring of collectivism is unlikely what is likely is that mutual self help will be limited to some amount of charity and a few acts of altruism based on personal sympathy 2 the us is running against a number of physical or organic limitations that no amount of regulation compensation or social engineering can possibly overcome the energy returned on energy invested is dropping to levels where an industrial society can no longer be maintained making the common living arrangement unaffordable for most the effect of forcing together organically incompatible ethnic groups breeds alienation hostility and violence making basic social adequacy something of a stretch goal these are predicaments rather than problems to solve and what one does with predicaments is accept their consequences with equanimity and poise 3 the us can be described as a single highly integrated systemically corrupt scheme to say that there is some corruption in the us would be like saying that a huge termite colony has a slight termite infestation problem everywhere you look be it finance the military industrial complex education medicine the legal system the private prison system agriculture and food production you see a corrupt predatory scheme that has been enshrined and indoctrinated as the proper way to get things done the intelligence community fabricates fake threats for the military industrial complex corporate lobbyists and congressional pork barrel politics micromanage the economy food that makes people obese and sick provides profits for both the agribusiness and the medical industry the police and the courts stock the private prison system with slave labor systemic corruption at this level cannot be reformed again that would be like asking an exterminator to improve conditions at a termite mound that said the article goes on to describe what these five stages will look like for some unlucky colorado residents and the picture it paints seems realistic so i now turn it over to zerohedge user h_h rather than using iceland the russian mafia the pashtuns the roma and the ik i will use one hypothetical zerohedge reader as our space monkey in fact let s refer to him as mr_monkey we will pretend that the monkey family lives in a suburb of denver highlands ranch in a typical single family monkey house on paper street mr and mrs_monkey have two lil_monkeys and their extended families live far away on the left and other left coast respectively mr_monkey designs training software applications for lockheed martin and mrs_m operates a day care in the basement of their suburban home stage 1 financial collapse faith in business as usual is lost government s deficit spending for eternal war and vote buying has finally caused the usd to lose its reserve currency status and all of those trillions of dollars exported over the past 50 years come flooding back to amerika dramatically increasing the local supply of us dollars decreasing the value of each dollar and increasing the price of everything mr_monkey needs or wants to buy this is called hyperinflation stage 2 commercial collapse faith that the market shall provide is lost gasoline is now rarely available at gas stations due to multiple failures within the just in time delivery system when gasoline is available it costs more to fill up than mr_monkey earns in a month fortunately mr_monkey is allowed to work from home but so are most other people still working and therefore mrs_monkey s daycare business collapses as parents stay home with their children mr_monkey spends a good portion of many days riding his bicycle to obtain a couple gallons of gasoline from fuel thieves that trade with him for pieces of silverware that mrs_monkey received when they were married the fuel thieves will not accept the constantly depreciating dollars stage 3 political collapse faith that the government will take care of you is lost mr_monkey learns that his job as a training software designer at lockheed martin has been realigned with the company s new five year plan due to his four years in the navy as a cyber security technician he is offered a security position at the company s waterton canyon facility which is about 15 miles away he is happy to hear that he will receive weekly raises that he is assured will keep up with the government s official inflation rate mr_monkey will not be allowed to telecommute but he tells mrs_monkey that the exercise he will get by riding his bike will do him some good when he arrives the first day he is issued a pistol and a yellow reflective vest and is sent to guard the entrance to a parking lot surrounded by chain link fence and concertina wire on his bicycle ride home at the end of the day he leaves the vest but takes the pistol in the couple of hours riding home he hears more than ten gunshots and passes by hundreds of families camped in the state park stage 4 social collapse faith that your people will take care of you is lost after a couple weeks of spending most of the day hunkered down in the basement with the lil_monkeys and their diminishing supply of food and toiletries left over from the daycare business tonight mrs_monkey is starting to really worry it is now well past dark the power is out again and mr_monkey has yet to return home with his pistol she can hear bits and pieces of what sounds like two of her neighbors involved in a serious argument out in the street all of the sudden she hears a window explode upstairs both of the lil_monkeys start crying mrs_monkey grips her 9 iron with both hands while holding the flashlight in her mouth tears are running down her cheeks but she isn t sad she is pissed off stage 5 cultural collapse faith in the goodness of humanity is lost mr_monkey is sitting alone by a small fire in the snow cooking lean meat on a hillside overlooking a long empty red rocks amphitheater he recalls hearing from his mom and dad about the time when they were dating in college and they had heard bruce springsteen and the e street band playing down there among a bunch of big rocks while touring to support their release darkness on the edge of town he recalls that grandpa_monkey had a newspaper clipping on his office wall the idea is to deliver what money can t buy bruce had said prior to the show mr_monkey is cold and shivering in the greasy snowmobile suit he has recently acquired he only has five rounds remaining for the pistol he promises himself that he will not use the last round on someone else as he had earlier that day when he had come across the skinny teenage boy asleep in the snowmobile suit nope no matter how hungry he gets he will save the last round for himself this may seem like bad news but there is some good news as well first the five stages of collapse is now easy to buy in australia via

all three of wall street s main indices popped to fresh records on friday ending the week on an emphatic note as investors grew increasingly confident the federal reserve will cut interest rates at the end of the month in congressional testimony this week federal reserve xhairman jerome powell told lawmakers crosscurrents increased risks to the us economic outlook strongly suggesting a rate cut was in the cards at the fed s next policy meeting in less than three weeks the broad based s p 500 closed above the 3 000 mark for the first time ever jack ablin of cresset wealth advisors said investors also were encouraged by the outlook for what could be a better than expected corporate revenues however with corporate earnings season set to begin in earnest s p 500 companies are forecast to see weaker profit growth compared to last year according to factset it would be the second consecutive quarter of slowing profit something that has not happened in three years but the next question we expect is where do we go from there he said the market needs to feed on something the appetite of the market for low rates is insatiable the question now is can they shift their attention to earnings while the positive sentiment initially filtered through to asia and europe on friday the momentum petered out in late european trading meanwhile china s economy grew at its slowest rate in nearly three decades in the second quarter hit by the us china trade war and weakening global demand according to an afp survey of analysts the world s second largest economy likely expanded 6 2 per cent in april june according to the poll of 10 economists ahead of the official gross domestic product report monday oil prices rise elsewhere geopolitical tensions rose after armed iranian boats threatened a british oil tanker earlier in the week provided support for oil prices although gains were limited by longer term oversupply concerns iran s menacing of the bp supertanker on wednesday appeared to be in retaliation for britain s seizure of the iranian grace 1 tanker off gibraltar on july 4 with iran seeking retribution for the uk s actions around gibraltar there is a distinct possibility that we could see an upside shock to prices said ig trading group analyst joshua mahony britain said it will send a second warship to the gulf while the pentagon said it was discussing military escorts for vessels in the gulf but the rises in oil prices as a result of the incident have been capped by an oversupplied oil market according to traders and the iea on friday said the recent decision by oil producing countries to prolong cuts in output will not fundamentally change the outlook for the market key figures around 2100 gmt new york dow up 0 9 per cent at 27 332 03 close new york s p 500 up 0 5 per cent at 3 013 77 close new york nasdaq up 0 6 per cent at 8 244 14 close london ftse 100 down less than 0 1 per cent at 7 505 97 points close paris cac 40 up 0 4 per cent at 5 572 86 close frankfurt dax 30 down less than 0 1 per cent at 12 323 32 close euro stoxx 50 flat at 3 497 63 close tokyo nikkei 225 up 0 2 per cent at 21 685 90 close hong kong hang seng up 0 1 per cent at 28 471 62 close shanghai composite up 0 4 per cent at 6 696 50 close euro dollar up at us 1 1270 from us 1 1255 at 2130 gmt pound dollar up at us 1 2576 from us 1 2526 dollar yen down at 107 89 yen from 108 45 yen brent north sea crude up 20 cents at us 66 72 per barrel west texas intermediate up 1 cent at us 60 21 per barrel afp
federal reserve chairman jerome powell might be willing to stand up to the white house but is reluctant to rock the boat on wall street in his congressional testimony on wednesday powell reaffirmed the strength of the u s economy but much of the focus was on the crosscurrents and challenges he cited characterizations market observers broadly interpreted as a signal that the central bank will cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point at its july meeting markets are fully expecting a rate cut at month end and powell did nothing to dissuade that said greg mcbride chief financial analyst at bankrate his comments today really reiterated a step a move closer towards more accommodative policy said charlie ripley senior investment strategist at allianz investment management in our view that s moving closer to the idea of these insurance rate cuts although he reiterated that the expectation of economic growth remains solid powell indicated that softer data raised fears of a slowdown since the fed s last statement in june it appears that uncertainties around trade tensions and concerns about the strength of the global economy continue to weigh on the u s economic outlook he said powell expressed concern about slower global growth trade issues brexit and the debt ceiling along with important longer run challenges like lagging labor force participation and productivity growth as well as the longer term effects of high and rising federal debt it sounds very dovish said zhiwei ren managing director and portfolio manager at penn mutual asset management they re trying to find a reason to cut they re trying to justify the cut you can see this rhetoric all over the statement his emphasis is always on the negatives he said despite a robust june employment report economists noted that powell s testimony largely dismissed this saying the fed is correct to look at data that reveals a less rosy picture nonfarm payrolls are slowing said dan north chief economist at euler hermes north america employment is a lagging indicator and they ve got to look forward he said adding that some economic data wasn t as positive as it first appeared the first quarter gdp report was pretty skewed by inventories and net exports he said trade also emerged as a major concern although the fed s june statement didn t mention the topic at all powell s testimony today mentioned it eight times you have tremendous uncertainty caused by the u s china trade conflict ren said business investment is a huge driver of economic growth he added but powell noted that this had dropped as of late a trend attributable to the unwillingness of companies to sink money into initiatives that could be undercut by soaring tariffs or disrupted supply chains analysts also said powell wanted to avoid injecting volatility into financial markets more generally since market expectations for a july rate cut are at 100 percent although not officially part of the fed s mandate experts said it had little choice but to deliver on this expectation there s been a tremendous amount of uncertainty particularly relating to the global trade front ripley said i would say at least at this point there will be a little bit more confidence in the market the stock market in particular is behaving like a kid who s throwing a temper tantrum mcbride said the market wants a rate cut and they want it now powell also responded to president donald trump s ongoing criticism of his leadership affirming the fed s autonomy and stressing more than once that the fed will always focus on doing the job that you have assigned us he dismissed the notion that emotion would play into any rate decision saying that monetary policy is guided by rational analytical data parsing it s reassuring to markets that powell is staunchly defending the fed s independence said mcbride any waffling on that could undermine the fed s credibility and be a risk to markets

this is a rush transcript copy may not be in its final form amy goodman this is democracy now i m amy goodman we end today s show in honduras to look at some of the root causes of the migration crisis and how it links to u s foreign policy honduras recently marked the 10th anniversary of the u s backed coup that ousted the democratically elected president manuel zelaya the coup was orchestrated by the honduran military business and political elite with the support of the obama administration since then extreme poverty and violence has skyrocketed in honduras tens of thousands of hondurans have been murdered including more than 300 lgbtq people about 60 journalists hundreds of peasant rights and environmental activists tens of thousands of refugees have also fled honduras most with the hope of receiving political asylum in the united states meanwhile mass protests are continuing to take place in honduras against the right wing government of juan orlando hernández and his plans to privatize healthcare pensions and education protesters have been met with violent repression from the honduran military and police last week we spoke with ousted honduran president manuel zelaya we reached him in tegucigalpa i spoke with him along with democracy now s juan gonzález i asked president zelaya about the 10th anniversary of the coup and the link between drug traffickers and government corruption manuel zelaya well look the coup d état inexorably it marks a new form of u s meddling in our society ten years ago john negroponte undersecretary of state and president george w bush warned me and threatened me when i was president of honduras saying that if had relations with hugo chávez then i would have problems with the united states six months after that warning i was removed from power and removed from this country the problem for the united states is that the friends of those who they consider their adversaries are not their friends they ve decided they re enemies of the united states quite simply because i was seeking better relations with the south bringing in oil from venezuela and getting financing for hydroelectric projects with president lula da silva who they are now holding prisoner in brazil so the policies of the united states towards this region changed and they made a mistake and i ll talk to you about the gangs the maras in just a moment to your question but if you think about the elite in the u s government well their view for this region is mistaken they want to go back to the 1980s which was marked by the cold war stigmatizing the opposition they ve created shock forces psychological war dirty war well if they think that they re going to be able to stop migration in this way well it s only going to worsen the gangs are a link in the drug trafficking business and they come about because there s no jobs there s an excess of poverty poverty is misery in honduras youth find no solution so organizations such as well then the drug trafficking organizations come on the scene and instead of creating more jobs the government brings more repression plus these are components of the dictatorship the united states is supporting they ve looted the country since the coup d état in these 10 years each year the united states through the international monetary fund has authorized 24 billion of additional debt each year so now we have approximately 14 billion debt when they removed me 10 years ago we only owed 3 billion today it s 14 billion so to uphold the dictatorship first they militarize the country then they drive the country into debt and they take out huge credits which they call sovereign bonds at huge interest rates and of every 100 lempiras 40 now go to the banks plus they loot the state institutions the levels of corruption are exorbitant they are abusive in every sense of the word they ve looted institutions such as social security which is where the retirement funds for the elderly are and where the moneys are to cover the illnesses that the mothers suffer they have looted these institutions in order to finance an unpopular anti democratic and dictatorial regime the united states doesn t talk about honduras because it s shameful they are ashamed to talk about what they re supporting in honduras and the only thing to do about it is to denounce it because there are murders there are death squads they ve exported what s called plan colombia to honduras the false positives where many opposition leaders such as berta cáceres to mention one or murillo at the time of the coup or another person who was asphyxiated a 24 year old who was asphyxiated by the gases all of these there s no way to describe these crimes over the last 10 years other than by calling them crimes against humanity and this country should be brought before the international criminal court because what u s policy is doing is supporting genocide in honduras and in central america juan gonzález president zelaya i would like to ask you about another country in the region about the role of mexico because many expected that when andrés manuel lópez obrador won the presidency in mexico that mexico would develop a more humane policy toward the refugees coming across its borders what s your assessment of the first year or the first several months of amlo s presidency in relationship to your country and your situation manuel zelaya well look andrés manuel lópez obrador i consider him to be a profoundly human man with values that are in line with great moral principles for the region and for mexico and for central america he has had a very clear position vis à vis the united states i believe that mr trump s pressures against mexico are serious when they threaten to impose tariffs on mexican merchandise well that produces more migrants more migration and more poverty in our region so the policies of mr andrés manuel lópez obrador are practically being punished by the united states in focusing on migration they re going to look for some solution to the system that is provoking the migrants because everyone talks about migration but the causes of migration are the u s policies the imf policies the policies of the southern command for this region are provoking more and more migrants with each passing day so militarizing central america militarizing honduras means that that escape valve that the honduran people have had which is to be able to get work in the united states and the honduran people haven t even looked for jobs in the united states it is the u s businesses u s businesses for example have large crops and cannot pay a u s person to work in the countryside they give the travel expenses to the family members of those who are their employees and that is why there s massive migration to work in the united states they might work six months or a year and then go back and then return migration is a human process seeking to find solutions when they militarize the border what they are going to provoke here will be greater convulsions greater explosions and the honduran people you ve seen this in media reports the honduran people are in the streets and they re protesting and they re not protesting because we the opposition tell them to protest nobody goes out to protest because some politician tells them to do so maybe there would be a group of a hundred people in that context but here it s thousands of people in different parts of the country engaged in massive protests peaceful protests they do not use weapons at most the protesters might mobilize in the streets making traffic difficult bringing transportation to a halt but those expressions of migration shows that poverty has worsened the debt has gone up and people are in the streets protesting because the cost of electricity the cost of transportation the cost of fuel almost everything has been privatized in honduras so that should be evidence that this which is a model for neoliberal capitalism everything is turned into a business for a small group and for the rest there s no solution it s a failure of mr donald trump in central america and then drug trafficking increases no one wants to say so but drug trafficking increased after the coup d état because the drug traffickers when they see a country that they can control through an authoritarian system well they immediately get involved here they ve found the military and the police so democracy is the way forward for honduras and central america the united states should learn to live with democracy and not be creating repressive policies against us we have the same right that they do to be able to make a living and live in freedom amy goodman you have the current president of honduras juan orlando hernández investigated by the u s government for drug trafficking and his brother tony hernández actually arrested for cocaine trafficking he was arrested in miami he s currently awaiting trial in this country how does what does this mean for the people of honduras i mean this is under the trump administration that supports the current president hernández manuel zelaya well there s only one way to read this the united states is protecting its dictator here and mistakenly they think that benefits the government of donald trump donald trump might win re election in the united states if the world sees that he is taking measures in favor of democracy in honduras rather than in favor of the dictatorship as he is doing now drug trafficking is a measure of that drug trafficking is managed by the dea the dea knows of each shipment that comes out of venezuela and colombia the deaknows about it and some pass through without any problem and others are stopped so there is not a fight against drug trafficking there is a fight against cartels there are some cartels that are fought and others they let them go they know the implications of drug trafficking here nonetheless justice is selective they take action against some and protect the others i think the president is protected by the united states juan gonzález ten years ago before the coup against you throughout latin america there were progressive governments trying to change the social conditions of their people and we ve seen this enormous change in brazil in your country in argentina in the attacks on the government in venezuela what is your sense of what is happening in latin america today in terms of the movements of peoples for greater social equality manuel zelaya well there were some statements recently made by a u s senator that triumph in socialism was seen that it could set a bad example for the united states because it could even impact domestic politics in the united states they could not allow socialism modern socialism i would say because this is a socialism that is different than the socialism one found in europe during the cold war this is a socialism that accepts capital not capitalism but capital it accepts private enterprise not control by capitalism of the state because we understand the concept of popular sovereignty where sovereignty resides in the people power does not reside in a military or economic elite as under the neoliberal model so of course for the united states which has internal opposition because internally in the united states there s begun to be talk of democratic socialism i have heard democratic party candidates talking about democratic socialism that is why the policy of the united states towards our region has changed and in brazil they went after dilma rousseff with a technical coup d état because of socialist agreements with the people of honduras and others in the region and the right won the elections because lula was in prison they would not have done so if lula were free and now the united states not only trains military but also judges because they re using the justice system as a tool for political purposes amy goodman president zelaya what is your assessment of president trump and what he s doing along the border manuel zelaya i don t know if that brings him any electoral benefit but i consider it to be an absurd action in a globalized world in which for the last three decades we ve been talking about free trade talking about competition and competitiveness as part and parcel of the development of capitalism and now he has come up putting a halt to globalization so trump is like a negation of the historic process he is a setback in almost every sense so in a conservative society such as the united states that can bring him electoral benefits but in the eyes of the world he is behaving like a white supremacist with no human sensitivity as one would require in the 21st century because migration well migration is a right not a crime and the migration of the poor northward is bad but migration of the investor southward is good the investors come to take over the natural resources to take over like an oligopoly and they further impoverish our countries and that impoverishment produces migration and the increase in drug trafficking and so on and so forth so i see that mr donald trump s policies with the republican party represent a setback when it comes to having good neighbor relations with latin america amy goodman president trump cut off all aid to the northern triangle countries to el salvador to guatemala and to your country honduras this is very interesting considering he supports juan orlando hernández the president now he s backed off cutting that aid but threatens to do so if the immigrant flow continues do you think president hernández would fall without that u s aid manuel zelaya we don t need the help of the united states the united states gives very little assistance what the united states wants is to exercise economic control over the structures of the macroeconomy worldwide for example the world bank gives honduras some 150 million a year 150 million the inter american development bank a similar sum so all told we might get about 240 million and that is controlled by the united states and it also has a specific weight in our region the imf authorizes a letter that is signed every year so that honduras can go into debt at very high interest rates because it is a government that is allied with the united states what that provokes in our region is clear i think i think it s evident what it causes in our region i believe that that relationship where they say they re going to cut the assistance has almost no effect let me put it in clearer terms honduran migrants send to honduras about 4 billion a year let me repeat this amy 4 billion a year and the united states together with the world bank and the idb sends 200 million so honduras should be concerned and the current president has no dignity we should be able to speak to the americans on equal conditions with reciprocity and dignity but he doesn t protest because an immigration treaty we had with the united states was canceled we had an immigration treaty it was renewed every year indeed i had good relations with the united states the u s and european oil companies don t accept competition but they respected me and every year they renewed tps every year they renewed the millennium account but this year they have not renewed a single penny of the millennium account but of course the policy is threatening that aid well the u s aid from the standpoint of hegemonic control of capitalism through the transnational corporations through businesses through the control of the southern command over security and the imf over the economy and the oas the oas has supported or made an internal effort on the justice system through the maccih so if the justice system is controlled by the oas and if the u s and monetary fund and idb control the economy and security is controlled by the southern command then well then what does honduras run it s all based on u s policy and on the interference and meddling of the united states in honduras we should simply reach agreement because the united states is a strong neighbor it s the biggest military and technological power in the world it s not that we re going to be the same as the united states but we should not be a vassal of the united states we are a small country but with the same dignity as the europeans and the u s have amy goodman former honduran president manuel zelaya he was ousted in a u s backed coup in 2009 to see the interview in spanish visit democracynow org es to see all our coverage of honduras go to

what i m suggesting in other words is that gold standard advocacy is a lot like climate change denial there are big personal and financial rewards for an expert willing to say what a few billionaires want to hear precisely because no serious expert agrees in the climate arena we know that essentially all climate deniers are on the fossil fuel take there may be some true believers in the monetary magic of gold but it s hard to tell what we do know is that prominent goldbugs do very well relative to where their careers would be if they didn t buy into this particular area of derp
before going to the white house donald trump demanded that the fed raise interest rates despite high unemployment and low inflation now he s demanding rate cuts even though the unemployment rate is much lower and inflation at least a bit higher to be fair there is a real economic argument for rate cuts as insurance against a possible slowdown but it s clear that trump s motives are and always have been purely political he wanted the fed to hurt president obama and now he wants it to boost his own reelection chances it s not surprising then that trump is also trying to stuff the federal reserve board with political allies what may seem surprising is that many of his would be appointees like stephen moore and now judy shelton have long records of supporting the gold standard or something like it this should put them at odds with his efforts to politicize the fed after all one of the supposed points of a gold standard is to remove any hint of politics from monetary policy and with gold prices rising lately gold standard advocates should be calling for the fed to raise rates not lower them but of course both moore and shelton have endorsed trump s demand for rate cuts this creates a dual puzzle why does trump want these people and why are they so willing to cater to his wishes well i think there s a simple answer to both sides of the puzzle which involves the reason some economic commentators not sure if they deserve to be called economists become goldbugs in the first place what i d suggest is that it usually has less to do with conviction than with cynical careerism and this in turn means that goldbugs are in general the kind of people who can be counted on to do trump s bidding never mind what they may have said in the past
washington ap in a shift from just a few months ago federal reserve chairman jerome powell is worried that too low inflation could persist for a while and undercut the u s economy powell s concern is a key reason why the fed will likely cut short term interest rates late this month for the first time in a decade a rate cut and especially if it s followed by others could help lift inflation closer to the fed s target level the chairman s newly expressed worries about chronically low inflation reflect another sea change at the fed powell and other officials seem to have jettisoned a long standing economic rule of thumb that a long streak of low unemployment will inevitably raise inflation too high the u s unemployment rate has remained under 5 for roughly three years and yet annual inflation has consistently failed to reach the fed s 2 target all of which suggests that the fed is now prepared to keep borrowing costs low for households and businesses indefinitely even if the job market and the economy keep growing steadily it s a prospect that has delighted investors who have lifted stock indexes to record highs the connection between the level of unemployment and inflation was very strong if you go back 50 years and it s gotten weaker and weaker and weaker to the point where it s a faint heartbeat powell testified on capitol hill this week in response to questions from rep alexandria ocasio cortez a new york democrat we really have learned that the economy can sustain much lower unemployment than we thought without troubling levels of inflation kathy bostjancic an economist at oxford economics a consulting firm said powell s comments marked a sharp turnaround from last year the fed had justified its four rate hikes in 2018 in part by arguing that robust hiring would eventually ignite inflation there s been a big shift in their thinking bostjancic said the fed s been slow to this idea typically in the past when unemployment has fallen very low such as to the current 3 7 employers are compelled to offer higher pay to attract and keep workers these employers in turn raise prices to offset the cost of their higher wages yet that dynamic which economists call the phillips curve has yet to kick in during the decade long expansion consumer inflation in june for example was up just 1 6 in june compared with 12 months earlier below the fed s target most americans of course prefer low prices but the fed has reasons to worry when inflation stays consistently below its target level their biggest concern is that when businesses and consumers expect ultra low inflation to remain in place they factor it into decisions such as how much they re willing to spend or raise pay why spend or pay more now if prices aren t likely to rise and might even fall once such low expectations become entrenched powell warned in congressional testimony wednesday they re difficult to dislodge central banks in japan and europe have cut their interest rates into negative territory meaning that holders of government bonds actually lose money in desperate efforts to accelerate growth and prices you don t want to get behind the curve and let inflation drop below 2 powell said wednesday before the senate banking committee the second of two days of testimony yet according to the fed s preferred inflation gauge it has been below 2 for nearly the entire seven years since the central bank chose that target as recently as a may 1 news conference powell had characterized lower inflation since the start of the year as merely transitory blaming trends such as a drop in clothing prices but in his congressional testimony this week he acknowledged a risk that weak inflation will be even more persistent than we anticipate economists point to a range of factors that are holding inflation to ultra low levels globalization has enabled the production of many goods in low wage countries thereby lowering costs the so called amazon effect of online shopping which allows real time across the board price comparisons has made it difficult for retailers to charge more fewer workers belong to unions and so have less bargaining power to seek higher pay and by some measures the u s workforce is on average less efficient growth in productivity which measures output per hour worked has remained notoriously weak during the expansion that has given companies less incentive to raise pay powell and other fed officials have expressed hope that a rate cut will make it cheaper to borrow and buy a home or car or make other purchases and thereby speed the economy faster economic growth could nudge inflation up at least slightly higher inflation does offer some benefits it helps grease the wheels of the economy people are more likely to buy something if they fear it will cost more later companies are more likely to raise pay to keep up with higher prices which makes it easier to pay off debts still further fed rate cuts do carry risks a few fed officials warned at its last meeting in june that a rate cut could help fuel a bubble in the stock market that s because lower interest rates would likely lead more and more investors to abandon low yielding bonds and seek higher returns in stocks but overall there is rare bipartisan agreement about the need for the fed to lower its benchmark rate larry kudlow a top white house economic adviser praised ocasio cortez on fox news channel s fox friends for challenging powell on the fed s long held belief that low unemployment would accelerate inflation i got to give the hats off ms aoc kind of nailed that kudlow conceded
compassionate capitalism a better name for what nordic countries practice it is certainly true that sweden finland norway and denmark have notable economic successes it is certainly false that they have been achieved through socialism nordic countries focus on combining a free market system with several social programs this nexus gives way to programs such as free education free health care and a guaranteed pension program for retirees for this to take place the citizens must place an enormous amount of trust in their government and their policymakers the economy work and welfare must work hand in hand policymakers must address ever changing social challenges and then pass solutions through a democratic process many different derivations of socialism places like sweden and norway have cut the gap between the rich and the poor while still preserving the basic benefits of capitalism this type of capitalist model is reliant upon creative destruction a term coined by joseph schumpeter in 1942 the process of industrial mutation that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within incessantly destroying the old one incessantly creating a new one nordic nations seem to flawlessly use this system and progressives continue to say this is socialism my policies most closely resemble what we see in the uk in norway in finland in sweden rep alexandria ocasio cortez told 60 minutes but where does it fall under american standards can we learn anything from this derivation of socialism there is a lot behind the nordic model and a lot more behind why it so greatly praised capitalism is a dynamic system constantly changing and evolving because of opportunities for profit and property this ideal seamlessly fits with many other economic systems that naturally evolve much like the nordic model progressives like to believe that america is in need of such an economic evolution the poor are so far away from the rich that socialism of all things is a necessity americans we re told need equality across all sectors all markets and all classes economic models frankly schumpeter did not have equilibrium in mind when he philosophized creative destruction instead he wished for a paradigm where inventors and entrepreneurs would improve creating a type of disequilibrium that would actually benefit the constituents of the system a socialist ideal where all are equal on all grounds was not the backbone of creative destruction nor that of any nordic model nor that of any common sense economy why would anyone want to kill the goose that lays the golden egg but there are myriad other differences that the nordic model holds when compared to socialism the government benefits didn t create the wealth of these nations the wealth of the populous created the government benefits first the beginning nordic nations developed their current economic system after years of a free economy with free trade they would be nothing without this foundation the wealth previously created allowed the government to begin its social programs by imposing high tax rates never should the government begin with extensively high rates and expect its citizens to keep pace the economist magazine describes the nordic countries as stout free traders who resist the temptation to intervene even to protect iconic companies does this sound like socialism certainly not what s more both norway and denmark are easier places to do business than the united states according to doingbusiness org the government benefits didn t create the wealth of these nations the wealth of the populous created the government benefits government interference second government interference a staple of labor laws in the us is not found in nordic governances a minimum wage set by the federal government does not exist in nordic or scandinavian nations and yet they still survive unions and organizers help to set wages but the government does not get involved in the negotiation process this decentralized system is arguably the best way to do things businesses are free to pay less for unskilled work apprenticeships internships and unskilled workers samoa did not need the minimum wage politicians simply wanted to feel good about their actions and not look at the consequences having a minimum wage is almost suicide for small businesses they cannot hire the workers they need because they are not making enough profit so those businesses will continue to stay small the minimum wage makes it difficult for a business to grow for example us politicians recently enacted our minimum wage on all of the us territories including american samoa in samoa the largest employers on the island were tuna canner factories once the minimum wage was enacted it destroyed the competition on the island the factories closed down and the unemployment rate skyrocketed samoa did not need the minimum wage politicians simply wanted to feel good about their actions and not look at the consequences the lack of government involvement allows for people to be paid according to their worth not by what big brother deems their worth to be education third education the nordic economy is the ultimate zip codes should not define a child s future supporter while education is free the choices citizens have are impeccable this could be because it is extremely similar to the libertarian point of view as defined by economist milton friedman in his 1955 essay the role of government in education nordic governments gift their citizens with voucher like education coupons these vouchers can be redeemed for schooling anywhere whether public schools government run charter schools or private schools according to the institute for the study of labor this privatization of schooling improved average educational performance both at the end of compulsory school and in the long run in terms of high school grades university attendance and years of schooling this school choice benefits the citizens children and the future of the nations just as turning point usa promotes school choice so do nordic and scandinavian nations socialists however are not the ones promoting free choice sweden s economic growth fell to one percent lower than the rest of europe and two percent lower than america lastly how it evolved nordic nations have not always been so progressive in fact they are beginning to take a step back until the 1950s nordic countries were the top free market competition based nations in the world in the 1970s however intense social government and regulatory systems were put in place with high tax rates all of the economic growth came to a sad end for example sweden s economic growth fell to one percent lower than the rest of europe and two percent lower than america by the 1990s government spending was up to 70 percent of gdp and the debt to gdp ratio accumulated to 80 percent even the unemployment rate rose five percent as soon as policymakers saw this socialist makeover gone wrong things changed in 1991 legislatures privatized parts of health care introduced schooling vouchers and cut back on money wasting welfare programs between 1995 and 2000 the debt to gdp ratio was cut by 40 percent and citizens earned more income thanks to the new 28 percent income tax inflation and taxes in fact that tax was lowered to 22 percent in 2013 so countries like sweden took an extremely progressive stance realized it didn t work then converted to an even more free market philosophy why make the us learn for itself that socialism doesn t work when we can simply trust sweden s experiment the lesson learned is not what the left teaches due to deregulation sweden has actually exceeded economic growth compared to all other european peers by at least one percent per year this is not a result of progressivism or socialism it is the opposite they need something anything to justify their position and prove that socialism all of a sudden works the truth is it doesn t progressives grossly overuse the comparison of nordic nations to socialist ones but the nordics are actually a poor example because they practice a predominantly free market system the only likeness between the two is the social programs to add insult to injury the nordic economies don t completely fall apart and kill millions of people on the way down like socialist systems do so here s why progressives claim this is a product of socialism they need a good example there are zero none no good examples of socialism anywhere as soon as a progressive system is somewhat close to yet so far away from a socialist state progressives will take credit and proclaim it is socialism they need something anything to justify their position and prove that socialism all of a sudden works the truth is it doesn t no one size fits all and nations that try it end up destroying any advantage they had in the world and return to a system of freedom or suffer the consequences look at venezuela 1 600 percent inflation 17 percent gdp growth and 44 percent unemployment expected in 2020 it is through willful ignorance that opponents of capitalism continually propose this economic model but can t tell the difference between an insolvent economy and a prosperous one the nordic model is not a be all and end all system neither is capitalism nor socialism most economies develop change and become better over time history is the best teacher for guidance in the evolution process the left does not deserve to take credit for the glamours the accomplishments and the benefits of a free market system and slap the socialist sticker on it they define nordic and scandinavian models as progressive but this is no longer an argument of definition this is about whether the left will stop lying to the american people and making socialism appear beneficial younger people in particular are prone to this rhetoric everything important to them is free under socialism thanks to sen bernie sanders and others like him the young do not know because they have not been told the consequences it is time they were told the truth
swaminathan s anklesaria aiyar is consulting editor of the economic times he has frequently been a consultant to the world bank and asian development bank a popular columnist and tv commentator swami has been called india s leading economic journalist by stephen cohen of the brookings institution swaminomics has been appearing as a weekly column in the times of india since 1990 in 2008 the times of india brought out the book the benevolent zookeepers the best of swaminomics less more the economic survey said rightly that no country had ever grown fast without buoyant exports and called for policies to generate a virtuous cycle of rising exports gdp savings and investment the budget fails comprehensively to do this far from taking india to 8 growth it could take india down to 6 why have exports hardly grown for five years because india is a high cost economy that cannot compete with its asian peers india has among the highest cost land labour capital electricity railway freight rates air freight corporate and income tax rates a thrust for 8 growth requires lowering every one of these rates alas the budget goes in the opposite direction back in 2007 finance minister chidambaram grasped the importance of being competitive and decreed that import duties should be reduced till they approximated the asian norm of 10 that was achieved by a series of cuts till 2008 and helped fuel india s biggest boom then arun jaitley said india would cut its corporate tax rate to 25 to compete with asia this vision has been abandoned by nirmala sitharaman she has done nothing to bring down the high costs of so many items she has yet to cut corporate tax to the promised 25 rate for large companies with revenue of over rs 400 crore meanwhile corporate tax in many asian countries has fallen to 15 20 the new peak income tax rate of 42 7 is out of line with rates in several competing countries sitharaman wants to attract foreign investment and talent but 42 7 income tax is a clear disincentive foreign portfolio investors organised as trusts suddenly find they have to pay 42 7 tax and are exiting causing a crash in stock markets many indian businessmen will move to low tax havens like singapore and dubai 7 000 billionaires have already left in recent years corporate promoters will keep profits in companies instead of distributing them as dividends that are highly taxed so the policy in anti dividend a wedge as high as 17 7 between the top income tax rate and corporate tax rate is a recipe for proliferating tax avoidance the additional revenue sought by the budget may not accrue at all an elementary precept of economic liberalisation is that a tax on imports becomes a tax on exports it creates a high cost economy appreciates the exchange rate and induces investment to shift from export production to import substitution it induces retaliation against indian exports as the usa has demonstrated far from seeing this as a problem sitharaman wants to encourage it jaitley in last year s budget started the dismal trend of raising import duties on overt 40 items just for protection sitharaman expands the list much further this year declaring explicitly that she aims to reduce import dependence protect the msme sector and curb non essential imports this is the language of the licence permit raj that trapped india into the hindu rate of growth of 3 5 infant industry protection for temporary periods has created competitive industries in some countries but the new levies have no sunset clause the industries being protected by sitharaman are not infants merely traditional bjp vote banks attracting large foreign investment to boost investment requires stability and predictability in tax rates but constant changes in income tax surcharges and import tariffs represent tax policy driven by lobbying not transparent principles foreign investors will not respond to her incentives if these can change at political whim in the next budget india urgently needs new land laws to slash land prices and acquisition costs new labour laws that reduce effective cost through flexibility lower fiscal deficits that help reduce the interest rate electricity reforms that end high industrial rates to subsidise farmers rail reforms that end high freight rates that subsidise passenger traffic lower taxes on aviation spirit to lower air freight and a shift from high support prices for crops to direct cash benefits for farmers to lower agricultural prices and make them internationally competitive this is a huge and politically difficult agenda nobody could expect modi to grasp such thorny nettles in an election year but despite winning a landslide lok sabha victory he remains in election mode because some state election or another is always a few months away modi and sitharaman need to realise that the need of the hour is not to just to compete with the congress and regional parties more important is the need to compete with china and other competitors like bangladesh vietnam indonesia and thailand they all have lower costs and faster export growth facebook twitter linkedin email disclaimer views expressed above are

source sb moyo sells reforms at chatham the herald july 13 2019 minister moyo farirai machivenyika senior reporter government is committed to economic and political transformation and re engagement to enable the country achieve its full potential through the exploitation of its abundant natural resources this was said by foreign affairs and international trade minister sibusiso busi moyo while addressing business leaders at the royal institute of international affairs also known as chatham house in london minister moyo has been in london as part of government s drive for re engagement and to update the international community on various policy reforms government has embarked on we as government believe in zimbabwe and we believe that we can lead the process of transformation that will see our nation reach its full potential he said our advantages are many and obvious our abundant fertile soils our amazing mineral wealth including vast untapped reserves of coal bed methane gas and highly sought after strategic minerals such as platinum lithium and rare earth minerals our idyllic climate our multiple tourist attractions our well educated people and of course our strategic location in the very heart of southern africa minister moyo added that zimbabwe was committed to re engagement and engagement as seen by his visit to the uk we do not want to be a government perceived as being at perpetual war with our neighbours my visit here has only strengthened our commitment to re engagement we thus remain committed to economic and political reforms in our nation and to re engagement and to mending fences with all those who wish to engage with us minister moyo said he also apprised the audience on the various political economic and legislative reforms that government has embarked on since my visit in april 2018 we have launched our transitional stabilisation programme tsp an ambitious two year programme anchored on sweeping economic and other reforms designed to stabilise the economy and to lay a solid base for sustainable economic growth thereafter we are now 10 months into that programme and the results of government s austerity for prosperity measures have been significant most specifically in promoting fiscal consolidation reduced government expenditure and unprecedented over the past 20 years or so sustained primary budget surpluses he said the envoy noted that the economic reforms had caused suffering to some sections of society but said government had committed significant amounts of the budgetary surpluses towards cushioning the vulnerable he said the economic reforms were being carried out without budgetary support from multi lateral institutions for all these setbacks our efforts are being recognised the world bank recently upgraded us from a low income to a middle income country making our dream of being an upper middle income country by 2030 possible in tourism lonely planet designated zimbabwe as a must visit destination for 2019 while the berlin international tourism board recognised zimbabwe as the most sustainable tourist destination nespresso has also identified zimbabwean coffee as the next great discovery minister moyo added he also said government had abolished the multi currency regime after realising that the stronger us dollar was dominating the multi currency basket making zimbabwe s products uncompetitive and resulting in company closures on the legislative reforms he said tremendous progress has been in crafting laws that enhance personal freedoms and entrench democratic practices we have made significant progress on this constitutional realignment project it has been said by our critics that progress has been slow and that is certainly a fair comment but i am pleased to confirm the following progress three separate bills that are meant to repeal aippa and bring within constitutional parameters the disseminating of public information protection of privacy and that are meant to guarantee press freedom are currently before parliament similarly the amendment of the public order security and maintenance act posa is underway we hope that there will be sincere and concerted engagement with these amendments both in parliament and in public consultations as these are laws that have toxified the relationship between government and its critics both in and outside the country minister moyo said other key political reforms include the restructuring of the security sector partly by way of implementation of recommendations put forward by the montlanthe commission in the wake of post election violence further compounded by the january 14 and 15 violence the process of consultation on this exercise is well advanced he also said compensation for the victims of the violent incidences was being finalised in parallel with these economic political and legislative reforms is another process of reforms aimed at addressing ease of doing business constraints in zimbabwe minister moyo said a raft of amendments to existing legislation and regulations has already been effected cutting away red tape and bureaucracy related to starting and running a business producing for export and investment more generally a bill establishing the zimbabwe investment and development agency zida a one stop investment shop modelled along the lines of the highly effective rwanda development board is currently before parliament and will become law within the coming weeks he also said reengagement with the eu and the us is continuing with the signing of an economic partnership agreement with the eu we have signed an epa with the eu and more recently an interim epa with the uk an arrangement which will enable us to continue to trade with the uk under the current eu specific preferences even after brexit we are working to improve trade and investment relations with the united states the recent launch by the usa of its prosper africa initiative heralded by a us coordinated 20 billion dollar investment in mozambique s natural gas industry underlines washington s burgeoning interest in the continent as a market for sure but also as a source of strategic minerals and ores as a source of food and as an increasingly important partner in the fight against terrorism and other global issues minister moyo said

gordon l weil donald trump s strongest political case for re election is the success of the american economy it s also a big risk and he knows it that s why he lambasts the federal reserve for not lowering interest rates he believes that lower rates will stimulate more growth keeping the historic obama trump recovery going his demands for lower interest rates and his frontal attacks on jerome powell his own choice as fed chair have created an open war between the president and the independent fed short term political demands can conflict with the fed s role to protect the economy long term that s what seems to be what s happening now the recovery from the great recession has been long but not especially strong the benefits have not been the same for all americans republicans blocked president obama s effort for a second economic push leaving the fed to handle the recovery it cut interest rates and made money available for borrowers successfully stimulating economic activity the gop tax cut and trump s cutback on environmental regulation have helped sustain the recovery but its long life the president s strongest political argument carries considerable risk trump needs it to last even longer through to the november 2020 election he has long believed in low interest rates partly because of his experience as a borrower for real estate investments he argues that growth would have been higher if interest rates had been cut and they should be slashed now to juice up higher growth trump openly believes that the fed should follow his policies yet like other central banks in free market economies that manage major world currencies the fed is supposed to operate independently of the politics of the day that s one reason its members terms are 14 years well beyond even two presidential terms central banks take a long view of their role in promoting a stable currency and economic conditions that will increase employment the fed now composed primarily of republican economists has done that consistently since the great recession of 2008 by cutting interest rates it made investment and home buying easier as the recovery continued it gradually began increasing rates though they still remain well below the rates of the past 60 years taking care that its small steps would not harm the recovery the fed began increasing rates so that it would have a tool its ability to again cut rates if there were signs of a recession trump ignores that longer range concern and focuses on his desire for higher growth now if there is any reason the fed might cut rates it is the uncertainty created by the president s trade moves that unsettle world markets wobbles elsewhere could spread to the u s trying to impose his will on the fed trump has openly sought ways to dump powell he would like the powers of the near dictator turkish president who just fired his central bank chief and he envies the chinese ruler s day to day economic control he ignores the need to protect the stability of the dollar the standard world currency two recent picks to fill fed vacancies were obviously unqualified and were dropped one of the next two named openly displays her vast ignorance of monetary policy unqualified nominees who do not support the fed s independence are unlikely to be confirmed by the senate though it is under gop control republican resistance is similar to its unwillingness to eliminate the requirement for 60 votes to end debate on most bills though trump demands it the republicans recognize that the senate majority will almost inevitably shift one day to the democrats they are likely to continue to protect fed independence and require more than a simple majority it s not that they oppose trump but they worry about what the democrats would do beyond these policy concerns there s a practical reason to worry about unnecessary rate cuts when the fed lowers interest rates payouts are reduced on bonds the fixed investments on which many retirees depend whether its obvious to them or not the interest rate paid on bank savings also falls maine has the highest median age in the u s lowering interest rates can cut retiree income because the effects of any national economic policy are not evenly distributed lower interest rates could harm older mainers and not be offset by a small increase in national economic growth with its broad long term focus the fed can take such facts into account trump s focus on how to force the fed to help him win in 2020 doesn t do that

story on the first weekend of june singapore hosted the 18th iiss shangri la dialogue where asean s mechanisms for preserving peace were once again on display at the heart of asean lies a commitment to peaceful dialogue and the pursuit of shared economic growth malaysia and thailand s joint development area in the gulf of thailand is a shining example of the fruits of this commitment both countries are able to manage their overlapping territorial claims through the pursuit of mutual prosperity as a result the region that was once among the poorest on the planet has undergone rapid economic growth and expansion vietnam reduced extreme poverty from around 50 to just 3 indonesia and the philippines both enjoy some of the highest levels of consumer confidence on earth much of this economic progress stems from the establishment of the asean free trade agreement the removal of tariffs and barriers to trade allowed inter asean trade to flourish it also provided a strong economic platform for individual nations to negotiate bilateral trade agreements with much larger economies the economic successes of the block have led to significant social improvements literacy rates and life expectancy rates have soared a newborn baby born in the asean region in 2016 could expect to live 15 years longer than its counterpart born in 1967 regional cooperation lies at the heart of asean s successes at the heart of asean s economic and social successes is the deep regional ties between individual member states for example the development of infrastructure in the region has drawn on the shared knowledge of individual member states to deliver improved competitivity and increased economic output the myingyan power plant in myanmar was a glowing example of successful regional cooperation for mutual prosperity the plant was myanmar s first openly tendered independent power project singapore s sembcorp industries won the contract and is running the gas fired power plant vietnam plays an important role in asean development joining asean as the first indochinese country had important social political economic and security effects for vietnam vietnam s membership of the bloc created a favourable environment for regional economic development as an asean member vietnam has worked hard to secure peace stability and reconciliation among southeast asian nations this also raised vietnam s global image leading to increased cooperation with multiple nations in the region and greater bargaining influence with global superpowers like the united states and china as a non permanent member of the un security council for the term of 2020 2021 and the asean chair in 2020 vietnam has a huge opportunity to consolidate its position on the global stage however they will also challenge vietnam s ability to handle the relationship between larger powers resolve the trade protectionism issues and other regional disputes prof pham quang minh rector of the university of social sciences and humanities in hanoi once said the bases for vietnam to achieve this position are stable political system successful economic transition model and the achievement of the millennium development goals vietnam is in asean as active and responsible member seeking to join with other countries in resolving conflict by peaceful means and respecting international law deeper cooperation will be key moving forward the region is at a critical juncture unique challenges posed by the ongoing us china trade war territorial disputes in the south china sea and the fourth industrial revolution mean that going forward regional cooperation and integration are more important than ever before as tensions escalate in the south china sea and asean s claimant states are forced to confront chinese aggression regional cooperation will be key to producing a peaceful outcome a code of conduct would underline asean s commitment to a rules based order and could provide a conflict resolution mechanism and bring increased political stability by 2030 asean s infrastructure needs are set to reach us 3 4 trillion to meet these needs asean will need to draw on the region s workforce to plug knowledge gaps and provide a steady stream of affordable and reliable infrastructure to ensure economic stability in an increasingly volatile global economy the region will have to increase its regulatory hegemony and remove non tariff trade barriers deeper cooperation between nations can also provide solutions to the challenges individual member states face the young workforces of indonesia and the philippines can alleviate the growing fiscal burden of an ageing population in singapore in return singapore s small and medium businesses smes can help strengthen local expertise in the two countries to help their economies transition to the high value activities of the digital era asean s structure is designed to facilitate cooperation this puts the bloc in a strong position to tackle these global and regional challenges the asean platform regularly brings nation states together to discuss regional economics foreign policy fiscal policy and social issues for example on june 20 the asean summit will kick off in bangkok thailand the three day event will bring governments together to collaborate on social political economic and security challenges this year s focus will be on advancing partnerships to promote sustainability the first half decade of asean s history has been a success story all indicators suggest the next 50 years will be more of the same asean s aec blueprint 2025 has outlined areas to increase strategic economic cooperation to ensure sustained economic growth in the new industrial age building the required shared economic policies won t happen overnight but asean s history of extensive cooperation and its working practices give it the best possible platform to build on
some states and cities are getting very little for the taxpayer dollars they hand out to companies atstock productions shutterstock com u s states and cities hand out tens of billions in taxpayer dollars every year to companies as economic incentives these businesses are supposed to use the money typically distributed through economic development programs to open new facilities create jobs and generate tax revenue but all too often that s not what happens as i ve learned after doing research on the use of tax incentives to spur economic development in cities and states across the country particularly in texas recent scandals involving economic development programs in new jersey baltimore and elsewhere illustrate just what s wrong with these programs and why i believe it s time to end this waste of taxpayer dollars once and for all economic development 101 many states counties and cities have economic development agencies tasked with facilitating investment in their communities these agencies undertake a variety of valuable activities from gathering data to training small businesses owners yet one of their most high profile activities is the use of tax and other incentives to entice companies to invest in their communities generating local jobs and expanding the tax base estimates of how much is spent on such incentives range from us 45 billion to 80 billion a year but what do taxpayers get for all this money as it turns out not much 1 a waste of money first off in most cases investments that result from these incentives would have happened anyway that was the case in baltimore involving a federal program meant to spur development in distressed communities it dubbed opportunity zones propublica reported in june that maryland accidentally designated an area of baltimore that wasn t poor and was already under redevelopment an opportunity zone despite catching the error the state kept the designation allowing real estate investors to potentially claim millions of dollars in tax breaks those investors include kevin plank the billionaire ceo of under armour who owns about 40 of the zone according to propublica this example isn t unique last year tim bartik an economist at the upjohn institute for employment research reviewed 30 studies on the use of economic development incentives he found that 75 to 98 of companies were planning to make the desired investment anyway in my own work in texas i found that more than 85 of the companies offered tax breaks had already planned to open the promised new facilities a few even broke ground before applying for the incentives and in new jersey investigators who uncovered abuse in the state s economic development program found that a lawyer representing a powerful democratic official drafted legislation to benefit companies tied to him and his associates to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars their june report described how the new jersey economic development agency didn t perform the basic due diligence of a single google search which would have shown that some of the companies had already announced a move to new jersey before being offered incentives 2 investments rarely pay off even when an incentive does draw new investments they rarely pay off and they can even harm the fiscal health of cities and states by pulling resources away from other more productive activities in incentives to pander a book i co authored with duke political scientist edmund malesky we reviewed the academic literature in the u s and elsewhere on the use of incentives and found that they are expensive and ineffective in generating employment and economic growth wisconsin residents may be learning this the hard way after their government offered electronics manufacturer foxconn over 4 billion in incentives in exchange for a promise to build a high tech facility that is supposed to create 13 000 jobs but since the 2017 announcement the company has failed to meet job targets and even downgraded the type of facility it plans to build 3 a failure of oversight a third problem is that government agencies fail to provide effective oversight to ensure that company promises on investment and employment like foxconn s are upheld a legislative audit found that the wisconsin agency responsible follows problematic oversight practices and failed to verify that companies created the number of jobs or other goals they claimed wisconsin isn t alone many states and municipalities provide limited oversight of the economic incentives they offer and often rely on companies self reported data to determine whether they ve met targets in texas doctoral candidate calvin thrall and i found that the state even allowed companies to renegotiate their job creation targets sometimes the day before they were required to report compliance with an incentive agreement and even though these deals are often accompanied by splashy pr campaigns that highlight how many jobs will be created the incentive contracts often don t even include actual job creation requirements and only 56 of cities surveyed indicated that they required a performance agreement before offering incentives new jersey investigators found similar oversight problems and other shortcomings in its economic development program finally a lack of transparency surrounding these programs makes it hard for others to determine whether taxpayers got what they were promised ending incentives so you re probably wondering if these incentives don t work why do government officials continue to use and promote them the book i wrote with malesky and a related paper showed how these incentives provide a way for politicians to take credit for business investment in the hopes that it will give them a lift in their next election all they have to do is convince voters that these programs work and that the grand promises being made when officials cut ribbons in well publicized ceremonies will eventually pan out powerful special interest groups are also to blame as they play a big role in shaping incentive programs and lobby vigorously for lawmakers to create them and keep them alive rather than reform or rebrand these programs i believe states should take the advice of some of their own evaluations of these programs and eliminate them taxpayers would be better off without them nathan jensen professor

lyle daly the motley fool there s a diverse range of views about student loans among the 2020 presidential candidates here s how the next president of the united states could affect how you pay for school with the total amount of student loan debt surpassing 1 5 trillion student loans have become a hot button political issue that figures to play a major role in the 2020 presidential election although some candidates have more thorough plans than others for student loan reform they ve all given at least some indication of how they feel on the subject if you re wondering how things could change depending on who s in office let s take an in depth look at the views all the major 2020 presidential candidates have regarding student loans crushed by student loans here s how to spend less and save more drowning in loan debt you may have to ditch your dream job learn more best personal loans president donald trump we ll start with president donald trump who as the incumbent will almost assuredly be the republican candidate based on what trump and his administration have said and his proposed 2020 budgets two of his primary student loan objectives are to simplify repayment plan options on federal student loans to save money for the federal government to accomplish the former the trump administration has proposed cutting the many federal loan repayment plan options to just two a standard plan and an income based plan the standard plan would be the same 10 year repayment plan option that s currently available the graduated repayment plan and the extended 30 year repayment plan would both be eliminated the income based repayment plan would be at most 12 5 of the borrower s income undergraduate students would receive loan forgiveness on any remaining balance after 15 years of payments which is five years sooner than when they d receive loan forgiveness on the current repayment plans graduate students would receive loan forgiveness after 30 years of payments which is five years later than what the current plans offer the 2020 budget proposal aims to terminate public service loan forgiveness to cut costs for the federal government another cost cutting measure in this proposal is ending subsidized student loans which are federal loans where the federal government pays the interest during the following time periods while the student is in school for the first six months after graduation and in periods of deferment or forbearance student loans how they can fatten or shrink your tax refund senator bernie sanders sanders ran a campaign in 2016 based on proposals that were considered far to the left even for the democrats although they have since become much more widely accepted one such proposal was that all students be able to attend public colleges without paying any tuition his plan to fund this was to have the federal government pay for two thirds of the costs and the state where the college was located to pay for one third the senator created the college for all act in 2017 which aims to offer tuition free college at four year public colleges to students from working and middle class families those earning 125 000 or less offer tuition free community college to all students joe biden former vice president in 2015 when biden publicly announced that he would not be running for president in the upcoming election he stated that he supported offering students four years at public colleges tuition free he expanded on this during a 2018 speech saying that the government could finance this plan by getting rid of the stepped up basis loophole that heirs use to pay smaller capital gains taxes on their inheritances he was also part of an obama administration that supported legislation in 2015 to simplify discharging student loan debt during bankruptcy biden has however faced criticism for his previous track record as a senator he was part of a 2005 legislation that prevented people from discharging or renegotiating their student loan debt in bankruptcy court senator elizabeth warren warren has released one of the more detailed plans to address student loan debt and make college more affordable the plan includes at least partial student loan forgiveness for 95 of debtors with the amount forgiven being based on income here are the specifics on this households with incomes under 100 000 would have 50 000 in student loan debt canceled for households with incomes between 100 000 and 250 000 the debt cancellation amount would decrease by 1 for every 3 in income above 100 000 so a household with an income of 160 000 would receive 30 000 in debt cancellation households with incomes of 250 000 or above would receive no debt cancellation her plan also includes expanding the pell grant program by investing an additional 100 billion over 10 years and expanding eligibility for the program to fund this plan warren has proposed an ultra millionaire tax this would be a 2 annual tax on all the families with 50 million or more senator kamala harris harris has pledged her support for students to get a debt free college education and said that this would be one of her priorities if she becomes president she has supported sander s college for all act as well as the debt free college act of 2018 authored by democrat senator brian schatz the debt free college act stipulates that the federal government would match each state s higher education funding and then those funds would be used to cover any sort of college costs a student has that exceed their expected family contribution during a cnn town hall harris also mentioned that a focus of hers would be getting rid of for profit colleges that prey on students she has experience fighting these colleges in the past during her time as the california attorney general notably winning a 1 billion judgment against corinthian colleges beto o rourke former congressman o rourke has publicly stated that he doesn t support the idea of free college for all but that he does support free community college and debt free college for students who attend four year public universities he has also stated that more student loans should be refinanced at lower interest rates and that the public service loan forgiveness program should be expanded senator cory booker booker is a supporter of schatz s debt free college act other than that he hasn t gone into his opinions about student loans yet but he did author a bill focused on bridging the wealth gap that bill is the american opportunity accounts act and it stipulates that each american child receives an account with 1 000 at birth each year thereafter until the child turns 18 the account would receive an additional deposit of up to 2 000 with the amount depending on their family s income the interest rate on the account would be about 3 account holders could only access the money after they turn 18 and they must use it for select allowable expenses such as paying for higher education or purchasing a home pete buttigieg mayor of south bend indiana in a crowded field full of democrats who support either tuition free or debt free college buttigieg stands out as one of the few not to have pledged support to either idea he has stated that since americans with degrees earn more on average than americans without degrees he doesn t think it s fair for those who didn t go to school to subsidize the degrees of those who did buttigieg has said that he wants college to be much more affordable specifically by expanding the pell grant program and getting states to increase their spending on higher education he also mentioned that he wants people to be able to refinance their federal student loans at lower interest rates julia n castro former mayor of san antonio texas and member of obama s cabinet when castro announced that he d be running for president he stated that he wanted to make certification programs apprenticeship programs and the first two years of college accessible and affordable he has since taken it a step further and said that he believes the united states should work towards tuition free public colleges universities certification programs and apprenticeship programs andrew yang entrepreneur yang has some of the most unique policy ideas of any candidate with his most well known idea being a universal basic income of 1 000 per month for every u s citizen over the age of 18 he also has several policy ideas aimed at reducing both student loan debt and the cost of higher education to reduce student loan debt if elected president he has pledged to ensure that the federal government does not profit at all from student loans by reducing interest rates issue a bailout for the people where recent graduates receive a partial reduction of their student loan principals and receive debt forgiveness a set time after graduation propose a plan where the federal government buys private student loan debt from the lenders and then offers borrowers a plan where they pay 10 of their salary for 10 years after 10 years of payments any remaining balance would be forgiven change bankruptcy laws so that student loan debt is dischargeable when filing for bankruptcy senator kirsten gillibrand gillibrand is a supporter of both sander s college for all act and schatz s debt free college act in addition she authored the federal student loan refinancing act which would allow borrowers to refinance their federal student loans at a fixed interest rate of 4 that s lower than the current interest rates for federal loans disbursed on or after july 1 2018 and before july 1 2019 which are 5 05 on direct subsidized loans and direct unsubsidized loans for undergraduate students 6 6 on direct unsubsidized loans for graduate students 7 6 on direct plus loans for graduate or professional students and parents of those students senator amy klobuchar klobuchar is one of the more moderate democrat candidates and she has spoken out against the ideas of tuition free college and student debt forgiveness she claims that both options are unrealistic her proposals which she says she has found ways to fund completely are to provide free community college to offer federal student loan refinancing to current and former students at an interest rate just above 3 and to expand the pell grant program in the past klobuchar has supported the college cost reduction act which led to both income based repayment plans on federal student loans and the public service loan forgiveness program and the american opportunity tax credit which is a tax credit of up to 2 500 families can receive for college costs representative tulsi gabbard gabbard is a supporter of sander s college for all act she has also backed the pathways to affordable education act which focused on increasing the funding for pell grants and making more students eligible for these grants and help for students and parents act which would incentivize businesses in the form of a tax credit to help their employees pay back student loans wayne messam mayor of miramar florida messam s proposal is different from that of most democrats who generally focus on either debt free or tuition free college the south florida mayor wants to wipe out all outstanding student loan debt entirely including both federal and private student loans and then focus on reducing the cost of higher education to pay for this bailout messam says he would repeal the trump administration s tax cuts for wealthy americans john delaney former congressman although delaney is not a supporter of tuition free or debt free college he does believe that everyone should be entitled to go to community colleges or technical schools for free he wants to make all higher education more affordable by offering more grants to students in financial need and by cutting the costs of student loans delaney is also a strong supporter of making both public and private debt dischargeable in bankruptcy and he s the sponsor of the discharge student loans in bankruptcy act of 2017 representative tim ryan ryan is for both debt free and tuition free college and he has a history of supporting these causes he has co sponsored several bills regarding education and student loans including sander s college for all act schatz s debt free college act the aim higher act which would invest more in federal student aid incentivize states to invest more in higher education and expand the public service loan forgiveness program the student loan fairness act which would provide student loan forgiveness for those who have made 120 monthly payments in the previous 10 years a divisive issue for the 2020 election student loans and the cost of higher education are clearly an area where there s a deep divide between the republican and democratic parties on the republican side trump s proposals mainly focus on simplification of repayment plan options and cutting costs for the federal government although there s a range of proposals on the democratic side all of them want to ease the burden of student loan debt and reduce the costs of going to school while it takes more than just proposals to affect change in any area the results of the 2020 election could have a significant impact on the student loan landscape going forward the motley fool owns and recommends mastercard and visa and recommends

nearly one third of earth s population some 2 4 billion people use facebook every month with that kind of reach the social media giant s new cryptocurrency libra could become big enough overnight to be deemed systemically important or large enough that its failure might threaten the financial system federal reserve chairman jerome powell told the senate banking committee last week if that term prompts a feeling of déjà vu it should systemically important was the description coined during the 2008 financial crisis to describe lenders the government propped up with billions of dollars in bailouts in the decade since it has become industry shorthand for lenders subject to heightened oversight by the federal reserve under a regulatory regime intended to prevent a repeat libra raises a lot of serious concerns in areas from money laundering to consumer protection and financial stability powell said during two days of congressional testimony that served as a prelude to hearings next week on facebook s cryptocurrency plans and provided fodder to wary lawmakers libra s potential scale given the size of menlo park calif based facebook s network means it should be subject to the highest level of expectations as well as regulations requiring risk controls and capital reserves for crises powell said the question is who is going to provide that and how and when he added explaining the federal reserve has already developed a working group to evaluate the matter it isn t obvious at all from our current regulatory system that we have in place what we need to assess this that perspective reflects the concern regulators and lawmakers alike have raised with cryptocurrencies overall during the past several years particularly after the value of one of the best known forms bitcoin took a nosedive in 2018 bitcoin and existing cryptocurrencies generated through so called mining validation of transactions on a shared digital ledger known as blockchain are issued by neither governments nor companies meaning users have no recourse when their value sinks trump administration officials from treasury secretary steven mnuchin to securities and exchange commission chairman jay clayton have worried that cryptocurrency investors don t understand what they are buying and that the products could undermine financial stability the president himself made clear on thursday that he shares those opinions arguing on twitter that cryptocurrency values are based on thin air indeed currencies that don t exist outside cyberspace and have suffered rapid price fluctuations represent the mother of all scams nouriel roubini the new york university economist who predicted the 2008 financial crisis and was nicknamed dr doom told the senate banking committee in october libra in many ways appears designed to sidestep such concerns it s unlike older cryptocurrencies including bitcoin since it would be tied to major world currencies including the u s dollar euro and yen and overseen by a switzerland based panel dubbed the libra association with members including mastercard visa and paypal each of which would have voting rights equivalent to facebook s on its own facebook plans to enable transactions through a new subsidiary calibra that will offer a digital wallet as soon as 2020 through whatsapp and messenger as well as on a stand alone basis the company s safeguards however haven t convinced trump a frequent facebook critic who said libra won t be any more dependable than older cryptocurrencies if facebook and other companies want to become a bank they must seek a new banking charter and become subject to all banking regulations he said we have only one real currency in the u s a and it is stronger than ever both dependable and reliable it is by far the most dominant currency anywhere in the world i am not a fan of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies which are not money and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air unregulated crypto assets can facilitate unlawful behavior including drug trade and other illegal activity donald j trump realdonaldtrump july 12 2019 while cryptocurrency has the potential to deliver real benefits said sen mark warner a virginia democrat facebook has developed something of a trust deficit the company which zuckerberg founded before dropping out of harvard has spent the past several years grappling with complaints that it was employed to manipulate voters in the 2016 election failed to prevent improper access to the accounts of millions of users and suppressed conservative opinions from account holders the silicon valley mindset of move fast and break things doesn t always work warner said the truth is we could be creating a system with the kind of oversight deficiencies that allowed warning signals before the financial crisis to go undetected he said we could end up with that same circumstance around libra that s why it s important that the process of evaluating facebook s proposal be a patient one and not a sprint to implementation powell said a statement with which the company concurred we are very much aligned with the chairman around the need for public discourse on this said elka looks a facebook spokeswoman this is why we along with the 27 other founding members of the libra association made this announcement so far in advance so that we could engage in constructive dialogue while facebook hopes to introduce libra in the first six months of 2020 rep maxine waters the california democrat who leads the house financial services committee has urged the company to delay any further action until regulators and congress complete a thorough review facebook s planned products may ultimately be intended to establish a parallel banking and monetary policy system to rival the dollar she noted during a hearing with powell on wednesday our current system of regulation lacks adequate coordination safeguards and attention to cryptocurrency libra is important to facebook because it positions the company to take advantage of a lucrative new market with the cryptocurrency and its calibra wallet the social media giant could offer payment capabilities to 1 7 billion people in developing nations who lack access to banks but carry smartphones built on google s android platform that can tap digital cash said justin post an analyst with charlotte n c based bank of america the financial impact is likely to be immaterial for next three years but the proposed digital currency launch has helped raise optimism on facebook s innovation potential he said still the regulatory hurdles are significant post said an opinion shared by jaret seiberg an analyst with cowen washington research group which has tracked federal policy for the past 40 years there is no constitutional right to a cryptocurrency seiberg said it is important to appreciate that libra cannot exist here as a viable payment option if the u s government wants to stop it other countries have even more flexibility seiberg said china for instance could simply bar libra s use as it has already done with other cryptocurrencies in britain the central bank approaches libra with an open mind but not an open door gov mark carney said in late june unlike social media for which standards and regulations are being debated well after they have been adopted by billions of users the terms of engagement for innovations such as libra must be adopted in advance of any launch he said authorities will need to consider carefully the implications of libra for monetary and financial stability our citizens deserve no less
farirai machivenyika senior reporter government is committed to economic and political transformation and re engagement to enable the country achieve its full potential through the exploitation of its abundant natural resources this was said by foreign affairs and international trade minister sibusiso busi moyo while addressing business leaders at the royal institute of international affairs also known as chatham house in london minister moyo has been in london as part of government s drive for re engagement and to update the international community on various policy reforms government has embarked on we as government believe in zimbabwe and we believe that we can lead the process of transformation that will see our nation reach its full potential he said our advantages are many and obvious our abundant fertile soils our amazing mineral wealth including vast untapped reserves of coal bed methane gas and highly sought after strategic minerals such as platinum lithium and rare earth minerals our idyllic climate our multiple tourist attractions our well educated people and of course our strategic location in the very heart of southern africa minister moyo added that zimbabwe was committed to re engagement and engagement as seen by his visit to the uk we do not want to be a government perceived as being at perpetual war with our neighbours my visit here has only strengthened our commitment to re engagement we thus remain committed to economic and political reforms in our nation and to re engagement and to mending fences with all those who wish to engage with us minister moyo said he also apprised the audience on the various political economic and legislative reforms that government has embarked on since my visit in april 2018 we have launched our transitional stabilisation programme tsp an ambitious two year programme anchored on sweeping economic and other reforms designed to stabilise the economy and to lay a solid base for sustainable economic growth thereafter we are now 10 months into that programme and the results of government s austerity for prosperity measures have been significant most specifically in promoting fiscal consolidation reduced government expenditure and unprecedented over the past 20 years or so sustained primary budget surpluses he said the envoy noted that the economic reforms had caused suffering to some sections of society but said government had committed significant amounts of the budgetary surpluses towards cushioning the vulnerable he said the economic reforms were being carried out without budgetary support from multi lateral institutions for all these setbacks our efforts are being recognised the world bank recently upgraded us from a low income to a middle income country making our dream of being an upper middle income country by 2030 possible in tourism lonely planet designated zimbabwe as a must visit destination for 2019 while the berlin international tourism board recognised zimbabwe as the most sustainable tourist destination nespresso has also identified zimbabwean coffee as the next great discovery minister moyo added he also said government had abolished the multi currency regime after realising that the stronger us dollar was dominating the multi currency basket making zimbabwe s products uncompetitive and resulting in company closures on the legislative reforms he said tremendous progress has been in crafting laws that enhance personal freedoms and entrench democratic practices we have made significant progress on this constitutional realignment project it has been said by our critics that progress has been slow and that is certainly a fair comment but i am pleased to confirm the following progress three separate bills that are meant to repeal aippa and bring within constitutional parameters the disseminating of public information protection of privacy and that are meant to guarantee press freedom are currently before parliament similarly the amendment of the public order security and maintenance act posa is underway we hope that there will be sincere and concerted engagement with these amendments both in parliament and in public consultations as these are laws that have toxified the relationship between government and its critics both in and outside the country minister moyo said other key political reforms include the restructuring of the security sector partly by way of implementation of recommendations put forward by the montlanthe commission in the wake of post election violence further compounded by the january 14 and 15 violence the process of consultation on this exercise is well advanced he also said compensation for the victims of the violent incidences was being finalised in parallel with these economic political and legislative reforms is another process of reforms aimed at addressing ease of doing business constraints in zimbabwe minister moyo said a raft of amendments to existing legislation and regulations has already been effected cutting away red tape and bureaucracy related to starting and running a business producing for export and investment more generally a bill establishing the zimbabwe investment and development agency zida a one stop investment shop modelled along the lines of the highly effective rwanda development board is currently before parliament and will become law within the coming weeks he also said reengagement with the eu and the us is continuing with the signing of an economic partnership agreement with the eu we have signed an epa with the eu and more recently an interim epa with the uk an arrangement which will enable us to continue to trade with the uk under the current eu specific preferences even after brexit we are working to improve trade and investment relations with the united states the recent launch by the usa of its prosper africa initiative heralded by a us coordinated 20 billion dollar investment in mozambique s natural gas industry underlines washington s burgeoning interest in the continent as a market for sure but also as a source of strategic minerals and ores as a source of food and as an increasingly important partner in the fight against terrorism and other global issues minister moyo said
according to government figures the u s economy has been expanding for over a decade the longest uptick in u s history with the stock market at record levels and official unemployment at a 50 year low but under the class realities of capitalism most working people haven t seen many real gains four in 10 u s workers struggle to pay their bills a recent ubs bank survey showed and would confront a crisis if faced with a 400 emergency expense one quarter of u s residents skipped necessary medical care in 2018 because they couldn t afford the cost i keep hearing this is one of the best economies we ve ever had and unemployment is down especially among african americans which i am sommer johnson who lives in douglasville georgia told the washington post i m looking around going where is this boom from where i sit this doesn t look like the best economy ever u s workers have faced stagnant wages for decades and got slammed during what the capitalist pundits call the 2008 great recession at the same time they ve been hit with rising expenses for housing health care and education and now record levels of personal debt after adjusting for inflation 50 percent of u s households have less income today than they did 30 years ago the federal reserve bank reports while more jobs are available today increasing numbers of workers are forced to work two or even three jobs to make ends meet wages are less than 18 58 an hour for half of all u s jobs and more than a third pay less than 15 some 4 3 million workers seeking full time jobs are forced to accept part time hours the government admits speed up and longer hours at the same time many bosses push those who do have jobs to work faster and for longer hours nurses for example are being overworked to the detriment of their own health and care for patients with daily workshifts of 12 hours or more 31 percent of nurses show symptoms of chronic insomnia according to a recent study by the associated professional sleep societies some 13 of nurses say they have to rely on medication to help keep them awake similar conditions affect railroad workers who say fatigue is a constant threat other employers are trying to use technology to squeeze superhuman productivity by ramping up the pace of work robotic storage cubicles that swarm around the 2 500 worker amazon warehouse on staten island in new york bring goods for pickers to pack at breakneck speed raising the rate from 100 items an hour to between 300 to 400 we try to eliminate any wasted motion one picker trainer told the new york times if you have one second that s adding to the process it doesn t seem like a lot but if you do that 1 000 times a day that s when it starts adding up debt explosion under these conditions more and more workers face mounting debts there s a lot of press about student loan debt and the 24 competing democratic presidential candidates argue about whether they can cancel student debts but the fact is there s a steadily mounting debt burden of all kinds facing workers and farmers today total u s household debt in the first quarter of this year reached a record level of 13 7 trillion the federal reserve bank of new york says a rising component of this is car loans with auto finance companies pushing subprime loans which involve low down payments and high interest rates that many working people can t keep up with the number of people seriously delinquent on car loan payments rose to the highest level on record in 2018 7 million people a million above the previous peak in 2010 dairy farmers are facing unprecedented pressure to fold up shop as their income has been squeezed to below zero by the seed and fertilizer monopolies processors and banks this spiraling debt has spawned one seriously expanding capitalist job category the repo man the number of debt collection hounds is exploding and lawsuits by these agencies are boosting their profits on workers misery debt claim suits rose 29 percent in texas last year to 214 000 cases in new york city court filings rose 32 in 2018 and 61 in 2017 and today s laws allow the leeches to garnish your wages often without you even knowing they re coming and to slap liens on any property you ve managed to acquire these collection outfits purchase packages of consumer debts paying a few pennies on the dollar and then pursue borrowers with fervent gusto for the face value of the debt plus interest which may have accumulated for over 20 years one example of how this works was described in a july 5 wall street journal article titled debt collectors wage comeback debt buying company am solutions llc sued philadelphia couple adolph and doris muir in 2017 to foreclose on the couple s home and collect more than 83 000 for what the company claimed was defaulting on a 6 500 mortgage in 1983 but as the muirs tried to explain the fact was they paid 4 500 cash for the house in 1978 and never took out a mortgage on it the debt thieves got the story wrong but for 15 months the muirs faced the threat of eviction and faced the expense of hiring lawyers while the courts pondered over the case eventually the court said they were right others aren t so lucky many cab drivers in new york took out loans to pay hundreds of thousands on medallions to own and operate cabs promised lifetime returns and a happy retirement but with the steep increase in competition that has exploded from uber and other app based for hire cars the medallions today are virtually worthless and the competition means uber drivers find it very hard to get by as well the resulting debts have led to a rash of driver suicides
powell sends further signals of future rate cuts washington ap federal reserve chairman jerome powell testifying for a second day before congress said thursday that the economy is in a very good place despite headwinds and that the fed is prepared to do what it can to keep it there powell s comments before the senate banking committee strengthened the message he had sent to a house panel on wednesday that the central bank is prepared to cut interest rates to support economic growth powell noted that economic worries reflected in surveys of business confidence rose sharply in may he did not specify what had caused the shock but in early may trade talks between the united states and china broke down and president donald trump announced that he was doubling tariffs on 250 billion in chinese goods at the same time the global economy showed further weakness powell said these added threats were addressed by the fed at its june meeting since then job creation which had slowed sharply in may has rebounded and fears of a widening us china trade war have eased the economy is in a very good place powell told the senate committee we want to use our tools to keep it there it is very important that this expansion continue as long as possible while powell did not specifically state that a fed rate cut could be coming at the july meeting investors have taken his two days of testimony as strong evidence that is what will occur federal reserve chair jerome powell presents the monetary policy report to the senate banking committee july 11 2019 on capitol hill in washington ap photo jacquelyn martin in his senate appearance powell elaborated on the fed s concerns about persistently low inflation as a reason that there is growing support for rate cuts citing the problems japan and europe are facing in fighting chronically low inflation the fed seeks to keep prices rising at an annual rate of 2 but it has lagged below that level for most of the current expansion this year it has fallen farther below that goal you don t want to get behind the curve and let inflation drop well below 2 because what happens is you get into this unhealthy dynamic potentially where lower expected inflation gets baked into interest rates powell said the fed raised rates four times in 2018 drawing the ire of trump who has called the central bank clueless by pursuing needless rate hikes that have slowed economic growth and depressed stock gains much of trump s criticism has focused on powell the president has said he has the power to fire powell or demote him something that legal experts dispute asked about trump s threats on wednesday powell repeated that he intends to serve his full four year term powell received support from lawmakers in the house and the senate for his efforts to maintain the fed s independence from political pressure sen richard shelby r ala told powell on thursday thank you for keeping the federal reserve independent of both parties we salute you for that at a separate white house event thursday trump kept up his criticism of the fed saying in reference to powell we have somebody who likes raising rates now i think he s maybe going to change but we ll find out the stock market set new records on thursday bolstered by powell s signals on rate cuts with the s p 500 index hitting an all time high and the dow jones industrial average closing above 27 000 for the first time trump said i m a very greedy person we just set a record 27 000 i said we could be 10 000 points higher with better policies from the fed in response to questions at the senate hearing powell said that very low unemployment rates no longer necessarily push up inflation a relationship between the two existed 50 years ago but that has gotten weaker and weaker and weaker powell said those comments were viewed as another signal that the fed is feeling more comfortable about keeping short term interest rates low even though unemployment has fallen to the lowest level in nearly 50 years for decades economic theory suggested that low unemployment such as the current jobless rate of 3 7 meant that employers would have to raise pay to attract and keep workers and that would then raise prices to cover higher wage costs many fed officials believed that required raising rates to slow the economy and prevent a wage price spiral from sending inflation higher but powell said thursday he believes the unemployment rate can likely fall much further than in the past without sparking inflation which means that interest rates can also stay lower advertisement i think we re learning all of those things he said
12 07 2019 turkey s arms industry is on a war footing high risk foreign adventures erdoğan has been engaging in lavish military spending despite the poor state of the economy reports esen uslu in the aftermath of the defeat of president recep tayyip erdoğan s justice and development party akp in the istanbul mayoral elections the survival instincts of his regime are now focused on foreign policy following the infamous maxim of sir cecil rhodes if you want to avoid civil war you must become imperialists erdoğan has adopted a new swagger in his approach to regional disputes while no doubt this is intended to garner domestic support it may also prove very costly to both turkey and its neighbours his attempts to extend turkey s military commitments and acts of aggression come at a time when the economy looks unable to sustain costly foreign adventures spiralling inflation is back with a vengeance turning all established precepts upside down erdoğan style economics blames high interest rates for rising inflation and insists that only by reducing those rates can the economy be boosted even the head of the so called independent central bank appointed by erdoğan via a controversial process a few years back was summarily dismissed when he seemed unwilling to reduce rates will the new governor of the bank dare cut the 24 rate fixed in september 2018 to avoid a meltdown of the turkish lira since the interest hike the government has attempted to reduce the impact of the painful economic slowdown by tax cuts incentives and subsidies for many goods the private consumption tax pct and vat rates were reduced sometimes to zero for a period that ends this month the pct was introduced as a special tax to alleviate the burden of the major earthquake of 1999 however it was transformed into a regular tax in 2002 and has become a principal money maker for governments since yet despite all these attempts to fire up the sluggish economy the results have been dismal and their effect could be measured by the istanbul mayoral election results now a new package is being prepared overseas conflict nevertheless as i have pointed out despite the sorry state of the economy the akp is intent on financing foreign adventures turkish armed forces control two zones under occupation in syria and maintain 12 observation positions in idlib province they are threatening to occupy further zones west of the euphrates river too the military is also waging a large scale combined operation in northern iraq against the kurds daily surveillance flights with domestically produced unmanned aerial vehicles uavs are complemented by airforce raids as well as uav strikes in some areas turkish troops are in control up to 15 kilometres from the border within iraqi kurdish territory and have established new bases controlling the traditional routes along the valleys in effect turkey has unilaterally redrawn the borders agreed with iraq decades ago meanwhile the deep seabed exploration for gas and oil around cyprus has become another bone of contention the gas fields discovered off the coast of israel and cyprus and the development of the adjacent zohr field in egypt have increased competition as well as tension turkey has declared that it does not accept the unilateral declaration of an economic zone off cyprus by the internationally recognised government and has sent two drilling ships both of which are now operating to the south of cyprus istanbul has been asked to desist by the international community to no avail when the greek cypriots issued international arrest warrants against the crew of the drilling ships turkey s response was to use uavs to keep the area under surveillance and organise navy and airforce patrols the outcome of the greek elections resulting in a new rightwing government could also mean an escalation of tensions meanwhile cyprus is planning to enlarge the mari base to accommodate the french navy president emmanuel macron has become quite vocal against turkey s drilling and erdoğan has publicly attacked him the us navy s sixth fleet is also off cyprus protecting the exxonmobil company and other us interests in the region on july 8 the state department released a press statement which claimed this provocative step raises tensions in the region we urge turkish authorities to halt these operations and encourage all parties to act with restraint turkey s involvement in libya s civil war has also had repercussions a spokesperson for khalifa haftar s national libyan army recently declared that any ship or plane with a turkish flag would be regarded as hostile and treated accordingly immediately afterwards six crew members of a ship docked in a libyan port were detained and released only after sustained pressure from istanbul this followed the defeat of his forces attacking tripoli it soon became apparent that overt and covert supply of turkish arms and personnel had been instrumental in forcing the withdrawal of nla forces while turkey has built a good relationship with russia there are some who are piling on the pressure to thwart that the royal navy s hms duncan is yet again in the black sea taking part in a large naval exercise called sea breeze with the participation of warships from 17 countries including turkey and usa the exercise aims to demonstrate support for ukraine s territorial integrity in opposition to russia s annexation of crimea and aggression in eastern ukraine according to official press releases this is highly pertinent since there is a large crimean tatar community living in exile in turkey and since the cold war era the crimea has been used as a tool to drum up anti communist and nationalistic sentiments making it quite difficult for erdoğan to backtrack however the president has been quite skilful when he decides to backtrack on some issues during his recent visit to china he uttered not a word on the plight of uyghurs in xinjiang and when he was pressed on the issue calmly stated that turkey remains committed to a one china policy it will not allow anyone to drive a wedge in its relations with china however the extremist uyghur fighters of the turkestan islamic party are operating with impunity around jisr al shughour under the protection of turkish observation posts in the idlib province of syria armaments to facilitate these incursions into neighbouring countries turkey has changed the structure of its armed forces now all land forces are made up of professional soldiers compulsory military service is mainly used to indoctrinate the young male population with nationalist dogma for a couple of weeks for the remaining service duration there is an option of paying a withdrawal fee which is actually a form of taxation meanwhile a major programme of shipbuilding including submarines frigates and even a helicopter landing ship is underway however a joint programme with the uk to produce a domestic fighter bomber with the financial backing of qatar seems to have fizzled out following rolls royce s withdrawal from supplying engine technology this year but a helicopter gunship produced in collaboration with italy was rapidly put into service a new heavier version is on the drawing board and a helicopter peddled as the first example of a local and national aircraft has been undergoing flight tests armoured vehicles and blast proof personnel carriers are also big business mobile artillery and howitzers have been produced in large numbers and put into service similarly short and medium range artillery rocket technology has been developed and put into operation also anti tank rockets for land based and aerial platforms the main beneficiary of this spending spree draped in the national flag and accompanied by islamic chants in support of martyrs has of course been the turkish arms industry there has not been much media focus on this lavish spending while for the moment the money is flowing in from the gulf the negative results may not be tangible but in the long run all these debts have to be paid however turkey is facing another test as the usa and nato are opposed to the purchase of long range anti aircraft systems from russia istanbul is threatened with sanctions and a deterioration of relations nonetheless it is pressing on with the deployment of s 400s despite the noises coming from the trump administration russian military planes have been landing in turkey along with the technical personnel needed to install the s 400 missiles that includes visiting military airfields that have been off limit for many years so these are interesting and dangerous times yet the nationalistic anti kurdish sentiment prevailing in so called progressive circles has paralysed the opposition nobody is raising these issues on the streets except the peoples democratic party while parliament has been relegated to a talking shop even turkish journalists working for the foreign press are now being targeted with veiled threats giving an idea of what may come in the near future hundreds of journalists have already been imprisoned for years with or without conviction on trumped up charges could all this be a prelude to a new wave of repression or just the thrashing about of a dying akp regime there are many signs indicating that the akp is decaying from within a former economics minister ali babacan has resigned from it with the intention of forming an alternative political party while ex president abdullah gül seems to be supporting the move and the former prime minister ahmet davutoğlu has been pursuing a similar aim will he also resign from the akp and will they join forces watch this space

by sarah dadouch and idrees ali istanbul washington reuters turkey began taking delivery of an advanced russian missile defence system on friday a move expected to trigger u s sanctions against a nato ally and drive a wedge into the heart of the western military alliance the first parts of the s 400 air defence system were flown to the murted military air base northwest of ankara the turkish defence ministry said sealing turkey s deal with russia which washington had struggled for months to prevent reaction from washington which has threatened to impose sanctions on turkey was limited with acting defence secretary mark esper saying the u s position has not changed president donald trump gave a 30 minute speech on trade on friday afternoon at a plant in milwaukee run by a subsidiary of defence contractor lockheed martin but made no mention of turkey washington has opposed turkey s purchase saying russian military hardware is not compatible with nato systems and that the acquisition may lead to turkey s expulsion from an f 35 fighter jet programme investors in turkey have been unsettled by the deal the turkish lira weakened as much as 1 6 to 5 7780 against the dollar before recovering somewhat after the ministry announced the arrival of the s 400 consignment the main istanbul share index fell 2 13 turkish broadcasters showed footage of huge russian air force an 124 cargo planes offloading equipment at the air base today three cargo planes arrived defence minister hulusi akar told state owned anadolu news agency adding that deliveries would continue in coming days a second delivery by air will take place soon russia s tass news agency quoted an unnamed military diplomatic source as saying a third delivery of 120 guided missiles will be carried out by ship at the end of the summer the source said twenty turkish servicemen received training from russia in may june and 80 more turkish servicemen will receive training to use the s 400 system the source was quoted as saying story continues we are aware of turkey taking delivery of the s 400 our position regarding the f 35 has not changed esper told reporters earlier in the day and said there will be more to follow after he spoke with his turkish counterpart but the pentagon then cancelled a planned news briefing on turkey minister akar told his u s counterpart that turkey remains under a serious air and missile threat and that purchase of s 400 defence systems was not an option but rather a necessity the turkish defence ministry said about the phone call adding that ankara was still assessing acquiring u s patriot missiles erdogan trump talks turkey says the system is a strategic defence requirement particularly to secure its southern borders with syria and iraq it says that when it made the deal with russia for the s 400s the united states and europe had not presented a viable alternative president tayyip erdogan said after meeting president donald trump at a g20 summit last month that the united states did not plan to impose sanctions on ankara for buying the s 400s trump said turkey had not been treated fairly but did not rule out sanctions and u s officials said last week the administration still plans to act there has been bipartisan opposition in the u s congress to turkey s purchase and the reaction from lawmakers have been more stern calling the state department and pentagon to remove turkey from the f 35 programme president erdogan was given a very clear choice unfortunately he has clearly made the wrong one a statement from house of representatives foreign affairs committee said under legislation known as countering america s adversaries through sanctions act caatsa which targets purchases of military equipment from russia trump should select five of 12 possible measures these range from banning visas and denying access to the u s based export import bank to the harsher options of blocking transactions with the u s financial system and denying export licences washington says the s 400s could compromise its lockheed martin f 35 stealth fighter jets an aircraft turkey is helping to build and planning to buy turkey could also face expulsion from the f 35 programme under the sanctions erdogan has dismissed that possibility but washington has already started the process of removing turkey from the programme halting training of turkish pilots in the united states on the aircraft investors in turkey have been concerned about the impact of potential u s sanctions on an economy which fell into recession after a currency crisis last year turkey s dollar bonds dropped to three week lows on the news of the delivery while the cost of insuring exposure to turkish sovereign debt also rose fitch ratings downgraded turkey s sovereign rating to bb on friday and said it remained vulnerable to deterioration of ties with the u s and added that while any u s sanctions on turkey might have minimal direct economic effect warned that their impact on sentiment could be significant the s 400 acquisition is one of several issues which have frayed ties between the two allies including a dispute over strategy in syria east of the euphrates river where the united states is allied with kurdish forces that turkey views as foes the detention of u s consular staff in turkey has also strained relations along with disagreements over iran venezuela and middle east policy turkey has long demanded washington hand over a muslim cleric who ankara holds responsible for an attempted coup in 2016 additional reporting by ezgi erkoyun orhan coskun in ankara

military vehicles and equipment parts of the s 400 air defense systems are unloaded from a russian transport aircraft at murted military airport in ankara turkey reuters turkey began taking delivery of an advanced russian missile defence system on friday a move expected to trigger us sanctions against a nato ally and drive a wedge into the heart of the western military alliance the first parts of the s 400 air defence system were flown to the murted military air base northwest of ankara the turkish defence ministry said sealing turkey s deal with russia which washington had struggled for months to prevent reaction from washington which has threatened to impose sanctions on turkey was limited with acting defence secretary mark esper saying the us position has not changed advertisement president donald trump gave a 30 minute speech on trade on friday afternoon at a plant in milwaukee run by a subsidiary of defense contractor lockheed martin but made no mention of turkey washington has opposed turkey s purchase saying russian military hardware is not compatible with nato systems and that the acquisition may lead to turkey s expulsion from an f 35 fighter jet programme investors in turkey have been unsettled by the deal the turkish lira weakened as much as 1 6 to 5 7780 against the dollar before recovering somewhat after the ministry announced the arrival of the s 400 consignment the main istanbul share index fell 2 13 turkish broadcasters showed footage of huge russian air force an 124 cargo planes offloading equipment at the air base advertisement today three cargo planes arrived defence minister hulusi akar told state owned anadolu news agency adding that deliveries would continue in coming days a second delivery by air will take place soon russia s tass news agency quoted an unnamed military diplomatic source as saying a third delivery of 120 guided missiles will be carried out by ship at the end of the summer the source said twenty turkish servicemen received training from russia in may june and 80 more turkish servicemen will receive training to use the s 400 system the source was quoted as saying first parts of a russian s 400 missile defense system are seen after unloaded from a russian plane at murted airport known as akinci air base near ankara turkey reuters first parts of a russian s 400 missile defense system are seen after unloaded from a russian plane at murted airport known as akinci air base near ankara turkey reuters we are aware of turkey taking delivery of the s 400 our position regarding the f 35 has not changed esper told reporters earlier in the day and said there will be more to follow after he spoke with his turkish counterpart advertisement but the pentagon then canceled a planned news briefing on turkey minister akar told his us counterpart that turkey remains under a serious air and missile threat and that purchase of s 400 defence systems was not an option but rather a necessity the turkish defense ministry said about the phone call adding that ankara was still assessing acquiring us patriot missiles erdogan trump talks turkey says the system is a strategic defence requirement particularly to secure its southern borders with syria and iraq it says that when it made the deal with russia for the s 400s the united states and europe had not presented a viable alternative president tayyip erdogan said after meeting president donald trump at a g20 summit last month that the united states did not plan to impose sanctions on ankara for buying the s 400s advertisement trump said turkey had not been treated fairly but did not rule out sanctions and us officials said last week administration still plans to act there has been bipartisan opposition in the us congress to turkey s purchase and the reaction from lawmakers have been more stern calling the state department and pentagon to remove turkey from the f 35 program president erdogan was given a very clear choice unfortunately he has clearly made the wrong one a statement from house of representatives foreign affairs committee said under legislation known as countering america s adversaries through sanctions act caatsa which targets purchases of military equipment from russia trump should select five of 12 possible measures these range from banning visas and denying access to the us based export import bank to the harsher options of blocking transactions with the us financial system and denying export licences a russian plane carrying parts of a russian s 400 missile defense system is pictured at akinci air base near ankara turkey reuters a russian plane carrying parts of a russian s 400 missile defense system is pictured at akinci air base near ankara turkey reuters washington says the s 400s could compromise its lockheed martin f 35 stealth fighter jets an aircraft turkey is helping to build and planning to buy advertisement turkey could also face expulsion from the f 35 program under the sanctions erdogan has dismissed that possibility but washington has already started the process of removing turkey from the programme halting training of turkish pilots in the united states on the aircraft investors in turkey have been concerned about the impact of potential us sanctions on an economy which fell into recession after a currency crisis last year turkey s dollar bonds dropped to three week lows on the news of the delivery while the cost of insuring exposure to turkish sovereign debt also rose fitch ratings downgraded turkey s sovereign rating to bb on friday and said it remained vulnerable to deterioration of ties with the us and added that while any us sanctions on turkey might have a minimal direct economic effect warned that their impact on sentiment could be significant the s 400 acquisition is one of several issues which have frayed ties between the two allies including a dispute over strategy in syria east of the euphrates river where the united states is allied with kurdish forces that turkey views as foes advertisement the detention of us consular staff in turkey has also strained relations along with disagreements over iran venezuela and middle east policy turkey has long demanded washington hand over a muslim cleric who ankara holds responsible for an attempted coup in 2016 additional reporting by ezgi erkoyun orhan coskun in ankara maxim rodionov and tom

u s states and cities hand out tens of billions in taxpayer dollars every year to companies as economic incentives these businesses are supposed to use the money typically distributed through economic development programs to open new facilities create jobs and generate tax revenue but all too often that s not what happens as i ve learned after doing research on the use of tax incentives to spur economic development in cities and states across the country particularly in texas recent scandals involving economic development programs in new jersey baltimore and elsewhere illustrate just what s wrong with these programs and why i believe it s time to end this waste of taxpayer dollars once and for all economic development 101 many states counties and cities have economic development agencies tasked with facilitating investment in their communities these agencies undertake a variety of valuable activities from gathering data to training small businesses owners yet one of their most high profile activities is the use of tax and other incentives to entice companies to invest in their communities generating local jobs and expanding the tax base estimates of how much is spent on such incentives range from us 45 billion to 80 billion a year but what do taxpayers get for all this money as it turns out not much 1 a waste of money first off in most cases investments that result from these incentives would have happened anyway that was the case in baltimore involving a federal program meant to spur development in distressed communities it dubbed opportunity zones propublica reported in june that maryland accidentally designated an area of baltimore that wasn t poor and was already under redevelopment an opportunity zone despite catching the error the state kept the designation allowing under armour billionaire kevin plank and other investors to potentially claim millions of dollars in tax breaks this example isn t unique last year tim bartik an economist at the upjohn institute for employment research reviewed 30 studies on the use of economic development incentives he found that 75 to 98 of companies were planning to make the desired investment anyway in my own work in texas i found that more than 85 of the companies offered tax breaks had already planned to open the promised new facilities a few even broke ground before applying for the incentives and in new jersey investigators who uncovered abuse in the state s economic development program found that a lawyer representing a powerful democratic official drafted legislation to benefit companies tied to him and his associates to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars their june report described how the new jersey economic development agency didn t perform the basic due diligence of a single google search which would have shown that some of the companies had already announced a move to new jersey before being offered incentives 2 investments rarely pay off even when an incentive does draw new investments they rarely pay off and they can even harm the fiscal health of cities and states by pulling resources away from other more productive activities in incentives to pander a book i co authored with duke political scientist edmund malesky we reviewed the academic literature in the u s and elsewhere on the use of incentives and found that they are expensive and ineffective in generating employment and economic growth wisconsin residents may be learning this the hard way after their government offered electronics manufacturer foxconn over 4 billion in incentives in exchange for a promise to build a high tech facility that is supposed to create 13 000 jobs but since the 2017 announcement the company has failed to meet job targets and even downgraded the type of facility it plans to build 3 a failure of oversight a third problem is that government agencies fail to provide effective oversight to ensure that company promises on investment and employment like foxconn s are upheld a legislative audit found that the wisconsin agency responsible follows problematic oversight practices and failed to verify that companies created the number of jobs or other goals they claimed wisconsin isn t alone many states and municipalities provide limited oversight of the economic incentives they offer and often rely on companies self reported data to determine whether they ve met targets in texas doctoral candidate calvin thrall and i found that the state even allowed companies to renegotiate their job creation targets sometimes the day before they were required to report compliance with an incentive agreement and even though these deals are often accompanied by splashy pr campaigns that highlight how many jobs will be created the incentive contracts often don t even include actual job creation requirements and only 56 of cities surveyed indicated that they required a performance agreement before offering incentives new jersey investigators found similar oversight problems and other shortcomings in its economic development program finally a lack of transparency surrounding these programs makes it hard for others to determine whether taxpayers got what they were promised ending incentives so you re probably wondering if these incentives don t work why do government officials continue to use and promote them the book i wrote with malesky and a related paper showed how these incentives provide a way for politicians to take credit for business investment in the hopes that it will give them a lift in their next election all they have to do is convince voters that these programs work and that the grand promises being made when officials cut ribbons in well publicized ceremonies will eventually pan out powerful special interest groups are also to blame as they play a big role in shaping incentive programs and lobby vigorously for lawmakers to create them and keep them alive rather than reform or rebrand these programs i believe states should take the advice of some of their own evaluations of these programs and eliminate them taxpayers would be better off without them

a self made tycoon who earned a fortune by assembling iphones for apple is promising taiwan he ll impose a special tax on the ultra rich if he gets to become president terry gou the 68 year old founder of foxconn technology group was described by one taiwanese magazine as the most powerful freshman in politics link in chinese after he announced plans to compete in next year s presidential election hoping to be selected as the opposition kuomintang kmt party s candidate the party which campaigns for closer ties with china is holding its primary this week and will announce the winner on monday july 15 based on the result of landline phone polls voters will be asked how he stacks up against president tsai ing wen who ll be running for a second term as well as how he stacks up against other candidates advertisement the election comes at a time when many are concerned about their salaries and cost of living last november the kuomintang won 15 of 22 mayoral and county magistrate seats in local elections on promises of focusing on the economy handing tsai s democratic progressive party a crushing defeat according to wei ting yen an assistant professor in government at franklin and marshall college in the us gou s image as a successful self made businessman makes him a strong contender despite trailing behind kaohsiung city mayor han kuo yu in several polls yen thinks that gou s business success could convince the kmt s voters that he will deliver economic results gou has been highlighting a tax proposal aiming at the ultra rich in taiwan since he began his campaign and on july 6 he reiterated this policy through a facebook post link in chinese just ahead of the start of telephone polling for the primary he said he would impose a tax on taiwan s 1 000 richest people that he expected could generate at least 5 billion annually though rivals have questioned his numbers which he plans to devote to social welfare spending such as public kindergartens and daycare centers and social housing projects he referenced similar appeals made by fellow billionaires like bill gates and warren buffett who have called for the us government to increase taxes on the ultra rich when all citizens are safe and self sufficient businesses can have fewer concerns gou wrote in the facebook post that s why i propose to impose a tax on taiwan s ultra rich and i m very firm about this proposal advertisement han is a formidable rival though he jumped into the presidential race after calls from his supporters to run just months after pulling off an upset victory to become mayor of kaohsiung city long a dpp stronghold his political rallies draw large numbers of people and in recent televised debates he has emphasized the gap between rich and poor blaming the current administration for not distributing economic benefits properly he wants to address these issues by establishing an economic fund to help farmers fishermen women and other lower income groups and is also proposing new negotiations for free trade agreements gou first revealed his intention to run for taiwan s highest office in april when he said that the sea goddess mazu came into his dreams and asked him to do good things for our suffering people give hope to the youth and contribute to cross strait peace a reference to china which claims taiwan is a part of one china the island however is self governed with its own legislature and a court system that ushered in asia s first same sex marriages in may gou said that taiwan plays a key role in the ongoing trade war between china and the us and only if he becomes taiwan s next president can the island truly elaborate its unique advantages i can increase taiwan s profit help the us reach its goals facilitate a successful structural transition for china and help taiwan create another economic miracle gou said in a speech to executives from taiwan s electronic industry gou is capable of framing a public image that he can maintain very good relationships with both the us and china and such an image can be appealing to many taiwanese people said yen advertisement but despite the kmt s strong showing in last year s local polls analysts have cautioned against seeing the result as favoring its stance on friendlier ties with the mainland in fact both gou and han have had to alter the direction of their china policy in recent weeks and have come under pressure over their contacts with china after president tsai s popularity was boosted by her outspoken support for the anti extradition bill movement in hong kong they are now both distancing themselves from beijing and reiterating their opposition to the one country two systems model under which hong kong returned to china in 1997 gou s attempts to transform how voters see his business and political ties to china where foxconn employs hundreds of thousands of people may convince some says liu chieh hsu a taiwanese voter in his 30s in recent weeks we have seen gou repeatedly emphasizing how china is the one that needs to rely on him rather than the other way around liu explains though he doesn t plan to vote for gou himself if he wins the nomination gou has also tried to play up another possible selling point the comparison drawn between him and us president donald trump in taiwanese media as successful businessmen with no prior political background who are prone to taking provocative stances paywall as politicians advertisement in may he even won an invitation to the white house not long after announcing his presidential bid though trump and gou didn t discuss support for his presidential campaign gou still seized the opportunity to turn the meeting into a political one in a facebook post link in chinese about the visit gou showed off the three souvenirs that trump gave him while saying his old friend trump told him that being a president is a tough job he didn t forget to take a page from trump s campaign strategy by adding the hashtag makeournationsgreatagain at the end of the post
economists have dubbed it bad good news an unexpectedly high number of jobs added in june is likely to roil markets and hand federal reserve chairman jerome powell the biggest challenge of his career powell will have a harder time making the case for an interest rate cut when the central bank meets later this month after the government announced that the economy added 224 000 jobs in june compared with the 165 000 expected by economists it becomes harder for the fed to decide if it s appropriate for the fed to cut rates in july daniel zhao senior economist at glassdoor com said after powell obliquely suggested in his most recent remarks that the fed was open to an interest rate cut perhaps as soon as july markets might have relied too heavily on that assumption putri pascualy managing director for paamco prisma said our sense is that bad news is actually good news because that s what the market s anticipating pascualy said softening job numbers open up the door for rate cuts that s been baked in the market she said but today s strong report throws a curveball to that expectation it really complicates their narrative and it s no longer a sure thing that they cut rates this month they may want to wait and see a couple more job reports before they make a move mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics said the fed chairman will face an unpalatable choice at the central bank s meeting at the end of the month failing to deliver the rate cut that president donald trump has been clamoring for and the market is already expecting could have a seismic effect on wall street there s a very good probability that we ve got to unwind some of this said sameer samana senior global market strategist for the wells fargo investment institute something s got to give to a certain extent in the aftermath of the great recession investors became conditioned to a cycle of dip and rescue with the federal reserve responding to market drops with more accommodative policy it s kind of the playbook that was fashioned out of the crisis every time stocks would go down the fed would step in samana said what the markets might be missing is even though the fed is willing to help out and step in they might not do it as quickly as the market hopes right now investors are treating the prospect of lower interest rates as a kind of cure all pascualy said the crux of all the positive tenor in the market is contingent on one thing which is fed rate cuts that s extremely risky she said the positive is one thing and it has been priced in versus a multitude of negatives that have not been priced in zandi said if it becomes evident that the fed doesn t have enough room to maneuver because rates are historically low to begin with or that rate cuts are unable to stem an exodus of jobs from the economy investor sentiment could plummet if that s the case then the market would turn very sharply he said at this point in the business cycle there s not a lot of room to maneuver so it makes it very difficult for the fed to thread the needle on the flip side if the fed trims interest rates in the absence of clear cut signs of an impending slowdown it risks overheating the economy particularly analysts said if the china trade war does reach a successful resolution the big worry is if china gets solved and the economy really picks up ryan detrick senior market strategist for lpl financial said that can bring back a lot of confidence and business investment although corporate america has been agitating for an end to the tariffs supply chain disruptions and negative sentiment that have inhibited growth since the trade war began a rapid reversal of fortune particularly one taking place in an overly accommodative economic climate could be just as dangerous if the economy starts to pick up and the fed is making cuts maybe inflation could spike quite quickly and business cycles tend to be choked off when you have too much inflation detrick said that s definitely a worry
the giant foxconn manufacturing complex planned in wisconsin is likely to continue falling short of the threshold required to begin receiving billions of dollars in state incentives even after production begins next year we understand what is going to be built and when it s going to be finished the first phase gov tony evers told cnbc noting that his administration has now gotten clarity from the taiwanese electronics manufacturer on its plans which are much less ambitious than they were originally portrayed evers spoke exclusively with cnbc in his state capitol office in madison on june 27 one week after paying his first visit to the construction site near racine the site visit was undisclosed to the public until now under the deal negotiated by evers predecessor gov scott walker foxconn said it would build a 10 billion manufacturing complex that president donald trump called the eighth wonder of the world at a groundbreaking one year ago since then no factory has been built but state and local governments already have spent tens of millions of dollars on land acquisition and road and utility improvements the company only recently began laying the foundation for a vastly scaled down manufacturing plant more than a year behind schedule in fact i saw them pouring concrete the other day evers said but the governor said the project s initial phase will employ only about 1 500 people when production begins which is currently scheduled for next may that would be well short of the company s previously announced plans to hire more than 1 800 people by the end of next year the company already has acknowledged that it no longer plans to produce giant glass panels for video displays at the plant using so called generation 10 5 technology for which there are no facilities in the u s instead foxconn will build a generation 6 plant they re going to be making smaller items probably tablets glass for tablets and phones and things like that not the big tvs that they talked about initially evers said foxconn attributed the change to market forces in addition the larger displays would have required an advanced glass plant to be built nearby the leading glass manufacturer new york based corning said it was unwilling to locate a new plant in wisconsin without subsidies but the state was already tapped out foxconn s agreement with the wisconsin economic development corp the state s business development arm calls for the company to create the 13 000 jobs by 2032 the deal calls for the company to do its hiring in phases meeting specific targets in order to qualify for subsidies of around 3 billion the payments are part of a controversial package totaling more than 4 billion in incentives and other assistance the state agreed to in 2017 believed to be the largest such package ever offered to a foreign company in the u s the company s point person in wisconsin told cnbc that its long term goals for the project are unchanged i talked to our corporate and they have reiterated that we are committed to 13 000 jobs said peter buck executive director of the wisconsin valley science and technology park which is what the company and the state have named the development the company already missed last year s target of 260 employees it hired only 156 which meant it forfeited 10 million in credits last year the company has not said whether it will meet this year s minimum of 520 employees to collect as much as 222 million in 2020 the contract requires the company to create at least 1 820 jobs by year s end in order to receive up to 270 million more in credits the disconnect between foxconn s initial promises and reality has been deeply controversial in wisconsin and likely helped evers a democrat defeat walker a republican in last november s election as recently as april evers said the original deal with foxconn was no longer in play and that his administration was renegotiating it at the company s request the comments set off a flurry of activity with trump intervening and foxconn s then chairman terry gou traveling to the white house and to wisconsin on may 1 and 2 to smooth things over gou has since stepped down from the company to run for president of taiwan in the january 2020 election in the interview with cnbc evers first public comments about the project since gou s visit he said specifics of the contract were still under discussion but the clarity he has received has made it more of an ongoing dialogue rather than a one time renegotiation that clarity is important to me that transparency and accountability and protecting the taxpayers has always been a top priority evers said his administration has hired a consultant with industry expertise to monitor the project and is in constant conversation with the company evers said the natural outgrowth of that has been let s have some conversations around the quote unquote deal because it s not going to be what that deal was set up on it s going to be something different evers said backers of the deal including wedc secretary and ceo mark hogan a walker appointee who has announced plans to step down later this year say the experience thus far proves that the contract is functioning the way it was designed and is protecting the taxpayers the contract works they didn t create the jobs it s a performance based contract they don t get the tax credits they understand that hogan told cnbc but that does not address the taxpayer money that already has been spent on the project or the upheaval it has created on what was thousands of acres of rolling farmland 30 miles south of milwaukee under the agreement racine county and the village of mount pleasant where the facility will be located are on the hook for as much as 764 million whether foxconn meets its hiring targets or not as of the beginning of this year nearly 200 million of that already had been paid out mostly for land acquisition while foxconn s factory has yet to rise on the site the area was still a beehive of activity when cnbc visited in june nearby interstate 94 was a giant construction zone it is being widened to eight lanes from six a requirement from foxconn when it was still planning a generation 10 5 plant off the freeway crews were building new roads laying utility and drainage lines and moving tons of dirt orange construction signs pointed the way for wisconn valley trucks the impact extends beyond the neighborhood the village of mount pleasant and racine county both saw their credit ratings downgraded as a result of the money they are spending on the project in its aug 30 report downgrading mount pleasant s bond rating to aa3 from aa2 moody s investors service said the move largely reflects current and anticipated growth in the village s direct debt burden and likely growth in its overlapping debt burden tied to borrowing in support of the foxconn development village officials did not respond to cnbc s request for comment but racine county executive jonathan delagrave said the upfront costs are well worth the benefits foxconn will provide in terms of infrastructure health care and jobs i think it s been a huge huge benefit and there s certainly been a good return on our investment already delagrave told cnbc the ultimate cost benefit analysis of course depends on what foxconn ultimately builds at the site and whether it hires the numbers of people it has promised evers acknowledges the company s commitment to expand beyond 1 500 employees but he will not speculate beyond that well we will take one step at a time he said we ve learned that making sure that things are concrete and discreet and transparent takes some time and we re going to continue to do that
orwell said the choice for mankind lies between freedom and happiness and for the great bulk of mankind happiness is better nothing could be truer in the case of us pakistanis for we seem to seek happiness while willingly fritter away our freedoms according to panos mourdoukoutas professor and chair of the department of economics at liu in new york pakistan jumped from 80th to 67th on a list of 156 countries on the world happiness index announced earlier this year whereas india ranked 140th on the list in his article published in forbes magazine moudoukoutas analyses that although india is a democracy that has yet to be interrupted by military coups it has an equity market heading north compared to pakistan s equities which are spiraling south and an economy outperforming in a number of metrics according to him the reason pakistan is placed higher on the world happiness index beating india by such a wide margin is the fact that during the past couple of years the government of pakistan spent a great deal on welfare programs for the general uplift of people pakistan has been getting ahead of india in spreading the wealth to the masses he says that was then this is now sitting across the table from a bunch of disillusioned and disgruntled youth at a local coffee shop hearing them talking not about art culture films or books but increase in taxes inflation price hikes dollar rates unemployment and a general sense of despondency made me wonder about the current happiness index in pakistan the word on the streets is not positive all people are talking about the inflation caused by the escalating devaluation of pak rupee which translates into a price hike in the normal consumer items the pti assumed power on the slogans of providing employment cheap housing peppered with all the beautiful words sloganeers use for their election campaigns along with free concerts for the public but now when it s time to walk the talk the entire cabinet appears clueless according to experts commenting on the maiden budget presented by the government the budget would contract the already troubled economy resulting in job losses higher inflation rates and finally a heavy toll on the people struggling to make ends meet the pursuit of happiness is a jeffersonian principle enshrined in the constitution of the united states as a right of the citizens other countries are now catching up and also trying to make their citizens happy bhutan a tiny kingdom nestled in the himalayas has now enshrined the pursuit of happiness for every citizen in article 9 of the country s constitution becoming the first country to adopt such a resolution on february 10 2016 the uae prime minister announced the appointment of ohoud al roumi as the first minister of state for happiness the sole aim of the ministry being to initiate a national happiness and positivity program not only at the government level but also in the private sector in july 2016 madhya pradesh a state in india announced setting up a ministry of happiness to put a smile on everyone s face the new ministry s sole purpose is to track the growth in a manner based on bhutan s concept of gross national happiness madhya pradesh beside being one of india s poorest and most agrarian states also has the country s third highest suicide rate madhya pradesh also has the highest rate of infant and maternal mortality rate as well as malnutrition the present economic hardship coupled with depression rates in pakistan makes it a volatile cocktail according to the world health organization pakistan is facing a mental health crisis with rates of depression four times higher than the rest of the world since financial woes precipitate depression and being in debt broke and unemployed are all precursors to depression maybe it s time the tabdeeli brigade sets up a ministry of utmost happiness to ease the pain of the masses i am sure this government will chalk out an excellent plan since its ministers seem quite capable of making people miserable and happy at the same time they desperately need something like this to act as an anodyne and infuse some semblance of happiness while black clouds of hopelessness float above us these days pakistanis are consumed by wayward thoughts of new taxes being imposed by the government in theory the purpose of such a ministry would be to improve the level of happiness in the country through a variety of policies measuring the effectiveness of the government s various social welfare programs if there are any in sight but in reality it will just be another lie that becomes the truth just another illusion that becomes reality the writer is a freelance consultantworking on health and the environment email drmehr5 gmail com

the battle of dunkirk the 1940 allied evacuation of 338 226 belgian british and french troops from the beaches of northern france has been continually accentuated as a critical moment of the world war ii in a miracle of deliverance as winston churchill the then prime minister called it hundreds of thousands of soldiers came together in a resourceful feeling of togetherness today dunkirk remains a symbol of determination against adversity seven decades later the country has to weather another battle albeit against a different enemy in may 2010 after a series of financial failures in the united states and europe such as the insolvency of the northern rock bank collapse of lehman brothers financial deceit in the us mortgage market and large scale bank bailouts the coalition government adopted austerity measures it did so in an effort to both reduce the public sector deficit in the short term and to maintain confidence in the country s financial stability in the long term yet the politics of austerity however deeply entrenched in the popular national memory has failed to reignite the spirit of dunkirk the dramatic impact of austerity on those who are acutely reliant upon public services those who are poor marginalised and excluded is too visible to ignore regrettably this phenomenon remains to be under articulated this harmful effect of austerity on prisoners a cohort that to a greater extent than the general population suffers from physical and mental ailments as well as from rampant poverty and deprivation should not be ignored austerity is a political choice rather than an economic imperative severe cuts to national ﬁnances of greece ireland and portugal were part of their recovery plans in the uk case however while the country was not a member of the eurozone our politicians went ahead with the stringent bailout conditions that were similarly imposed on greece ireland and portugal by the europe commission the european central bank and the international monetary fund the troika large spending cuts across public programmes were didactically introduced to cover the burgeoning deficits without raising taxes the prison budget was reduced by 22 0 8 billion leading to a 30 reduction in the number of frontline prison officers even as incarceration rates plateaued this has seriously compromised the resilience of prison health agenda as its delivery is largely depending on a stable prison regime getting no direct benefits from financial bailouts prisoners have to bear the disproportionate brunt of austerity with 155 prisoners per 100 000 population england and wales have the highest incarceration rate in western europe this record imprisonment rate despite the abated crime rates remains broadly consistent dovetailing the tough stance on crime and longer sentences moreover contrary to the government cost saving ambition during the time of recession the hefty price tags of prisons 38 042 per person have not explicitly featured in any political debates while prisons are often the last bastion for prisoners to address their health and welfare needs they are no longer able to withstand austerity with fortitude fragmented access to prison healthcare exacerbated poor living conditions hindered participation in purposeful activities and increased level of violence have become the norm in 2018 mere 17 prisoners fewer than two out of ten were released from their cells for at least 10 hours a day to participate in education employment and training sessions between 2010 and 2018 suicide self harm and assault rates in english prisons increased by 23 47 and 52 respectively these statistics contradict the election pledge that prisons should be places where people are helped to turn their lives around the current prison conditions not only progressively harm physical and mental health but also create inhumane conditions to live in making prisons places of double punishment where detainees are unable to articulate their needs make decisions and or advocate for their rights the first step towards reviving the dunkirk spirit of solidarity that once emerged in the national consciousness is challenging the misnomers of austerity and imprisonment the path forward shall be paved by using alternatives to imprisonment revisiting sentencing practices using a more informed economic recovery approach introducing intergovernmental and non governmental monitoring of the compliance that health standards should not be breached as well as by naming and shaming human rights violators to come back to our roots of humanity and unity embodied by dunkirk and to springboard honest conversations about the right of prisoners to have better lives we will need to critically challenge the use of austerity in imprisonment featured image credit corridor by matthew ansley public domain via unsplash

trade commerce from across the continent including algeria morocco egypt rwanda angola ghana the morning of the 19th saw some remarkable statements from these illustrious representatives outlining what they would like to see in terms of the future of u s african trade and investment ties it was very encouraging to hear many of them describe in detail how greater partnerships with u s companies fit in well with the african union s ambitious 2063 development agenda the rapidly moving african continental free trade agreement and their own national development plans the key message was that the door is very much open for american companies to come and look for opportunities to trade and invest we were also pleased hat the united states government selected the summit as the venue to announce the kickoff of prosper africa the administration s new program to expand trade and investment between the u s and africa deputy secretary of commerce karen kelley highlighted this program in her

exchanges and helped participants make important business connections sessions on the link between business and philanthropy showcased the amazing work of a number of cca members while other sessions highlighted successful techniques for african firms to connect with american partners the closing plenary provided some food for thought in terms of where the u s and africa should look to deepen their trade and investment relationship commerce undersecretary kaplan highlighted some of the steps his department will be taking to build linkages between companies and there was general consensus that there is great opportunity for u s africa business partnerships especially in infrastructure ict and agribusiness during the summit we also held a session featuring nine agreements that were signed between companies and making clear that the summit was more than a talkfest all told it was an amazing event with more than 1300 people attending over the three days from most of the countries on the continent we thank those that attended and extend a special note of appreciation for our sponsors who made the summit possible just before the summit cca worked closely with the state department and the ethiopian government to support the ethiopian partnership forum in mid may this was a great opportunity to hear more detail from key advisers to the prime minister about how ethiopia is moving forward in implementing plans for privatization as well as attracting more foreign direct investment cca hosted a follow on session with the millennium challenge corporation which announced its ethiopia threshold program and provided more details about how it will work over the next two years immediately afterwards two senior advisers to prime minister abiy gave a much more detailed summary of their plans to attract investment and solicited company observations and concerns it was a great opportunity to hear directly from the officials directing these programs and to offer suggestions on how best to address company concerns we re already preparing for a busy rest of the summer including hosting the agoa private sector forum in abidjan august 3 right after that we ll return to new york for sessions on the margins of the un general assembly in summary there s a lot going on in the u s africa trade and investment space many african countries have made clear that they are very interested in welcoming more american companies while african companies are also looking for opportunities to partner with their american counterparts there will be the inevitable challenges and setbacks in some places but it s clearly a great time for companies to get more engaged in the search for business opportunities on the continent we look forward to updating you on these and other programs and to your collaboration with cca in promoting a robust u s africa trade and investment relationship

hamish mcrae it would be nice if we could get rid of boom and bust but a dip now beats a crash later there is a general rule in finance that things take longer to happen than you would expect but when they do they happen more violently and so it is with the next global downturn everyone worries about it for we all know there is an economic cycle it would be nice if we could get rid of boom and bust as gordon brown thought he had as chancellor but we can t for investors a downturn in america so often a bellwether for the global economy is not yet in sight the us stock market last week hit a new all time high with the standard poor s 500 index briefly going over 3 000 for uk investors the picture is more clouded for obvious reasons uncertainty about brexit and fear of a corbyn government yet despite uk assets being deeply unfashionable the ftse 100 index is within 4 per cent of the all time peak it hit last year it is easy to see what is pushing shares up the willingness of central banks to keep pumping out money last week s testimony to congress by jay powell chairman of the us federal reserve confirmed that the fed would keep credit flowing and the markets expect a cut in interest rates later this month the european central bank is expected to keep the taps open too and in the bank of england has leeway to cut rates if needed but if it is easy to see what is pushing shares up it is harder to judge what might pull them and the economy down in the past it has often been a sudden rise in inflation driven by higher oil and raw material prices remember the so called oil shocks sometimes it has been wage inflation with tight job markets leading to people demanding and getting higher pay but neither of those looks likely now encouragingly joblessness is at its lowest level since the 1970s in the uk and us despite signs of pay pressures maybe unemployment can go lower still there could be a financial bubble such as the dotcom boom of the late 1990s or the boom in sub prime lending that collapsed in 2008 or a downturn could simply be triggered by bad economic policies the trade war rumblings between the us and china and maybe soon between the us and eu cannot help ultimately though while it would be great to pinpoint the key issue that will send us into a global recession we have to honest and admit we can t we can see warning signs such as weak demand for uk jobs as we report on page 12 and we can make a best guess my own is for a not too serious global downturn starting next year but of this i am sure the longer the downturn is delayed and the more global asset prices are pumped up to keep things moving the harder the bump when we fall better to have a small recession in 2020 than a humdinger in 2022 new car sales are the best immediate indicator of consumer confidence not only are they the biggest big ticket item people buy but also we can probably hang on to the old car if we are worried about our finances so look at this car sales in china the world s biggest market are down 14 per cent in the first six months of this year compared with the same period last year in india until recently the fastest growing large market they are running down 25 per cent year on year and globally according to germany s centre for automotive research they are likely to be down 4 million the largest fall since 2008 uk car sales are down only 3 4 per cent in the first half of this year if you are in the motor trade this is a disaster there are stories of desperate dealers in china offering bogofs buy one get one free a supermarket trick to bump up sales but from global perspective well maybe the downturn noted above is gathering pace we should always be careful of political scare stories but the first evidence of damage to the economy from fears of a corbyn government came last week the 2 billion sale of electricity north west which delivers electricity and gas across the uk was abandoned the reason labour renationalisation plans if you say you will nationalise companies without full compensation don t expect investors to knock at your door

indiana laughter so i can t tell you how good i feel just being back on a farm so would you join me in thanking doug and julie freitas for being such great hosts and being such a great example of the american family farm let s hear it for them applause thank you so thank you all for that now before i get started on the subject of the day let me let me just say a few words as your vice president about something that i know has been on everyone s minds here in california and frankly has been on the hearts of every american and when i landed just a few hours ago on air force two i was pleased to get a briefing from cal oes and the u s geological survey and fema about last week s earthquakes near ridgecrest now these were serious earthquakes and i want you to know the american people know that they were incredibly powerful and we thank god that they weren t worse and i want to assure each and every one of you all across the state of california that at the president s direction our administration is already hard at work supporting the recovery efforts the president issued an emergency declaration to make federal resources available and we are working with state and local officials to speed that support to families applause but two more messages first and foremost i have to tell you the fact that at the present within the state of california there are no reported loss of life it wasn t worse it is a tribute to many people but no one more so than our first responders so can we give a round of applause to all of those who responded so swiftly in the wake of the earthquakes job well done applause and i also have a message to all the people across ridgecrest and all the affected areas i want to assure you that the american people are with you and we will stay with you and provide the support to you and your communities until you rebuilt bigger and better than ever before and that s a promise applause so god bless them all applause thank you for that with that let me just say again it is great to be back on a farm great to be back with all of you you know i mentioned i was raised in the heart of the heartland in a small town in southern indiana i had a cornfield in my backyard that cornfield is still there to this day i grew up among farmers i wasn t raised on a farm but we owned some cattle when i was growing up and had a few horses i want to tell you i cleaned more my share of stalls in my day good preparation for service in washington d c laughter and applause you know the truth is in america just like here in the san joaquin valley we do two things particularly well we make things and we grow things and here in california that is especially true on the latter front i want you to know that we know california is the most agriculturally diverse state in america and the san joaquin valley is one of the most dynamic agricultural areas in the world and we want to see it prosper even more applause i mean the president and i firmly believe that america is many things but at our core throughout our history america is agriculture what you sow our nation reaps and what you plant bears fruit all over the world you know the dignity of a hard day s work your values echo through communities and states all across this nation you model every day the grit that drives our nation forward and people of agriculture and people of the farm always have you in every sense embody the virtues and the values that are at the root of american greatness that is the american farm applause you know the president put it well he said one time quote our nation was founded by farmers our independence was won by farmers our continent was tamed by farmers our armies have been fed by farmers and made of farmers and throughout our history farmers have always led the way and it ll always be true applause and in every decision that we ve made in this administration the president made a solemn promise that we would be honoring and supporting america s proud farming legacy and that s what we ve done and that s what brings me here today you think of the last two and a half years it s been a remarkable journey for our country i mean the truth is this president has been putting family farmers and small businesses and businesses of every size first and america s economy is booming from the first day of this administration we ve rolled back red tape at a historic pace and i remember back on the campaign trail the president promised that we would repeal two federal regulations for every one new federal rule put on the books and i m here to admit to our friends in california that we haven t exactly done that we ve actually repealed 14 federal regulations for every new federal rule put on the books applause in fact we ve already cancelled or delayed more than 1 500 planned rules that s more than any president in american history we are clearing away the red tape in the city and on the farm applause and it s made a difference right here for farmers in the san joaquin valley for instance to ensure that farmers and ranchers in this state and all across america can control the land that you own and possess and develop this president repealed the waters of the usa rule we ve reaffirmed our commitment to private property in america applause and we did something also important for family farms just like this one i know that doug and julie want to pass this extraordinary third generation farm on to joshua and aaron and thanks to president donald trump and our supporters in the congress that s going to be a whole lot easier because this president signed a tax cut that eliminated a tax the death tax for nearly every family farmer in america so you can keep your farms in your family applause i mean we cut taxes across the board in the city and on the farm we cut taxes for working families we doubled the child tax credit we doubled the standard deduction so american families now can actually get their first 24 000 in income completely tax free and thanks to the president s tax reforms farmers as you all know already i m sure can now deduct 100 percent of the cost of every piece of new equipment you buy applause those input costs can be completely deducted in the year you make that purchase it makes a difference applause i remember back in indiana people would talk about farm income and i d be the first one back when i was a congressman and when i was a governor to remind people about what you all called an input cost on farming i mean those tractors those combines that equipment that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and the president understood that our allies in the congress understood that and now we make it more possible for your family farm to thrive you know it s amazing to think in the last two and a half years we ve rolled back red tape we ve cut taxes we ve unleashed american energy and as i said the results have been remarkable since election day businesses large and small across this country have created more than 6 million new good paying jobs including 800 000 jobs right here in the state of california applause you know we like to say there s only way you can describe the last two and half years it s been two and a half years action applause it s been two and a half years of results applause it s been two and a half years of promises made and promises kept california and we re just getting started applause you know but for all the progress we ve made over the last two and a half years i can tell you that s just what president trump calls a good start applause and i m here because california s farmers and america s farmers and businesses large and small need the kind of free fair and reciprocal trade deals that will put american jobs and american workers first we ve been busy about that we renegotiated a deal with south korea we ve been opening access to markets all across the country but the president the president made it clear in the course of that campaign that he believed that nafta had not served american workers and american jobs and american farmers well and we promised to renegotiate that agreement and that we did i watched the president as he drove a hard bargain and that s why we need to approve the united states mexico canada agreement because it s a win for american farmers and a win for american business and workers applause it s really why i m here it s really why i m here i ve been literally traveling all across the country over the last several months talking about the usmca and the difference that it s going to make not only in agriculture but in industries all across this economy but i wanted to come here to california here in the san joaquin valley because you all understand the global impact of our agricultural economy and the need to have a trade deal here with our neighbors to the north and the south that really puts american agriculture first and that s exactly what we ve done i mean here in california this great state already exports more than 48 billion in goods and services to canada and mexico alone and under the usmca we know that number is going to grow which is going to create even more jobs and more opportunity in the city and on the farm all across the san joaquin valley applause it s going to do it i promise you when congress finally ratifies the usmca we ll have trading rules that support innovation by addressing biotechnology poultry producers are going to have new access to canada for chicken and eggs and expanded access for turkey audience member woo the vice president and the usmc somebody is excited about that laughter making thanksgiving plans over there laughter and the usmca will update rules of origin for processed fruits to ensure preferences benefit u s producers california applause okay the deal is also help ranchers and farmers sell more at greater profits canada is going to end this class 6 and class 7 programs that allow cheap dairy products to undersell american dairy producers all around the world the usmca is going to help countless farmers across the country and right here in california that s going to be especially true like a dairy farmer from riverdale who is with us today i m told that he married the daughter of a dairy farmer he s been in the dairy business for 18 years and all their dairy products go to california dairies whose biggest customer happens to be our neighbor to the south in mexico and once the usmca goes into effect it s all but certain that their dairy business is going to flourish like never before so would you join me in recognizing the proud owner of j d wilson and sons jim wilson jim thanks for being here applause thanks for being such a great example of agriculture in california we also have with us the second and third generation owners of a dairy farm that s about 15 miles down the road it was founded in 1916 and is still family owned that s an incredible thing they re also a member of the same co op as j d wilson and they re pillars of the community and they represent all that s great about agriculture here in california so would you join me in welcoming 90 year young johnny fagundes iii and his proud son john fagundes iv where are you guys applause there you are men thank you thank you good to see you johnny you know improving dairy sales is going to be good for jim john and their family businesses and johnny is excited about it too and i have to tell you i watched this president drive a hard bargain johnny on dairy with canada you know what they were doing up in canada and this president just stood firm and said it s got to change he put american dairy first and the usmca is a win for american dairy applause and what s good for dairy is also good for hay and feed farmers like doug and julie and i know they re just as excited about that all right i know it s got to go in the front before it comes out the bottom laughter we had some cows that s what i got in total according to the international trade commission the usmca we think is actually going to add 176 000 jobs to our economy and 68 billion of investment that s real results applause according to some conservative estimates american exports to canada are going to increase by 19 billion and exports to mexico are going to increase by 14 billion the itc also tells us the usmca will increase annual u s agricultural and food exports by 2 2 billion all by itself applause and that includes and johnny that includes 314 million in additional u s dairy exports it s going to happen it s absolutely essential that we get the usmca passed by the congress because it s going to finally give american farmers and american workers the level playing field that we need here all across north america to be able to compete and win and we re simply not going to we re simply not going to allow under this administration and this president we re not going to allow outdated trade deals to hurt american farmers or american workers anymore applause that s why we need the usmca we re not going to let trade deals undermine good jobs the jobs that build and sustain our middle class and are rebuilding our middle class today but i m here today to tell you the president has done his job i was there watching him in the negotiations when he did it and canada and mexico have reached an agreement they ve already begun to make progress in their legislative chambers in approving this agreement so the president has done his job our neighbors have done their job now it s time for congress to do their job and pass the usmca this year applause but make no mistake about it you all are going to be the difference the voice of american farmers needs to be heard as congress takes up and considers this legislation in the weeks and months ahead and i just want to tell you the members of congress in both political parties all across california need to hear from you there is no force in america more powerful than the concerted voice of the american people so california farmers let your voice be heard applause i want to encourage each and every one of you really i hope you leave here today with a little bit of burden on your heart that you re going to pick up the phone make a respectful phone call to your local congressman in either political party send them an e mail drop them a note let them know just how just say i ran into mike the other day over at doug and julie s laughter and you could say you know i thought this usmca was a good deal but i didn t know it was that good a deal and it s going to be good for california it s going to be good for america and just tell them how important it is to you and to your community and to your farms and to your ranches i mean the truth is we need the usmca we need the usmca for san joaquin valley we need it for california and we need it for america so go out there and tell the story tell people how this agreement is going to put american farmers and american workers first and make no mistake about it your voice will make a difference and so let me just thank you all thank you all for being here today and while i m at it my wife is i think she s visiting some beekeepers or something laughter but we re going to catch up in vandenberg air force base in a little bit we flew out here today and you know there s not a day goes by that we aren t deeply humbled by the privilege that the american people and all of you have afforded us so on behalf of my little family can i just say thank you thank you for the privilege of serving as your vice president at such a time as this applause it s the greatest honor of my life thank you thank you very much thank you very much and also just thanks for being who you are you know i you know that book i try and open every morning has a phrase that says consider the farmer so many times the nazarene actually pointed to the farmer who not just tilled the soil but had the virtues of faith and character and generosity and neighborliness and i just want you to know that as you contribute to our economy your character and your faith contributes to this nation so thank you for being who you are applause and in these challenging times in the life of our nation where it seems like there s more focus on what divides us any more than what unites us i ll always believe that there s more that unites the american people than could ever divide us and chief among that is faith and so i encourage you to have faith applause have faith in the american people and the ability of our nation to find our way forward not just with deals like the usmca but to continue to advance policies that will make us more secure and more prosperous and have faith in the leaders that we ve elected to every level from that president on down to keep the promise that we made to each and every one of you and keep fighting for every one of you and finally just have faith that he who placed this miracle of democracy on these wilderness shores will still surely bless america if we will just turn our hearts to him applause and so i encourage you to pray pray for america pray for all the people of america in this one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all because prayer matters i believe it with all my heart applause so with that thank you again for coming out i look forward to meeting as many of you as time permits i m just absolutely convinced that with the progress that we ve made as a nation to this day with new deals like the usmca we ll sign into law with president donald trump in the white house and with god s help we re going to make california and america more prosperous than ever before and to borrow a phrase we will make america great again thanks everybody applause god bless you god bless america
unlike sen bernie sanders i vt one of her competitors for the democratic presidential nomination sen elizabeth warren d mass rejects the socialist label insisting that she s a capitalist to the bone however warren s economic policies bespeak a socialist s ambition to empower government and the elites who control it rather than an understanding of capitalism s potential to create opportunity and reward individual achievement on the campaign trail warren s favorite phrase is i ve got a plan for that unfortunately this capitalist to the bone means that for every problem we face she s got a plan to expand and empower government andy puzder bernie sanders doesn t have a clue about economics 101 and that s scary for example warren advocates removing private enterprise from the health care sector which represents about 20 percent of our economy a supporter of medicare for all she was one of only two candidates in the recent democratic presidential debates who raised her hand in support of totally eliminating private health insurance the other was new york city mayor bill de blasio it s hard to argue with the notion that as a nation we should work to reduce costs and increase the quality of health care but a capitalist would understand that the only thing that has ever reduced costs and increased quality is competition and that competition is the first thing to die whenever the government takes control only a socialist could believe that increasing government control in any economic sector would cause prices to decline or quality to improve warren also supports and even co sponsored rep alexandria ocasio cortez s d n y green new deal gnd the gnd proposes extensive government control over the energy transportation and construction sectors allowing government elites to dictate business goals discouraging innovation and investment while restricting what consumers would have the option to purchase as a justification for this massive act of government empowerment the gnd primarily offers climate change which it blames for economic injustice disproportionally affecting communities of color the poor low income workers women people with disabilities and youth among others a capitalist might note that over the past two years each of these groups has experienced an unemployment rate at or near historic lows with wage growth accelerating at rates not seen in a decade and at a faster pace for low wage workers all this is due to a reduction in taxes and government regulation plus a focus on domestic energy production a capitalist might also acknowledge that thanks to private sector innovation we have an abundance of clean burning natural gas that has allowed the u s to reduce its carbon emissions more than any other nation of course tax increases are a cornerstone to warren s economic policies she wants to repeal the republican tax cuts that have been so vital to the current economic boom while declining to say what the top individual tax rate should be she has refused to rule out 50 percent for corporations she would eliminate the current 21 percent rate and restore the growth killing rate of 35 percent which was the highest and least competitive rate among the organization for economic cooperation and development s member nations but increasing existing tax rates isn t enough for the capitalist to the bone warren let s start with a wealth tax in america she declared in homage to class warfare during the first democratic presidential debate and what a tax it would be according to warren s campaign website this annual tax on wealthy americans would cover all household assets held anywhere in the world including residences closely held businesses assets held in trust retirement assets assets held by minor children and personal property with a value of 50 000 or more of course warren proposes redistributing the additional revenue she believes her increased taxes would produce through a myriad of new government benefits which would put the government in charge of housing child care and education while making down payments on a green new deal and medicare for all let s be honest warren s attempt to identify as a capitalist to the bone is simply absurd her campaign mantra is little more than an updated version of the repeatedly disproven claim that socialism is necessary to protect the oppressed masses from capitalist greed from the former soviet union to modern day venezuela this myth has turned potentially productive nations into totalitarian disasters populated by oppressed and starving masses while warren does not call for direct government ownership of the means of production distribution and exchange as is the case with traditional socialism she advocates state control over these economic building blocks through laws regulations taxation redistribution and a massive federal bureaucracy it s a distinction without a difference traditional socialism s primary fault was that it empowered government over individuals eliminating the incentive for individuals to be productive absent that incentive economic growth in socialist countries inevitably declines and their economies either collapse or their citizens live in abject poverty under the authoritarian control of government elites click here to get the fox news app would substituting warren s pervasive government control for government ownership avoid traditional socialism s pitfalls clearly it would not warren s brand of socialism would virtually eliminate the incentive for entrepreneurs innovators and the leaders of private sector firms to succeed just like traditional socialism and nothing like capitalism in her dna warren is no more a capitalist than she is a native american click here for more from
