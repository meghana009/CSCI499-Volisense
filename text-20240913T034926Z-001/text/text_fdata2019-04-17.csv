our malls with digital communication and move to help our retailers provide omnichannel offers our media platform now has in excess of 200 000 active subscribers and has recorded millions of views content is coming from a variety of sources in 2018 a particularly popular video experiment borrowed from the harry potter films and projected ghosts flying through our prospekt mall the response resulted in thousands of views without any advertising and made clear the potential to do more to link this style of interaction with sales promotions as always our approach is to work collaboratively with retailers and consumers sharing data together and building trust and respect with the aim of everyone achieving their goals through working together as a result the number of tenants working with e commerce has nearly doubled from 39 to 72 as previously announced we invested in an online portal for tenants providing a broad range of tools for tenants use from access to administrative resources to a range of potential revenue generating opportunities for tenants to participate in merchandising mix is at the heart of every successful mall knowing our customers and understanding their aspirations is key 42 1 of our revenue from tenants across our 5 malls are from fashion stores with the balance of revenue being 6 4 health and beauty 8 3 restaurants and food 9 0 entertainment services 10 1 accessories jewellery and homeware 10 4 electronics and 13 7 hypermarkets in the third quarter of 2018 there was a focus on strengthening our presence in fashion including men s fashion with each shopping mall introducing 2 3 new popular clothing stores both ukrainian and international brands these efforts are clearly producing results given the 6 increase in visitor numbers during the year alongside achieving a good mix of tenants an important reason behind the popularity of the group s shopping centres is having the right balance of social spaces within each centre with this in place visitors can come and find their favourite retailers under one roof and also enjoy the well designed social spaces in which to meet eat and relax in terms of the new developments the group is progressing projects in odesa and lukyanivka kyiv the main focus is on development of the lukyanivka project construction is underway with initial financing completed in february 2019 and the project remains on track to complete in 2021 outlook these results reflect the success of our hard work over the last 5 years our malls are market leading and to maintain this position we are focused on the future it is clear shopping is going through an evolution here as it is elsewhere as the convenience of online purchases is altering traditional habits rather than this be a challenge we see it as an opportunity and we are responding accordingly our work with consumers and retailers on digital communications is proving successful not only in creating new experiences but also in strengthening the relationships we enjoy with both these groups this together with all the other elements of our business means we are confident of being able to continue to increase revenues in 2019 in line with

in ukraine and leasing them out as at 31 december 2018 the group operated five shopping centres in kyiv simferopol zaporizhzhya and kryvyi rig with a total leasable area of over 147 300 square meters and was and remains in the process of development of two new investment projects in kyiv and odesa with one more project to be developed the average number of employees employed by the group during the year is 103 2017 106 b ukrainian business environment the group s operations are primarily located in ukraine the political and economic situation in ukraine has been subject to significant turbulence in recent years and demonstrates characteristics of an emerging market consequently operations in the country involve risks that do not typically exist in other markets an armed conflict in certain parts of lugansk and donetsk regions which started in spring 2014 has not been resolved and part of the donetsk and lugansk regions remains under control of the self proclaimed republics and ukrainian authorities are not currently able to fully enforce ukrainian laws in this territory various events in march 2014 led to the accession of the republic of crimea to the russian federation which was not recognised by ukraine and many other countries this event resulted in a significant deterioration of the relationship between ukraine and the russian federation in november 2018 following an incident between the russian and ukrainian military around a waterway connecting the azov sea and the black sea the ukrainian authorities introduced martial law for a 30 days period in 10 regions located along the russian and moldovian border the azov sea and the black sea coast the martial law was terminated at the end of december 2018 after 30 days ukraine s economic situation deteriorated significantly in 2014 2016 as a result of the fall in trade with the russian federation and military tensions in eastern ukraine although instability continued throughout 2017 2018 the ukrainian economy continued to show signs of recovery with the inflation rate slowing down reduced depreciation of hryvnia against major foreign currencies growing international reserves of the national bank of ukraine the nbu and a general revival in business activity during 2016 2018 the nbu took certain steps to provide relief to the currency control restrictions introduced in 2014 2015 in particular the required share of foreign currency proceeds subject to mandatory sale on the interbank market was gradually decreased while the settlement period for export import transactions in foreign currency was increased also the nbu allowed ukrainian companies to pay dividends abroad subject to a certain monthly limitation in february 2019 a new law on currency and currency transactions came into force the new law abolished a number of restrictions defined new principles of currency operations currency regulation and supervision and resulted in significant liberalisation of foreign currency transactions and capital movements the banking system remains fragile due to low level of capital and weak asset quality and ukrainian companies and banks continue to suffer from a lack of funding from domestic and international financial markets the international monetary fund the imf continued to support the ukrainian government under the four year extended fund facility the eff program approved in march 2015 in october 2018 the government of ukraine reached an agreement with the imf on a new fourteen months stand by program which will replace the existing eff program other international financial institutions have also provided significant technical support in recent years to help ukraine restructure its external debt and launch various reforms including anti corruption corporate law and gradual liberalization of the energy sector in december 2018 moody s upgraded ukraine s credit rating to caa1 with a stable outlook reflecting the reaching of an agreement on further cooperation with the imf positive expectations regarding certain reforms and improved foreign affairs further stabilisation of economic and political environment depends on the continued implementation of structural reforms and other factors whilst management believes it is taking appropriate measures to support the sustainability of the group s business in the current circumstances a continuation of the current unstable business environment could negatively affect the group s results and financial position in a manner not currently determinable these consolidated financial statements reflect management s current assessment of the impact of the ukrainian business environment on the operations and the financial position of the group the future business environment may differ from management s assessment c cyprus business environment the cyprus economy has been adversely affected during the last few years by the economic crisis the negative effects have to some extent been resolved following the negotiations and the relevant agreements reached with the european commission the european central bank and the international monetary fund imf for financial assistance which was dependent on the formulation and the successful implementation of an economic adjustment program the agreements also resulted in the restructuring of the two largest systemic banks in cyprus through a bail in the cyprus government has successfully completed earlier than anticipated the economic adjustments program and exited the imf program on 7 march 2016 after having recovered in the international markets and having only used eur 7 25 billion of the total eur 10 billion earmarked in the financial bailout under the new euro area rules cyprus will continue to be under surveillance by its lenders with bi annual post program visits until it repays 75 of the economic assistance received although there are signs of improvement especially in the macroeconomic environment of the country s economy including growth in gdp and reducing unemployment rates significant challenges remain that could affect the estimates of the group s cash flows and its assessment of impairment of financial and non financial assets the group s management believes that it is taking all the necessary measures to maintain the viability of the group and the development of its business in the current business and economic environment and that no adverse impact on the group s operations is expected d russian business environment the group s operations are also carried out in the russian federation consequently the group is exposed to the economic and financial markets of the russian federation which display characteristics of an emerging market the legal tax and regulatory frameworks continue development but are subject to varying interpretations and frequent changes which together with other legal and fiscal impediments contribute to the challenges faced by entities operating in the russian federation starting in 2014 the united states of america the european union and some other countries imposed and gradually expanded economic sanctions against a number of russian individuals and legal entities the imposition of the sanctions has led to increased economic uncertainty including more volatile equity markets a depreciation of the russian rouble a reduction in both local and foreign direct investment inflows and a significant tightening in the availability of credit as a result some russian entities may experience difficulties accessing the international equity and debt markets and may become increasingly dependent on state support for their operations the longer term effects of the imposed and possible additional sanctions are difficult to determine the consolidated financial statements reflect management s assessment of the impact of the russian business environment on the operations and the financial position of the group the future business environment may differ from management s assessment 2 basis of preparation a statement of compliance these consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with

that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets liabilities income and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities actual results may differ from these estimates estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any

conclude a number of new tenancy agreements and increase occupancy rate of its shopping centres besides the group managed to gradually increase its rental rates during the year for existing tenants in accordance with the budget approved for 2019 the group plans to increase its operating income during the next year management believes that the measures that it undertakes as described above will allow the group to maintain the positive working capital and operate on a going concern basis in the foreseeable future these consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realisation of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business f measurement of fair values a number of the group s accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values for both financial and non financial assets and liabilities when measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability the group uses market observable data as far as possible fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows level 1 quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly i e as prices or indirectly i e derived from prices level 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs if the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability might be categorised in different levels of the fair value hierarchy then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement the group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred further information about the assumptions made in measuring fair values is included in the following notes note 4 investment property and note 21 f iii fair values g change in presentation management

business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date which is the date on which control is transferred to the group the group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as the fair value of the consideration transferred plus the recognised amount of any non controlling interests in the acquiree plus if the business combination is achieved in stages the fair value of the pre existing equity interest in the acquiree less the net recognised amount generally fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed when the excess is negative a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss the consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre existing relationships such amounts are generally recognised in profit or loss transaction costs other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities that the group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date if an obligation to pay contingent consideration that meets the definition of a financial instrument is classified as equity then it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity otherwise other contingent consideration is remeasured at fair value at each reporting date and subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss when the acquisition of subsidiaries does not represent a business it is accounted for as an acquisition of a group of assets and liabilities the cost of the acquisition is allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based on their relative fair values and no goodwill or deferred tax is

measures the allowance for impairment is described in note 3 j the determination of the business model within which a financial asset is held has been made on the basis of the facts and circumstances that existed at the date of initial application policy applicable after 1 january 2018 i recognition and initial measurement trade receivables are initially recognised when they are originated all other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument a financial asset unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus for an item not at fvtpl transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue a trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price ii derecognition the group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the group neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset the group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled or expire the group also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value on derecognition of a financial liability the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid including any non cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed is recognised in profit or loss iii classification and subsequent measurement of financial assets on initial recognition a financial asset is classified as measured at amortised cost fvoci debt investment fvoci equity investment or fvtpl financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the group changes its business model for managing financial assets in which case all

the following conditions and is not designated as at fvtpl it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows and its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding a debt investment is measured at fvoci if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at fvtpl it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and its contractual terms give

losses interest income foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss any gain or loss on derecognition is recognised in profit or loss cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances on the current accounts and call deposits iv financial assets business model assessment the group makes an assessment of the objective of the business model in which a financial asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed and information is provided to management the information considered includes the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice these include whether management s strategy focuses on earning contractual interest income maintaining a particular interest rate profile matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of any related liabilities or expected cash outflows or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the group s management the risks that affect the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model and how those risks are managed how managers of the business are compensated e g whether compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or the contractual cash flows collected and the frequency volume and timing of sales of financial assets in prior periods the reasons for such sales and expectations about future sales activity transfers of financial assets to third parties in transactions that do not qualify for derecognition are not considered sales for this purpose consistent with the group s continuing recognition of the assets financial assets that are held for trading or are managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at fvtpl v financial assets assessment whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest for the purposes of this assessment principal is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition interest is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs e g liquidity risk and administrative costs as well as a profit margin in assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest the group considers the contractual terms of the instrument this includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition in making this assessment the group considers contingent events that would change the amount or timing of cash flows terms that may adjust the contractual coupon rate including variable rate features prepayment and extension features

the prepayment amount substantially represents unpaid amounts of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding which may include reasonable additional compensation for early termination of the contract additionally for a financial asset acquired at a discount or premium to its contractual par amount a feature that permits or requires prepayment at an amount that substantially represents the contractual par amount plus accrued but unpaid contractual interest which may also include reasonable additional compensation for early termination is treated as consistent with this criterion if the fair value of the prepayment feature is insignificant at initial recognition vi classification and subsequent measurement of financial liabilities financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost or fvtpl a financial liability is classified as at fvtpl if it meets the definition of held for trading or it is designated as such on initial recognition financial liabilities at fvtpl are measured at fair value and net gains and losses including any interest expense are recognised in profit or loss except for the part of the fair value change that is due to changes in the group s own credit risk that is recognised in other comprehensive income other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in profit or loss the group measures all of its financial liabilities at amortised cost vii offsetting financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statements of financial position when and only when the group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously the group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off if that right is not contingent on a future event and enforceable both in the normal course of business and in the event of default insolvency or bankruptcy of the group and all counterparties policy applicable before 1 january 2018 the group classified its non derivative financial assets as loans and receivables and available for sale financial assets the group classified non derivative financial liabilities into the other financial liabilities category i non derivative financial assets and financial liabilities recognition and derecognition the group initially recognised loans and receivables on the date that they are originated all other financial assets and financial liabilities were recognised initially on the trade date at which the group became a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument the group derecognised a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expired or it transferred the rights to receive the contractual cash flows on the financial asset in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset were transferred any interest in transferred financial assets that was created or retained by the group was recognised as a separate asset or liability ii derecognition the group derecognised a financial liability when its contractual obligations were discharged or cancelled or expired financial assets and liabilities were offset and the net amount was presented in the consolidated statement of financial position when and only when the group had a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and intended either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously the group had a legally enforceable right to set off if that right is not contingent on a future event and enforceable both in the normal course of business and in the event of default insolvency or bankruptcy of the group and all counterparties iii non derivative financial assets measurement loans and receivables loans and receivables were a category of financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that were not quoted in an active market such assets were recognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs subsequent to initial recognition loans and receivables were measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any impairment losses loans and receivables comprised the following classes of financial assets trade and other receivables loans receivable and cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents comprised cash balances call deposits and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less from the acquisition date that were subject to insignificant risk of changes in their fair value iv non derivative financial liabilities measurement the group classified non derivative financial liabilities into the other financial liabilities category such financial liabilities were recognised initially at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs subsequent to initial recognition these financial liabilities were measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method other financial liabilities comprised loans and borrowings finance lease liability trade and other payables and other liabilities d capital and reserves share capital ordinary shares are classified as equity incremental costs directly attributable to issue of ordinary shares are recognised as a deduction from equity net of any tax effects more to follow dow jones newswires april 17 2019 02 04 et 06 04 gmt dj arricano real estate plc final results 10 share premium share premium reserves include amounts that were created due to the issue of share capital at a value price greater than the nominal non reciprocal shareholders contribution non reciprocal shareholders contribution reserve includes contributions made by the shareholders directly in the reserves the shareholders do not have any rights to these contributions which are distributable at the discretion of the board of directors subject to the shareholders approval retained earnings retained earnings include accumulated profits and losses incurred by the group other reserves other reserves comprise the effect of acquisition and disposal of subsidiaries under common control change in non controlling interest in these subsidiaries and the effect of forfeiture of shares foreign currency translation differences foreign currency translation differences comprise foreign currency differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations and foreign exchange gains and losses from monetary items that form part of the net investment in the foreign operation e investment properties investment properties are those that are held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or for both but not for sale in the ordinary course of business use in production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes investment properties principally comprise freehold land leasehold land and investment properties held for rental income earning or future redevelopment leasehold of land under operating lease is classified and accounted for as an investment property when the definition of investment property is met under investment property accounting the right to use the land is measured at fair value and the obligation to pay rentals is accounted for as a finance lease i initial measurement and recognition investment properties are measured initially at cost including related acquisition costs cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the investment property the cost of self constructed investment property includes the cost of materials and direct labour any other costs directly attributable to bringing the investment property to a working condition for their intended use and capitalised borrowing costs if the group uses part of the property for its own use and part to earn rentals or for capital appreciation and the portions can be sold or leased out separately they are accounted for separately therefore the part that is rented out is investment property if the portions cannot be sold or leased out separately the property is investment property only if the company occupied portion is insignificant ii subsequent measurement subsequent to initial recognition investment properties are stated at fair value any gain or loss arising from a change in fair value is included in profit or loss in the period in which it arises when the group begins to redevelop an existing investment property for continued future use as investment property the property remains an investment property which is measured at fair value and is not reclassified to property and equipment during the redevelopment when the use of a property changes such that it is reclassified as property plant and equipment its fair value at the date of reclassification becomes its cost for subsequent accounting investment properties are derecognised on disposal or when they are permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefits are expected from their disposal the gain or loss on disposal is calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised as gain or loss in profit or loss it is the group s policy that an external independent valuation company having an appropriate recognised professional qualification and recent experience in the location and category of property being appraised values the portfolio as at each reporting date the fair value is the amount for which a property could be exchanged on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm s length transaction the valuation is prepared in accordance with international valuation standards published by the international valuation standards council iii property under development construction property that is being constructed or developed for future use as an investment property and for which it is not possible to reliably determine fair value is accounted for as an investment property that is stated at cost until construction or development is complete or until it becomes possible to reliably determine its fair value when construction is performed on land previously classified as an investment property and measured at fair value such land continues to be accounted at fair value throughout the construction phase f property and equipment i recognition and measurement items of property and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset the cost of self constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labor any other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use and the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that equipment when parts of an item of property and equipment have different useful lives they are accounted for as separate items major components of property and equipment the gain or loss on disposal of an item of property and equipment is determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property and equipment and is recognised net within other income other operating expenses in profit or loss ii reclassification to investment property when the use of a property changes from owner occupied to investment property the property is re measured to fair value and reclassified to investment property any gain arising on re measurement is recognised in profit or loss to the extent that it reverses a previous impairment loss on the specific property with any remaining gain recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the revaluation reserve in equity any loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss iii subsequent costs the cost of replacing part of an item of property and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the group and its cost can be measured reliably the costs of the day to day servicing of property and equipment are recognised in profit or loss as incurred iv depreciation items of property and equipment are depreciated from the date that they are installed and are ready for use or in respect of internally constructed assets from the date that the asset is completed and ready for use depreciation is based on the cost of an asset less its residual value depreciation is recognised in profit or loss on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property and equipment leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term land is not depreciated the estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods are as follows vehicles and equipment 5 years fixture and fittings 2 5 5 years depreciation methods useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted if appropriate g intangible assets i recognition and measurement intangible assets that are acquired by the group which have finite useful lives are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses ii subsequent expenditure subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates all other expenditure including expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in profit or loss as incurred iii amortisation amortisation is calculated over the cost of the asset or other amount substituted for cost less its residual value amortisation is recognised in profit or loss on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets other than goodwill from the date that they are available for use since this most closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset the estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods are as follows software 3 5 years amortisation methods useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted if appropriate h inventories inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value the cost of inventories is based on the first in first out principle and more to follow dow jones newswires april 17 2019 02 04 et 06 04 gmt dj arricano real estate plc final results 11 includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses i assets classified as held for sale non current assets or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities that are expected to be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use are classified as held for sale such assets or disposal group are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell any impairment loss on a disposal group is allocated first to goodwill and then to the remaining assets and liabilities on pro rata basis except that no loss is allocated to inventories financial assets deferred tax assets or investment property which continue to be measured in accordance with the group s other accounting policies impairment losses on initial classification as held for sale and subsequent gains or losses on remeasurement are recognised in profit or loss gains are not recognised in excess of any cumulative impairment loss intangible assets and property and equipment once classified as held for sale are not amortised or depreciated j impairment i impairment financial assets policy applicable from 1 january 2018 the group uses expected credit loss ecl model this impairment model applies to financial assets measured at amortised cost contract assets but not to investments in equity instruments the financial assets at amortised cost consist of trade and other receivables cash and cash equivalents and loans receivable loss allowances are measured on either of the following bases 12 month ecls these are ecls that result from possible default events within the 12 months after the reporting date and lifetime ecls these are ecls that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument the group measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ecls except for bank balances for which credit risk i e the risk of default occurring over the expected life of the financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition for which loss allowances are measured as 12 month ecls when determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ecls the group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort this includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis based on the group s historical experience and informed credit assessment the group assumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly if it is more than 30 days past due the group considers a financial asset to be in default when the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the group in full without recourse by the group to actions such as realising security if any is held or the financial asset is more than 90 days past due the maximum period considered when estimating ecls is the maximum contractual period over which the group is exposed to credit risk measurement of ecls ecls are a probability weighted estimate of credit losses credit losses are measured as the present value of all cash shortfalls i e the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the group expects to receive ecls are discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset credit impaired financial assets at each reporting date the group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost are credit impaired a financial asset is credit impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred presentation of allowance for ecl loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortised cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets impairment losses related to trade and other receivables are presented under operating expenses and impairment losses on other financial assets are presented under finance costs similar to the presentation under ias 39 and not presented separately in the consolidated interim condensed statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income due to materiality considerations as at 1 january 2018 there was no change in the allowance for impairment for the group s financial assets due to implementation of ifrs 9 ii non financial assets the carrying amounts of non financial assets other than investment property deferred tax assets and inventory are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment if any such indication exists then the asset s recoverable amount is estimated for goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives or that are not yet available for use the recoverable amount is estimated each year at the same time for the purpose of impairment testing assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or cash generating unit cgu subject to an operating segment ceiling test for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing cgus to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment testing is performed reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of cgus that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination the group s corporate assets do not generate separate cash inflows and are utilised by more than one cgu corporate assets are allocated to cgus on a reasonable and consistent basis and tested for impairment as part of the testing of the cgu to which the corporate asset is allocated the recoverable amount of an asset or cgu is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell in assessing value in use the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or cgu an impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its cgu exceeds its estimated recoverable amount impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss impairment losses recognised in respect of cgus are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cgu group of cgus and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the cgu group of cgus on a pro rata basis an impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed in respect of other assets impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined net of depreciation or amortisation if no impairment loss had been recognised policy applicable before 1 january 2018 non derivative financial assets a financial asset not carried at fair value through profit or loss was assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any objective evidence that it is impaired a financial asset was impaired if objective evidence indicates that a loss event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset and that the loss event had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset that can be estimated reliably objective evidence that financial assets were impaired included default or delinquency by a debtor restructuring of an amount due to the group on terms that the group would not consider otherwise indications that a debtor or issuer will enter bankruptcy adverse changes in the payment status of borrowers or issuers in the group economic conditions that correlate with defaults the disappearance of an active market for a security or observable data indicating that there is measurable decrease in expected cash flows from a group of financial assets in addition for an investment in an equity security a significant or prolonged decline in its fair value below its cost was objective evidence of impairment financial assets measured at amortised cost the group considered evidence of impairment for financial assets measured at amortised cost at both a specific asset and collective level all individually significant assets were individually assessed for impairment those found not to be impaired were then collectively assessed for any impairment that had been incurred but not yet identified assets that were not individually significant were collectively assessed for impairment by grouping together assets with similar risk characteristics more to follow dow jones newswires april 17 2019 02 04 et 06 04 gmt dj arricano real estate plc final results 12 in assessing collective impairment the group used historical trends of the probability of default timing of recoveries and the amount of loss incurred adjusted for management s judgement as to whether current economic and credit conditions were such that the actual losses were likely to be greater or less than suggested by historical trends an impairment loss was calculated as the difference between an asset s carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the asset s original effective interest rate losses were recognised in profit or loss and reflected in an allowance account when the group considered that there were no realistic prospects of recovery of the asset the relevant amounts were written off interest on the impaired asset continued to be recognised through the unwinding of the discount when a subsequent event caused the amount of impairment loss to decrease and the decrease could be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised the decrease in impairment loss was reversed through profit or loss available for sale financial assets impairment losses on available for sale financial assets were recognised by reclassifying the losses accumulated in the fair value reserve in equity to profit or loss the cumulative loss that was reclassified from equity to profit or loss was the difference between the acquisition cost net of any principal repayment and amortisation and the current fair value less any impairment loss previously recognised in profit or loss changes in impairment provisions attributable to application of the effective interest method were reflected as a component of interest income if in a subsequent period the fair value of an impaired available for sale debt security increased and the increase could be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in profit or loss then the impairment loss was reversed with the amount of the reversal recognised in profit or loss however any subsequent recovery in the fair value of an impaired available for sale equity security was recognised in other comprehensive income k provisions a provision is recognised if as a result of a past event the group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability the unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance cost l revenue the group has

businesses in the ukraine it is an excellent performance and builds upon a similarly strong performance in the prior year whilst the social and economic conditions continue to be challenging the group has performed strongly relative to domestic peers in particular arricano has differentiated itself by continuing to develop the portfolio expanding in 2014 through the opening of the prospekt mall and more recently securing a new loan in february 2019 with raiffeisen bank aval jsc to fund in part the development of the lukianivka site in kyiv across the group s shopping and entertainment centres

that sharing data openly will generate increased growth and customer satisfaction trust and effective collaboration are at the heart of the multiple initiatives that are ongoing across the portfolio marketing b2c strategy is focused on enhancing quality and quantity of communication total media capacity of malls in smm channels is about 200 thousand followers with an average monthly reach more than 4 million people which make the digital resources of the group an efficient media platform and communication tool these efforts are reflected in the significant increase in visitor numbers achieved over the year up by 6 to 47 8 million visitors the group is consistently achieving impressive increases in visitor numbers year on year and this is primarily driven by the focus on making each shopping and entertainment centre a place which consumers want to visit not simply to shop at but also to relax and socialise an important part of arricano s appeal is due to the retail mix in each centre the management team is focused on constantly refreshing the retail mix so that each site continues to offer new brands and experiences alongside keeping traditional favourites the popularity of the shopping and entertainment centres means demand has remained strong this is reflected in occupancy across the portfolio improving to 99 7 up from 98 7 at 31 december 2018

37 the market trend in ukraine as it is in europe is towards digitalisation in all aspects of consumer s lives our challenge has been to respond creatively and combine the physical social spaces of our malls with digital communication and move to help our retailers provide omnichannel offers our media platform now has in excess of 200 000 active subscribers and has recorded millions of views content is coming from a variety of sources in 2018 a particularly popular video experiment borrowed from the harry potter films and projected ghosts flying through our prospekt mall the response resulted in thousands of views without any advertising and made clear the potential to do more to link this style of interaction with sales promotions as always our approach is to work collaboratively with retailers and consumers sharing data together and building trust and respect with the aim of everyone achieving their goals through working together as a result the number of tenants working with e commerce has nearly doubled from 39 to 72 as previously announced we invested in an online portal for tenants providing a broad range of tools for tenants use from access to administrative resources to a range of potential revenue generating opportunities for tenants to participate in merchandising mix is at the heart of every successful mall knowing our customers and understanding their aspirations is key 42 1 of our revenue from tenants across our 5 malls are from fashion stores with the balance of revenue being 6 4 health and beauty 8 3 restaurants and food 9 0 entertainment services 10 1 accessories jewellery and homeware 10 4 electronics and 13 7 hypermarkets in the third quarter of 2018 there was a focus on strengthening our presence in fashion including men s fashion with each shopping mall introducing 2 3 new popular clothing stores both ukrainian and international brands these efforts are clearly producing results given the 6 increase in visitor numbers during the year alongside achieving a good mix of tenants an important reason behind the popularity of the group s shopping centres is having the right balance of social spaces within each centre with this in place visitors can come and find their favourite retailers under one roof and also enjoy the well designed social spaces in which to meet eat and relax in terms of the new developments the group is progressing projects in odesa and lukyanivka kyiv the main focus is on development of the lukyanivka project construction is underway with initial financing completed in february 2019 and the project remains on track to complete in 2021 outlook these results reflect the success of our hard work over the last 5 years our malls are market leading and to maintain this position we are focused on the future it is clear shopping is going through an evolution here as it is elsewhere as the convenience of online purchases is altering traditional habits rather than this be a challenge we see it as an opportunity and we are responding accordingly our work with consumers and retailers on digital communications is proving successful not only in creating new experiences but also in strengthening the relationships we enjoy with both these groups this together with all the other elements of our business means we are confident of being able to continue to increase revenues in 2019 in line with

in ukraine and leasing them out as at 31 december 2018 the group operated five shopping centres in kyiv simferopol zaporizhzhya and kryvyi rig with a total leasable area of over 147 300 square meters and was and remains in the process of development of two new investment projects in kyiv and odesa with one more project to be developed the average number of employees employed by the group during the year is 103 2017 106 b ukrainian business environment the group s operations are primarily located in ukraine the political and economic situation in ukraine has been subject to significant turbulence in recent years and demonstrates characteristics of an emerging market consequently operations in the country involve risks that do not typically exist in other markets an armed conflict in certain parts of lugansk and donetsk regions which started in spring 2014 has not been resolved and part of the donetsk and lugansk regions remains under control of the self proclaimed republics and ukrainian authorities are not currently able to fully enforce ukrainian laws in this territory various events in march 2014 led to the accession of the republic of crimea to the russian federation which was not recognised by ukraine and many other countries this event resulted in a significant deterioration of the relationship between ukraine and the russian federation in november 2018 following an incident between the russian and ukrainian military around a waterway connecting the azov sea and the black sea the ukrainian authorities introduced martial law for a 30 days period in 10 regions located along the russian and moldovian border the azov sea and the black sea coast the martial law was terminated at the end of december 2018 after 30 days ukraine s economic situation deteriorated significantly in 2014 2016 as a result of the fall in trade with the russian federation and military tensions in eastern ukraine although instability continued throughout 2017 2018 the ukrainian economy continued to show signs of recovery with the inflation rate slowing down reduced depreciation of hryvnia against major foreign currencies growing international reserves of the national bank of ukraine the nbu and a general revival in business activity during 2016 2018 the nbu took certain steps to provide relief to the currency control restrictions introduced in 2014 2015 in particular the required share of foreign currency proceeds subject to mandatory sale on the interbank market was gradually decreased while the settlement period for export import transactions in foreign currency was increased also the nbu allowed ukrainian companies to pay dividends abroad subject to a certain monthly limitation in february 2019 a new law on currency and currency transactions came into force the new law abolished a number of restrictions defined new principles of currency operations currency regulation and supervision and resulted in significant liberalisation of foreign currency transactions and capital movements the banking system remains fragile due to low level of capital and weak asset quality and ukrainian companies and banks continue to suffer from a lack of funding from domestic and international financial markets the international monetary fund the imf continued to support the ukrainian government under the four year extended fund facility the eff program approved in march 2015 in october 2018 the government of ukraine reached an agreement with the imf on a new fourteen months stand by program which will replace the existing eff program other international financial institutions have also provided significant technical support in recent years to help ukraine restructure its external debt and launch various reforms including anti corruption corporate law and gradual liberalization of the energy sector in december 2018 moody s upgraded ukraine s credit rating to caa1 with a stable outlook reflecting the reaching of an agreement on further cooperation with the imf positive expectations regarding certain reforms and improved foreign affairs further stabilisation of economic and political environment depends on the continued implementation of structural reforms and other factors whilst management believes it is taking appropriate measures to support the sustainability of the group s business in the current circumstances a continuation of the current unstable business environment could negatively affect the group s results and financial position in a manner not currently determinable these consolidated financial statements reflect management s current assessment of the impact of the ukrainian business environment on the operations and the financial position of the group the future business environment may differ from management s assessment c cyprus business environment the cyprus economy has been adversely affected during the last few years by the economic crisis the negative effects have to some extent been resolved following the negotiations and the relevant agreements reached with the european commission the european central bank and the international monetary fund imf for financial assistance which was dependent on the formulation and the successful implementation of an economic adjustment program the agreements also resulted in the restructuring of the two largest systemic banks in cyprus through a bail in the cyprus government has successfully completed earlier than anticipated the economic adjustments program and exited the imf program on 7 march 2016 after having recovered in the international markets and having only used eur 7 25 billion of the total eur 10 billion earmarked in the financial bailout under the new euro area rules cyprus will continue to be under surveillance by its lenders with bi annual post program visits until it repays 75 of the economic assistance received although there are signs of improvement especially in the macroeconomic environment of the country s economy including growth in gdp and reducing unemployment rates significant challenges remain that could affect the estimates of the group s cash flows and its assessment of impairment of financial and non financial assets the group s management believes that it is taking all the necessary measures to maintain the viability of the group and the development of its business in the current business and economic environment and that no adverse impact on the group s operations is expected d russian business environment the group s operations are also carried out in the russian federation consequently the group is exposed to the economic and financial markets of the russian federation which display characteristics of an emerging market the legal tax and regulatory frameworks continue development but are subject to varying interpretations and frequent changes which together with other legal and fiscal impediments contribute to the challenges faced by entities operating in the russian federation starting in 2014 the united states of america the european union and some other countries imposed and gradually expanded economic sanctions against a number of russian individuals and legal entities the imposition of the sanctions has led to increased economic uncertainty including more volatile equity markets a depreciation of the russian rouble a reduction in both local and foreign direct investment inflows and a significant tightening in the availability of credit as a result some russian entities may experience difficulties accessing the international equity and debt markets and may become increasingly dependent on state support for their operations the longer term effects of the imposed and possible additional sanctions are difficult to determine the consolidated financial statements reflect management s assessment of the impact of the russian business environment on the operations and the financial position of the group the future business environment may differ from management s assessment 2 basis of preparation a statement of compliance these consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with

markets for identical assets or liabilities level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly i e as prices or indirectly i e derived from prices level 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs if the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability might be categorised in different levels of the fair value hierarchy then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement the group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred further information about the assumptions made in measuring fair values is included in the following notes note 4 investment property and note 21 f iii fair values g change in presentation management

in notes 3 c and 3 l the accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements a basis of consolidation i business combinations business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date which is the date on which control is transferred to the group the group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as the fair value of the consideration transferred plus the recognised amount of any non controlling interests in the acquiree plus if the business combination is achieved in stages the fair value of the pre existing equity interest in the acquiree less the net recognised amount generally fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed when the excess is negative a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss the consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre existing relationships such amounts are generally recognised in profit or loss transaction costs other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities that the group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date if an obligation to pay contingent consideration that meets the definition of a financial instrument is classified as equity then it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity otherwise other contingent consideration is remeasured at fair value at each reporting date and subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss when the acquisition of subsidiaries does not represent a business it is accounted for as an acquisition of a group of assets and liabilities the cost of the acquisition is allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based on their relative fair values and no goodwill or deferred tax is

accounted investees the group s interests in equity accounted investees comprise interests in associates associates are those entities in which the group has significant influence but not control or joint control over the financial and operating policies significant influence is presumed to exist when the group holds between 20 and 50 of the voting power of another entity interest in associates is accounted for using the equity method and is recognised initially at cost the cost of the investment includes transaction costs the consolidated financial statements include the group s share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of equity accounted investees from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases when the group s share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investee the carrying amount of that interest including any long term investments is reduced to zero and the recognition of further losses

only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment b foreign currency transactions and operations i foreign currency transactions transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of group entities at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rates as at that date the foreign currency gain or loss on monetary items is the difference between amortised cost in the functional currency at

non monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined

influence or joint control is lost the cumulative amount in the translation reserve related to that foreign operation is reclassified to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal when the group disposes of only part of its interest in a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation while retaining control the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reattributed to non controlling interests when the group disposes of only part of its investment in an associate or joint venture that includes a foreign operation while retaining significant influence or joint control the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss when the settlement of a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation is neither planned nor

requirements for recognising and measuring financial assets financial liabilities and some contracts to buy or sell non financial items this standard replaces ias 39 financial instruments recognition

financial assets and financial liabilities resulting from the adoption of ifrs 9 including impairment were recognised respectively there is no impact on the group s basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended 31 december 2018 and 2017 accordingly the information presented for 2017 generally reflects the requirements of ifrs 9 and ias 39 additional information about how the group measures the allowance for impairment is described in note 3 j the determination of the business model within which a financial asset is held has been made on the basis of the facts and circumstances that existed at the date of initial application policy applicable after 1 january 2018 i recognition and initial measurement trade receivables are initially recognised when they are originated all other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument a financial asset unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus for an item not at fvtpl transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue a trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price ii derecognition the group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the group neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset the group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled or expire the group also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value on derecognition of a financial liability the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid including any non cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed is recognised in profit or loss iii classification and subsequent measurement of financial assets on initial recognition a financial asset is classified as measured at amortised cost fvoci debt investment fvoci equity investment or fvtpl financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the group changes its business model for managing financial assets in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following the change in the business model a financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at fvtpl it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows and its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding a debt investment is measured at fvoci if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at fvtpl it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and its contractual terms give

losses interest income foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss any gain or loss on derecognition is recognised in profit or loss cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances on the current accounts and call deposits iv financial assets business model assessment the group makes an assessment of the objective of the business model in which a financial asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed and information is provided to management the information considered includes the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice these include whether management s strategy focuses on earning contractual interest income maintaining a particular interest rate profile matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of any related liabilities or expected cash outflows or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the group s management the risks that affect the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model and how those risks are managed how managers of the business are compensated e g whether compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or the contractual cash flows collected and the frequency volume and timing of sales of financial assets in prior periods the reasons for such sales and expectations about future sales activity transfers of financial assets to third parties in transactions that do not qualify for derecognition are not considered sales for this purpose consistent with the group s continuing recognition of the assets financial assets that are held for trading or are managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at fvtpl v financial assets assessment whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest for the purposes of this assessment principal is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition interest is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs e g liquidity risk and administrative costs as well as a profit margin in assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest the group considers the contractual terms of the instrument this includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition in making this assessment the group considers contingent events that would change the amount or timing of cash flows terms that may adjust the contractual coupon rate including variable rate features prepayment and extension features and terms that limit the group s claim to cash flows from specified assets e g non recourse features a prepayment feature is consistent with the solely payments of principal and interest criterion if the prepayment amount substantially represents unpaid amounts of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding which may include reasonable additional compensation for early termination of the contract additionally for a financial asset acquired at a discount or premium to its contractual par amount a feature that permits or requires prepayment at an amount that substantially represents the contractual par amount plus accrued but unpaid contractual interest which may also include reasonable additional compensation for early termination is treated as consistent with this criterion if the fair value of the prepayment feature is insignificant at initial recognition vi classification and subsequent measurement of financial liabilities financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost or fvtpl a financial liability is classified as at fvtpl if it meets the definition of held for trading or it is designated as such on initial recognition financial liabilities at fvtpl are measured at fair value and net gains and losses including any interest expense are recognised in profit or loss except for the part of the fair value change that is due to changes in the group s own credit risk that is recognised in other comprehensive income other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in profit or loss the group measures all of its financial liabilities at amortised cost vii offsetting financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statements of financial position when and only when the group currently has

recognised loans and receivables on the date that they are originated all other financial assets and financial liabilities were recognised initially on the trade date at which the group became a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument the group derecognised a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expired or it transferred the rights to receive the contractual cash flows on the financial asset in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset were transferred any interest in transferred financial assets that was created or retained by the group was recognised as a separate asset or liability ii derecognition the group derecognised a financial liability when its contractual obligations were discharged or cancelled or expired financial assets and liabilities were offset and the net amount was presented in the consolidated statement of financial position when and only when the group had a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and intended either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously the group had a legally enforceable right to set off if that right is not contingent on a future event and enforceable both in the normal course of business and in the event of default insolvency or bankruptcy of the group and all counterparties iii non derivative financial assets measurement loans and receivables loans and receivables were a category of financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that were not quoted in an active market such assets were recognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs subsequent to initial recognition loans and receivables were

appreciation or for both but not for sale in the ordinary course of business use in production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes investment properties principally comprise freehold land leasehold land and investment properties held for rental income earning or future redevelopment leasehold of land under operating lease is classified and accounted for as an investment property when the definition of investment property is met under investment property accounting the right to use the land is measured at fair value and the obligation to pay rentals is accounted for as a finance lease i initial measurement and recognition investment properties are measured initially at cost including related acquisition costs cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the investment property the cost of self constructed investment property includes the cost of materials and direct labour any other costs directly attributable to bringing the investment property to a working condition for their intended use and capitalised borrowing costs if the group uses part of the property for its own use and part to earn rentals or for capital appreciation and the portions can be sold or leased out separately they are accounted for separately therefore the part that is rented out is investment property if the portions cannot be sold or leased out separately the property is investment property only if the company occupied portion is insignificant ii subsequent measurement subsequent to initial recognition investment properties are stated at fair value any gain or loss arising from a change in fair value is included in profit or loss in the period in which it arises when the group begins to redevelop an existing investment property for continued future use as investment property the property remains an investment property which is measured at fair value and is not reclassified to property and equipment during the redevelopment when the use of a property changes such that it is reclassified as property plant and equipment its fair value at the date of reclassification becomes its cost for subsequent accounting investment properties are derecognised on disposal or when they are permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefits are expected from their disposal the gain or loss on disposal is calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised as gain or loss in profit or loss it is the group s policy that an external independent valuation company having an appropriate recognised professional qualification and recent experience in the location and category of property being appraised values the portfolio as at each reporting date the fair value is the amount for which a property could be exchanged on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm s length transaction the valuation is prepared in accordance with international valuation standards published by the international valuation standards council iii property under development construction property that is being constructed or developed for future use as an investment property and for which it is not possible to reliably determine fair value is accounted for as an investment property that is stated at cost until construction or development is complete or until it becomes possible to reliably determine its fair value when construction is performed on land previously classified as an investment property and measured at fair value such land continues to be accounted at fair value throughout the construction phase f property and equipment i recognition and measurement items of property and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset the cost of self constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labor any other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use and the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that equipment when parts of an item of property and equipment have different useful lives they are accounted for as separate items major components of property and equipment the gain or loss on disposal of an item of property and equipment is determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property and equipment and is recognised net within other income other operating expenses in profit or loss ii reclassification to investment property when the use of a property changes from owner occupied to investment property the property is re measured to fair value and reclassified to investment property any gain arising on re measurement is recognised in profit or loss to the extent that it reverses a previous impairment loss on the specific property with any remaining gain recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the revaluation reserve in equity any loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss iii subsequent costs the cost of replacing part of an item of property and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the group and its cost can be measured reliably the costs of the day to day servicing of property and equipment are recognised in profit or loss as incurred iv depreciation items of property and equipment are depreciated from the date that they are installed and are ready for use or in respect of internally constructed assets from the date that the asset is completed and ready for use depreciation is based on the cost of an asset less its residual value depreciation is recognised in profit or loss on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property and equipment leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term land is not depreciated the estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods are as follows vehicles and equipment 5 years fixture and fittings 2 5 5 years depreciation methods useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted if appropriate g intangible assets i recognition and measurement intangible assets that are acquired by the group which have finite useful lives are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses ii subsequent expenditure subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates all other expenditure including expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in profit or loss as incurred iii amortisation amortisation is calculated over the cost of the asset or other amount substituted for cost less its residual value amortisation is recognised in profit or loss on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets other than goodwill from the date that they are available for use since this most closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset the estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods are as follows software 3 5 years amortisation methods useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted if appropriate h inventories inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value the cost of inventories is based on the first in first out principle and more to follow

location and condition net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses i assets classified as held for sale non current assets or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities that are expected to be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use are classified as held for sale such assets or disposal group are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell any impairment loss on a disposal group is allocated first to goodwill and then to the remaining assets and liabilities on pro rata basis except that no loss is allocated to inventories financial assets deferred tax assets or investment property which continue to be measured in accordance with the group s other accounting policies impairment losses on initial classification as held for sale and subsequent gains or losses on remeasurement are recognised in profit or loss gains are not recognised in excess of any cumulative impairment loss intangible assets and property and equipment once classified as held for sale are not amortised or depreciated j impairment i impairment financial assets policy applicable from 1 january 2018 the group uses expected credit loss ecl model this impairment model applies to financial assets measured at amortised cost contract assets but not to investments in equity instruments the financial assets at amortised cost consist of trade and other receivables cash and cash equivalents and loans receivable loss allowances are measured on either of the following bases 12 month ecls these are ecls that result from possible default events within the 12 months after the reporting date and lifetime ecls these are ecls that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument the group measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ecls except for bank balances for which credit risk i e the risk of default occurring over the expected life of the financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition for which loss allowances are measured as 12 month ecls when determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ecls the group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort this includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis based on the group s historical experience and informed credit assessment the group assumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly if it is more than 30 days past due the group considers a financial asset to be in default when the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the group in full without recourse by the group to actions such as realising security if any is held or the financial asset is more than 90 days past due the maximum period considered when estimating ecls is the maximum contractual period over which the group is exposed to credit risk measurement of ecls ecls are a probability weighted estimate of credit losses credit losses are measured as the present value of all cash shortfalls i e the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the group expects to receive ecls are discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset credit impaired financial assets at each reporting date the group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost are credit impaired a financial asset is credit impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred presentation of allowance for ecl loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortised cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets impairment losses related to trade and other receivables are presented under operating expenses and impairment losses on other financial assets are presented under finance costs similar to the presentation under ias 39 and not presented separately in the consolidated interim condensed statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income due to materiality considerations as at 1 january 2018 there was no change in the allowance for impairment for the group s financial assets due to implementation of ifrs 9 ii non financial assets the carrying amounts of non financial assets other than investment property deferred tax assets and inventory are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment if any such indication exists then the asset s recoverable amount is estimated for goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives or that are not yet available for use the recoverable amount is estimated each year at the same time for the purpose of impairment testing assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or cash generating unit cgu subject to an operating segment ceiling test for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing cgus to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment testing is performed reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of cgus that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination the group s corporate assets do not generate separate cash inflows and are utilised by more than one cgu corporate assets are allocated to cgus on a reasonable and consistent basis and tested for impairment as part of the testing of the cgu to which the corporate asset is allocated the recoverable amount of an asset or cgu is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell in assessing value in use the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or cgu an impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its cgu exceeds its estimated recoverable amount impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss impairment losses recognised in respect of cgus are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cgu group of cgus and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the cgu group of cgus on a pro rata basis an impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed in respect of other assets impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined net of depreciation or amortisation if no impairment loss had been recognised policy applicable before 1 january 2018 non derivative financial assets a financial asset not carried at fair value through profit or loss was assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any objective evidence that it is impaired a financial asset was impaired if objective evidence indicates that a loss event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset and that the loss event had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset that can be estimated reliably objective evidence that financial assets were impaired included default or delinquency by a debtor restructuring of an amount due to the group on terms that the group would not consider otherwise indications that a debtor or issuer will enter bankruptcy adverse changes in the payment status of borrowers or issuers in the group economic conditions that correlate with defaults the disappearance of an active market for a security or observable data indicating that there is measurable decrease in expected cash flows from a group of financial assets in addition for an investment in an equity security a significant or prolonged decline in its fair value below its cost was objective evidence of impairment financial assets measured at amortised cost the group considered evidence of impairment for financial assets measured at amortised cost at both a specific asset and collective level all individually significant assets were individually assessed for impairment those found not to be impaired were then collectively assessed for any impairment that had been incurred but not yet identified assets that were not individually significant were collectively assessed for impairment by grouping together assets with similar risk characteristics more to follow dow jones newswires april 17 2019 02 04 et 06 04 gmt dj arricano real estate plc final results 12 in assessing collective impairment the group used historical trends of the probability of default timing of recoveries and the amount of loss incurred adjusted for management s judgement as to whether current economic and credit conditions were such that the actual losses were likely to be greater or less than suggested by historical trends an impairment loss was calculated as the difference between an asset s carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the asset s original effective interest rate losses were recognised in profit or loss and reflected in an allowance account when the group considered that there were no realistic prospects of recovery of the asset the relevant amounts were written off interest on the impaired asset continued to be recognised through the unwinding of the discount when a subsequent event caused the amount of impairment loss to decrease and the decrease could be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised the decrease in impairment loss was reversed through profit or loss available for sale financial assets impairment losses on available for sale financial assets were recognised by reclassifying the losses accumulated in the fair value reserve in equity to profit or loss the cumulative loss that was reclassified from equity to profit or loss was the difference between the acquisition cost net of any principal repayment and amortisation and the current fair value less any impairment loss previously recognised in profit or loss changes in impairment provisions attributable to application of the effective interest method were reflected as a component of interest income if in a subsequent period the fair value of an impaired available for sale debt security increased and the increase could be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in profit or loss then the impairment loss was reversed with the amount of the reversal recognised in profit or loss however any subsequent recovery in the fair value of an impaired available for sale equity security was recognised in other comprehensive income k provisions a provision is recognised if as a result of a past event the group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability the unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance cost l revenue the group has

our malls with digital communication and move to help our retailers provide omnichannel offers our media platform now has in excess of 200 000 active subscribers and has recorded millions of views content is coming from a variety of sources in 2018 a particularly popular video experiment borrowed from the harry potter films and projected ghosts flying through our prospekt mall the response resulted in thousands of views without any advertising and made clear the potential to do more to link this style of interaction with sales promotions as always our approach is to work collaboratively with retailers and consumers sharing data together and building trust and respect with the aim of everyone achieving their goals through working together as a result the number of tenants working with e commerce has nearly doubled from 39 to 72 as previously announced we invested in an online portal for tenants providing a broad range of tools for tenants use from access to administrative resources to a range of potential revenue generating opportunities for tenants to participate in merchandising mix is at the heart of every successful mall knowing our customers and understanding their aspirations is key 42 1 of our revenue from tenants across our 5 malls are from fashion stores with the balance of revenue being 6 4 health and beauty 8 3 restaurants and food 9 0 entertainment services 10 1 accessories jewellery and homeware 10 4 electronics and 13 7 hypermarkets in the third quarter of 2018 there was a focus on strengthening our presence in fashion including men s fashion with each shopping mall introducing 2 3 new popular clothing stores both ukrainian and international brands these efforts are clearly producing results given the 6 increase in visitor numbers during the year alongside achieving a good mix of tenants an important reason behind the popularity of the group s shopping centres is having the right balance of social spaces within each centre with this in place visitors can come and find their favourite retailers under one roof and also enjoy the well designed social spaces in which to meet eat and relax in terms of the new developments the group is progressing projects in odesa and lukyanivka kyiv the main focus is on development of the lukyanivka project construction is underway with initial financing completed in february 2019 and the project remains on track to complete in 2021 outlook these results reflect the success of our hard work over the last 5 years our malls are market leading and to maintain this position we are focused on the future it is clear shopping is going through an evolution here as it is elsewhere as the convenience of online purchases is altering traditional habits rather than this be a challenge we see it as an opportunity and we are responding accordingly our work with consumers and retailers on digital communications is proving successful not only in creating new experiences but also in strengthening the relationships we enjoy with both these groups this together with all the other elements of our business means we are confident of being able to continue to increase revenues in 2019 in line with

in ukraine and leasing them out as at 31 december 2018 the group operated five shopping centres in kyiv simferopol zaporizhzhya and kryvyi rig with a total leasable area of over 147 300 square meters and was and remains in the process of development of two new investment projects in kyiv and odesa with one more project to be developed the average number of employees employed by the group during the year is 103 2017 106 b ukrainian business environment the group s operations are primarily located in ukraine the political and economic situation in ukraine has been subject to significant turbulence in recent years and demonstrates characteristics of an emerging market consequently operations in the country involve risks that do not typically exist in other markets an armed conflict in certain parts of lugansk and donetsk regions which started in spring 2014 has not been resolved and part of the donetsk and lugansk regions remains under control of the self proclaimed republics and ukrainian authorities are not currently able to fully enforce ukrainian laws in this territory various events in march 2014 led to the accession of the republic of crimea to the russian federation which was not recognised by ukraine and many other countries this event resulted in a significant deterioration of the relationship between ukraine and the russian federation in november 2018 following an incident between the russian and ukrainian military around a waterway connecting the azov sea and the black sea the ukrainian authorities introduced martial law for a 30 days period in 10 regions located along the russian and moldovian border the azov sea and the black sea coast the martial law was terminated at the end of december 2018 after 30 days ukraine s economic situation deteriorated significantly in 2014 2016 as a result of the fall in trade with the russian federation and military tensions in eastern ukraine although instability continued throughout 2017 2018 the ukrainian economy continued to show signs of recovery with the inflation rate slowing down reduced depreciation of hryvnia against major foreign currencies growing international reserves of the national bank of ukraine the nbu and a general revival in business activity during 2016 2018 the nbu took certain steps to provide relief to the currency control restrictions introduced in 2014 2015 in particular the required share of foreign currency proceeds subject to mandatory sale on the interbank market was gradually decreased while the settlement period for export import transactions in foreign currency was increased also the nbu allowed ukrainian companies to pay dividends abroad subject to a certain monthly limitation in february 2019 a new law on currency and currency transactions came into force the new law abolished a number of restrictions defined new principles of currency operations currency regulation and supervision and resulted in significant liberalisation of foreign currency transactions and capital movements the banking system remains fragile due to low level of capital and weak asset quality and ukrainian companies and banks continue to suffer from a lack of funding from domestic and international financial markets the international monetary fund the imf continued to support the ukrainian government under the four year extended fund facility the eff program approved in march 2015 in october 2018 the government of ukraine reached an agreement with the imf on a new fourteen months stand by program which will replace the existing eff program other international financial institutions have also provided significant technical support in recent years to help ukraine restructure its external debt and launch various reforms including anti corruption corporate law and gradual liberalization of the energy sector in december 2018 moody s upgraded ukraine s credit rating to caa1 with a stable outlook reflecting the reaching of an agreement on further cooperation with the imf positive expectations regarding certain reforms and improved foreign affairs further stabilisation of economic and political environment depends on the continued implementation of structural reforms and other factors whilst management believes it is taking appropriate measures to support the sustainability of the group s business in the current circumstances a continuation of the current unstable business environment could negatively affect the group s results and financial position in a manner not currently determinable these consolidated financial statements reflect management s current assessment of the impact of the ukrainian business environment on the operations and the financial position of the group the future business environment may differ from management s assessment c cyprus business environment the cyprus economy has been adversely affected during the last few years by the economic crisis the negative effects have to some extent been resolved following the negotiations and the relevant agreements reached with the european commission the european central bank and the international monetary fund imf for financial assistance which was dependent on the formulation and the successful implementation of an economic adjustment program the agreements also resulted in the restructuring of the two largest systemic banks in cyprus through a bail in the cyprus government has successfully completed earlier than anticipated the economic adjustments program and exited the imf program on 7 march 2016 after having recovered in the international markets and having only used eur 7 25 billion of the total eur 10 billion earmarked in the financial bailout under the new euro area rules cyprus will continue to be under surveillance by its lenders with bi annual post program visits until it repays 75 of the economic assistance received although there are signs of improvement especially in the macroeconomic environment of the country s economy including growth in gdp and reducing unemployment rates significant challenges remain that could affect the estimates of the group s cash flows and its assessment of impairment of financial and non financial assets the group s management believes that it is taking all the necessary measures to maintain the viability of the group and the development of its business in the current business and economic environment and that no adverse impact on the group s operations is expected d russian business environment the group s operations are also carried out in the russian federation consequently the group is exposed to the economic and financial markets of the russian federation which display characteristics of an emerging market the legal tax and regulatory frameworks continue development but are subject to varying interpretations and frequent changes which together with other legal and fiscal impediments contribute to the challenges faced by entities operating in the russian federation starting in 2014 the united states of america the european union and some other countries imposed and gradually expanded economic sanctions against a number of russian individuals and legal entities the imposition of the sanctions has led to increased economic uncertainty including more volatile equity markets a depreciation of the russian rouble a reduction in both local and foreign direct investment inflows and a significant tightening in the availability of credit as a result some russian entities may experience difficulties accessing the international equity and debt markets and may become increasingly dependent on state support for their operations the longer term effects of the imposed and possible additional sanctions are difficult to determine the consolidated financial statements reflect management s assessment of the impact of the russian business environment on the operations and the financial position of the group the future business environment may differ from management s assessment 2 basis of preparation a statement of compliance these consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with

judgments estimates and assumptions the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with ifrss as adopted by the eu requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets liabilities income and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities actual results may differ from these estimates estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected in particular information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements and have significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment within the next financial year are included in the following notes note 2 c

conclude a number of new tenancy agreements and increase occupancy rate of its shopping centres besides the group managed to gradually increase its rental rates during the year for existing tenants in accordance with the budget approved for 2019 the group plans to increase its operating income during the next year management believes that the measures that it undertakes as described above will allow the group to maintain the positive working capital and operate on a going concern basis in the foreseeable future these consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realisation of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business f measurement of fair values a number of the group s accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values for both financial and non financial assets and liabilities when measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability the group uses market observable data as far as possible fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows level 1 quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly i e as prices or indirectly i e derived from prices level 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs if the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability might be categorised in different levels of the fair value hierarchy then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement the group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred further information about the assumptions made in measuring fair values is included in the following notes note 4 investment property and note 21 f iii fair values g change in presentation management

business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date which is the date on which control is transferred to the group the group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as the fair value of the consideration transferred plus the recognised amount of any non controlling interests in the acquiree plus if the business combination is achieved in stages the fair value of the pre existing equity interest in the acquiree less the net recognised amount generally fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed when the excess is negative a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss the consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre existing relationships such amounts are generally recognised in profit or loss transaction costs other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities that the group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date if an obligation to pay contingent consideration that meets the definition of a financial instrument is classified as equity then it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity otherwise other contingent consideration is remeasured at fair value at each reporting date and subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss when the acquisition of subsidiaries does not represent a business it is accounted for as an acquisition of a group of assets and liabilities the cost of the acquisition is allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based on their relative fair values and no goodwill or deferred tax is

liabilities 6 adoption of ifrs 9 had no effect on the carrying amount of financial assets and financial liabilities transition the group has used an exemption not to restate comparative information for prior periods with respect to classification and measurement including impairment requirements therefore comparative periods have not been restated no differences in the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities resulting from the adoption of ifrs 9 including impairment were recognised respectively there is no impact on the group s basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended 31 december 2018 and 2017 accordingly the information presented for 2017 generally reflects the requirements of ifrs 9 and ias 39 additional information about how the group measures the allowance for impairment is described in note 3 j the determination of the business model within which a financial asset is held has been made on the basis of the facts and circumstances that existed at the date of initial application policy applicable after 1 january 2018 i recognition and initial measurement trade receivables are initially recognised when they are originated all other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument a financial asset unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus for an item not at fvtpl transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue a trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price ii derecognition the group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the group neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset the group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled or expire the group also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value on derecognition of a financial liability the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid including any non cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed is recognised in profit or loss iii classification and subsequent measurement of financial assets on initial recognition a financial asset is classified as measured at amortised cost fvoci debt investment fvoci equity investment or fvtpl financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the group changes its business model for managing financial assets in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following the change in the business model a financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at fvtpl it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows and its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding a debt investment is measured at fvoci if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at fvtpl it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding on initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading

value in oci this election is made on an investment by investment basis the group s financial assets comprise trade and other receivables loans receivable and cash and cash equivalents and are classified into the financial assets at amortised cost category these assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method the amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses interest income foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss any gain or loss on derecognition is recognised in profit or loss cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances on the current accounts and call deposits iv financial assets business model assessment the group makes an assessment of the objective of the business model in which a financial asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed and information is provided to management the information considered includes the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice these include whether management s strategy focuses on earning contractual interest income maintaining a particular interest rate profile matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of any related liabilities or expected cash outflows or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the group s management the risks that affect the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model and how those risks are managed how managers of the business are compensated e g whether compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or the contractual cash flows collected and the frequency volume and timing of sales of financial assets in prior periods the reasons for such sales and expectations about future sales activity transfers of financial assets to third parties in transactions that do not qualify for derecognition are not considered sales for this purpose consistent with the group s continuing recognition of the assets financial assets that are held for trading or are managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at fvtpl v financial assets assessment whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest for the purposes of this assessment principal is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition interest is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs e g liquidity risk and administrative costs as well as a profit margin in assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest the group considers the contractual terms of the instrument this includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition in making this assessment the group considers contingent events that would change the amount or timing of cash flows terms that may adjust the contractual coupon rate including variable rate features prepayment and extension features and terms that limit the group s claim to cash flows from specified assets e g non recourse features a prepayment feature is consistent with the solely payments of principal and interest criterion if the prepayment amount substantially represents unpaid amounts of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding which may include reasonable additional compensation for early termination of the contract additionally for a financial asset acquired at a discount or premium to its contractual par amount a feature that permits or requires prepayment at an amount that substantially represents the contractual par amount plus accrued but unpaid contractual interest which may also include reasonable additional compensation for early termination is treated as consistent with this criterion if the fair value of the prepayment feature is insignificant at initial recognition vi classification and subsequent measurement of financial liabilities financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost or fvtpl a financial liability is classified as at fvtpl if it meets the definition of held for trading or it is designated as such on initial recognition financial liabilities at fvtpl are measured at fair value and net gains and losses including any interest expense are recognised in profit or loss except for the part of the fair value change that is due to changes in the group s own credit risk that is recognised in other comprehensive income other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in profit or loss the group measures all of its financial liabilities at amortised cost vii offsetting financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statements of financial position when and only when the group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously the group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off if that right is not contingent on a future event and enforceable both in the normal course of business and in the event of default insolvency or bankruptcy of the group and all counterparties policy applicable before 1 january 2018 the group classified its non derivative financial assets as loans and receivables and available for sale financial assets the group classified non derivative financial liabilities into the other financial liabilities category i non derivative financial assets and financial liabilities recognition and derecognition the group initially recognised loans and receivables on the date that they are originated all other financial assets and financial liabilities were recognised initially on the trade date at which the group became a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument the group derecognised a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expired or it transferred the rights to receive the contractual cash flows on the financial asset in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset were transferred any interest in transferred financial assets that was created or retained by the group was recognised as a separate asset or liability ii derecognition the group derecognised a financial liability when its contractual obligations were discharged or cancelled or expired financial assets and liabilities were offset and the net amount was presented in the consolidated statement of financial position when and only when the group had a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and intended either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously the group had a legally enforceable right to set off if that right is not contingent on a future event and enforceable both in the normal course of business and in the event of default insolvency or bankruptcy of the group and all counterparties iii non derivative financial assets measurement loans and receivables loans and receivables were a category of financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that were not quoted in an active market such assets were recognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs subsequent to initial recognition loans and receivables were measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any impairment losses loans and receivables comprised the following classes of financial assets trade and other receivables loans receivable and cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents comprised cash balances call deposits and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less from the acquisition date that were subject to insignificant risk of changes in their fair value iv non derivative financial liabilities measurement the group classified non derivative financial liabilities into the other financial liabilities category such financial liabilities were recognised initially at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs subsequent to initial recognition these financial liabilities were measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method other financial liabilities comprised loans and borrowings finance lease liability trade and other payables and other liabilities d capital and reserves share capital ordinary shares are classified as equity incremental costs directly attributable to issue of ordinary shares are recognised as a deduction from equity net of any tax effects more to follow dow jones newswires april 17 2019 02 04 et 06 04 gmt dj arricano real estate plc final results 10 share premium share premium reserves include amounts that were created due to the issue of share capital at a value price greater than the nominal non reciprocal shareholders contribution non reciprocal shareholders contribution reserve includes contributions made by the shareholders directly in the reserves the shareholders do not have any rights to these contributions which are distributable at the discretion of the board of directors subject to the shareholders approval retained earnings retained earnings include accumulated profits and losses incurred by the group other reserves other reserves comprise the effect of acquisition and disposal of subsidiaries under common control change in non controlling interest in these subsidiaries and the effect of forfeiture of shares foreign currency translation differences foreign currency translation differences comprise foreign currency differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations and foreign exchange gains and losses from monetary items that form part of the net investment in the foreign operation e investment properties investment properties are those that are held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or for both but not for sale in the ordinary course of business use in production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes investment properties principally comprise freehold land leasehold land and investment properties held for rental income earning or future redevelopment leasehold of land under operating lease is classified and accounted for as an investment property when the definition of investment property is met under investment property accounting the right to use the land is measured at fair value and the obligation to pay rentals is accounted for as a finance lease i initial measurement and recognition investment properties are measured initially at cost including related acquisition costs cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the investment property the cost of self constructed investment property includes the cost of materials and direct labour any other costs directly attributable to bringing the investment property to a working condition for their intended use and capitalised borrowing costs if the group uses part of the property for its own use and part to earn rentals or for capital appreciation and the portions can be sold or leased out separately they are accounted for separately therefore the part that is rented out is investment property if the portions cannot be sold or leased out separately the property is investment property only if the company occupied portion is insignificant ii subsequent measurement subsequent to initial recognition investment properties are stated at fair value any gain or loss arising from a change in fair value is included in profit or loss in the period in which it arises when the group begins to redevelop an existing investment property for continued future use as investment property the property remains an investment property which is measured at fair value and is not reclassified to property and equipment during the redevelopment when the use of a property changes such that it is reclassified as property plant and equipment its fair value at the date of reclassification becomes its cost for subsequent accounting investment properties are derecognised on disposal or when they are permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefits are expected from their disposal the gain or loss on disposal is calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised as gain or loss in profit or loss it is the group s policy that an external independent valuation company having an appropriate recognised professional qualification and recent experience in the location and category of property being appraised values the portfolio as at each reporting date the fair value is the amount for which a property could be exchanged on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm s length transaction the valuation is prepared in accordance with international valuation standards published by the international valuation standards council iii property under development construction property that is being constructed or developed for future use as an investment property and for which it is not possible to reliably determine fair value is accounted for as an investment property that is stated at cost until construction or development is complete or until it becomes possible to reliably determine its fair value when construction is performed on land previously classified as an investment property and measured at fair value such land continues to be accounted at fair value throughout the construction phase f property and equipment i recognition and measurement items of property and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset the cost of self constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labor any other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use and the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that equipment when parts of an item of property and equipment have different useful lives they are accounted for as separate items major components of property and equipment the gain or loss on disposal of an item of property and equipment is determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property and equipment and is recognised net within other income other operating expenses in profit or loss ii reclassification to investment property when the use of a property changes from owner occupied to investment property the property is re measured to fair value and reclassified to investment property any gain arising on re measurement is recognised in profit or loss to the extent that it reverses a previous impairment loss on the specific property with any remaining gain recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the revaluation reserve in equity any loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss iii subsequent costs the cost of replacing part of an item of property and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the group and its cost can be measured reliably the costs of the day to day servicing of property and equipment are recognised in profit or loss as incurred iv depreciation items of property and equipment are depreciated from the date that they are installed and are ready for use or in respect of internally constructed assets from the date that the asset is completed and ready for use depreciation is based on the cost of an asset less its residual value depreciation is recognised in profit or loss on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property and equipment leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term land is not depreciated the estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods are as follows vehicles and equipment 5 years fixture and fittings 2 5 5 years depreciation methods useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted if appropriate g intangible assets i recognition and measurement intangible assets that are acquired by the group which have finite useful lives are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses ii subsequent expenditure subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates all other expenditure including expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in profit or loss as incurred iii amortisation amortisation is calculated over the cost of the asset or other amount substituted for cost less its residual value amortisation is recognised in profit or loss on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets other than goodwill from the date that they are available for use since this most closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset the estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods are as follows software 3 5 years amortisation methods useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted if appropriate h inventories inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value the cost of inventories is based on the first in first out principle and more to follow dow jones newswires april 17 2019 02 04 et 06 04 gmt dj arricano real estate plc final results 11 includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses i assets classified as held for sale non current assets or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities that are expected to be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use are classified as held for sale such assets or disposal group are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell any impairment loss on a disposal group is allocated first to goodwill and then to the remaining assets and liabilities on pro rata basis except that no loss is allocated to inventories financial assets deferred tax assets or investment property which continue to be measured in accordance with the group s other accounting policies impairment losses on initial classification as held for sale and subsequent gains or losses on remeasurement are recognised in profit or loss gains are not recognised in excess of any cumulative impairment loss intangible assets and property and equipment once classified as held for sale are not amortised or depreciated j impairment i impairment financial assets policy applicable from 1 january 2018 the group uses expected credit loss ecl model this impairment model applies to financial assets measured at amortised cost contract assets but not to investments in equity instruments the financial assets at amortised cost consist of trade and other receivables cash and cash equivalents and loans receivable loss allowances are measured on either of the following bases 12 month ecls these are ecls that result from possible default events within the 12 months after the reporting date and lifetime ecls these are ecls that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument the group measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ecls except for bank balances for which credit risk i e the risk of default occurring over the expected life of the financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition for which loss allowances are measured as 12 month ecls when determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ecls the group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort this includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis based on the group s historical experience and informed credit assessment the group assumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly if it is more than 30 days past due the group considers a financial asset to be in default when the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the group in full without recourse by the group to actions such as realising security if any is held or the financial asset is more than 90 days past due the maximum period considered when estimating ecls is the maximum contractual period over which the group is exposed to credit risk measurement of ecls ecls are a probability weighted estimate of credit losses credit losses are measured as the present value of all cash shortfalls i e the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the group expects to receive ecls are discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset credit impaired financial assets at each reporting date the group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost are credit impaired a financial asset is credit impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred presentation of allowance for ecl loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortised cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets impairment losses related to trade and other receivables are presented under operating expenses and impairment losses on other financial assets are presented under finance costs similar to the presentation under ias 39 and not presented separately in the consolidated interim condensed statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income due to materiality considerations as at 1 january 2018 there was no change in the allowance for impairment for the group s financial assets due to implementation of ifrs 9 ii non financial assets the carrying amounts of non financial assets other than investment property deferred tax assets and inventory are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment if any such indication exists then the asset s recoverable amount is estimated for goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives or that are not yet available for use the recoverable amount is estimated each year at the same time for the purpose of impairment testing assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or cash generating unit cgu subject to an operating segment ceiling test for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing cgus to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment testing is performed reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of cgus that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination the group s corporate assets do not generate separate cash inflows and are utilised by more than one cgu corporate assets are allocated to cgus on a reasonable and consistent basis and tested for impairment as part of the testing of the cgu to which the corporate asset is allocated the recoverable amount of an asset or cgu is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell in assessing value in use the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or cgu an impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its cgu exceeds its estimated recoverable amount impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss impairment losses recognised in respect of cgus are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cgu group of cgus and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the cgu group of cgus on a pro rata basis an impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed in respect of other assets impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined net of depreciation or amortisation if no impairment loss had been recognised policy applicable before 1 january 2018 non derivative financial assets a financial asset not carried at fair value through profit or loss was assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any objective evidence that it is impaired a financial asset was impaired if objective evidence indicates that a loss event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset and that the loss event had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset that can be estimated reliably objective evidence that financial assets were impaired included default or delinquency by a debtor restructuring of an amount due to the group on terms that the group would not consider otherwise indications that a debtor or issuer will enter bankruptcy adverse changes in the payment status of borrowers or issuers in the group economic conditions that correlate with defaults the disappearance of an active market for a security or observable data indicating that there is measurable decrease in expected cash flows from a group of financial assets in addition for an investment in an equity security a significant or prolonged decline in its fair value below its cost was objective evidence of impairment financial assets measured at amortised cost the group considered evidence of impairment for financial assets measured at amortised cost at both a specific asset and collective level all individually significant assets were individually assessed for impairment those found not to be impaired were then collectively assessed for any impairment that had been incurred but not yet identified assets that were not individually significant were collectively assessed for impairment by grouping together assets with similar risk characteristics more to follow dow jones newswires april 17 2019 02 04 et 06 04 gmt dj arricano real estate plc final results 12 in assessing collective impairment the group used historical trends of the probability of default timing of recoveries and the amount of loss incurred adjusted for management s judgement as to whether current economic and credit conditions were such that the actual losses were likely to be greater or less than suggested by historical trends an impairment loss was calculated as the difference between an asset s carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the asset s original effective interest rate losses were recognised in profit or loss and reflected in an allowance account when the group considered that there were no realistic prospects of recovery of the asset the relevant amounts were written off interest on the impaired asset continued to be recognised through the unwinding of the discount when a subsequent event caused the amount of impairment loss to decrease and the decrease could be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised the decrease in impairment loss was reversed through profit or loss available for sale financial assets impairment losses on available for sale financial assets were recognised by reclassifying the losses accumulated in the fair value reserve in equity to profit or loss the cumulative loss that was reclassified from equity to profit or loss was the difference between the acquisition cost net of any principal repayment and amortisation and the current fair value less any impairment loss previously recognised in profit or loss changes in impairment provisions attributable to application of the effective interest method were reflected as a component of interest income if in a subsequent period the fair value of an impaired available for sale debt security increased and the increase could be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in profit or loss then the impairment loss was reversed with the amount of the reversal recognised in profit or loss however any subsequent recovery in the fair value of an impaired available for sale equity security was recognised in other comprehensive income k provisions a provision is recognised if as a result of a past event the group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability the unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance cost l revenue the group has

how central bank gold buying is undermining the us dollar ahead of the herd has been digging into why central banks are buying a lot of gold recently what we ve found is eyebrow raising to say the least it may be the best reason you ve ever read for wanting to buy gold take this headline from the northern miner editorial central banks are major gold buyers in 2019 citing statistics from the world gold council the northern miner reports that central banks netted 51 tonnes in gold purchases the most since october 2018 when they increased gold held in central bank vaults by 105 tonnes switching to ounces the miner states that gold holdings grew by a startling 2 9 million ounces in january and february 2019 versus 1 9 moz during the same period of 2018 this is the highest level of gold buying by central banks since the first two months of 2008 during the financial crisis central banks backed up the truck for gold in 2018 buying 651 5 tonnes versus 375 tonnes in 2017 that s the largest net purchase of gold since 1967 the miner suggests that anti us sentiment is at the root of all this central bank gold buying and yes there is a distinct geopolitical element to it all as these central bank buyers are predominantly from countries that stand in direct economic or political opposition to the u s and so are keen to move away from the u s dollar as a foreign reserve currency case in point the top two purchasers were russia and turkey russia is actively seeking to reduce its dependence on the greenback in an effort to skirt us sanctions for among other things interfering in the us presidential election and invading crimea the kremlin stopped buying foreign currency in september 2018 to prevent the ruble from crashing due to sanctions instead the russian central bank turned to gold buying a record 274 3 tonnes in 2018 according to bne intellinews while selling a whack of us treasuries bringing its share of the us dollar as a foreign reserve down from 43 7 to 20 between march and may of last year russia sold off 84 of its us debt holdings leaving just 14 9 billion in its us reserve account turkey needs gold to protect itself against a sluggish economy over the past year the lira has lost 30 of its value making it difficult for consumers to buy imported goods gold buying is one way to support the lira versus purchasing us treasuries which is difficult to do with the relative strength of the us dollar a couple of years ago turkey s president erdogan called on citizens to buy gold and they have those who keep dollar or euro currency under their mattresses should come and turn them into liras or gold goldcore summarizes the situation in turkey viz a viz gold the push for support for gold is two fold first it is an attempt to boost trust in the central banking system which is in increasingly dire straights the second is to support the underlying currency which is central to the axis of gold h t jim rickards that is russia china turkey and iran both of these things push back against us dollar hegemony and there we have it the reason for central banks recent gold accumulations has little to do with safe havens and a lot to do with chipping away at the us dollar s role as the reserve currency this article will explain what is happening rise of the petrodollar in july 1944 as allied troops were racing across normandy to liberate paris delegates from 44 nations met at bretton woods new hampshire and agreed to peg their currencies to the us dollar the only currency strong enough to meet the rising demands for international currency transactions what made the dollar so attractive to use as an international currency the world s reserve currency was each us dollar was based on 1 35th of an ounce of gold 35 20 us dollars an ounce and the gold was to be held in the us the us began to send larger and larger amounts of dollars overseas to fund their increasing trade deficits the glut of us dollars held abroad began to threaten us gold reserves remember us dollars were redeemable for gold and worldwide demand for gold was soaring by the late 1950 s us gold reserves had began to dwindle rapidly with the gulf of tonkin incident in late 1964 and the acceleration of the vietnam war in 1965 us military spending exploded this was compounded by president lyndon b johnson s great society project spending and not raising taxes since johnson refused to raise taxes to pay for the social welfare reforms undertaken earlier and the war in vietnam the us was now running massive balance of payment deficits with the world in october of 1960 panic buying caused gold s price to rise to over us 40 per oz a night time emergency call was made by the us federal reserve the bank of england was to immediately flood the gold market with enough supply to reduce and stabilize the price of gold the us had just made it abundantly clear that stopping the drain of its gold reserves and the depreciation of its currency against gold was a huge priority the us the bank of england and the central banks of west germany france switzerland italy belgium the netherlands and luxembourg then set up a gold sales consortium to prevent the market price of gold rising above us 35 20 per oz this consortium was known as the london gold pool this meant that the dollar would now be backed not only by the gold in fort knox but all the other pool members gold as well despite the cuban missile crisis and escalating tensions between moscow and the us gold prices remained fairly stable the london gold pool was a success with the gulf of tonkin incident in late 1964 and the acceleration of the vietnam war in 1965 us military spending exploded since us president johnson refused to raise taxes to pay social welfare reforms and the war in vietnam the us was now running massive balance of payments deficits with the world gold demand skyrocketed several planeloads of gold were emergency airlifted from the us to london gold demand continued to escalate with the london gold pool selling 175 tons one day and the very next day selling an additional 225 tons this broke the back of the london gold pool members were tired of draining their countries gold reserves to pay for the us s vietnam war and social reform policies an official two tiered price for gold was announced to the world the official price of us 35 20 would remain for central banks dealings the free market could find its own price in february 1970 the closing gold price on the london market averaged us 34 99 on august 15 1971 us president nixon ended the convertibility of the dollar into gold with gold finally demonetized the fed and the world s central banks were now free from having to defend their gold reserves and a fixed dollar price of gold the era of bretton woods was over for more economic history read our demise of london gold pool ends vietnam war recognizing that the us and the rest of the world was going to use a lot of oil and that saudi arabia wanted to sell the world s largest economy by far the us that oil nixon and saudi arabia came to an agreement in 1973 whereby saudi oil could only be purchased in us dollars this caused an immediate and strong global demand for the buck by 1975 all opec members had agreed to sell their oil only in us dollars thus ushering in the period of us petrodollar dominance that continues to this day exorbitant privilege in the 1960s french politician valéry d estaing complained that the united states and its exporters enjoyed an exorbitant privilege due to the dollar s status as the world s reserve currency he had a point because the dollar was and is the world s currency the us can borrow more cheaply than it could otherwise lower interest rates us banks and companies can conveniently do cross border business using their own currency and when there is geopolitical tension in the world central banks and investors buy us treasuries keeping the dollar high and the united states insulated from the conflict a government that borrows in a foreign currency can go bankrupt not so when it borrows from abroad in its own currency the dollar is the most important unit of account for international trade the main medium of exchange for settling international transactions and the store of value for central banks the federal reserve is the lender of last resort as in the 2008 09 financial crisis and is the most common currency for overseas borrowing by governments and businesses wall street generates significant income from selling banking services in usd to the rest of the world and the us manages the world s most important settlement systems allowing it to monitor and limit funds used for illegal activities us losing its privilege barry eichengreen author of exorbitant privilege the rise and fall of the dollar and the future of the international monetary system names three unique attributes to the dollar that no other currency has size stability and liquidity while the attendees at the bretton woods conference in 1944 envisioned the usd enjoying these advantages in perpetuity the reality is the greenback has been in decline for some time since the federal reserve was created in 1913 the dollar has lost 95 of its value see graph below over 100 years ago a buck was worth a buck in 2013 it was valued at 5 cents its worth eroded by inflation then there s the us debt currently sitting at over 22 trillion and growing daily jeffrey sachs writing for project syndicate argues the dollar punches far above america s weight in the world economy producing just 22 of world output but accounting for 50 or more of cross border invoicing reserves settlements liquidity and funding due to us fiscal and monetary mismanagement as described above the bretton woods financial system set up in 1944 collapsed the breakdown of a gold backed dollar led to high inflation in the us and europe then a fall in inflation in the early 1980s sachs argues the turmoil of the dollar was a key factor in motivating europe to embark on monetary union resulting in the euro s launch in 1999 same with america s mishandling of the 1997 asian debt crisis which led to china wanting to internationalize the renminbi or chinese yuan the 2008 09 financial crisis which started in the us through the sub prime mortgage debacle was another flag to the rest of the world signaling a move away from the dollar toward other currencies notes sachs america s monetary stewardship has stumbled badly over the years and trump s misrule could hasten the end of the dollar s predominance the quantitative easing program that saw the fed s assets skyrocket from 900 billion to 4 5 trillion between 2019 and 2015 through the buying up of treasuries paid for by printing money made it inexpensive for the us government to continue to borrow and spend with rates close to zero however qe also showed other countries that no longer was the united states following a sound fiscal policy all it was doing was printing money countries started to diversify their foreign exchange reserves and reduce their dependence on the dollar according to the imf usd foreign exchange reserves have dropped from 72 of the world s forex in 2001 to 62 today 7 saudi arabia s nuclear option the price of crude oil and gasoline have surged since january causing alarm within the trump administration the commander in chief has been sending angry tweets directed at opec blaming the oil cartel for high gas prices indeed fuel prices have risen about 50 cents a gallon over the past 90 days in step with increased crude prices which on wednesday closed at 63 58 a barrel wti from 48 452 barrel on jan 7 it wasn t long ago that everyone was complaining about oil prices being too low in response the house judiciary committee passed a bill allowing the united states to sue members of opec for manipulating the oil market the so called nopec bill has been proposed under past administrations but no previous presidents have dared to threaten the us saudi relationship trump in typical cavalier fashion is the first to do so he thumbed his nose at the arab world by recognizing jerusalem as the capital of israel and israeli sovereignty over the golan heights the unconventional president has picked at the threads of the us saudi relationship leading to its unraveling as a presidential candidate trump called the saudi regime the world s biggest funder of terrorism to be fair saudi arabia s crown prince mohammed bin salman mbs has shown a disturbing recklessness in foreign policy from the bloody yemen conflict to the blockade of qatar the kidnapping of the lebanese prime minister and the near collapse of the gulf cooperation council the low point came when the us did not defend mbs amid widespread condemnation over what appeared to be a premeditated killing of a saudi journalist jamal khashoggi there is also concern over the construction of saudi arabia s first nuclear reactor and whether its nuclear capability could be put to use making weapons while the two reactors are meant for energy production mbs said last year that the kingdom would develop nuclear arms if iran did so recently the us congress passed a bill cutting off aid for the saudi war in yemen exhausting any goodwill left between the two nations back to the nopec bill the move to expose opec members to us antitrust lawsuits put saudi arabia on the defensive the oil soaked nation is threatening to kill the petrodollar if the us moves forward on the legislation by selling its oil in non dollar currencies oilprice com reports the effects of opec members rejecting dollar dominance in oil sales would be extremely bad for the us economy this is the so called nuclear option the global oil market is almost entirely conducted in dollars which provides the foundation for dollar domination in the global financial system introducing new currencies in the oil trade could undercut demand for the dollar diminish american influence over global finance weaken american influence over sanctions and thus undercut its geopolitical reach it s hard to assess how serious saudi arabia is but the implications of such a move are far reaching and hard to overstate the willing beneficiaries of oil traded in other than us dollars include china russia and the european union all of which have expressed frustration at the trump administration s treatment of other countries and called for a resetting of the dollar based international system china and russia have inked energy deals whereby trade is conducted in rubles and yuan china has also started a yuan denominated oil futures contract based in shanghai and perhaps most significantly in a major snub to the us iran and the eu agreed to set up a new payments system to enable trade with iran in order to avoid us sanctions arising from the scrapping of the 2015 iran nuclear deal trump said in may 2018 that any nation that helps iran in its quest for nuclear weapons could be strongly sanctioned the special purpose vehicle is effectively the eu s own swift the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunications used for transferring money between countries which conducts transactions in usd perfect storm for gold amid rising regional tensions that has saudi arabia the world s largest oil exporter looking beyond its special relationship with the us and wider geopolitical strains between the us china and russia think about the us china trade war naval posturing in the south china sea russia supporting outcast venezuelan president maduro in what has traditionally been the us s backyard we have more evidence to show that the vaunted usd is under threat consideration of an alternative loony left economic theory that should have been dismissed outright by american lawmakers is actually being taken seriously due to the untenable position the us finds itself in regarding its mounting pile of debt modern monetary theory posits that rather than obsessing about how large the debt has grown over 2 trillion and the ongoing annual deficits that fuel debt government should target certain spending programs that will cause minimal inflation curb inflation and the debt can keep growing with no consequences this is because the us government can never run out of money it just keeps printing money because dollars are always in demand with the dollar being the reserve currency and commodities are traded in dollars government is therefore given a free pass on spending because the only thing that we have to worry about with the national debt is inflation fiscal policy on steroids is according to its proponents to be the new engine of us growth and prosperity even if mmt isn t adopted and it s extremely unlikely that it would be just the idea of the us dollar losing its role as the world s reserve currency is alarming if it happened suddenly a massive sell off of us treasuries would result crashing the value of the dollar it would make the financial crisis of 2008 09 look like a mere stock market correction recall the frenzy of central bank gold buying described at the top countries holding large amounts of us treasury bills must be concerned about the ability of the us to keep financing its debt if opec kills the petrodollar its value could halve overnight and if the debt burden become so onerous that lawmakers decide to try mmt the greenback would take a massive hit in light of these risks is it any wonder central banks are bulking up on bullion indeed gold s status as store of value as money the only currency available when yours is worthless has come into play with respect to the drama that has been unfolding in venezuela over the last couple of years gold gives all of us something that fiat currencies paper money or any other financial innovation cannot deliver gold is insurance irreplaceable in its functions wall street turned its back on gold because it can t produce growth sprouts but international banking rules recently changed to accommodate the yellow metal under the old basel i and ii rules gold was rated a tier 3 asset under basel iii tier 3 has been abolished making gold bullion a tier 1 asset as of march 29 tier 1 capital is the measure of a bank s financial strength from a regulator s point of view also and this is important under basel iii a bank s tier 1 assets have to rise from the current 4 of total assets to 6 because gold is now a tier 1 asset banks can operate with far less capital than is normally required gold is the new backstop for debt currencies and bank equity capital central banks clearly see the value of holding gold over paper assets after 2008 mortgage backed securities mbs lost most of their value and they have also suffered massive value destruction by holding sovereign securities ie greece and italys that are today also near worthless perhaps almost a doubling of gold bullion purchases in 2018 over 2017 indicates that central banks believe gold is a better tier i asset than government debt and mbs there is also that 2 increase in total assets to 6 which now needs to be filled likely by gold in another way though central bank gold buying is undermining the dollar it s sending a signal to the us government and the federal reserve that the buck is no longer as important as it once was it s no longer risk free and the us is no longer considered to be the most powerful nation in the world carrying the biggest stick and the fattest wallet what will be the

how central bank gold buying is undermining the us dollar ahead of the herd has been digging into why central banks are buying a lot of gold recently what we ve found is eyebrow raising to say the least it may be the best reason you ve ever read for wanting to buy gold take this headline from the northern miner editorial central banks are major gold buyers in 2019 citing statistics from the world gold council the northern miner reports that central banks netted 51 tonnes in gold purchases the most since october 2018 when they increased gold held in central bank vaults by 105 tonnes switching to ounces the miner states that gold holdings grew by a startling 2 9 million ounces in january and february 2019 versus 1 9 moz during the same period of 2018 this is the highest level of gold buying by central banks since the first two months of 2008 during the financial crisis central banks backed up the truck for gold in 2018 buying 651 5 tonnes versus 375 tonnes in 2017 that s the largest net purchase of gold since 1967 the miner suggests that anti us sentiment is at the root of all this central bank gold buying and yes there is a distinct geopolitical element to it all as these central bank buyers are predominantly from countries that stand in direct economic or political opposition to the u s and so are keen to move away from the u s dollar as a foreign reserve currency case in point the top two purchasers were russia and turkey russia is actively seeking to reduce its dependence on the greenback in an effort to skirt us sanctions for among other things interfering in the us presidential election and invading crimea the kremlin stopped buying foreign currency in september 2018 to prevent the ruble from crashing due to sanctions instead the russian central bank turned to gold buying a record 274 3 tonnes in 2018 according to bne intellinews while selling a whack of us treasuries bringing its share of the us dollar as a foreign reserve down from 43 7 to 20 between march and may of last year russia sold off 84 of its us debt holdings leaving just 14 9 billion in its us reserve account turkey needs gold to protect itself against a sluggish economy over the past year the lira has lost 30 of its value making it difficult for consumers to buy imported goods gold buying is one way to support the lira versus purchasing us treasuries which is difficult to do with the relative strength of the us dollar a couple of years ago turkey s president erdogan called on citizens to buy gold and they have those who keep dollar or euro currency under their mattresses should come and turn them into liras or gold goldcore summarizes the situation in turkey viz a viz gold the push for support for gold is two fold first it is an attempt to boost trust in the central banking system which is in increasingly dire straights the second is to support the underlying currency which is central to the axis of gold h t jim rickards that is russia china turkey and iran both of these things push back against us dollar hegemony and there we have it the reason for central banks recent gold accumulations has little to do with safe havens and a lot to do with chipping away at the us dollar s role as the reserve currency this article will explain what is happening rise of the petrodollar in july 1944 as allied troops were racing across normandy to liberate paris delegates from 44 nations met at bretton woods new hampshire and agreed to peg their currencies to the us dollar the only currency strong enough to meet the rising demands for international currency transactions what made the dollar so attractive to use as an international currency the world s reserve currency was each us dollar was based on 1 35th of an ounce of gold 35 20 us dollars an ounce and the gold was to be held in the us the us began to send larger and larger amounts of dollars overseas to fund their increasing trade deficits the glut of us dollars held abroad began to threaten us gold reserves remember us dollars were redeemable for gold and worldwide demand for gold was soaring by the late 1950 s us gold reserves had began to dwindle rapidly with the gulf of tonkin incident in late 1964 and the acceleration of the vietnam war in 1965 us military spending exploded this was compounded by president lyndon b johnson s great society project spending and not raising taxes since johnson refused to raise taxes to pay for the social welfare reforms undertaken earlier and the war in vietnam the us was now running massive balance of payment deficits with the world in october of 1960 panic buying caused gold s price to rise to over us 40 per oz a night time emergency call was made by the us federal reserve the bank of england was to immediately flood the gold market with enough supply to reduce and stabilize the price of gold the us had just made it abundantly clear that stopping the drain of its gold reserves and the depreciation of its currency against gold was a huge priority the us the bank of england and the central banks of west germany france switzerland italy belgium the netherlands and luxembourg then set up a gold sales consortium to prevent the market price of gold rising above us 35 20 per oz this consortium was known as the london gold pool this meant that the dollar would now be backed not only by the gold in fort knox but all the other pool members gold as well despite the cuban missile crisis and escalating tensions between moscow and the us gold prices remained fairly stable the london gold pool was a success with the gulf of tonkin incident in late 1964 and the acceleration of the vietnam war in 1965 us military spending exploded since us president johnson refused to raise taxes to pay social welfare reforms and the war in vietnam the us was now running massive balance of payments deficits with the world gold demand skyrocketed several planeloads of gold were emergency airlifted from the us to london gold demand continued to escalate with the london gold pool selling 175 tons one day and the very next day selling an additional 225 tons this broke the back of the london gold pool members were tired of draining their countries gold reserves to pay for the us s vietnam war and social reform policies an official two tiered price for gold was announced to the world the official price of us 35 20 would remain for central banks dealings the free market could find its own price in february 1970 the closing gold price on the london market averaged us 34 99 on august 15 1971 us president nixon ended the convertibility of the dollar into gold with gold finally demonetized the fed and the world s central banks were now free from having to defend their gold reserves and a fixed dollar price of gold the

marketing b2c strategy is focused on enhancing quality and quantity of communication total media capacity of malls in smm channels is about 200 thousand followers with an average monthly reach more

achieved over the year up by 6 to 47 8 million visitors the group is consistently achieving impressive increases in visitor numbers year on year and this is primarily driven by the focus on making each shopping and entertainment centre a place which consumers want to visit not simply to shop at but also to relax and socialise an important part of arricano s appeal is due to the retail mix in each centre the management team is focused on constantly refreshing the retail mix so that each site continues to offer new brands and experiences alongside keeping traditional favourites the

our malls with digital communication and move to help our retailers provide omnichannel offers our media platform now has in excess of 200 000 active subscribers and has recorded millions of views content is coming from a variety of sources in 2018 a particularly popular video experiment borrowed from the harry potter films and projected ghosts flying through our prospekt mall the response resulted in thousands of views without any advertising and made clear the potential to do more to link this style of interaction with sales promotions as always our approach is to work collaboratively with retailers and consumers sharing data together and building trust and respect with the aim of everyone achieving their goals through working together as a result the number of tenants working with e commerce has nearly doubled from 39 to 72 as previously announced we invested in an online portal for tenants providing a broad range of tools for tenants use from access to administrative resources to a range of potential revenue generating opportunities for tenants to participate in merchandising mix is at the heart of every successful mall knowing our customers and understanding their aspirations is key 42 1 of our revenue from tenants across our 5 malls are from fashion stores with the balance of revenue being 6 4 health and beauty 8 3 restaurants and food 9 0 entertainment services 10 1 accessories jewellery and homeware 10 4 electronics and 13 7 hypermarkets in the third quarter of 2018 there was a focus on strengthening our presence in fashion including men s fashion with each shopping mall introducing 2 3 new popular clothing stores both ukrainian and international brands these efforts are clearly producing results given the 6 increase in visitor numbers during the year alongside achieving a good mix of tenants an important reason behind the popularity of the group s shopping centres is having the right balance of social spaces within each centre with this in place visitors can come and find their favourite retailers under one roof and also enjoy the well designed social spaces in which to meet eat and relax in terms of the new developments the group is progressing projects in odesa and lukyanivka kyiv the main focus is on development of the lukyanivka project construction is underway with initial financing completed in february 2019 and the project remains on track to complete in 2021 outlook these results reflect the success of our hard work over the last 5 years our malls are market leading and to maintain this position we are focused on the future it is clear shopping is going through an evolution here as it is elsewhere as the convenience of online purchases is altering traditional habits rather than this be a challenge we see it as an opportunity and we are responding accordingly our work with consumers and retailers on digital communications is proving successful not only in creating new experiences but also in strengthening the relationships we enjoy with both these groups this together with all the other elements of our business means we are confident of being able to continue to increase revenues in 2019 in line with

ukrainian authorities are not currently able to fully enforce ukrainian laws in this territory various events in march 2014 led to the accession of the republic of crimea to the russian federation which was not recognised by ukraine and many other countries this event resulted in a significant deterioration of the relationship between ukraine and the russian federation in november 2018 following an incident between the russian and ukrainian military around a waterway connecting the azov sea and the black sea the ukrainian authorities introduced martial law for a 30 days period in 10 regions located along the russian and moldovian border the azov sea and the black sea coast the martial law was terminated at the end of december 2018 after 30 days ukraine s economic situation deteriorated significantly in 2014 2016 as a result of the fall in trade with the russian federation and military tensions in eastern ukraine although instability continued throughout 2017 2018 the ukrainian economy continued to show signs of recovery with the inflation rate slowing down reduced depreciation of hryvnia against major foreign currencies growing international reserves of the national bank of ukraine the nbu and a general revival in business activity during 2016 2018 the nbu took certain steps to provide relief to the currency control restrictions introduced in 2014 2015 in particular the required share of foreign currency proceeds subject to mandatory sale on the interbank market was gradually decreased while the settlement period for export import transactions in foreign currency was increased also the nbu allowed ukrainian companies to pay dividends abroad subject to a certain monthly limitation in february 2019 a new law on currency and currency transactions came into force the new law abolished a number of restrictions defined new principles of currency operations currency regulation and supervision and resulted in significant liberalisation of foreign currency transactions and capital movements the banking system remains fragile due to low level of capital and weak asset quality and ukrainian companies and banks continue to suffer from a lack of funding from domestic and international financial markets the international monetary fund the imf continued to support the ukrainian government under the four year extended fund facility the eff program approved in march 2015 in october 2018 the government of ukraine reached an agreement with the imf on a new fourteen months stand by program which will replace the existing eff program other international financial institutions have also provided significant technical support in recent years to help ukraine restructure its external debt and launch various reforms including anti corruption corporate law and gradual liberalization of the energy sector in december 2018 moody s upgraded ukraine s credit rating to caa1 with a stable outlook reflecting the reaching of an agreement on further cooperation with the imf positive expectations regarding certain reforms and improved foreign affairs further stabilisation of economic and political environment depends on the continued implementation of structural reforms and other factors whilst management believes it is taking appropriate measures to support the sustainability of the group s business in the current circumstances a continuation of the current unstable business environment could negatively affect the group s results and financial position in a manner not currently determinable these consolidated financial statements reflect management s current assessment of the impact of the ukrainian business environment on the operations and the financial position of the group the future business environment may differ from management s assessment c cyprus business environment the cyprus economy has been adversely affected during the last few years by the economic crisis the negative effects have to some extent been resolved following the negotiations and the relevant agreements reached with the european commission the european central bank and the international monetary fund imf for financial assistance which was dependent on the formulation and the successful implementation of an economic adjustment program the agreements also resulted in the restructuring of the two largest systemic banks in cyprus through a bail in the cyprus government has successfully completed earlier than anticipated the economic adjustments program and exited the imf program on 7 march 2016 after having recovered in the international markets and having only used eur 7 25 billion of the total eur 10 billion earmarked in the financial bailout under the new euro area rules cyprus will continue to be under surveillance by its lenders with bi annual post program visits until it repays 75 of the economic assistance received although there are signs of improvement especially in the macroeconomic environment of the country s economy including growth in gdp and reducing unemployment rates significant challenges remain that could affect the estimates of the group s cash flows and its assessment of impairment of financial and non financial assets the group s management believes that it is taking all the necessary measures to maintain the viability of the group and the development of its business in the current business and economic environment and that no adverse impact on the group s operations is expected d russian business environment the group s operations are also carried out in the russian federation consequently the group is exposed to the economic and financial markets of the russian federation which display characteristics of an emerging market the legal tax and regulatory frameworks continue development but are subject to varying interpretations and frequent changes which together with other legal and fiscal impediments contribute to the challenges faced by entities operating in the russian federation starting in 2014 the united states of america the european union and some other countries imposed and gradually expanded economic sanctions against a number of russian individuals and legal entities the imposition of the sanctions has led to increased economic uncertainty including more volatile equity markets a depreciation of the russian rouble a reduction in both local and foreign direct investment inflows and a significant tightening in the availability of credit as a result some russian entities may experience difficulties accessing the international equity and debt markets and may become increasingly dependent on state support for their operations the longer term effects of the imposed and possible additional sanctions are difficult to determine the consolidated financial statements reflect management s assessment of the impact of the russian business environment on the operations and the financial position of the group the future business environment may differ from management s assessment 2 basis of preparation a statement of compliance these consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with

from these estimates estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any

conclude a number of new tenancy agreements and increase occupancy rate of its shopping centres besides the group managed to gradually increase its rental rates during the year for existing tenants in accordance with the budget approved for 2019 the group plans to increase its operating income during the next year management believes that the measures that it undertakes as described above will allow the group to maintain the positive working capital and operate on a going concern basis in the foreseeable future these consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realisation of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business f measurement of fair values a number of the group s accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values for both financial and non financial assets and liabilities when measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability the group uses market observable data as far as possible fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows level 1 quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly i e as prices or indirectly i e derived from prices level 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs if the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability might be categorised in different levels of the fair value hierarchy then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement the group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred further information about the assumptions made in measuring fair values is included in the following notes note 4 investment property and note 21 f iii fair values g change in presentation management

business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date which is the date on which control is transferred to the group the group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as the fair value of the consideration transferred plus the recognised amount of any non controlling interests in the acquiree plus if the business combination is achieved in stages the fair value of the pre existing equity interest in the acquiree less the net recognised amount generally fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed when the excess is negative a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss the consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre existing relationships such amounts are generally recognised in profit or loss transaction costs other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities that the group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date if an obligation to pay contingent consideration that meets the definition of a financial instrument is classified as equity then it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity otherwise other contingent consideration is remeasured at fair value at each reporting date and subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss when the acquisition of subsidiaries does not represent a business it is accounted for as an acquisition of a group of assets and liabilities the cost of the acquisition is allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based on their relative fair values and no goodwill or deferred tax is

that existed at the date of initial application policy applicable after 1 january 2018 i recognition and initial measurement trade receivables are initially recognised when they are originated all other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument a financial asset unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus for an item not at fvtpl transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue a trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price ii derecognition the group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the group neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset the group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled or expire the group also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value on derecognition of a financial liability the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid including any non cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed is recognised in profit or loss iii classification and subsequent measurement of financial assets on initial recognition a financial asset is classified as measured at amortised cost fvoci debt investment fvoci equity investment or fvtpl financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the group changes its business model for managing financial assets in which case all

the following conditions and is not designated as at fvtpl it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows and its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding a debt investment is measured at fvoci if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at fvtpl it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and its contractual terms give

comprise cash balances on the current accounts and call deposits iv financial assets business model assessment the group makes an assessment of the objective of the business model in which a financial asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed and information is provided to management the information considered includes the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice these include whether management s strategy focuses on earning contractual interest income maintaining a particular interest rate profile matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of any related liabilities or expected cash outflows or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the group s management the risks that affect the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model and how those risks are managed how managers of the business are compensated e g whether compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or the contractual cash flows collected and the frequency volume and timing of sales of financial assets in prior periods the reasons for such sales and expectations about future sales activity transfers of financial assets to third parties in transactions that do not qualify for derecognition are not considered sales for this purpose consistent with the group s continuing recognition of the assets financial assets that are held for trading or are managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at fvtpl v financial assets assessment whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest for the purposes of this assessment principal is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition interest is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs e g liquidity risk and administrative costs as well as a profit margin in assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest the group considers the contractual terms of the instrument this includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition in making this assessment the group considers contingent events that would change the amount or timing of cash flows terms that may adjust the contractual coupon rate including variable rate features prepayment and extension features and terms that limit the group s claim to cash flows from specified assets e g non recourse features a prepayment feature is consistent with the solely payments of principal and interest criterion if the prepayment amount substantially represents unpaid amounts of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding which may include reasonable additional compensation for early termination of the contract additionally for a financial asset acquired at a discount or premium to its contractual par amount a feature that permits or requires prepayment at an amount that substantially represents the contractual par amount plus accrued but unpaid contractual interest which may also include reasonable additional compensation for early termination is treated as consistent with this criterion if the fair value of the prepayment feature is insignificant at initial recognition vi classification and subsequent measurement of financial liabilities financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost or fvtpl a financial liability is classified as at fvtpl if it meets the definition of held for trading or it is designated as such on initial recognition financial liabilities at fvtpl are measured at fair value and net gains and losses including any interest expense are recognised in profit or loss except for the part of the fair value change that is due to changes in the group s own credit risk that is recognised in other comprehensive income other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in profit or loss the group measures all of its financial liabilities at amortised cost vii offsetting financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statements of financial position when and only when the group currently has

legally enforceable right to set off if that right is not contingent on a future event and enforceable both in the normal course of business and in the event of default insolvency or bankruptcy of the group and all counterparties iii non derivative financial assets measurement loans and receivables loans and receivables were a category of financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that were not quoted in an active market such assets were recognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs subsequent to initial recognition loans and receivables were measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any impairment losses loans and receivables comprised the following classes of financial assets trade and other receivables loans receivable and cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents comprised cash balances call deposits and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less from the acquisition date that were subject to insignificant risk of changes in their fair value iv non derivative financial liabilities measurement the group classified non derivative financial liabilities into the other financial liabilities category such financial liabilities were recognised initially at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs subsequent to initial recognition these financial liabilities were measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method other financial liabilities comprised loans and borrowings finance lease liability trade and other payables and other liabilities d capital and reserves share capital ordinary shares are classified as equity incremental costs directly attributable to issue of ordinary shares are recognised as a deduction from equity net of any tax effects more to follow dow jones newswires april 17 2019 02 04 et 06 04 gmt dj arricano real estate plc final results 10 share premium share premium reserves include amounts that were created due to the issue of share capital at a value price greater than the nominal non reciprocal shareholders contribution non reciprocal shareholders contribution reserve includes contributions made by the shareholders directly in the reserves the shareholders do not have any rights to these contributions which are distributable at the discretion of the board of directors subject to the shareholders approval retained earnings retained earnings include accumulated profits and losses incurred by the group other reserves other reserves comprise the effect of acquisition and disposal of subsidiaries under common control change in non controlling interest in these subsidiaries and the effect of forfeiture of shares foreign currency translation differences foreign currency translation differences comprise foreign currency differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations and foreign exchange gains and losses from monetary items that form part of the net investment in the foreign operation e investment properties investment properties are those that are held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or for both but not for sale in the ordinary course of business use in production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes investment properties principally comprise freehold land leasehold land and investment properties held for rental income earning or future redevelopment leasehold of land under operating lease is classified and accounted for as an investment property when the definition of investment property is met under investment property accounting the right to use the land is measured at fair value and the obligation to pay rentals is accounted for as a finance lease i initial measurement and recognition investment properties are measured initially at cost including related acquisition costs cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the investment property the cost of self constructed investment property includes the cost of materials and direct labour any other costs directly attributable to bringing the investment property to a working condition for their intended use and capitalised borrowing costs if the group uses part of the property for its own use and part to earn rentals or for capital appreciation and the portions can be sold or leased out separately they are accounted for separately therefore the part that is rented out is investment property if the portions cannot be sold or leased out separately the property is investment property only if the company occupied portion is insignificant ii subsequent measurement subsequent to initial recognition investment properties are stated at fair value any gain or loss arising from a change in fair value is included in profit or loss in the period in which it arises when the group begins to redevelop an existing investment property for continued future use as investment property the property remains an investment property which is measured at fair value and is not reclassified to property and equipment during the redevelopment when the use of a property changes such that it is reclassified as property plant and equipment its fair value at the date of reclassification becomes its cost for subsequent accounting investment properties are derecognised on disposal or when they are permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefits are expected from their disposal the gain or loss on disposal is calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised as gain or loss in profit or loss it is the group s policy that an external independent valuation company having an appropriate recognised professional qualification and recent experience in the location and category of property being appraised values the portfolio as at each reporting date the fair value is the amount for which a property could be exchanged on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm s length transaction the valuation is prepared in accordance with international valuation standards published by the international valuation standards council iii property under development construction property that is being constructed or developed for future use as an investment property and for which it is not possible to reliably determine fair value is accounted for as an investment property that is stated at cost until construction or development is complete or until it becomes possible to reliably determine its fair value when construction is performed on land previously classified as an investment property and measured at fair value such land continues to be accounted at fair value throughout the construction phase f property and equipment i recognition and measurement items of property and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset the cost of self constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labor any other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use and the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that equipment when parts of an item of property and equipment have different useful lives they are accounted for as separate items major components of property and equipment the gain or loss on disposal of an item of property and equipment is determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property and equipment and is recognised net within other income other operating expenses in profit or loss ii reclassification to investment property when the use of a property changes from owner occupied to investment property the property is re measured to fair value and reclassified to investment property any gain arising on re measurement is recognised in profit or loss to the extent that it reverses a previous impairment loss on the specific property with any remaining gain recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the revaluation reserve in equity any loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss iii subsequent costs the cost of replacing part of an item of property and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the group and its cost can be measured reliably the costs of the day to day servicing of property and equipment are recognised in profit or loss as incurred iv depreciation items of property and equipment are depreciated from the date that they are installed and are ready for use or in respect of internally constructed assets from the date that the asset is completed and ready for use depreciation is based on the cost of an asset less its residual value depreciation is recognised in profit or loss on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property and equipment leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term land is not depreciated the estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods are as follows vehicles and equipment 5 years fixture and fittings 2 5 5 years depreciation methods useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted if appropriate g intangible assets i recognition and measurement intangible assets that are acquired by the group which have finite useful lives are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses ii subsequent expenditure subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates all other expenditure including expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in profit or loss as incurred iii amortisation amortisation is calculated over the cost of the asset or other amount substituted for cost less its residual value amortisation is recognised in profit or loss on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets other than goodwill from the date that they are available for use since this most closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset the estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods are as follows software 3 5 years amortisation methods useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted if appropriate h inventories inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value the cost of inventories is based on the first in first out principle and more to follow dow jones newswires april 17 2019 02 04 et 06 04 gmt dj arricano real estate plc final results 11 includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses i assets classified as held for sale non current assets or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities that are expected to be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use are classified as held for sale such assets or disposal group are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell any impairment loss on a disposal group is allocated first to goodwill and then to the remaining assets and liabilities on pro rata basis except that no loss is allocated to inventories financial assets deferred tax assets or investment property which continue to be measured in accordance with the group s other accounting policies impairment losses on initial classification as held for sale and subsequent gains or losses on remeasurement are recognised in profit or loss gains are not recognised in excess of any cumulative impairment loss intangible assets and property and equipment once classified as held for sale are not amortised or depreciated j impairment i impairment financial assets policy applicable from 1 january 2018 the group uses expected credit loss ecl model this impairment model applies to financial assets measured at amortised cost contract assets but not to investments in equity instruments the financial assets at amortised cost consist of trade and other receivables cash and cash equivalents and loans receivable loss allowances are measured on either of the following bases 12 month ecls these are ecls that result from possible default events within the 12 months after the reporting date and lifetime ecls these are ecls that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument the group measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ecls except for bank balances for which credit risk i e the risk of default occurring over the expected life of the financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition for which loss allowances are measured as 12 month ecls when determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ecls the group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort this includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis based on the group s historical experience and informed credit assessment the group assumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly if it is more than 30 days past due the group considers a financial asset to be in default when the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the group in full without recourse by the group to actions such as realising security if any is held or the financial asset is more than 90 days past due the maximum period considered when estimating ecls is the maximum contractual period over which the group is exposed to credit risk measurement of ecls ecls are a probability weighted estimate of credit losses credit losses are measured as the present value of all cash shortfalls i e the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the group expects to receive ecls are discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset credit impaired financial assets at each reporting date the group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost are credit impaired a financial asset is credit impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred presentation of allowance for ecl loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortised cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets impairment losses related to trade and other receivables are presented under operating expenses and impairment losses on other financial assets are presented under finance costs similar to the presentation under ias 39 and not presented separately in the consolidated interim condensed statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income due to materiality considerations as at 1 january 2018 there was no change in the allowance for impairment for the group s financial assets due to implementation of ifrs 9 ii non financial assets the carrying amounts of non financial assets other than investment property deferred tax assets and inventory are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment if any such indication exists then the asset s recoverable amount is estimated for goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives or that are not yet available for use the recoverable amount is estimated each year at the same time for the purpose of impairment testing assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or cash generating unit cgu subject to an operating segment ceiling test for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing cgus to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment testing is performed reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of cgus that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination the group s corporate assets do not generate separate cash inflows and are utilised by more than one cgu corporate assets are allocated to cgus on a reasonable and consistent basis and tested for impairment as part of the testing of the cgu to which the corporate asset is allocated the recoverable amount of an asset or cgu is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell in assessing value in use the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or cgu an impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its cgu exceeds its estimated recoverable amount impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss impairment losses recognised in respect of cgus are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cgu group of cgus and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the cgu group of cgus on a pro rata basis an impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed in respect of other assets impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined net of depreciation or amortisation if no impairment loss had been recognised policy applicable before 1 january 2018 non derivative financial assets a financial asset not carried at fair value through profit or loss was assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any objective evidence that it is impaired a financial asset was impaired if objective evidence indicates that a loss event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset and that the loss event had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset that can be estimated reliably objective evidence that financial assets were impaired included default or delinquency by a debtor restructuring of an amount due to the group on terms that the group would not consider otherwise indications that a debtor or issuer will enter bankruptcy adverse changes in the payment status of borrowers or issuers in the group economic conditions that correlate with defaults the disappearance of an active market for a security or observable data indicating that there is measurable decrease in expected cash flows from a group of financial assets in addition for an investment in an equity security a significant or prolonged decline in its fair value below its cost was objective evidence of impairment financial assets measured at amortised cost the group considered evidence of impairment for financial assets measured at amortised cost at both a specific asset and collective level all individually significant assets were individually assessed for impairment those found not to be impaired were then collectively assessed for any impairment that had been incurred but not yet identified assets that were not individually significant were collectively assessed for impairment by grouping together assets with similar risk characteristics more to follow dow jones newswires april 17 2019 02 04 et 06 04 gmt dj arricano real estate plc final results 12 in assessing collective impairment the group used historical trends of the probability of default timing of recoveries and the amount of loss incurred adjusted for management s judgement as to whether current economic and credit conditions were such that the actual losses were likely to be greater or less than suggested by historical trends an impairment loss was calculated as the difference between an asset s carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the asset s original effective interest rate losses were recognised in profit or loss and reflected in an allowance account when the group considered that there were no realistic prospects of recovery of the asset the relevant amounts were written off interest on the impaired asset continued to be recognised through the unwinding of the discount when a subsequent event caused the amount of impairment loss to decrease and the decrease could be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised the decrease in impairment loss was reversed through profit or loss available for sale financial assets impairment losses on available for sale financial assets were recognised by reclassifying the losses accumulated in the fair value reserve in equity to profit or loss the cumulative loss that was reclassified from equity to profit or loss was the difference between the acquisition cost net of any principal repayment and amortisation and the current fair value less any impairment loss previously recognised in profit or loss changes in impairment provisions attributable to application of the effective interest method were reflected as a component of interest income if in a subsequent period the fair value of an impaired available for sale debt security increased and the increase could be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in profit or loss then the impairment loss was reversed with the amount of the reversal recognised in profit or loss however any subsequent recovery in the fair value of an impaired available for sale equity security was recognised in other comprehensive income k provisions a provision is recognised if as a result of a past event the group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability the unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance cost l revenue the group has

sri lanka s central bank which printed tens of billions of rupees in 2018 to boost economic activity artificially just as the economy recovered generated another bust and currency collapse bringing to fruition a prediction made in 1975 false promise on false premise sri lanka abolished a hard peg currency board with a floating interest rates and moved to money printing in 1950 on the false promise that the exchange rate and interest rate can be controlled at the same time and join the failed bretton woods system of soft pegs the controlling of interest rates is called monetary policy independence it was all the rage in post colonial countries monetary policy independence was simply a euphemism to say that the central bank officials could print money at any time they wished and with no questions asked it was the fad of the times after world war ii and keynesianism was all the rage but countries like malaysia singapore later also mauritius the maldives and dubai stayed out of the craze and kept their pegs hard while being part of the bretton woods japan which had suffered from hyper inflation was also not tempted maldives now has a per capita gdp of 11 000 dollars compared to 4 000 in sri lanka but the law of the maldives monetary authority has been modernised leading to more instability of late more modernisation is planned germany which lost the war also stayed out of the keynesian dogma and created the german economic miracle through its social market economy the basis for the social market economy was sound money not soft pegging or a depreciating real effective exchange rate anglo saxon the uk suffered from keynesian economics which generated unsound money just as badly as any former colony that followed such policies such as sri lanka india or pakistan the bank of england the uk had a soft peg with the us dollar under the bretton woods system was hit with sterling crises inflation and depreciation and became a weak nation while countries like singapore forged ahead the way to a better life was through hard work first in schools then in universities or polytechnics and then in the workplace goh keng swee architect of singapore s monetary stability and economic reforms said diligence education and skills will create wealth not central bank credit hence we were not impressed by claims excessive as they turned out to be that government could bring about prosperity through spending it did not surprise us that the anglo saxon countries which adopted such policies got into trouble we also noted that the germans and japanese did not believe they could spend their way to prosperity as the phrase went like singaporeans they set stock on diligence education and skills controlling interest rates is called monetary policy independence it was all the rage in postcolonial countries goh went to the london school of economics lse where in the 1930s friedrich von hayek an austrian german economist lectured and pointed out the flaws of keynes theories under margaret thatcher uk finally dug itself out of its post world war ii economic morass thatcher incidentally was a fan of hayek and reportedly flashed a copy of his constitution of liberty when a conservative think tank tried to make her follow the middle way the usual path of fascists sri lanka s a s jayewardene who also went to lse was the first central bank governor to resist money printing jayawardene also changed the underlying law of the central bank which earlier gave it the responsibility to maintain the internal and external value of the rupee as both the exchange rate and interest rate cannot be controlled at the same time age of keynes under the bretton woods system countries like the uk and sri lanka pegged to the us dollar the us was expected to peg to gold at 35 dollars an ounce under the interventionist new deal during the great depression which was a result of the roaring 20s bubble fired by the fed in the first decade of its operation the us dollar was depreciated from 22 to 35 dollars an ounce this was a currency that has been stable since the late 1700s without a central bank if the fed was supposed to peg at 35 dollars an ounce obviously it could not operate independent monetary policy print money as it wished fixed interest rate targeting is incompatible with maintaining a gold peg just like sri lanka cannot maintain the exchange rate peg by printing money in the end gold convertibility of the us dollar was suspended in august 1971 and shortly thereafter the regime of floating currencies came into being world currencies continue to float till this day singapore s goh observed my cabinet colleagues took careful note of these dramatic events as they unfolded on the world s financial scene none of us believed that keynesian economic policies could serve as singapore s guide to economic well being there is a further difficulty to contend with the keynesian system is a closed one that is it takes no account of foreign trade this is admissible in theory but in practice since all modern states engage in foreign trade a keynesian stimulus will lead eventually to balance of payments deficits if the government does not exercise restraint in time the us also slapped import controls as the dollar s gold peg collapsed sri lanka closed its entire economy after 1971 while countries like singapore floated initially and then went back to a currency board it has since been modified to appreciate if the us fed is pursuing inflationary policy the sad thing is in 2018 sri lanka also slapped import controls sri lanka has learnt nothing other than mercantilism since 1950 taxes and currency depreciation the current administration came to power promising a social market economy and good governance this column pointed out that central bank reform should be the first step in a social market economy soon after this administration came to power sri lanka needs central bank reforms for a social market economy bellwether germany brought down inflation and currency stability after world war ii with its central bank and policymakers stuffed with newly resurgent liberals mostly from the so called frieberg school like ludwig erhard but also austrian classical economists such as william ropke who served on the currency reform panel singapore s goh has said democratically elected governments the world over are exposed to the temptation of winning votes though promising better and cheaper services and at the same time lower taxes but finance minister mangala samaraweera who took over later and had an extremely difficult job to save the country from the 2015 budget did not do that he has imposed several unpopular taxes in sharp contrast to the danger goh keng swee warned against neither samaraweera nor state minister eran wickremeratne has put pressure on the central bank to loosen policy and print money the central bank printed money and generates monetary instability and capital flight entirely on its own doctrine which then slowed economic activity and tax collections key monetary policy errors in february april and after august 2018 were all done by the central bank on its own volition exercising its independence in addition to paying new and higher taxes people are now forced to suffer exchange rate depreciation as well because of reer targeting meanwhile the national debt is expanding and forex losses at state enterprises are also going up the international monetary fund also gave the soft pegged central bank tools to engage in fancy monetary policy the central bank was taught to calculate the potential output so that it would be induced to print money when output was below the threshold like in april 2018 trying to close the potential output through printing money is what got the fed and the us dollar in trouble in the 1960s and led to the collapse of the entire bretton woods system in the first place in sharp contrast to conventional wisdom regarding politicians harsha de silva the state minister in charge of the ministry overseeing the central bank at the time urged the agency to allow rates to go up to reduce money printing it is not clear whether any elected politician in any other democratic country had ever asked a central bank to raise rates and follow prudent policy since like trump they are not aware or do not care whether a collapse comes later other than singapore where the politician who is the central bank governor is usually a classical economist it is perhaps the first time an asian politician had asked a central bank to follow prudent policy how come he was ignored why did this happen and how come the imf apparently sanctioned all this keynes ghost and the big lie that countries will continue to suffer from keynes doctrine despite the fall of bretton woods was predicted by none other than hayek over 40 years ago keynes died shortly after world war ii after the first negotiations for bretton wood he did not live to see the massive inflation and currency problems that his own country and the us suffered to be fair keynes first preference was to have a different system the bancor and not the structure that eventually came bretton woods soft pegs and the imf were primarily a us idea driven by new dealers who were also keynesians who wanted to break the sterling era and get central banks in countries like sri lanka to invest in us dollar debt instead of sterling debt new dealers were probably worse than keynes and they had greater political power as the us was the biggest creditor nation remaining at the time with gold reserves of the bank of england and other european banks depleted the us also loaned officials to set up soft pegged central banks including to sri lanka and the state department gave the diplomatic push hayek pointed out the flaws and the dangers of the ideas contained in keynes treatise in money through a series of lectures in the 1930s a central idea of the treatise was that a recession would occur if savings exceeded investment in fact this is what happens after a bubble bursts and a modern day central bank in sri lanka re builds forex reserves the opposite happens when money is printed and balance of payment deficits occurs it may cause harm to print money just after a bubble has burst because the credit system is not giving enough loans i e savings exceed investment but not so when the economy and credit starts to recover this is why singapore s goh said restraint must be exercised in time it is also why the fed tightened as credit picked up in recent months sri lanka s central bank on the other hand opens the monetary taps just as the economy is recovering it did so in 2011 2015 and in 2018 the central bank also keeps unnecessarily high interest rates after the end of a bop crisis delaying a recovery egged on by the imf after a currency collapse and liquidity shortages end inflation usually spikes as the price structure of the country re adjusts regardless of whether interest rates are high or low unless the exchange rate bounces back like in a floating system austrian economists one of the last remaining classical economics schools on the other hand said that stimulus would lead to a bubble which will then collapse and generate transient unemployment sri lanka s central bank has been in the habit of blaming the government budget for excess demand this is not true a budget cannot generate excess demand because spending power is transferred from one set of people bond holders to the government excess demand can only be fired if the central bank prints money it matters little whether the money is printed for deficit financing or it is injected through open market operations into the banking system for private credit the government which can pay higher rates is supposed to crowd out other borrowers if there is perfect crowding out there cannot be excess demand the excess demand will only come if the central bank prints money to buy the bonds or gives money to banks through open market operations to finance the government to say that a budget fires excess demand is a lie although whether it is intentionally done by the central bank to absolve itself from blame it or whether it is a lost generation side effect is open to debate the sad thing is in 2018 sri lanka also slapped import controls we have learnt nothing other than mercantilism since 1950 even in the case of a credit collapse deficit spending can only take the excess savings and expand consumption or investment to equal spending to savings monetary hitler hayek was awarded a nobel prize in 1974 shortly after the bretton woods system collapsed and the world went into floating rates and inflation picked up during this time hayek made a presentation at a conference in switzerland urging countries to end legal tender laws and allow currency competition so that better currencies would get wider use he pointed out that money printing will only give a short term stimulus the price is a bust and lower employment it had been the case when tried out earlier by the likes of john law in france it was john maynard keynes a man of great intellect but limited knowledge of economy theory who ultimately succeeded in rehabilitating a view long the preserve of cranks with whom he openly sympathized hayek said in a speech that was published by the institute of economic affairs as an occasional paper the claim of an eminent public figure and brilliant polemicist to provide a cheap and easy means of permanently preventing serious unemployment conquered public opinion and after his death professional opinion too john hicks an economist who came up with an is lm model but later said it was a classroom gadget had proposed that 1950 to 1975 be called the age of keynes because the earlier quarter century was the age of hitler i do not feel that the harm keynes did is really so much as to justify that description hayek said but it is true that so long as his prescriptions seemed to work they operated as an orthodoxy which it appeared useless to oppose sri lanka s central bank has been in the habit of blaming the government budget for excess demand this is not true lost generation so why is there no learning curve at depreciating central banks either in sri lanka or in latin america how come the central bank is still following john law to generate excess liquidity when there is no currency pressure and continues to sterilise outflows through open market operations when the peg is defended after pressure is generated how come sri lanka is targeting an exchange rate with multiple convertibility undertakings without a floating policy rate the whole theory underlying the full employment policies has by now of course been thoroughly discredited by the experience of the last few years hayek said in consequence the economists are also trying to discover its fatal intellectual defects which they ought to have seen all along yet i fear the theory will still give us a lot of trouble it has left us with a lost generation of economists who have learnt nothing else one of our chief problems will be to protect our money against those economists who will continue to offer their quack remedies the short term effectiveness of which will continue to ensure them popularity in 2001 to 2004 when prime minister ranil wickremesinghe was in power sri lanka operated exceptional economic policy and a liberalisation drive with a s jayewardene as governor sound money was preserved budgets were tight and the economy recovered with no inflation keynes was nowhere in sight but in 2015 wickremesinghe was quoted in news reports saying a keynesian stimulus was being done there was a massive spike in the deficit under finance minister ravi karunanayake and released liquidity by terminating term repo deals like the central bank of argentina was buying back its own sterilisation securities and the bop crisis came soon after imf puzzle it is also a puzzle why the imf is giving a forex reserve target with an inflation target instead of a domestic assets ceiling for the central bank an inflation target which allows the central bank to cut rates print money is incompatible with a forex reserve target which requires the operation of a peg tighter than a currency board so why is there no learning curve at depreciating central banks either in sri lanka or in latin america the soft peg is a creature of the bretton woods and the bretton woods was a creature of us new dealers who were arch interventionists that made the great depression worse the us treasury s harry dexter white in particular who was the prime mover behind the bretton woods was a new dealer with soviet sympathies unlike the gold standard which made free trade possible for about two centuries with no inflation the bretton woods was failing by the 1960s and collapsed in 1971 a key reason for building a dollar pegged exchange regime by america was to get other central banks to buy us debt with their forex reserves lowering deficit financing costs instead of sterling debt but people like then us secretary of state cordell hull genuinely wanted free trade and a monetary order that would help achieve it after the devaluations and tariff wars during depression the imf also does not favour currency boards which may be a throwback to the past since its original mandate revolved around breaking currency boards amusingly imf teams that reviewed hong kong used to say that the linked exchange rate has served the country well since 1950 sri lanka s central bank s soft peg has done enormous damage to the country destroying stability destroying people s real salaries and destroying free trade forex shortages also helped economic nationalism with import substitution triggered by policy errors countless hapless sri lankans were prosecuted for breaking foreign exchange controls this is not counting the political instability that came from inflation and depreciation the latest cost of the soft peg is to kill the social market economy before it is born taking away the basic stability destroy real wages and leave the people with both higher taxes and currency depreciation the reer targeting and the resulting unsound money also shattered the trade liberalisation drive of mangala samaraweera by forcing him to roll back trade liberalisation and slam restrictions in monetary dominance of fiscal policy since 1950 the central bank s soft peg has done enormous damage to the country destroying stability people s real salaries and free trade currency depreciation also denied any benefit of lower tariffs to the people a similar phenomenon was seen in the 1980s where the benefits of an open market was denied to the people by monetary instability of the central bank as currency depreciation destroyed real wages triggering widespread strikes and unrest as karl schiller economy minister of germany until 1972 around the time the bretton woods collapsed said stability is not everything but without stability everything is nothing the question is when will sri lanka s central bank stop de

disruptions are accelerating the fourth industrial revolution era lord mervyn king former governor of bank of england elaborates extensively about this change in his book the end of alchemy the beauty of the english language is that a silent letter in a word can add a detonating meaning to evoke some interest with little confusion this article is titled with a newly coined word debterioration which will undoubtedly add sense to the rest of the writing as we all know economics is a subject that predicts specific outcomes on probabilities and possibilities in an economy in addressing disequilibrium resulting in allocation and misallocation of primary factor inputs such as land labour capital and entrepreneurship unlike in natural sciences no economics formulas or solutions can be tested in a laboratory before being introduced to the community many economic theories are based on trust and belief as lessons learnt from past experiences and the impact of such opinions on the economy discussed as historical narrations one such approach is put forward by renowned economist john maynard keynes which is popularly known as keynesian theories his strategy worked well to overcome the economic crisis in the early 20th century when money supply was strictly in the hands of central bankers it is unfortunate that we still assess productivity and performances of businesses and institutions based on indicators designed for the first industrial revolution when land labour entrepreneurship and capital factors were the productivity driving assets performances and productivity returns were measured in terms of returns on capital this formula was necessary as amongst the four factor inputs capital was the scarcest resource how prudent are we to continue with the same performance and productivity measuring indicators in the current context in this era assets driving productivity and growth are our knowledge and human capital catalysed with digital and mobile technology the capital what is now circulating is fake and impotent which is leveraged with debt as such investment capital has lost its vigour there appears to be a need to challenge conventional thinking to initiate discussions to come up with new performance measuring indicators that are compatible with the 4ir as many economies are on life support with debt infused saline drip economics is not a natural science natural science is a branch of knowledge that deals with the physical world however in sri lanka economics in sinhala is known as arthika vidyava adding the scientific suffix to get a feeling of science for those students who opted to follow the subject putting good money behind bad is not considered as good business sense with regulatory tightening following the 2008 global financial crisis gfc banks were subject to stress tests and forced to beef up their capital to cover the weighted risk assets and meet their liquidity requirements regulatory tightening was considered as one option to resolve the global financial crisis which originated from the oecd countries the unethical rent seeking business culture of the top triple b bankers big bonus bankers that contributed to the crisis were side lined governments in a panic threw lifeboats to rescue the banks and bankers and life jackets were taken away from the real victims of the disaster and forced many to sink losing assets jobs and life savings source us dept of treasury public private partnership private debt and public debt camouflaged as sovereign debt post gfc commercial banks were subjected to tighter regulatory control but the central banks could print money at will with the mythical belief to accelerate the growth stimulating the economy a longstanding time tested public private partnership operation economists termed this policy option as quantitative easing qe central banks were expected to arrest the deflationary trends and halt stagnation in the marketplace through qe these unconventional monetary policies were termed as modern monetary theory based on this theory it is reported that the us federal reserve bank printed 2 trillion worth of paper money and released to jump start the economy the european central bank issued euros 80 billion to stimulate economic growth post 2008 global financial crisis as a result the interest rates in the us and eurozone remain at negative or near zero levels we are printing paper money glorified with the term quantitative easing the new jargon in economics since 2017 the fed started interest rate hikes resulting in many upheavals in global stock markets there have been two rounds of quantitative easing qe 1 and qe 2 during both rounds stock prices rose sharply the conventional perception is that higher stock prices make people more productive so long as they remain high at least and when people are more prosperous they spend more money with a false belief that spending supports the economy creates jobs and generates tax revenues which reduce the government budget deficit a step towards the further widening of inequality of income and wealth in the community the perception of richness is what is expected to drive economic growth what a fake feeling to foster future prosperity this may not sound an intelligent way to overcome challenges in the common man s understanding as one creates lies and believes in one s lies and forces others also to think alike with statistics and complex mathematical models economics and politics were two separate disciplines and practised differently in the post colonisation era by many countries depending on the degree of development free market believers clubbed economics and politics together and espoused the neoliberal order since the late 1970s the era of an ownership society driven with the sole aim of increasing shareholder value was unleashed since then coining the new economic order popularly known as reaganomics in the usa and thatcherism in the uk it never ended there and continued with fake beliefs till recently when prime minster shinsho abe tried abenomics in japan the free market believers under the neo liberal order promoted and propagated liberalisation privatisation and globalisation strategies to the rest of the world as the formula to accelerate growth yielding for prosperity growth measurements in terms of returns on investments and returns of assets are the outdated first industrial revolution indicator returns on equity capital share markets were the indicators measuring the prosperities of the nation and anything and everything was done to see the feelings of richness being kept alive in the capital markets development financial institutions like the world bank and imf too followed these principles and discouraged developing countries offering subsidies to the producers in the real economy grants and economic assistance to the marginalised needy can be considered as a market distortion force all these policy directives made a u turn with the advent of the global financial crisis causal factor that led to the global economic meltdown since 2008 moreover tariff reduction to promote trade and tax breaks for privileged aggravate the financial deficits in all major economies tax havens insulated with social hells populated as a way out of the gfc the policymakers ventured out offer subsidies this time they came up with the quantitative easing strategy which is printing money and offered grants to the capital markets to keep the stock markets alive and prevent them from collapse the unconventional monetary policy is now allowed zero or negative interest rates in the economies reversing the championed formula of market distortions negative interest rates confiscate capital and discourage savings nearly 10 trillion worth of bonds is trading currently at negative rates in europe and japan the corporate borrowing is high in the usa at rock bottom interest rates as reported in the economist collateralised loan obligations clo in the usa is rising steadily as the corporates are borrowing at near zero interest rates in the leveraged loan market reports reveal the clo volumes are almost equivalent the amounts of collateralised debt obligations cdo of 2007 alarming the dangers of sub prime debt banks and financial institutions are forced to hold bonds yielding negative returns to maintain liquidity as per the new regulatory norms president donald trump tweets and warns of the dangers of interest rate hikes to the fed reserve imf and wb are revising economic growth figures downward periodically artificially managed interest rates are not the best option to overcome the current challenges it is a step towards postponing the agony at these levels without enough economic growth no one generates enough wealth to repay debt obligations when the next financial crisis hits debt defaulters will wipe out a large portion of world savings the economists and central bankers will run out of monetary policy tools beyond negative interest rates instead the central bankers need to use negative interest rates to curb excessive debt holding the risky borrowers to bear the burden not allowing the erosion of wealth from savers shaking future financial stability the other option is to widen financial inclusion in society enabling the real economic actors producers and consumers to drive organic growth blending social finance with digital finance the new roe returns on ethics facts above and figures point out the investment capital that is circulating in the economies is fake distinctively different from the capital that rejuvenated economic growth in the first industrial revolution therefore the economists need to define a new performance and productivity measuring indicators in tune with the new wave of 4ir returns on equity roe does not sound ethical and scientific to estimate future prosperity returns on ethics can be a qualitative measuring tool as all the profits dividends earned and retained in books will be of no use when people do not have fresh water to drink and fresh air to breathe in the future the fake capital can smoothly integrate with artificial intelligence platforms driven with the algorithms and unfold double jeopardy bridging a link between the enron and gfc crisis that erupted at the beginning of the

the country s balance of payments bop which summarizes the philippines economic transactions with the rest of the world for a given period yielded a surplus for the fifth month in a row as inflows from the national government s ng net foreign currency deposits and the central bank s foreign exchange operations as well as income from the latter s investments abroad offset outflows due to ng s foreign debt payments the bangko sentral ng pilipinas bsp reported on wednesday the central bank reported separately that foreign portfolio investments also called hot money for the ease by which they are infused and taken out of local markets and which form part of bop s financial account reversed to a net outflow in march from net surpluses a year ago and the preceding month bop posted a 627 million surplus in march that was a turnaround from the year ago 429 million deficit and 46 8 more than february s 467 million surfeit that led to a year to date 3 797 billion surplus that was a turnaround from the 1 227 billion deficit in last year s first quarter and compares to the 3 5 billion deficit the central bank has projected for 2019 and the 2 306 billion gap incurred in 2018 the reported bop position reflected the final gross international reserves gir level of 83 61 billion as of end march 2019 the central bank said in a press statement at this level the gir represents a more than ample liquidity buffer and is equivalent to 7 4 months worth of imports of goods and payments of services and primary income it is also equivalent to five times the country s short term external debt based on original maturity outstanding foreign debt with maturity of up to a year and 3 5 times based on residual maturity outstanding foreign debt with original maturity of up to a year plus principal payments on medium and long term loans of the public and private sectors falling due in the next 12 months bsp deputy governor diwa c guinigundo told reporters via mobile phone message e continue to see very encouraging signs in the first two months of the year that ofw overseas filipino worker remittances and tourist receipts would continue to be robust adding that nflows of foreign loans are expected to have also supported the surplus in the march bop the bsp reported last monday that the first two months saw money sent home by ofws grew three percent year on year to 4 784 billion if this trend continues we should be looking at a better bop position at the end of the year it should also validate the financiability of the current account deficit we have sustained in the last few years on account of strong economic performance mr guinigundo said in an e mail security bank corp chief economist robert dan j roces said that the surplus masks the negative current account that includes trade in goods the philippine statistics authority reported on april 11 that the country s merchandise trade deficit grew 16 to 6 708 billion as of february from the 5 763 billion shortfall in 2018 s comparable two months the surplus reflects the high reserves accumulated by the central bank via the capital account our gross international reserves at an all time high and foreign investors are coming back having poured in around 400 million as of february mr roces wrote however these mask the negative in the current account which measures among others imports and exports where our imports are high and exports are stagnant he added moreover ofw remittances also high for the quarter are part of the current account which goes to show that the remittances are not enough to cover for the trade gap mr roces noted on a positive note our high capital account means we have enough forex reserves to stabilize the peso and as long as economic growth stays robust the export sector gets its support after the budget was signed and our economic fundamentals remain solid we see a sustained surplus for the year in a separate comment michael l ricafort economist of the rizal commercial banking corp rcbc said via text the improvement in the bop surplus may be attributed to the sustained pickup in net foreign portfolio net foreign buying in the local financial markets since the start of 2019 amid easing trend on both local inflation and interest rates bop surplus may also reflect the sustained growth in the country s structural us dollar foreign currency inflows such as ofw remittances bpo revenues and foreign direct tourism receipts as well as foreign direct investment inflows hot money retreats the central bank also reported on wednesday that hot money net outflows in march ended four straight months of net inflows march saw 739 million net outflows that was a reversal of the year ago 1 132 billion net inflows as gross inflows went down a third to 1 732 billion from 2 469 billion and gross outflows nearly doubled to 2 471 billion from 1 337 billion about 66 5 of investments registered during the month were in philippine stock exchange listed securities mainly to holding firms food beverage and tobacco companies property firms banks and transportation services companies while 33 4 went to peso denominated government securities and the 0 1 balance went to uitfs unit investment trust funds the bsp said in a separate statement the united kingdom the united states singapore luxembourg and hong kong were the top five investor countries for the month with combined share to total at 80 3 the central bank added that gross outflows may be attributed to large outflows from peso gs amounting to 939 million for march 2019 vis à vis the 154 million recorded in february the us continued to be the main destination of outflows receiving 76 8 of total remittances that brought first quarter flows to a 363 4 million net inflows that were less than half the year ago 766 05 million as gross inflows edged up 1 3 to 5 204 billion from 5 137 billion and gross outflows grew 10 7 to 4 841 billion from 4 372 billion sought for comment rcbc s mr ricafort replied in a text message some profit taking activities in march 2019 may have ensued after hefty market gains in january february 2019 partly triggered by slower global economic growth and outlook amid declines in manufacturing gauges of china euro zone and in some developed countries and declines in china s exports and imports largely due to the adverse effects of the lingering us china trade war and uncertainties related to brexit eopolitical risks related to tensions between india and pakistan in march 2019 also triggered some profit taking in the local markets some profit taking in the local markets also came after the announcement on increased msci weighting of chinese stocks in global benchmarks mr ricafort added in a separate comment nicholas antonio t mapa senior economist of ing bank nv manila said that the outflows could reflect investors monetary policy expectations portfolio flows continue to help determine direction for the peso with the outflow driven mainly by expectations for monetary policy march s depreciation trend mirrored the outflow from both the bond and equity markets with the bsp perceived to take on perhaps a more dovish tone to support flagging growth prospects after their ultra aggressive rate salvo of 2018 to quell supply side inflation mr mapa said in an e mailed response to questions we can also note that sentiment can help drive the direction for trading with the first two months of the year seeing stark appreciation pressure for the peso even as interest rate differentials between the us and the philippines remained unchanged we ve noted that foreign exchange direction is driven by both interest rate differentials as well as market assigned probability to a fed rate hike and thus the peso can remain stable even if actual differentials are maintained for as long as investors believe the fed to be on hold for the time being he added in the coming months we can expect the peso to still enjoy some appreciation pressure given that investors are no longer expecting the fed to hike rates in 2019 given the recent adjustment to the fed s outlook on rates this expectation will help drive the flow of funds to emerging markets like the philippines even if differentials are unchanged or even narrowed reicelene joy n ignacio
use the lexology getting the deal through tool to compare the answers in this article with those from other jurisdictions general structuring of financing choice of law what territory s law typically governs the transaction agreements will courts in your jurisdiction recognise a choice of foreign law or a judgment from a foreign jurisdiction governing law the transaction documents in a conventional acquisition financing in the united arab emirates uae are typically governed by the laws of the uae as applied in the emirate where the funds are made available the transaction documents in an acquisition funded through islamic finance are typically governed by the laws of the uae to the extent that such laws do not conflict with the principles of the islamic sharia ah a body of religious ethical and legal rules based on notions of justice and equity in the event of a conflict such principles would prevail choice of foreign law uae law recognises the principle of freedom of contract therefore in theory an express foreign choice of law clause in a contract should be recognised by the uae courts however the courts are normally reluctant to apply foreign laws on public policy grounds a principle that has been broadly construed if a uae court decides to apply foreign law in a particular case the foreign law must be proven to the court as a question of fact and if so proven may be ignored by a uae court as a matter of practice furthermore if a foreign law is applied there is no guarantee that a court will interpret it in a manner that is consistent with its application in the jurisdiction of origin there are certain areas of commercial dealing in which uae courts do not uphold a foreign choice of law including commercial agencies and distributorships real property employment government contracts certain sea transport claims and certain types of insurance contracts although acquisition finance agreements would likely not fall into any of these categories some elements of the transaction eg satisfaction of closing conditions may be affected and the caveats noted above will apply to any choice of law provision enforceability of foreign judgments the uae has treaties with various countries for judicial cooperation and recognition of judgments and arbitration awards the uae is also a signatory to the 1983 convention on judicial co operation between states of the arab league riyadh convention to which several arab countries have acceded and which has provisions relating to among other things the recognition and enforcement of judgments rendered in member states in relation to a judgment from a riyadh convention member state or a state with which the uae has a treaty the jurisdiction of the court of origin is generally not reviewed subject to particular exceptions that may be provided in the relevant treaty and the foreign judgment will likely be enforced the provisions of the uae civil procedure code must be satisfied in order for a uae court to enforce a judgment from a country with which the uae does not have a bilateral treaty the primary test for enforcement in the uae where no treaty is in place is whether reciprocal arrangements for the enforcement of judgments exist between the uae and the country in which the judgment is given an application to a uae court for enforcement of a foreign judgment must comply with a number of other conditions that include the following the uae courts must not have jurisdiction over the substantive dispute in relation to which the foreign judgment was obtained the judgment must have been issued by a competent court under the law of the jurisdiction from which it emanates the defendant must have been summoned and represented in the foreign proceedings the judgment must be final and binding under the law of the country in which the judgment was given and the judgment must not be inconsistent with a judgment or order already issued by a court in the uae and cannot be contrary to uae principles of morality and public order the requirement that the uae courts must not have jurisdiction over the substantive dispute may cause difficulties when enforcing a judgment against a defendant resident or domiciled in the uae as the uae courts have jurisdiction in relation to such a defendant if the requirements of the civil procedure code discussed above cannot be satisfied a civil claim must be filed in the relevant uae court where the foreign judgment may be filed in evidence however in such cases a uae court will examine the claim on its merits arbitration is becoming an increasingly popular way to resolve disputes in the uae the uae acceded to the un convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards of 1958 new york convention in 2006 and uae courts have since started enforcing foreign arbitral awards restrictions on cross border acquisitions and lending does the legal and regulatory regime in your jurisdiction restrict acquisitions by foreign entities are there any restrictions on cross border lending acquisitions by foreign entities yes there are significant restrictions on acquisitions by foreign entities in the uae uae federal law no 2 of 2015 as amended companies law requires companies located in the uae and not in one of the country s free zones to be at least 51 per cent owned by one or more uae nationals citizens of a gulf cooperation council gcc country or companies wholly owned by uae or gcc nationals certain entities eg banks are required to allocate an even greater portion of their shares to uae and gcc persons and entities foreign investors often contribute the entire capital and in such circumstances commonly enter into side agreements with the majority nominal shareholder in order to reflect the de facto beneficial ownership of the company and to strengthen their management rights however while certain aspects of such agreements have been upheld their enforceability has yet to be fully tested in the uae courts there is no restriction on acquisition of companies located in any of the uae free zones where 100 per cent foreign ownership is permitted restrictions on cross border lending there are no restrictions on cross border lending types of debt what are the typical debt components of acquisition financing in your jurisdiction does acquisition financing typically include subordinated debt or just senior debt acquisition financing in the uae is typically structured as a senior term loan which the borrower generally secures with personal or corporate guarantees in addition to the primary facility documentation the borrower will likely sign a promissory note a subordination agreement for its remaining debt and an assignment of certain identified ie current assets based on the nature of the acquisition although most acquisitions are funded through conventional finance there are a number of islamic finance structures that are used as well particularly the murabahah musharakah mudarabah and ijarah structures however the financial covenants of the islamic finance instruments are often more onerous than those found in conventional facilities certain funds are there rules requiring certainty of financing for acquisitions of public companies have certain funds provisions become market practice in other transactions where not required neither the uae companies law being law no 2 of 2015 nor the rules and regulations applicable in the uae s exchanges ie the abu dhabi securities exchange the dubai financial market and nasdaq dubai provide a separate set of rules governing the acquisition of public companies in the uae accordingly there is no express requirement that certain funds must be used in acquisitions in the dubai international financial centre difc a financial free zone in the emirate of dubai acquisitions are governed by the takeover rules module of the dubai financial services authority dfsa rulebook which also does not prescribe the use of certain funds although an offeror need not confirm that funds are in place for an acquisition there are restrictions on the use of debt financing see question 5 the recently established abu dhabi global market adgm has its own set of rules regulating the acquisition of public companies with a presence within the adgm which can be found in the takeover regulations takeover code rules 2015 and the takeover regulations 2015 these rules do contain provisions on certainty of financing restrictions on use of proceeds are there any restrictions on the borrower s use of proceeds from loans or debt securities yes central bank circular 25 2005 as amended by circular 2418 2006 restricts the amount of debt financing that may be used to acquire shares in a target company in particular it provides that in an initial public offering any debt financing provided to the subscribers cannot exceed 10 per cent of the nominal value of the shares to be acquired unless either the company or the bank receiving the subscription funds agrees to refund excess subscription funds to the lending bank in which case the lending limit would be 50 per cent of the nominal value of the shares also loans extended against the pledge of allotted shares in a public subscription of a newly established company may not exceed 70 per cent of the book value of the shares moreover borrowers may utilise debt financing to acquire up to 50 per cent of founder shares in a private company and 80 per cent of the shares in a company that has been operating for at least five years licensing requirements for financing what are the licensing requirements for financial institutions to provide financing to a company organised in your jurisdiction licensing requirements in the uae the principal financial services regulator in the uae is the central bank the securities and commodities authority esca also has some oversight functions in certain specific areas particularly in relation to listed securities and funds federal law no 10 of 1980 the banking law is the primary legislation giving the central bank the authority to regulate financial services in the uae the banking law provides that the central bank has the power to license and regulate a wide variety of financial institutions including those seeking to provide financing in the uae in particular those institutions are as follows commercial banks which include institutions that customarily receive funds from the public for granting loans and which issue and collect cheques place bonds trade in foreign exchange and precious metals and carry out other operations allowed by law or by customary banking practice investment banks which include institutions conducting similar activities to commercial banks with the notable exception that they do not accept deposits with a maturity of less than two years investment companies which manage portfolios on behalf of individuals or companies subscribe to equity and debt instruments prepare feasibility studies for projects market shares and debt instruments and establish and manage funds finance companies which provide corporate and consumer credit facilities but may not accept deposits from individuals islamic banks which undertake all the activities of a commercial bank and additionally can own assets financed by them islamic finance companies which may provide personal and consumer property vehicle and trade financing issue guarantees enter into foreign exchange contracts with corporate entities subscribe to shares bonds and certificates of deposits accept deposits from corporate entities and manage investment vehicles and real estate finance companies which are finance companies that specialise in funding real estate projects on a conventional or shariah compliant basis each of the entity structures listed if incorporated in the uae requires a uae national to hold at least 51 per cent of its shares however for finance companies commercial banks and investment banks the minimum uae national shareholding is 60 per cent branches of foreign banks are licensed as commercial banks and routinely provide financing to local entities any application for a central bank licence requires the submission of a letter of application various constitutional documents of the applicant and a business plan the central bank does not prescribe the exact documents required rather the normal practice is for the central bank to notify the applicant of such additional documents as it might require on an ad hoc basis currently the central bank has imposed a moratorium on accepting applications from foreign banks to operate a commercial bank in the uae esca has released a number of new regulations regarding the registration licensing and promotion of local and foreign funds in particular licensed fund sponsors must adhere to esca board of directors chairman decision no 9 rm of 2016 mutual fund regulations and the new regulations issued in relation to it as applicable including fund specific rules such as those related to real estate investment trusts cash investment funds venture capital funds and exchange traded funds the mutual fund regulations require fund sponsors to submit an application form along with a long form offering document and short form key investment information document licensing requirements in the difc to provide any financial service from within the difc an individual or entity must be authorised by the dfsa in particular a lender must seek a licence for arranging credit in order to offer financing from the free zone and must be structured as any one of the following entities limited liability company note it is anticipated that this legal form will soon be removed by way of an amendment to the difc companies law company limited by shares limited liability partnership or branch of foreign company or partnership unlike the rest of the uae the difc imposes no requirement for majority ownership by a uae national and 100 per cent foreign ownership is permitted however as with the entities incorporated in the uae a regulated lender in the difc must appoint directors and make periodic filings regarding among other things its capital adequacy licensing requirements in the adgm similar to the difc the adgm imposes no requirement for majority ownership by a uae national and 100 per cent foreign ownership is permitted an entity seeking to offer financial services in or from the adgm must obtain permission from the financial services regulatory authority however as with the entities incorporated in the uae a regulated lender in the adgm must appoint directors and make periodic filings regarding among other things its capital adequacy withholding tax on debt repayments are principal or interest payments or other fees related to indebtedness subject to withholding tax is the borrower responsible for withholding tax must the borrower indemnify the lenders for such taxes no there is no withholding tax currently levied in the uae restrictions on interest are there usury laws or other rules limiting the amount of interest that can be charged central bank circular 2149 2003 requires banks operating in the uae to publish tables on a monthly basis that include among other things the applicable interest rates for such period for variable rate lending the margin charged must be constant relative to either an inter bank rate or the cost of funds although no limit is set for the maximum interest that may be charged a bank may not lend at a rate that exceeds its maximum published interest rate there are similar rules governing penalty interest interest cannot be charged in islamic finance because it is prohibited under the principles of the islamic sharia ah indemnities what kind of indemnities would customarily be provided by the borrower to lenders in connection with a financing in both conventional and islamic financing the borrower typically indemnifies the lender for all costs resulting from any breach of the transaction documents or an event of default assigning debt interests among lenders can interests in debt be freely assigned among lenders yes a lender may assign an interest in debt to another lender in the uae requirements to act as agent or trustee do rules in your jurisdiction govern whether an entity can act as an administrative agent trustee or collateral agent yes the central bank esca dfsa and fsra licensing processes for administrative agents trustees and collateral agents are similar to those in place for entities intending to provide financing in the uae difc and adgm respectively see question 6 in this case the central bank application will need to stipulate that the entity intends to act as an administrative agent trustee or collateral agent both the dfsa and fsra require those agents and trustees to apply for a licence for custody trust services fund administration or for acting as the trustee of a fund as applicable debt buy backs may a borrower or financial sponsor conduct a debt buy back there is no express restriction against conducting a debt buy back in the uae in practice a borrower may be permitted to buy back the outstanding debt in conventional financing in islamic facilities debt prepayment is generally only possible with the consent of the lenders exit consents is it permissible in a buy back to solicit a majority of lenders to agree to amend covenants in the outstanding debt agreements there is no express restriction against soliciting a majority of lenders to amend a debt agreement under uae law in practice amendments are generally undertaken by a vote of the majority of lenders in both conventional and islamic syndicated lending guarantees and collateral related company guarantees are there restrictions on the provision of related company guarantees are there any limitations on the ability of foreign registered related companies to provide guarantees while there are no explicit restrictions on uae entities providing related company guarantees or benefiting from guarantees from foreign registered entities the companies law includes provisions that may nonetheless limit such guarantees in particular a joint stock company may not provide any loan or guarantee or collateral in connection with any loan to a member of its board or any relative of such person up to the second degree the limitation on providing loans but not guarantees and collateral extends to companies where the board member or any such relative holds more than 20 per cent of the capital furthermore the companies law requires any transaction including providing or benefiting from a guarantee with a related party to be approved by the shareholders and if the value of such transaction is greater than 5 per cent of the company s capital esca for the purposes of this restriction a related party refers to any director or senior executive of the company any company in which a director or executive holds at least 30 per cent of the share capital and any subsidiary or affiliate of that company assistance by the target are there specific restrictions on the target s provision of guarantees or collateral or financial assistance in an acquisition of its shares what steps may be taken to permit such actions the companies law prohibits companies and their subsidiaries from providing financial aid to any shareholder to enable the shareholder to acquire shares bonds or islamic bonds of the company such financial assistance includes providing loans gifts donations security or guarantees also while there is no specific body of law governing acquisitions in the uae there are some applicable provisions in federal law no 2 of 1987 civil code central bank circulars esca regulations and the listing rules for the uae s three exchanges the legislation in the difc and adgm has separate rules in each case concerning financial assistance in acquisitions these should be considered separately where relevant types of security what kinds of security are available are floating and fixed charges permitted can a blanket lien be granted on all assets of a company what are the typical exceptions to an all assets grant it is permissible to create a fixed charge over a specific asset or a blanket lien over all assets that are in existence at the time the funds are made available security is generally taken in the form of an assignment from the debtor to the lender or in the case of assets that are specifically addressed by statute eg land a mortgage or pledge however granting a lien over future acquired assets including by way of floating charges is not possible under uae law the asset must be identifiable at the time that the security interest is created it must have some monetary value and it must be capable of being delivered a valid security interest cannot be created over assets that change from time to time in practice the lender and borrower have entered into a commercial mortgage which is notarised and registered or chattel mortgage which is simply notarised over all of the assets of the borrower the assets in existence when the mortgage is created will be enumerated in an attached schedule and that schedule may be updated periodically by the parties however the uae recently enacted federal law no 20 of 2016 pledge law which creates a register of mortgages for certain movable assets as security for debts under the pledge law a lender may secure a pledge over tangible and intangible assets of a commercial business as security for any funding provided to acquire that business the resulting pledge will have priority over the rights of any purchaser lessee or lien holder provided that it is registered before the creation of any other rights on the relevant assets it is not clear to what extent this would replace the current use of commercial mortgages which also secure an interest over such assets the difc and adgm each have separate rules that should be considered separately where applicable requirements for perfecting a security interest are there specific bodies of law governing the perfection of certain types of collateral what kinds of notification or other steps must be taken to perfect a security interest against collateral execution of security interests over property in the uae is governed by the civil code federal law no 18 of 1993 commercial code the pledge law legislation passed in the individual emirates and the companies law to validly perfect a security interest over tangible movable property other than vessels vehicles and aircraft which have registered ownership the parties must conclude a pledge contract including details of the pledged asset declaration from the pledgor confirming its right to pledge the pledged asset and the nature of the secured debt and notify the holder of the pledged asset if not held by the pledgor the pledge shall be registered by filing the necessary registration form with the registrar and all persons that should be notified of the pledge registration under the provisions of the pledge law eg third party holders of the pledged asset must be notified of the pledge registration at the time of the application for such assets there is no requirement for the lender to take actual possession of the assets as was the case under the previous rules however to validly perfect a security interest over vessels vehicles aircraft and certain other assets the lender must take actual possession of the underlying assets and security interests over certain property must be registered in accordance with applicable law eg charges over vessels vehicles and aircraft in the case of a security interest over real property the lender must register the mortgage at the land department of the emirate where such property is located also a pledge over shares will only be effective once it is registered in the commercial register of the company that is maintained with the relevant economic department though the mechanism for registering such pledges has yet to be established the difc and adgm each have separate rules that should be considered separately where applicable in the difc a security interest is validly perfected if the lender has given value in respect of the collateral which the debtor must have the power to transfer the parties have entered into a security agreement or in the case of certain financial instruments the lender has control over the collateral and the lender files a financing statement unless a grace period applies or the collateral is exempt from filing eg promissory note or receivables renewing a security interest once a security interest is perfected are there renewal procedures to keep the lien valid and recorded most liens in the uae do not require registration therefore there are generally no applicable renewal procedures in fact article 1502 of the civil code provides that a security interest lapses only upon the satisfaction of the entire secured debt the assignment of the security interest the unification of title to the security interest and the property the destruction of the property or the expiry of the security interest eg as provided in the assignment upon creation of the interest furthermore pledges that are registered under the pledge law do not automatically lapse accordingly such law does not prescribe renewal procedures specifically the pledge law provides that a registered pledge may be terminated if the pledgee and pledgor or obligor as applicable agree to strike off the registration the obligor discharges the obligations that are secured by the registered pledge the registration relates to assets that cannot be pledged under the pledge law the pledgee fails to discharge its obligations following the registration of the pledge contract or a court order is issued to strike off the pledge registration on the other hand commercial mortgages are valid for five years and must be renewed before the end of such period in order to maintain priority also security interests in real property are valid upon registration with the land department of the relevant emirate but may require renewal depending on the emirate involved the difc and adgm each have separate rules that should be considered separately where applicable in the difc a duly filed financing statement is generally effective for a period of five years after the date of filing and a continuation statement may be filed within six months before the expiry of this five year period stakeholder consent for guarantees are there works council or other similar consents required to approve the provision of guarantees or security by a company no there are no works council or similar consents required to approve a guarantee or security issued by a company the company must simply issue a valid board resolution or shareholder resolution authorising the guarantee or security granting collateral through an agent can security be granted to an agent for the benefit of all lenders or must collateral be granted to lenders individually and then amendments executed upon any assignment security may be granted to an agent for the benefit of all lenders the use of security agents is common practice especially in syndicated loans creditor protection before collateral release what protection is typically afforded to creditors before collateral can be released are there ways to structure around such protection collateral can only be released with the prior written consent of the lienholder and uae law does not stipulate additional protections for creditors in respect of collateral unless the debtor is subject to bankruptcy proceedings see question 32 fraudulent transfer describe the fraudulent transfer laws in your jurisdiction article 409 of the civil code and article 206 of federal decree no 9 of 2016 bankruptcy code provide that a debtor shall be liable for fraud if he or she files for bankruptcy to deliberately cause loss to any party conceals property or fabricates false debts with the intention of causing loss to any creditor or fraudulently changes his or her place of residence also any fraudulent conveyance would be void in any insolvency proceeding see question 33 the difc and adgm each have separate rules that should be considered separately where applicable debt commitment letters and acquisition agreements types of documentation what documentation is typically used in your jurisdiction for acquisition financing are short form or long form debt commitment letters used and when is full documentation required in conventional acquisition financing the typical documentation that is used includes an offer letter facility agreement assignment agreement and promissory note short form commitment letters are used for smaller transactions whereas larger financing generally employ full documentation often along loan market association lines the documentation used in an islamic facility varies based on the structure used however many islamic financing rely on a sale and purchase agreement a form of agency agreement and a sale undertaking depending on the structure the parties may also enter into a lease agreement and promise to buy or sell level of commitment what levels of commitment are given by parties in debt commitment letters and acquisition agreements in your jurisdiction fully underwritten best efforts or other types of commitments in a conventional financing a typical offer letter represents a full commitment to fund subject to the borrower s satisfaction of the conditions and covenants contained in it if a memorandum of understanding or term sheet is agreed upon for an islamic facility the parties will utilise their best efforts to complete the transaction if such a document is not used and in the case of acquisition agreements for both types of financing the transaction documents represent a full commitment from the parties conditions precedent for funding what are the typical conditions precedent to funding contained in the commitment letter in your jurisdiction as noted in question 3 funding is typically conditioned upon the borrower providing the lender with any or all of the following issuance of personal and corporate guarantees an express subordination of debt an assignment or pledge of assets eg insurance proceeds and execution of a promissory note flex provisions are flex provisions used in commitment letters in your jurisdiction which provisions are usually subject to such flex yes flex provisions are sometimes used in the uae in particular some commitment letters permit lenders to modify the amount and tenor of a loan securities demands are securities demands a key feature in acquisition financing in your jurisdiction give details of the notable features of securities demands in your jurisdiction no securities demands are not a key feature in acquisition financing in the uae although not expressly prohibited under uae law there are a number of provisions that indicate that securities demands would not be upheld by the uae courts most notably article 733 of the uae civil code provides that it is impermissible for parties to resolve a dispute in which the settlement would include the creation of a new debt in order to annul an existing debt or to accelerate payment by substituting part of a deferred debt or reducing the amount of a guarantee on a deferred debt the difc and adgm each have separate rules that should be considered separately where applicable key terms for lenders what are the key elements in the acquisition agreement that are relevant to the lenders in your jurisdiction what liability protections are typically afforded to lenders in the acquisition agreement a lender will be interested in any provision of the acquisition agreement that affects its exposure under the loan the ability of the borrower to repay and the prospects of the underlying business in particular a lender will be concerned with provisions limiting the borrower s liability the scope of the borrower s representations any indemnities provided and performance clauses that may impact the purchase price these provisions are particularly important when the loan is intended to finance the acquisition of a business on a going concern basis most of the protections available to a lender will be secured in the relevant loan documentation and no funds will be released until all conditions are met however certain lender protections are sometimes found in the acquisition agreement and specifically some agreements will provide for information rights for the lender a requirement for direct agreements of third parties with the lender an escrow arrangement whereby any security documentation eg a title deed or share certificates will pass automatically to the lender or ongoing covenants regarding the state of the business particularly if the purchase price is subject to performance clauses public filing of commitment papers are commitment letters and acquisition agreements publicly filed in your jurisdiction at what point in the process are the commitment papers made public no commitment letters and acquisition agreements do not need to be filed in the uae and do not become public enforcement of claims and insolvency restrictions on lenders enforcement what restrictions are there on the ability of lenders to enforce against collateral prior to an insolvency proceeding a lender is generally able to enforce against collateral provided that it has validly created a security interest over such collateral and has provided the debtor with notice of the same and there are no grounds to set aside any payment of proceeds during the preference period see question 33 during and after an insolvency proceeding a lender s ability to enforce against collateral is greatly limited see questions 32 33 and 34 the difc and adgm each have separate rules that should be considered separately where applicable debtor in possession financing does your jurisdiction allow for debtor in possession dip financing the bankruptcy code contemplates two types of proceedings preventive composition and restructuring that will permit a debtor to continue managing its business and if approved obtain dip financing preventive composition affords the debtor the opportunity to reach an agreement with its creditors for the repayment of sums owed article 5 while under court protection from individual creditor claims rather than having to proceed to bankruptcy proceedings this option will be available to the debtor only if it has not been in default for more than 30 consecutive business days and is not insolvent article 6 2 and the court may grant restructuring in a bankruptcy proceeding under the following circumstances provided that the restructuring will not prejudice the creditors in which case the proceeding shall be structured as a liquidation of the debtor s assets any qualifying debtor ie a company governed by the companies law a business established in the free zones except for the difc and adgm a licensed civil company conducting professional activities a public sector company whose constitutional documents provide that it is subject to the bankruptcy code or an individual trader may request a reorganisation provided that the debtor has been in default for more than 30 business days or is insolvent the court may order a reorganisation or convert a preventive composition into a restructuring proceeding if the debtor has been in default for more than 30 business days or is insolvent or it becomes impossible to apply the preventive composition if applicable and ending such an arrangement would result in payment default for more than 30 consecutive business days or result in the debtor s insolvency the bankruptcy code does not include guidance as to what would constitute impossible creditors holding at least 100 000 uae dirhams or such lesser amount approved by the minister of finance in outstanding debt may initiate bankruptcy proceedings against a debtor provided that those creditors have adequately notified the debtor of such debt and the debtor has still failed to repay it within 30 consecutive business days of notification article 69 1 it is unclear from the regulations how the court will evaluate disputed amounts or any bankruptcy court or public prosecutor may also initiate bankruptcy proceedings article 181 of the bankruptcy code provides that the court may at the request of the debtor or the trustee in a preventive composition or restructuring permit the debtor to obtain dip with or without guarantee as follows the new financing has priority over any ordinary outstanding debt owed by the debtor on the date of initiating such proceedings a guarantee may be provided for the new financing by pledging any non pledged assets of the debtor and a guarantee may be provided for the new financing by pledging pledged assets of the debtor to the extent that such assets are appraised at a value more than the value of the debt guaranteed by the previous pledge in which case the new pledge shall rank lower than the existing pledge on the same properties unless the secured creditors for such assets agree that the new pledge ranks equally to or higher than the outstanding pledge it is unclear whether dip financing would be available in the event of a preventive composition in which such arrangement includes conditions restricting or prohibiting such financing the difc and the adgm each have separate rules that should be considered separately where applicable stays and adequate protection against creditors during an insolvency proceeding is there a general stay enforceable against creditors is there a concept of adequate protection for existing lien holders who become subject to superior claims automatic stay bankruptcy courts in the uae impose an automatic stay against creditors in accordance with the bankruptcy code a qualifying debtor or creditor a bankruptcy court or a public prosecutor may apply to have the debtor declared bankrupt as noted in question 31 the debtor must suspend payments to creditors if the court elects to initiate bankruptcy proceedings and any such payments shall be subject to unlawful preference rules see question 33 as soon as the bankruptcy judgment is issued the court with certain limited exceptions removes the power to administer and dispose of the debtor s assets from the debtor and provides it to a trustee in bankruptcy who will also manage all creditor claims however in the event of a preventive composition or restructuring the debtor must continue to perform its obligations under any contract provided that the court has not issued a stay of execution owing to the debtor s failure to perform its obligations in respect of the insolvency proceedings also the judgment identifies a group of creditors consisting of persons and entities having valid claims against the debtor existing prior to that judgment the pronouncement of the bankruptcy judgment results in the suspension of individual proceedings and actions brought against the debtor by ordinary creditors and preferred creditors including criminal proceedings for bounced cheques which may be voided if the debtor satisfies the bankruptcy judgment at that point all monetary debts owed by the debtor become payable regardless of whether such debts are unsecured or secured by a general or particular lien in accordance with the judgment which will approve a payment plan having a duration of no more than five years which may be extended in certain limited circumstances secured creditors shall be paid out of the proceeds of the sale of properties subject to their liens and in accordance with applicable priority rules there are limited circumstances under which a creditor may bring an enforcement action against the debtor after the pronouncement of the bankruptcy judgment they are as follows actions connected with assets rights and disposals that are not covered by the general prohibition preventing the debtor from administration or disposal eg assets of third parties and rights connected to the debtor s marital status actions that the law permits the debtor to bring in connection with the bankruptcy proceedings actions under criminal law and actions preparatory to a judgment to close proceedings protection of existing lienholders there is protection for existing lienholders under uae law under the bankruptcy code mortgage creditors and preferred creditors that have not been paid some or all of their debts out of the proceeds of the sale of real property have the right to share in any distribution to unsecured creditors provided that such debts have been verified by the court note that two additional factors will impact the effectiveness of this protection a lien may be set aside if it was created after the date of suspension of payments see question 33 and an additional secured creditor holding a specific charge may if approved by the court make a claim against the trustee in bankruptcy in respect of the assets over which the charge exists after the date of the bankruptcy judgment the difc and adgm each have separate rules which should be considered separately where applicable clawbacks in the course of an insolvency describe preference periods or other reasons for which a court or other authority could claw back previous payments to lenders what are the rules for such clawbacks and what period is covered payments to lenders made by the debtor within two years prior to the date of the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings can be clawed back by the bankruptcy court during this period the following payments by the debtor must be clawed back and added to the assets made available to the group of creditors established on the date of the bankruptcy judgment unless otherwise approved by the court the making of any donations with the exception of small customary gifts entering into any transaction in which the liabilities of the debtor remarkably exceed the liabilities of the counterparty the payment of any term debt by whatever means prior to the due date the payment of immediate debts other than in an agreed form and entering into any mortgage or other charge that is secured by the debtor s assets for the purpose of guaranteeing a prior debt furthermore the creditors may bring an action for restitution regarding any other payments made and the court may set aside any other disposal made by the debtor between the date of suspension of payments and date of the bankruptcy judgment ie in addition to those listed above if that disposal is harmful to the creditors and if the party to whom the disposal was made was aware that the debtor was insolvent at the time of the disposal also mortgages and liens secured on the assets of the debtor may be held unenforceable in respect of the group of creditors if they are registered after the date of suspension of payments if the court sets aside any payment the party to whom it was made must return the funds to the debtor s estate or failing that the value of the asset at the time it was received and repay any yield received from the date of receipt and any consideration for the asset s use unless such consideration is in the bankruptcy estate a third party that is compelled to return the consideration paid for an asset by the court may seek a refund of the benefit obtained from such payment from the group of creditors and may share in the debtor s estate as an unsecured creditor for any excess amount the difc and adgm each have separate rules which should be considered separately where applicable ranking of creditors and voting on reorganisation in an insolvency are creditors ranked what votes are required to approve a plan of reorganisation yes creditors are ranked in an insolvency the bankruptcy code sets out the following priority of payments in the order listed any judicial fees or charges including those of trustees and experts and any expense disbursed for the benefit of the creditors to maintain and liquidate the properties of the debtor unpaid end of service gratuity wages and salaries of the employees of the debtor other than allowances and bonuses which shall not exceed the relevant wages that are payable for a period of three months and provided that any payments made from the proceeds from the sale of assets in the debtor s possession do not exceed 30 days of the relevant wages any maintenance payments that are subject to a judgment from a competent court any amount payable to government bodies and any fees costs or expenses incurred after the date that insolvency proceedings have been initiated to procure commodities and services for the debtor or to continue the performance of any other contract required to continue the business of the debtor as noted in question 32 secured creditors are entitled to payment out of the proceeds of the sale of the underlying property subject to their liens and have the right to share in any distribution to unsecured creditors insofar as such proceeds are insufficient to satisfy their claims the court will determine the priority of remaining claims in a bankruptcy on an ad hoc basis the bankruptcy code provides that a composition or reorganisation plan must be approved by a majority of the creditors by number and by creditors holding at least two thirds of the debts that have been finally or provisionally accepted by the court the difc and adgm each have separate rules that should be considered separately where applicable intercreditor agreements on liens will courts recognise contractual agreements between creditors providing for lien subordination or otherwise addressing lien priorities yes contractual agreements regarding lien subordination are enforceable in the uae provided that such agreements do not violate uae laws regarding priority see question 34 the difc and adgm each have separate rules and independent course that should be considered separately where applicable discounted securities in insolvencies how is the claim of an original issue discount oid or discount debt instrument treated in an insolvency proceeding in your jurisdiction there is no special provision directly addressing discounted debt instruments under uae law the creditor holding such an instrument must make a claim to the trustee in bankruptcy and the court will determine the priority of such claim the difc and adgm each have separate rules that should be considered separately where applicable liability of secured creditors after enforcement discuss potential liabilities for a secured creditor that enforces against collateral see question 34 also note that articles 33 and 34 of the bankruptcy code provide that a debtor initiating a preventive composition shall not cause its debts to come due or any contract to terminate while it is unclear whether these provisions are intended to abrogate lenders rights they may have an impact on acceleration and termination clauses in loan agreements the difc and adgm each have separate rules that should be considered separately where applicable
the movement for free college has gained considerable momentum in the past year in no small part thanks to the sad state in which many college graduates currently find themselves for decades we have told young cohorts entering the labor market that if they only get the right skills they will find steady rewarding and remunerative work but we have not been able to keep that promise in large part because our understanding of the labor market s dysfunction is built on a theory of human capital that has very little to do with reality we are now living with the consequences today s students pay more for degrees in the hope of landing a job for which they are overqualified because the alternative is worse no job at all what we need is a federal policy of desegregation that ensures that access to higher education is available regardless of race or class meanwhile as tuition continues to rise accumulated student debt increasingly constitutes its own economic burden above and beyond a labor market offering stagnant wages and insufficient precarious work student debt is especially onerous for racial minorities as the current system relegates those with the least family and community resources to the worst higher education institutions exacerbating inequality couple this with continuing cuts to public higher education and as david leonhardt recently put it in the new york times it s as if our society were deliberately trying to restrict opportunities and worsen income inequality the united states has never had free high quality college education but that does not mean we can t in the past we have included world class public education in our understanding of public goods and we have successfully expanded public education on the premise that society as a whole benefits from a well educated population previous generations and social movements fought hard to create good educational institutions at public expense the current generation is discovering why that matters between 1910 and 1940 the share of eighteen year olds with a secondary education increased from 10 to over 50 percent in their book the race between education and technology 2007 economists claudia goldin and lawrence katz credit america s economic advances in the twentieth century to this uniquely american high school movement as they describe it the public high school was recreated in the early 1900s to be a quintessentially american institution open forgiving gender neutral practical but academic universal and often egalitarian it was reinvented in a manner that moved it away from its nineteenth century elitist european origins goldin and katz also emphasize that the high school movement was on the whole locally funded and directed there was no national movement toward universal secondary education or even systematic federal funding available to states to create their own programs the only impetus for the high school movement at the national level came from federal land grants to states which set up agricultural colleges for the higher education of farmers and the professional class many states guaranteed undergraduate admission to these institutions to anyone with a high school diploma which spurred many local school districts to expand their provision of public education from primary to secondary school for the most part though the high school movement happened because local school districts hundreds of thousands of them taxed themselves to build and staff free public high schools by 1960 california was attempting a similar educational revolution in the realm of higher education as the rising baby boom generation seemed poised to demand more higher education than any of its predecessors the state wanted to make high quality college more accessible the resulting master plan for higher education devised by the university of california s president clark kerr vastly expanded the university of california system and created the california state system from the state s teachers colleges it also expanded access to community colleges for remedial education and to aid the transition to traditional higher education the master plan set out to make educational advancement solely a matter of individual proficiency not family background or ability to pay the result paralleled what goldin and katz observe about the high school movement that it was open forgiving practical but academic and above all egalitarian when higher education is a prerequisite to getting a job that pays more than minimum wage we cannot stop until the sector is recast not as a way of preserving and amplifying cross generational inequality but of mitigating it but while california s model was widely lauded and enacted in other states and cities albeit with a less unified and ambitious vision the federal government chose a different route with the higher education act of 1965 a decision with reasons and repercussions that form a major part of the background for today s student debt crisis instead of funding institutions the federal government funded students why the main reason was race at the time the federal government already had its hands full enforcing the supreme court s mandate for integrated elementary and secondary education as the 1960s turned into the 1970s the political difficulties enforcing that mandate with court ordered integration plans and busing became ever more severe making racial integration seem structurally impossible for many trying to add higher education to the mix was a bridge too far moreover while one of the ultimate goals of the civil rights movement was to integrate the grand public edifices created by the progressive and new deal eras the potent backlash to that goal ended up eroding those same public goods for everyone once it became politically and rhetorically impossible to note the existence of racial exclusion in the public sphere a new ideology of economic individualism came to dominate federal and state policymaking this included geographic relocation suburbanization as a method of avoiding integrated schools and neighborhoods evading the reach of the federal judiciary and a cautious congress indeed subsidized mortgage lending in all white neighborhoods ensured that even as one political movement integrated the economy and society another resegregated it in this respect title iv of the higher education act of 1965 led the way it was individualistic from the start reflective of the human capital ideology and economic theory of the day the higher education act facilitated individual choice in selecting and gaining admission to institutions that operated within an already stratified system rather than funding institutions and telling them to provide education of a certain standard for all comers subject to entrance requirements what economists would call a pooling equilibrium it funded students who could then be sorted into a separating equilibrium effectively stratifying the sector by race and class the aforementioned theory of human capital behind these policies holds that students would choose their level of educational attainment by comparing earnings net of tuition and opportunity cost in this story the policy failure in higher education comes about if students are unable to secure financing for their education before their career starts thanks to the impossibility of collateralizing human capital and the resulting high cost of borrowing with unsecured debt therefore students cannot undertake a profitable investment in their future earnings unless their families can support them the solution to this market failure was to supply government guaranteed student loans thus ensuring access to higher education that will pay off ex post both for borrowers and for the lender the thinking at the time maintained that if students had access to loans they had access to education thus negating the need to create the grand edifices in the public sector that characterized earlier eras and led to the civil rights conflicts over universal access the quintessentially american model of education had changed from free and equal high quality public education to private or privatized institutions and student debt while government guaranteed student loans solved a narrow policy problem an incomplete capital market for financing higher education they carried the implication that there was no other problem to be solved this conception of higher education thrived for the next several decades as student populations became larger more diverse by race and gender and simultaneously more indebted however things started to go seriously wrong in the mid 2000s as state budget crises following the 2000 1 recession led to the decline of state funding for higher education and the concurrent rise of the for profit higher education sector previously serving only a few technical niches with narrow credentialing mechanisms for profit chains such as the university of phoenix found a massively expanded market by offering flexible non traditional degree options suited to older students as well as a wider variety of degree offerings for those seeking service sector employment the deregulation of accreditation standards in the mid 2000s also helped aid the boom since for profit schools were suddenly eligible for federally guaranteed student loans instead of funding institutions the federal government funded students why the main reason was race this vast expansion of the federal student loan program can be interpreted as the most ambitious federal labor market policy of the past several decades although it did not really start in terms of sheer numbers until the 2000s its roots can be found in part in economic scholarship and popular discussion of the economy from the 1990s the story told at the time was as follows sectoral transformation in the economy increased the need for workers with high human capital which corresponded with high educational attainment in the form of a college degree according to this interpretation the reason why wage inequality rose in the 1980s and 90s was that rising demand for skilled workers confronted a relative slow increase in the supply of skilled workers hence higher wages for the skilled and rising inequality overall this theory was even tweaked and extended to explain overall macroeconomic growth dynamics through the lens of aggregate human capital this human capital oriented approach to the labor market gradually morphed into a normative claim to increase wages and economic growth we should increase human capital by expanding higher education the federal student loan program in conjunction with increased enrollment became the policy mechanism for accomplishing this the normative implication was even extended to individual workers if you want higher wages increase your educational attainment and take on debt to do so the debt would pay for itself with the increased earnings available to those with more education but this theory was premised on the idea that the value of higher education credentials remains constant or increases even as more people obtain them because wages are set by worker productivity and productivity is increased by more education that assumption proved false formal and informal credentialization played a key role in driving would be workers to acquire more debt funded education at all levels for example the reforms enacted by the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of 1996 required welfare recipients to either have a job or be in re training this drove recipients to seek out certificates from overpriced predatory institutions as tressie mcmillan cottom notes in her book lower ed 2017 states also enacted laws requiring teachers to obtain master s degrees in their field of instruction and early education professionals to have bachelor s degrees both as part of the standards movement in education reform in many cases without salary increases commensurate with the debt required the rising prevalence of state level occupational licensing often meant enacting similar attainment requirements to practice as professionals in an increasing number of fields these formal examples of credentialization through overt policy do not remotely encompass its full impact which is often achieved informally when jobs are scarce employment tends to go to those with the highest educational attainment leading educational credentials to filter down to lower paying jobs the theory of human capital also provided a convenient pretext for cuts to state higher education budgets because college was seen as a good investment in future earnings state legislatures averse to tax increases saw no problem in shifting education expenditures from their budgets to individual students as demand for higher education rose and the federal government its apparatus of subsidized and guaranteed loans now fully developed was ready to pick up the slack since an expansion of human capital was thought to foster economic growth the long term aggregate gain from expanding the stock of outstanding debt and filtering it down the wage distribution to people who would previously have gotten their start in the labor market without higher education or with less of it apparently outweighed the risks student debt is especially onerous for racial minorities as the current system relegates those with the least family and community resources to the worst higher education institutions exacerbating inequality in this sense federal student debt policy looks a lot like federal home mortgage policy during the inflation of the housing bubble and as the financial crisis of 2007 8 revealed there are indeed risks associated with debt financed assets they do not continue to increase in value indefinitely ironically though the end of a dramatic expansion of secured loans in the form of home mortgages was the beginning of the heyday of unsecured loans in the form of student debt the huge increase in demand for higher education belied the widespread sense again that security in the labor market was to be found in credentials that ensured access to the jobs of the future since 2000 student debt has clearly followed cycles in the labor market there are large increases in student debt when enrollment expands during recessions and a leveling off when the economy partly recovers the problem though is that each of the last two labor market recoveries has been slow and inadequate compared to those that came before consequently once student debt has accumulated it is increasingly difficult to pay off the repayment trajectories for successive cohorts of borrowers entering repayment have worsened to the point that those who theoretically started repayment in 2013 actually have more debt now than when they started thanks to deferred interest forbearance re enrollment income based repayment and outright delinquency these problems are particularly acute for minority borrowers who are more likely to end up in for profit high tuition institutions that offer poor job prospects who face discrimination in the labor and credit markets and who have less family wealth to draw on either in financing higher education upfront or in cushioning the burden of student debt holding other demographic variables constant minority students take on more debt and use it to buy more education than their white counterparts suggesting that extra education and its accompanying debt is a prerequisite for minorities to beat the competition for scarce jobs in a discriminatory labor market free college offers a solution to this sad state of affairs so long as it was regulated in a way that ensures options for non traditional students free higher education would all but end the predatory for profit sector in addition by acting as a public option free higher education would serve as a check on the market as a whole similar to electric utilities or banking health care and now internet access public options offer a compelling vision for disciplining the market to serve rather than exploit its participants finally free higher education would also level the racial playing field mitigating the disparities that arise from inequality in parental and household wealth it may seem counterintuitive to suggest that free college would address the problem of runaway credentialization within the labor market wouldn t making higher education free also make it more abundant and hence even less valuable than it already is this interpretation however fails to understand the actual role higher education is currently playing in the labor market as a tollbooth to decent jobs that tollbooth is currently expensive and discriminatory whereas free college would be much cheaper and reduce racial inequalities in access to high quality institutions but by itself free college will not solve racial inequality in higher education the public higher education sector is already highly segregated with minority serving institutions having borne a disproportionate share of recent state austerity in too many cases flagship universities offer de facto preferential admission to white and out of state students especially after recent supreme court rulings curtailed their ability to mitigate these inequalities through explicit race based admissions policies what we need then is a brown v board of education for higher education a federal policy of desegregation that would ensure not just that some option in the public system exists regardless of race but that access to the entire system is available regardless of race and that the system as a whole is less stratified this would necessarily reduce inequality within american higher education in this era of credentialization when higher education is an absolute prerequisite to getting a job that pays better than minimum wage we cannot stop until the sector is recast not as a way of preserving and amplifying cross generational inequality but of mitigating it the heartening news is that we have done this before and the battle was won through the logic of public goods the heartening news is that we have done this before while the high school movement really was a magnificent achievement many southern states lagged behind the rest of the country in providing public secondary education because of racism the whole concept of public goods was threatening to the south a region of the country that used discrimination to uphold racial hierarchy at all levels of government and throughout its economy and yet the high school movement did eventually expand in the south most significantly due to the federally led desegregation of southern public education following brown v board of education 1954 and the long battle waged throughout the 1950s and 60s to have the decision enforced in deeply hostile territory that battle was won through the logic of public goods once that logic was abandoned for an individualistic interpretation of education those grand edifices were hollowed out as those able to secure what they wanted with private means decamped for the suburbs and for private schools and universities from this vantage point they were happy to see the old system crumble as we look back to the first half of the twentieth century to rediscover the logic of public goods it is crucial to remember two things public goods do not survive when we let the privileged opt out and if we make them racially inclusive the pressure for opt outs intensifies given these antagonistic truths we cannot pretend public options automatically sustain themselves politically success will require an unfailing commitment to universal access even to the point of prohibiting the privileged from taking their business elsewhere

and was in line with our internal targets our operating profits and ebitda margin of 13 for the quarter exceeded our expectations the improved performance is attributable to a number of factors including the continuing benefits from omnicomwide cost initiatives the impact of dispositions completed in 2018 and a small gain from a few additional dispositions completed in the first quarter of 2019 the upsides were offset in part by the negative effect of foreign exchange on our operating results phil will provide you more detail when he gets to his remarks and eps for the quarter was up 8 3 to 1 17 per share excluding the impact of a one time tax benefit from the successful resolution of foreign tax claims recorded in the first quarter of 2018 the results continue to demonstrate the consistency and diversity of omnicom s operations our ability to deliver consumer centric strategic business solutions to our clients and our best in industry creative talent combined with market leading digital data and analytical expertise in the quarter we grew organically in every geographic region of the world with the exception of latin america this growth was achieved through broad participation across all of our agencies disciplines and client sectors looking first across disciplines advertising and media was up 5 1 crm consumer experience was down less than 1 strong performance in our precision marketing group business was offset by a negative performance in our events business healthcare was up 6 8 with virtually all of our businesses in this discipline performing well pr was down 0 5 we are seeing some positive signs in certain areas of our pr operations and believe the growth strategies being implemented by our management teams will result in better performance and as expected crm execution and support was down 3 3 during the quarter we sold marketstar a provider of outsourced sales support and services based in utah marketstar is a very similar business to sellbytel which we sold in the third quarter of 2018 as i previously mentioned we also divested a few other small businesses in our portfolio during the quarter in line with our strategy of divesting non core and underperforming operations turning now to our performance by geography the us was up 2 in the quarter driven by strong performance in advertising and media healthcare and our precision marketing group offset by the decline in our events business beyond the us the north american region primarily consisting of canada was up 6 1 in the quarter the uk was up 1 3 led by advertising and media precision marketing and healthcare this performance was offset by declines in our events and crm execution businesses overall growth in the euro and non euro region was 4 in the euro markets the netherlands and spain have better than average growth and germany also performed well france was negative in the quarter primarily due to the loss of the specialty print production client in the non euro markets the czech republic and russia had very good growth asia pacific s first quarter organic growth was 2 1 as australia india and new zealand performed very well in the quarter china was negatively impacted by the delay of several projects and events it s our current expectation that these projects will go forward but later in the year latin america was down 3 as another quarter of solid operating results in mexico was offset by the continuing negative performance in brazil we expect 2019 will continue to be a difficult year in brazil our smallest region the middle east and africa grew 12 8 let me now discuss what we were seeing in the industry and how our strategies enable us to achieve consistent financial performance over the past couple of years omnicom initiated numerous changes in response to our clients needs as a result we are continuing to adjust and reorganize our businesses and management teams in order to improve the speed of decision making we are organized within our network structure into 12 practice areas the last practice area we formed the omnicom retail group was announced in march we ve expanded a number of top clients in our global client leaders group from 25 to 100 we have further consolidated our data and analytics and technology services and investments at annalect we launched omni our proprietary data and analytics platform the platform is in the process of being rolled out to our top clients we ve also expanded our investments in training and development of our people so they can use these tools we ve expanded our consulting services and capabilities and we ve consolidated our production services across all major markets and as i ll get to in a couple of minutes we continue to streamline our media offering expanding on some of these initiatives in march we announced the formation of a new center of excellence to advance our commerce capabilities omnicom retail group the new group is leveraging expertise to increase conversion and transactions for clients both online and offline it brings together five award winning agencies with exceptional creativity strategic thinking and deep client and category experience the integer group tracylocke haygarth tpn and the marketing arm these agencies together employ over 2 500 people across 19 markets omnicom s retail group agencies will continue to invest in advanced shopper knowledge and drive innovation and thought leadership in shopper and retail marketing sophie daranyi formerly the ceo of haygarth a creative agency specializing in brand shopper and retail marketing was named ceo of omnicom retail group turning now to our global client leaders group we ve expanded this group to 100 clients the responsibilities of the global client leaders include ensuring our clients are receiving the highest quality marketing and communication services from our agencies creating and managing agile client teams with best of breed talent and skills breaking down existing agency silos by organizing internal teams within and across practice area groups and offering our clients the breadth of our services as their needs change we also expanded our c suite consulting services last year we added credera and levo to our other consulting services which include batten daggerwing sparks honey tlgg and several other consulting units that have been developed organically to serve our clients needs as a result we are increasingly changing the manner in which we engage with our clients as these practices develop we expect to have more opportunities to offer our clients tip of the spear solutions that tackle business problems during the quarter we also made some important strategic changes in our media operations as you may recall about a decade ago we formed accuen for programmatic services and resolution media for search social and performance marketing at the time when these services were in their formative stages we needed dedicated units with real subject matter experts to support our media agencies today these services are no longer a specialty they are at the core of how we work with our media clients as a result we are fully integrating these capabilities involving about 600 people in the united states alone into our media agencies hearts science omd and phd with this reorganization we ve simplified our structure by expanding the capabilities of our client teams we expect these changes to increase our speed agility and the quality of service to clients to further this effort omnicom media group made several management changes to ensure that the next generation of media agency leaders have an understanding of creativity and a deep expertise in digital data and analytics scott hagedorn was named ceo of north american operations at omnicom media group following his previous positions as the ceo of hearts science and ceo of annalect he began his career as a brand planner at rapp scott will be partnered with john swift who was named coo of omnicom media group north america john has substantial operating experience having led our us media buying organization as well as developing a number of our specialty media business units with scott s move erin matts who previously served as ceo of annalect north america has been named ceo of hearts science in the us following the integration of resolution media and accuen capabilities into our media brands george manas has been named chief media officer at omd us and anthony koziarski is taking the same role at phd usa resolution media will continue as an agency focused on non network clients that seek dedicated performance only media services while we have undertaken numerous organizational changes our philosophy to support strong brands and cultures so they can be vital incubators for creativity and innovation as well as magnets for the best talent has not changed we believe our approach is a significant competitive advantage in retaining and hiring the best people and in servicing our clients our major brands have their own unique positioning and go to market strategies but a common overarching theme is our commitment to the concept of connected creativity we are using data analytics cultural insights and technology tools from our omni platform to create and deliver a powerful brand voice that connects with consumers across every touch point whether it s marketing sales service or support and through all mediums it s important to distinguish that omni serves as a platform of extremely valuable information just as important our agencies continue to significantly invest in educating and training their people and hiring new talent that can interpret and use this information this is a fundamental and constant change at our agencies and one which will allow us to remain a key partner for innovation to our clients especially as the marketplace rapidly evolves as evidence that these key themes and strategies are positively impacting our work let me just mention a few of the recent highlights of our agencies being recognized around the globe omd was named adweek s 2019 global media agency of the year in warc s best of the best rankings bbdo was ranked the number 1 network bbdo new york received number 1 agency followed by adam eve ddb omnicom won the world s most awarded holding company ketchum was named best agency of the past 20 years at the 20th annual prweek awards at the 2019 dubai lynx awards bbdo worldwide won network of the year with tbwa worldwide coming in second the media network of the year went to omd worldwide as always these awards are a true testament to the talent here at omnicom we ve always strived to be a great place for people to work which includes creating a safe and inclusive environment for all employees regarding of race religion gender or sexuality part of the commitment to attracting retaining and developing the best talent means continuing to place a strong emphasis on our diversity and inclusion efforts indeed we ve made some strides in diversity and inclusion in the first quarter for the third year in a row we received 100 on human rights campaign corporate equality index the national benchmarking tool on corporate policies and practices pertinent to lgbtq employees omnicom also received distinction of the best place to work for lgbtq equality and omnicom is an official member of the valuable 500 a global movement putting disability inclusion on the leadership agenda of businesses in summary we ve made significant strides in changing our services capability and organization we are pleased with our financial performance in the first quarter which continue to reflect the benefits of our strategies while it is early in the year we re on track for where we expect to be for the full year 2019 i will now turn the call over to phil for a closer look at the first quarter results phil philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you john and good morning as john said our results for the first quarter of 2019 were better than our expectations while organic revenue growth was within our expected range our operating profit and margins were stronger than we expected our results were driven by several items including the strong performance of our agencies the continuing impact of our cost efficiency initiatives plus some benefits from the repositioning actions we took in the third quarter of 2018 including a favorable change in business mix in the quarter from the disposition of certain non strategic under performing agencies in the second half of 2018 in addition we recorded a net gain on a few smaller dispositions in q1 which after considering the effect the negative impact fx translation had on our operating profit also had a slightly positive impact on our margins starting on slide 3 for the first quarter organic revenue growth totaled 2 5 or 91 million additionally due to the continued strengthening of the us dollar since the second half of last year changes in currency rates negatively impacted our reported revenue by 122 million or 3 4 and finally dispositions in connection with our repositioning actions primarily in our crm execution and support discipline exceeded revenue from acquisitions in the quarter as we continue to cycle through the disposals we made in the second half of 2018 the net impact from acquisitions and dispositions reduced our first quarter revenue by 130 million or about 3 6 in total our reported revenue decreased 4 4 to 3 5 billion in the quarter in a few minutes i will discuss the drivers of the changes in revenue in more detail turning to slide 1 in the income statement items below revenue our q1 ebita was 451 million up 1 million from q1 of 18 or 0 3 with the resulting ebita margin of 13 up 60 basis points our operating income or ebit for the quarter was 429 million up 1 7 when compared to the first quarter of last year while our operating margin of 12 4 represented an 80 basis point improvement over q1 of last year a few key points in regards to our margin improvement we continue to seek out opportunities to increase operational efficiencies these initiatives are primarily focused in the areas of real estate back office services procurement and it and continue to positively impact our operating performance additionally as we described last quarter we continue to see benefits from the change in business mix resulting from the disposition of several non strategic lower margin or underperforming agencies and lastly during the quarter we recorded a net gain on the disposition of a few agencies including marketstar a us based sales support business which after considering the effect of the negative impact of fx translation on our operating profit had a slightly positive impact on our margins net interest expense for the quarter was 46 million down 900 000 compared to the first quarter of 2018 and down 7 1 million versus q4 of 2018 interest expense on our debt increased 3 1 million in the first quarter of 2019 versus q1 of 18 reflecting higher rates on our fixed to floating interest rate swaps which was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on commercial paper compared to the prior year to take advantage of a unique opportunity in february 2019 we issued eur520 million of short term senior notes in a private placement to an investor outside the united states the notes are unsecured non interest bearing and mature in august 2019 as a result in the first quarter of 2019 we were able to substantially reduce our other short term borrowing needs including our commercial paper issuances the reduction in commercial paper borrowing is expected to continue through the maturity of the notes in q3 interest income increased 1 6 million versus q1 of 2018 reflecting higher cash balances available for investment and when compared to q4 of 2018 interest expense on our debt decreased 2 9 million due to the decrease in commercial paper activity as described above interest and amortization expense on our pension obligations also decreased versus last quarter and lastly we also saw an increase in our interest income versus q4 regarding income taxes our reported effective tax rate for the first quarter was 26 8 in line with our expected 2019 full year rate as a reminder last year s q1 tax rate benefited from the successful resolution of foreign tax claims which reduced last year s quarterly income tax expense by 13 3 million earnings from our affiliates was marginally negative in the first quarter of 2019 while the allocation of earnings to the minority shareholders in our less than fully owned subsidiaries decreased to 16 5 million due to our disposition activity as well as the impact of fx as a result net income for the first quarter was 263 million down slightly when compared to our reported q1 2018 net income but after excluding the 13 3 million addition to net income from the settlement of the foreign tax claims from last year 2019 s net income would have increased 4 9 now turning to slide 2 income available for common shareholders for the quarter was also 263 million and our diluted share count for the quarter decreased 3 1 versus q1 of last year to 224 2 million as a result our diluted eps for the first quarter was 1 17 which increased 0 03 or 2 6 when compared to our reported q1 eps for last year the positive impact from the settlement of the foreign tax claims increased last year s eps by 0 06 so excluding this item the increase versus last year s first quarter would have been 0 09 or 8 3 turning to components of our revenue change in the first quarter which are detailed on page 3 on a year over year basis us dollar s continued strengthening created a large headwinds in our reported revenue the impact of changes in currency rates decreased reported revenue by 3 4 or 122 million in revenue for the quarter and as has been the case for the last two quarters the strengthening was widespread on a year over year basis in the first quarter the dollar strengthened against every one of our major foreign currencies the largest fx movements in the quarter are from the euro the uk pound the australian dollar and the brazilian reis looking forward if currency stay where they currently are fx could negatively impact our revenues by approximately 2 5 during the second quarter but then moderate in the second half of the year resulting in a negative impact of approximately 25 basis points for the second half and 1 5 for the full year but obviously it s difficult to make assumptions on how foreign currency rates will move over the next few months let alone the balance of 2019 the impact of our recent acquisitions net of dispositions decreased revenue by 130 million in the quarter or 3 6 primarily driven by the sellbytel disposition and other actions we took in the second half of last year and a few dispositions we completed in the back half of the first quarter based on transactions we ve completed to date and since we will cycle through the most significant of last year s dispositions by the end of the third quarter our current expectations are that the impact of our acquisition activity net of dispositions will continue to be negative approximately 4 for the second quarter and approximately 3 for the third quarter and for the full year turning to organic growth which was up 91 million on a global basis for the quarter were 2 5 the performance of our disciplines was mixed our advertising and healthcare disciplines both had solid organic growth in the quarter crm consumer experience was marginally negative due primarily to reductions in revenue at our events businesses which offset strong performance in our precision marketing agencies in the quarter and pr was down a bit while crm execution and support continued to underperform geographically all regions were positive in the quarter except for latin america with our domestic and continental european regions having the strongest performance slide 4 shows our mix of business by discipline for the first quarter split was 55 for advertising and 45 for marketing services and as for the organic growth by discipline our advertising discipline was up 5 1 advertising s organic growth continues to be led by our media businesses notably the continued strong performance by hearts science while our global and national advertising agencies performed well with only a few exceptions crm consumer experience was down 0 6 for the quarter primarily driven by declines in our events businesses which faced a very difficult comp partly driven by last year s winter olympics in south korea results for the rest of the discipline were mostly positive driven by strong performance from our precision marketing group branding which also had growth while our shopper and sales promotion businesses were down slightly while crm execution and support continued to underperform this quarter our domestic businesses while negative versus the prior year did show improvement versus q4 pr was down 0 5 performance in this discipline was also mixed by geographic regions the uk and asia were both positive north america was marginally negative with continental europe and latin america both lagging in the quarter and healthcare was up 6 8 as has been the case over the past few quarters the growth has been well balanced with positive results across all regions on slide 5 which details the regional mix of business you can see during the quarter the split was 54 in the us 3 for the rest of north america 10 in the uk 18 for the rest of europe 11 for asia pacific 3 for latin america and the balance for the middle east and african markets as for the details of our performance by region organic revenue growth in the first quarter in the us was 2 led by our advertising and media agencies as well as our healthcare agencies with mixed performance from our crm consumer experience agencies while our crm execution and support agencies declined our uk businesses were positive again this quarter up 1 3 and led by our advertising healthcare and pr agencies however the continuing uncertainty surrounding how the british government will formalize its departure from the eu certainly clouds the outlook for the market the rest of europe was up 4 organically in the quarter in the euro markets italy the netherlands and spain continued to turn in strong performances across disciplines this quarter germany returned to positive organic growth while france lagged our organic growth in europe outside the eurozone was positive as well organic growth in the asia pacific region facing a fairly strong comp to q1 of 2018 was 2 1 with australia india japan and new zealand leading the way this quarter our greater china agencies were down organically in total for the quarter largely from the impact of non recurring project revenue from q1 18 in our events agencies in that market latin america was down 3 in the quarter with the continuing issues in the brazilian economy dragging down the region s performance overall elsewhere in the region we continue to see positive performance from our agencies in mexico in the middle east and africa which is our smallest region was up 12 8 for the quarter on slide 6 we present our revenue by industry sector in comparing the first quarter revenue for 2019 to 2018 you can see a slight shift in our mix of business an increase in the contribution from our pharma industry clients offset with the decrease in the percentage of revenue from our technology clients primarily resulting from the sellbytel disposition turning to our cash flow performance on slide 7 you can see that in the first quarter we generated 341 million of free cash flow excluding changes in working capital as for our primary uses of cash on slide 8 dividends paid to our common shareholders were 135 million down slightly versus q1 last year due to the reduction in our outstanding common shares as a result of repurchase activity over the past year the 0 05 per share increase in the quarterly dividend that we announced in february will impact our cash payments from q2 forward dividends paid to our non controlling interest shareholders totaled 17 million capital expenditures were 27 million down compared to 2018 due to less leasehold improvement activity acquisitions including earn out payments totaled 7 million reflecting a decrease in activity so far this year when compared to our q1 activity last year and stock repurchases net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans totaled 284 million reflecting an increase in the activity this year versus last year all in we outspent our free cash flow by about 130 million in the first quarter regarding our capital structure at the end of the quarter our total debt is 5 5 billion up about 600 million since this time last year and as of this past year end as we mentioned earlier in february of 2019 we issued short term senior notes of eur520 million in a private placement to an investor outside the united states the notes are unsecured non interest bearing and mature this august and therefore are classified as short term on our balance sheet our net debt position at the end of the quarter was 2 04 billion up about 800 million compared to the year end december 31 2018 balance the increase in net debt was a result of the typical uses of working capital that historically occur in our first quarter which totaled about 740 million as well as the use of cash in excess of our free cash flow of approximately 130 million these increases in net debt were partially offset by the cash we received from our disposition activity of 65 million and the effect of exchange rates on cash during q1 which increased our cash balance by about 25 million compared to march 31 2018 our net debt is down 282 million the decrease was primarily driven by the positive change in our operating capital during the past 12 months of approximately 340 million and the cash proceeds received from the sale of subsidiaries during the past year of 370 million partially offsetting these increases over the past 12 months was the overspend of our free cash flow of approximately 170 million and the negative impact of fx on our cash balances which totaled just over 200 million as for our debt ratios they remain solid our total debt to ebitda ratio was 2 3 times reflecting the issuance of the euro denominated debt this quarter while our net debt to ebitda ratio fell to 0 9 times and due to the year over year increase in our interest expense our interest coverage ratio decreased to 9 8 times but remain strong and finally on slide 10 you can see we continue to manage and build the company through a combination of well focused internal development initiatives and prudently priced acquisitions for the last 12 months our return on invested capital ratio was 25 while our return on equity was 52 6 and that concludes our prepared remarks please note that we have included a number of other supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your review but at this point we are going to ask the operator to open the call for questions thank you questions and answers operator speaker o operator thank you very much operator instructions our first question will come from alexia quadrani with jpmorgan please go ahead alexia quadrani jpmorgan analyst thank you very much just a couple of questions if i may john maybe if you can provide a bit more color on kind of what you re seeing behind the healthy underlying business especially in the us which has seen some improvement in the last couple of quarters after lagging for a couple of years you gave some broader color but i m wondering if there is anything specific that is sort of driving improvement in the us and then maybe for phil i think you highlighted a couple of divestitures that you ve downsized over the last 12 months or so which has helped improve the profitability of the business i guess i m wondering if you could tell us if that s going to help improve the profitability going forward should we see some margin benefit the next couple of quarters and maybe how much how many more of these sort of underperforming businesses do you think you still have that we could see the opportunity of further divestitures john d wren chairman and chief executive officer hello alexia in terms of the color or our performance this quarter versus prior same quarters in prior years is the marketplace is changing all the time they are changing in a number of ways the competition set is pretty much what competition set was last year at the end of last year we were able to we had a very good run in the third quarter in terms of new business and so we re seeing some of that reflected in the performance of the first quarter and you ll see it throughout the rest of the balance of this year that s probably the biggest single component the other thing as you know is organic growth for net of what you win how your clients grow or decline and what you lose and we ve been fortunate of late not to have the leaky bucket syndrome so i am pretty optimistic philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer and then just to follow up in terms of of divestitures alexia i think for future expectations for the balance of the year and the rest of the quarters i think our expectation is for the businesses to continue to perform well and i think we would expect to achieve probably 20 basis points to 30 basis points of improvement over last year the first quarter relatively speaking is traditionally small relative to the rest of our quarters so the first quarter doesn t always necessarily make a definitive trend for us but we re going to continue to focus on ebit dollars as we always do and we d expect 20 basis points to 30 basis points for the balance of the year but we re also going to continue to invest in the business and invest for growth as we always do and try to find the right balance so that we can find and fund sustainable growth in terms of future divestitures and the process we go through i think you ve seen over the last three or four years that it is a part of the process we follow i think we re through an awful lot of what we plan to do strategically but we re going to continue that process we look at it every quarter and annually every year late in the year as we look at the new year and reevaluate where the businesses still fit strategically and what might be some opportunistic things that come up which is essentially what you saw with the sellbytel disposition in the third quarter of last year and then marketstar disposition in the first quarter of this year both of those were similar businesses different geographies but they were opportunities for us to take advantage of situations where we weren t prepared to continue to invest in what was needed for the future of those businesses yet we re able to find buyers that made much more sense than us for those businesses alexia quadrani jpmorgan analyst thank you that was that s very helpful can i just ask you one quick follow up could you quantify the gain of marketstar that you captured in the quarter philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer i don t think from our perspective it s significant enough to quantify i think between marketstar as we said as far as the gain and the translation loss we had on fx those two together were essentially less than 10 basis points alexia quadrani jpmorgan analyst okay thank you very much philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer sure operator thank you our next question in queue will come from dan salmon with bmo capital markets please go ahead daniel salmon bmo capital markets analyst hi good morning everyone john maybe with your comment earlier about the competitive set not changing that much ultimately the answer to this question maybe no but nevertheless i d be just interested in your thoughts a bit more high level but when you look at some of the moves in recent weeks where non traditional competitors like accenture have been buying maybe what we viewed as a bit more traditional competitors like droga or a transaction like we saw over the weekend with publicis and epsilon if i put aside everything to talk about disciplines and capabilities and where the future of the business heads if i put that sort of aside if i put aside your normal sort of discipline on m a and valuation in the past and just sort of what deals may be available and just try to isolate the variables in your head that line up to say does m a in sort of a mid to larger scale make more sense or less sense based on what s going on around you do you sense any sort of notable change in how you might look at the landscape in that sense john d wren chairman and chief executive officer speaking purely from an omnicom point of view we can take these apart in as examples in two parts accenture buying droga which is a very good agency i already have a lot of really good agencies so that is not something that would buying another agency wouldn t be of it wouldn t be appeal to me the hiring ph which we are acquiring large and consultative type of it practices not sapiens of the world because we think those big builds of the past are of the past but like credera which we did last year and a few others we would continue to do those but i don t see them to be terribly expensive and what epsilon and i don t know what i haven t looked at epsilon in a long time but from what i ve observed of epsilon they are good company they have some good clients they don t have anything from what i can observe as unique or self proprietary in terms of what it does that it s if necessary is not replicated jonathan nelson who is head of our for all of omnicom our digital practices is sitting here with us today jonathan you want to add anything on that jonathan nelson chief executive officer omnicom digital at omnicom we ve been working on this idea of mass personalization at scale for well over a decade our investments in annalect our platform omni and the precision marketing group along with hearts science are just our latest examples of how we re focused on this as we proceed on this we are really focused on three key areas one is to keep the platforms open as i previously talked about we would rather rent and partner on data and technology rather than own that s not to say that in a few strategic instances we won t develop our own data assets we do develop our own data assets like our inventory graph but we generally believe of modular open approach is best for ourselves and our customers two we have been doing this on a global basis for over a decade our data platforms our technology platforms have been rolled out in every major region of the world as of right now and three the hardest part about this is doing integration with your traditional assets at scale anybody who does this can tell you that mass personalization at scale is extremely hard and we have been dedicated to this training thousands of our employees across all over the world in every major discipline across omnicom for the entire time that we ve been doing this so those three things open versus closed global and integration at scale are how we re approaching this problem john d wren chairman and chief executive officer so now back to john final answer to your question if i or my team felt threatened in any way we would look for the appropriate acquisitions to complete our offerings to our clients i simply don t feel that way right now operator okay thank you and our next question in queue will come from adrien de saint hilaire with bank of america please go ahead adrien de saint hilaire bank of america analyst hello good morning everyone and thanks for taking the question actually a very easy one i don t think you ve really repeated your 2019 outlook for 2 to 3 organic sales growth so could you just say whether you re still happy with this thank you very much philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer sure i don t think there s anything in our view that would change that outlook for the year at this point about 2 to 3 growth for the year adrien de saint hilaire bank of america analyst okay thank you very much indeed and also would you mind sharing how much did accuen grow year on year dollar wise q1 versus q1 philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer sure so accuen grew actually accuen grew in the us by about 2 million so it s basically flat and on a worldwide basis accuen is down 4 million which also is roughly flat going forward or overall just to comment on the programmatic business so the programmatic business certainly in our view continues to be strong but we continue to see the transition of some clients from our performance based bundled solution to the traditional agency approach and going forward as john had said earlier the programmatic offering is being integrated into our agencies and into the agency offering so we think that s the right answer for the business ultimately because it is something that is just part of what our agencies do on a day to day basis but ultimately the business is strong it continues to perform well adrien de saint hilaire bank of america analyst okay thanks very much philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer sure operator thank you our next question in queue will come from julien roch with barclays please go ahead julien roch barclays analyst yes good morning guys thank you my strategic question on m a has been asked so i will do more simple number question for phil if fx is minus 100 basis point across the board i e not a big impact from one country or another what s the rough impact on margin that s my first question the second one is for a while you ve said that you ve done the bulk of dispositions but you re looking at the portfolio on a continuing basis and you ve increased the guidance from 2 5 to 3 going forward in 2021 what s the best way of thinking about acquisition less disposition put a flat number or put like a minus one number because you ll continue to trim the portfolio and then last question is interest guidance for the full year because of the benefit of the private senior note until august thank you philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer sure so on fx i think your question is a hypothetical one if fx was down 100 basis points what would the impact on margin be i think the answer is it depends depends on where the fx positive or in this case a negative would be but i think i think it s pretty direct to say if fx is up or down 100 basis points to 200 basis points typically the impact on our margins is minimal and in this quarter the impact that negative fx had on margins the margin percentage was less than 10 basis points which sometimes when fx is up or down in the neighborhood it was this quarter we do tend to see a larger impact on our margins on the margin percentage but that didn t happen this quarter the fx decline was kind of across the board didn t have a big impact on margin percentage when you looked at the totality of omnicom as far as dispositions go we don t forecast certainly into 2020 and 2021 i think the bulk of the dispositions we ve done to date we will cycle through by the end of q3 of this year the size of the dispositions we did this quarter just they re not that large that they re going to have a significant impact on the number going forward and as far as strategically we will continue to pursue the same strategy as far as acquisitions are concerned we d rather do more than less our capital allocation strategy isn t going to change to the extent we can find accretive acquisitions that fit our strategy fit the culture and meet the needs of what we think we will work well and integrate with the business we re going to try and find more of those deals and do more of those deals we re not going to set an acquisition dollar target and then have an m a group chase deals so that we can we can meet that target but we re going to continue to pursue deals we re pursuing them today but less of the right fit we re pretty disciplined about it we re going to continue to be disciplined about it so ideally as you get out a year or two the goal would be to have certainly back in the more acquisitions mode the disposition process will continue but certainly the bulk of what we intended to do we re through the bulk of it but we re going to continue to look at opportunistic things if they come up and if they re right for the business disposition might be the right answer but the goal is to do more more acquisitions certainly on interest expense i think we don t have i don t have the number in front of me we could take that offline but we certainly expect that the reductions that we ve been able to achieve in our cp borrowings because of the opportunistic debt offering we did the private placement we did in january or in early february excuse me is going to reduce our cp borrowings we ll probably have a little bit of negative year over year increase in interest from our floating or fixed and floating swaps but we do have a debt offering coming we do have a 10 year bond offering that s coming due that we re going to replace and there should be some savings from that offering because 10 years ago the rate was certainly higher than we expect to refinance today so we can take that offline and we can give you some more detail adrien de saint hilaire bank of america analyst okay very clear as usual thank you very much philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer sure operator thank you our next question in queue will come from michael nathanson with moffettnathanson please go ahead michael nathanson moffettnathanson research analyst thanks can i just ask one on the numbers and then one if i could to jonathan so just on the numbers when i look at salary and service change i know there s a lot of moving pieces from dispositions and currency is there anyway you can give me a sense of what was where you think the organic growth is for omnicom on salary and services how we think about it for the year just try to strip away all these moving pieces john d wren chairman and chief executive officer i don t know if phil can but i know i can philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer we don t we don t really look at it that way or attempt to look at it that way unfortunately in terms of having a specific answer for your question michael nathanson moffettnathanson research analyst okay then i guess the question would be is so you guys within that number you can t take out what currency would be do you think currency is representative of the change of currencies represent the change in salary and services or is there anything unusual about maybe the weighting of salary and services by geographies philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer no i don t think there s anything unusual we actually i don t have it with me for the call but we do have a constant currency calculation that we do so we can give you a follow up on what those ratios were on a constant currency basis so that you get a sense for what those numbers are without currency we typically have that i forgot to bring it with me into the room where we re having the call michael nathanson moffettnathanson research analyst okay cool and do you guys mind if i ask jonathan a question philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer sure go right ahead michael nathanson moffettnathanson research analyst okay jonathan a question for you is last year we spent a lot of time in beginning of the year thinking about gdpr and the impact on the market and on agencies i wonder when you look back on what happened last year in gdpr what did you learn and looking forward to what could happen within the us what do you thing is likely in terms of privacy outcomes here for the us jonathan nelson chief executive officer omnicom digital well i think that there will be more regulation around privacy in the us that s nearly inevitable with the comments made by a number of people in the industry legislation is going to happen in the us at omnicom we did a deep audit of all of our assets looking at all of our different data providers and partners and came up with policies and procedures to protect ourselves and our clients and what we are trying to do is find that sort of fuzzy line of privacy and take a few steps back from it and i don t i think that policy has worked so far and it will likely work going forward michael nathanson moffettnathanson research analyst okay and meaning like you don t see any material change in how you guys running your business because of it jonathan nelson chief executive officer omnicom digital not a material change i mean when it comes down to actually on a day to day basis of course it s evolving every day but in the macro it s keep moving forward michael nathanson moffettnathanson research analyst okay thanks guys jonathan nelson chief executive officer omnicom digital sure philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer i think we have time given the markets about to open i think we have time for one more question operator operator instructions philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer great ok well if not we re right on time john d wren

thank you francisco for the introduction and thank you very much for the kind invitation to speak about the euro and its future it is an honour and a pleasure to address you and come to the london business school let me start with a disclaimer i am not going to talk to you about brexit today i understand it has been quite a drama on this side of the channel so perhaps the time we spend together will allow you some respite the truth is out there the world keeps spinning don t get me wrong this uncertainty is taking a toll on us all and we are very sad to see britain go but there are other important problems and challenges that we face and need to address i will talk a bit about those as we meet here today there is a wave of pessimism regarding the future some fear that the global economy is headed to another recession the crisis we have gone through nearly a decade ago was a once in a lifetime event it is a shame that we failed to prevent it and after that we let it go so far we saw financial bubbles grow beyond repair as regulation was weakened and supervisors failed to connect the dots many lessons were learnt but not all markets went from dormant to overzealous which made the euro debt crisis worse than it should have been many are still wary no one wants to be caught on the wrong foot you are labelled naive for pointing out that the economy moves in cycles or that there are temporary factors this last weekend i went to the imf spring meetings in washington the expectation was that the mood was going to be grim also because the imf forecasts had been gloomy ahead of the meetings many questioned yet again whether the euro would be prepared for another crisis having spent way too long dealing with the previous one my takeaway from washington is more positive the balance of risks in the global economy may be turning again the threat of a disorderly brexit has been pushed back on trade the us and china could be coming close to an agreement easing tensions china s policy driven expansion is compensating for some of the vulnerabilities of emerging market economies surely we will see a global slowdown this year and the euro area will be no exception but once again we will disappoint the scaremongers while some including in this country continue to expect the collapse of the euro every other year the single currency has made its survival from the crisis to a point of no return let me explain why and put this slowdown in perspective if the slowdown is due to a tremendous accumulation of political uncertainties not fundamentals only political resolve will fix it and in the euro area we have seen some strong political commitment it is true that the euro area s growth decelerated somewhat last year this trend is expected to continue in 2019 this should not come as a surprise the euro area growth is normalising which is inevitable after what was an exceptionally good year in 2017 when growth reached 2 4 such rates of growth could not last for long as it is well above growth potential of about 1 5 regardless of this normalisation the eurozone will grow for the fifth year in a row the longest growth streak since inception the euro area continues to create jobs 10 million new jobs since the crisis and better paid ones too as wages are now growing across the board unemployment has continued to fall for 15 consecutive quarters and it stood at 7 8 in february this year the lowest rate recorded in the euro area since october 2008 the services sector remained strong consumer confidence remains above long term average we have corrected trade and budget deficits no country posted an excessive deficit last year the euro area has a comfortable budget position to react to any economic shock this was the result of sound policies after the crisis namely a combination of fiscal consolidation and structural reforms at the same time citizens confidence in the euro which is celebrating only its 20th anniversary this year has also been constantly growing and is currently at its highest level ever 74 believe that the euro is a good thing for europe we must surely be doing something right i ve mentioned a number of external risks but there are some internal risks too 2019 will be a year of political changes in europe most key leadership positions in european institutions will change these have been good years for europe we must keep the trend this comes at a time when we see a wave of new political movements all across the western world on the fringes of the party system these have fragmented the political landscape and are shaking the political centre this is weighing heavily on economic policies and public sentiment all these risks are mainly political rather than economic or financial in a way this is a good thing addressing political risks depends directly on us in italy it is high time for budget execution and delivery in germany it is time to use the leeway to foster the recovery in particular of the manufacturing sector we still have time to bury a trade war and to give clarity to economic agents on the brexit process so we must use our time wisely the euro area has done exactly so since it faced an existential crisis a decade ago it is not time for complacency europe is sometimes hard to understand for british citizens sometimes it is also hard to understand for the rest of the europeans too we need diversity for economic systems to work properly and we have that in europe but the uk is an important part of that diversity losing it needs some preparedness are we doing our part the euro area has indeed come a long way after a rosy start but where the business cycle was rather unusual remember growth in germany was sluggish in the first seven years of this century the financial crisis found the euro area unprepared and pushed it to the brink of collapse in the end what kept us united was the same that brought us together in the first place a strong political will to find common solutions europe has always been brave to take the necessary steps towards more integration as it means peace and shared prosperity in the crisis it was no different we significantly improved economic policy coordination among the member states and extended it beyond fiscal surveillance we established the european stability mechanism our powerful common firewall we launched the banking union including a single supervisor the european central bank took bold decisions to address tail risks in parallel member states took action to reduce national imbalances we took our time but we took action the results are there to be evaluated our banking sector is now much more robust than it was on the eve of the financial crisis steps were taken to repair consolidate and recapitalise it our banks have more and better capital and higher liquidity buffers which are now under greater scrutiny from regulators the stock of non performing loans has been steadily decreasing improving prospects on profitability we realise there is still quite some work to be done to bring the euro area up to a level of integration compared to say the dollar and that is now our agenda step by step we are getting there i along with my fellow finance ministers of the euro area countries have been tasked by eu leaders with carrying out several projects related to further deepening of the economic and monetary union four months ago we have reached an agreement on how the rescue fund european stability mechanism esm can be used in a broader and more effective way this includes using the esm s firepower as a backstop for the single resolution fund which is part of the banking union and was created to prevent failing banks from being bailed out by governments this enhances the credibility of our banking resolution framework an agreement has also been reached on how to make the esm s precautionary credit lines more accessible to countries with sound fundamentals to protect them against exogenous shocks in addition we have found a way to expand the role of the esm supporting our capabilities of crisis management and prevention all this will help but arguably there are two important pieces missing in the euro one is a common european deposit insurance scheme or edis this is an essential piece of a coherent emu it will provide the system with a confidence boost preventing bank runs but this is a politically sensitive issue and that is why we need to see small steps one at a time that the discussion is now at a political level is a signal of confidence one of the most significant steps forward in recent years in my view was the decision to put in place a euro area budget to support convergence and competitiveness europe s finance ministers are currently working to define the main features of this instrument which will complement monetary policy you are probably wondering about the size of this budget it will not start as a bazooka but over time we will be able to adjust it to our needs as it proves its merits both as finance minister in portugal and as president of the eurogroup in brussels i don t like big machines we should take small steps as economists put it we should act on the margin so let s look at the most effective margin to act upon and do whatever it takes on the specific margin what matters the most is that we are adding a new instrument to the euro area s policy toolkit an instrument that is undoubtedly a credible testimony to our willingness and determination to continue strengthening the currency union and also that it will attract new members to the club in that sense it is a premium for euro area membership while we continue on the path of reform the euro is already the world s second most important currency for the sake of the stability of the international financial system this role must continue to grow the euro is used in 36 of international payments but when you look at its effective role in the international scene including its weight on international loans foreign exchange turnover or its use as a reserve currency the dollar rules and the euro punches below its weight proportion of foreign exchange trading is 44 in dollars but only 16 in euros recent developments have raised questions about the dominance of the dollar the dollar being a global currency the us has an exorbitant privilege of borrowing from foreign creditors in its own currency shielding itself from balance of payments crisis but this imposes a responsibility of stabilising the system through the provision of liquidity in particular in times of crisis washington is openly using the dollar as a tool to complement economic sanctions central bank independence is under strain europe is waking up to this reality we can only rely on ourselves not on others the best way to boost our global relevance is to do exactly what we are doing deepening both the banking and the capital markets unions and building an euro area budget these will reassure investors and other agents in financial markets that is why i am so optimistic there are so still many potential economic gains from a fully functioning emu and benefits to reap and still the euro thrives we are clearly working within our production possibilities frontier that is why i remain optimistic about the future the difference between the eu and each member state taken individually is that together we can make a difference in the world today we have the choice to make that difference to follow this example the portuguese escudo or the british pound for that matter cannot aspire to dominate or even dispute the dominance of the international financial system as they could centuries ago individually we are small although some still think they are big in the future the world is not going to become less interconnected less digitalised or even less globalised despite the latest populist and protectionist tendencies amidst what looks like increasing global political turbulence we in the euro area will continue to keep a cool head and choose the path of solidarity and multilateralism to address current and future challenges if we want to continue to have a say shaping the world financial order with our values and with a rules based system the euro is our best and only shot thank you again for having me looking forward to our debate on european issues and that includes brexit

gold market key message from imf the spring meeting of the world bank and the imf during which the latter organization released its fresh world economic outlook has just ended what are the takeaways for the gold market stagnation or acceleration after the slowdown in thursday s gold news monitor we pointed out that the imf significantly cut outlook for the eurozone s economic growth this year from 1 6 to 1 3 percent but what about other economies the imf forecasts now 2 3 percent rise in the american gdp 0 2 percentage point slower than it was projected in january global growth is now projected to be 3 3 percent a downward revision from the 3 5 percent forecasted three months earlier after such cuts in world economic outlook gold should shine shouldn t it well not necessarily you see investors have already acknowledged the current economic slowdown the key question for the markets is whether global growth will accelerate or stagnate from this point onward as we wrote in the latest edition of the market overview we believe that the slowdown will prove short lived and this is exactly what is forecasted also by the imf with improvements expected in the second half of 2019 global economic growth in 2020 is projected to return to 3 6 percent the reason behind our view is the recent stimulus in china the monetary and fiscal stimuli started in december and we see the effects now credit growth exceeded all estimates in march and the manufacturing sector unexpectedly return to growth while service sector activity accelerated importantly last month beijing announced billions of dollars in additional tax cuts and infrastructure spending on top of measures last year so even if we do not see a return of a boom the current global slowdown is not likely to morph into a recession whether gold bulls like it or not another important factor here is the shift away from tighter monetary policy by central banks in particular the fed has changed its view that low unemployment rate will have to spur inflation rather due to global competition and technological progress low inflation rate may stay with us for longer so there is no need for aggressive tightening a more dovish fed and the resulting downward pressure on the real interest rates and the us dollar should support the gold prices moreover trade tensions has somewhat eased at the spring meeting of world bank and the imf u s treasury secretary steven mnuchin said that he was hopeful the u s and china are close to the final round of trade talks last but not least the eu has postponed the deadline for brexit until the end of october raising the odds of orderly divorce and the british politicians seem to be approaching the customs union compromise which would not be as harmful as the hard brexit if these two big risks i e full blown trade war and chaotic exit of the uk without a deal don t materialize the risk appetite among investors may increase which could hit the safe havens such as gold implications for gold the key message from the imf s spring meeting and its recent world economic outlook is that there will be a significant growth slowdown this year however some of the idiosyncratic factors and uncertainties weighing on growth are waning while central banks and government are adopting more accommodative policies here we expect the current slowdown to be temporary and followed by a rebound in the second half of the year what does it imply for gold well the slowdown combined with a more dovish fed are key factors which could make 2019 a better year for gold than 2018 the rebound in growth could be conversely negative for the gold prices however although the us gdp might accelerate later this year the pace of economic expansion is projected to be slower than last year when fiscal stimulus spurred growth and the imf forecasts it to decline further in 2020 as the chart below shows the convergence between the us and europe s economies should ease the upward pressure on greenback and support gold chart 1 half yearly growth forecasts annualized semiannual change for the us green line eurozone red line and japan blue line from h1 2015 to h2 2020 indeed if we see a revival in the eurozone the euro may strengthen against the greenback which would also be supportive for the gold prices after all the current slowdown did not make the yellow metal to rally

by andrew moran imagine a world where americans canadians britons japanese and chinese purchase goods and services with the same currency the planet has a single central bank that runs the printing presses establishes interest rates and maintains controls on trade and capital flows the idea of a national monetary policy would go extinct substituted for the worldwide zone which would severely restrict or abolish economic sovereignty does this sound a far fetched tale in a dystopian novel in september 1988 the economist published an article titled one world one currency the magazine s cover page featured the proposed phoenix currency graced with the year 2018 on the coin it believed that a global currency would be instituted by 2018 spurring economic prosperity without risk disorganization or volatility countries would either agree or get left behind the magazine wrote as the next century approaches the natural forces that are pushing the world towards economic integration will offer governments a broad choice they can go with the flow or they can build barricades it is a growth crippling prospect pencil in the phoenix for around 2018 and welcome it when it comes well mmxviii has come and gone without the arrival of the one size fits all economy but that doesn t mean there aren t any renewed pushes for a one world fiat hegemony system international monetary system seventy five years ago the international monetary fund imf was established at the historic bretton woods conference in 1969 the special drawing rights sdr was created but just what exactly are these two financial elements the imf is a body that ostensibly fosters international monetary cooperation the sdr is the imf s global reserve asset that acts as an artificial money instrument and is construed from a basket of important national reserve currencies of member countries the u s dollar euro chinese yuan japanese yen and pound sterling josé antonio ocampo former united nations under secretary general for economic and social affairs believes the imf and sdr could be utilized to form a one world monetary system he outlined this proposal in a project syndicate piece titled time for a true global currency it essentially echoes the same sentiment behind the 31 year old economist article the world needs an international monetary system and one world notes in a global economy moving forward says ocampo the imf could be turned into a fully financed institution that runs its own paper money scheme this could be achieved by considering the undeposited sdrs that countries hold either during bullish times or throughout an economic collapse the imf could proceed to issue sdrs to the tune of 300 billion annually central banks would then exchange their reserves for sdrs eventually market sdrs would become ubiquitous in private transactions and investment vehicles he conceded that this an unnecessary aspect of his proposed reforms the anniversaries of the imf and the sdr in 2019 are causes for celebration but they also represent an ideal opportunity to transform the sdr into a true global currency that would strengthen the international monetary system policymakers should seize it a currency crisis are we in the beginning stages of a currency crisis there is little argument that the u s dollar is one of the strongest currencies in the world right now despite the federal reserve debasing the greenback since its inception the buck has done remarkably well in recent years but compared to what the canadian dollar is falling on hard times the euro has no clue what it is doing the pound sterling is constantly undermined by those who think brexit will end civilization and asian currencies are devaluing to gain market share in the export business the few currencies that are strengthening do not have as much influence on the world stage as their major rivals such as the singapore dollar the swiss franc and caymanian dollar the globalists want to take advantage of the failed monetary experiment otherwise known as the bretton woods system as expected they are not proposing a return to sound money or considering instituting free market solutions it is all about the growth of the leviathan instead they are using the advice of mayor rahm emanuel you never want a serious crisis to go to waste and what i mean by that is an opportunity to do things that you think you could not do before if you think the globalists ran wild during the great recession then imagine how they will behave during the next financial calamity they fired all their bullets conventional and unconventional to survive the previous crash what will they do the next time the global economic system implodes every century has a new currency king from the portuguese real of the 15th century to the french franc of the 18th century will the sdr become the crown prince of the 21st century anytime this discussion pops up the sage and influential words of legendary economist friedrich hayek become immediately relevant the curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design statists are constantly introducing new concepts modern monetary theory single legal tender and e u armies aimed at flattering their statist brethren expanding the size and scope of government and controlling the people the vision of the anointed is never freedom and the free flow of commerce only a boot stamping on a human face forever the real threat to our liberty is not a backward terrorist cell in the middle east but rather educated and revered suits in the swamp this was originally posted on liberty nation like this article get ecn delivered to your inbox daily subscribe here
question mr armstrong i believe you said at the wec in 2017 that central banks will diversify and increase their gold reserves going into the currency crisis coming in 2021 china has continued to increase its gold reserves you would please update on that development thank you pk answer central banks are in a very difficult position the ecb has really put the entire world at risk draghi is now realizing that negative interest rates have seriously harmed the european economy and led to a major growing liquidity crisis in european banking the euro is regarded as a time bomb for it is neither a national currency nor a stable unit of account the failure to have consolidated the debts from the outset has simply left the euro vulnerable to separatist movements and sheer chaos this is what has been behind the strength in the dollar central banks outside europe have been caught in this dollar vortex they have been selling dollars and buying gold in an effort to stem the advance of the dollar china also has a debt problem with many provinces and companies who borrowed in dollars here in 2019 there is 1 2 trillion in chinese dollar borrowings that must be rolled over there is a rising concern that this year there could be a major threat of a dollar funding crunch the total debt issued in us dollars outside the usa approached 12 trillion at the end of 2018 that is about 50 of the us national debt the forex risk is huge no less the interest rate risk on top of that the more crises we see in europe the greater the pressure on the dollar to rise regardless of the fed trying to stop capital inflows by delaying raising rates china has added to its gold reserves in a desperate attempt to try to keep the dollar down which also has an inverse trade problem as the yuan declines at the end of january china s gold holdings stood at 59 94m ounces which was up from 59 56m a month earlier according to figures released by the people s bank of china of course the gold bugs think this is because china hates the dollar and sees the world returning to a gold standard in reality none of that is true china is smart enough that they are trying to keep the yuan from crashing against the dollar but by selling the dollar they also do not want to buy euros or japanese yen with the chaos of brexit the neutral political place is gold over the past year central banks emerged as big buyers of gold with purchases up almost 75 as the private institutional market ignores gold and retail trade has shrunk the main buyers have been russia turkey and kazakhstan who all shifted their reserves away from the us dollar for political reasons in 2018 amounting to 27bn worth of bullion i used to help the arabs buy gold and lease it out to circumvent their religious laws against earning interest leasing gold was effectively the interest rate but it was trading commodities and thus did not violate their religion with the japanese to reduce the trade crisis i instructed them to buy gold in new york and export it to london to be resold it did not matter what they bought in the usa as long as it was exported it reduced the trade surplus the same tactic is in play here with china but they have been accumulating gold to reduce the trade surplus it is a neutral trade within their reserves that avoids problem currencies china is now the world s biggest consumer and producer of gold china only begun to buy gold again which is also supporting its mining industry as the us did during the 19th century with silver prior to december 2018 the last time china bought gold was back in 2016 nevertheless as geopolitical tensions rise pointing toward world war we should expect the former soviet union region to continue accumulating gold and avoiding the dollar the democrats seem to be increasing the tensions all to remove trump from office tensions between the us and china are nowhere near as bad as they are with russia china is strategically moving to develop their own consumer economy they realize that what made the us dollar the reserve currency was not a force of arms but the domestic consumer market japan and germany rose from the ashes after world war ii using the mercantilist model designed to build things to sell to americans china realized that is a dead end and they have turned inward to develop their own consumer market to replace the united states in italy deputy prime minister matteo salvini has raised the possibility of taking control of italy s sizeable gold reserves away from the country s central bank the bank of italy has the third largest central bank holding of gold reserves in the world after the us and germany owning 2 452 tonnes at the end of 2018 this is also reflective of the tensions with the entire dictatorial approach of brussels brussels tried to create a central government but one that refuses to accept responsibility for member state s debts that conflict is why the euro will never be ready to compete on the world stage of currencies in a serious manner

private equity funds formed in your jurisdiction does such a vehicle have a separate legal personality or existence under the law of your jurisdiction in either case what are the legal consequences for investors and the manager in the united states private equity funds are typically formed as limited partnerships in the state of delaware pursuant to the delaware revised uniform limited partnership act drulpa a limited partnership formed under the drulpa will have a separate legal personality the existence of which will continue until cancellation of the limited partnership s certificate of limited partnership a delaware limited partnership offers investors the benefits of limited liability as well as flow through tax treatment in the us the personal liability of a limited partner is generally limited to the amount of the capital contributed or that has been agreed to be contributed or returned by such investor the manager is the general partner of the fund with control over and subject to certain limitations general liability for the obligations of the partnership forming a private equity fund vehicle what is the process for forming a private equity fund vehicle in your jurisdiction a limited partnership requires at least one general partner and one limited partner neither of which needs to be a delaware entity to form a limited partnership the general partner must execute and file a brief certificate of limited partnership setting forth certain basic information about the partnership in delaware this filing is made with the secretary of state s office each delaware limited partnership must have and maintain and identify in its certificate of limited partnership a registered office and a registered agent for service of process on the limited partnership in delaware the certificate of limited partnership must also identify the name of the partnership and the name and address of the general partners although the names of the limited partners need not be disclosed in addition depending on the us jurisdictions in which the private equity fund conducts its business it may be required to obtain qualifications or authorisations as well as comply with certain publication requirements to do business in such jurisdictions there is generally no time delay associated with filing the certificate of limited partnership it can normally be prepared and filed on a same day basis the initial written limited partnership agreement to be entered into in connection with the formation of a limited partnership can be a simple form agreement which can be amended and restated with more detailed terms at a later date for a limited partnership formed in delaware the partnership agreement need not be and generally is not publicly filed the fee for filing a certificate of limited partnership in delaware is us 200 although an additional nominal fee may be charged for certified copies of the filing or for expedited processing there is an annual franchise tax of us 300 the fees for obtaining authorisation to do business in a particular jurisdiction are usually nominal but may be more costly in certain states there are no minimum capital requirements for a delaware limited partnership a private equity fund will typically engage counsel to draft the certificate of limited partnership and the related partnership agreement filings in delaware as well as in other jurisdictions where an authorisation to do business is required are typically handled by a professional service provider for a nominal fee which also provides the registered agent and registered office services referred to above requirements is a private equity fund vehicle formed in your jurisdiction required to maintain locally a custodian or administrator a registered office books and records or a corporate secretary and how is that requirement typically satisfied a delaware limited partnership must have and maintain a registered office and a registered agent for service of process in the state of delaware this requirement is typically satisfied by the limited partnership engaging for a nominal fee a professional service provider to act in these capacities see question 2 although under the drulpa a limited partnership must maintain certain basic information and records concerning its business and its partners and in certain circumstances provide access thereto to its partners there is no requirement that such documents be kept within the state of delaware there is no requirement under delaware law to maintain a custodian or administrator although registered investment advisers under the us investment advisers act of 1940 as amended the advisers act must maintain an independent custodian of client assets access to information what access to information about a private equity fund formed in your jurisdiction is the public granted by law how is it accessed if applicable what are the consequences of failing to make such information available although the drulpa provides that limited partners are entitled if they have a proper purpose and subject to such reasonable standards as may be set forth in the partnership agreement or otherwise established by the general partner to receive a list of the names addresses and capital commitments of the other partners a copy of the partnership agreement and any amendments thereto and certain other information the limited partnership s partnership agreement may limit or expand this further the partnership agreement may and typically does provide that any such information provided to limited partners is confidential and is not to be disclosed by a limited partner to third parties therefore the public is not generally entitled to information other than the identity of general partners which is set forth in the certificate of limited partnership about delaware limited partnerships nevertheless as a result of the us freedom of information act foia certain similar state public records access laws and other similar laws certain limited partners who are subject to such laws may be required to disclose certain information in their possession relating to the partnership generally the information that has been released to date pursuant to foia and similar laws has typically been fund level information eg overall internal rates of return other aggregate performance information amounts of contributions and distributions etc but not portfolio company level information eg information relating to individual investments by the fund also limited partnership agreements and the list of limited partners have generally been protected from disclosure to the public a general partner s failure to comply with the reporting requirements of applicable law or the partnership agreement or both could result in a limited partner seeking injunctive or other equitable relief monetary damages or both limited liability for third party investors in what circumstances would the limited liability of third party investors in a private equity fund formed in your jurisdiction not be respected as a matter of local law under delaware partnership law a limited partner is not liable for the obligations of a limited partnership unless such limited partner is also a general partner or in addition to the exercise of the rights and powers of a limited partner such limited partner participates in the control of the business of the partnership within the meaning of the drulpa it is generally possible to permit limited partners to participate in all aspects of the internal governance and decision making of the partnership without jeopardising the limited liability status of a limited partner as long as it is done in a prescribed manner even if the limited partner does participate in the control of the business within the meaning of the drulpa such limited partner is liable only to persons who transact business with the limited partnership reasonably believing based upon the limited partner s conduct that the limited partner is a general partner in addition under the drulpa a limited partner who receives a distribution made by a partnership and who knew at the time of such distribution that the liabilities of the partnership exceeded the fair value of the partnership s assets is liable to the partnership for the amount of such distribution for a period of three years from the date of such distribution and partnership agreements of private equity funds commonly impose additional obligations to return distributions there may be additional potential liabilities pursuant to applicable fraudulent conveyance laws in any case limited partners are liable for their capital contributions and any other payment obligations set forth in the limited partnership agreement or related agreement such as a subscription agreement to which they are a party fund manager s fiduciary duties what are the fiduciary duties owed to a private equity fund formed in your jurisdiction and its third party investors by that fund s manager or other similar control party or fiduciary under the laws of your jurisdiction and to what extent can those fiduciary duties be modified by agreement of the parties a general partner of a limited partnership generally will owe fiduciary duties to the partnership and its partners under delaware law which include the duties of candour care and loyalty however under delaware law to the extent that at law or equity a partner or other person has duties including fiduciary duties to a limited partnership or to another partner or to another person that is a party to or is otherwise bound by a partnership agreement the partner s or other person s duties may be expanded or restricted or eliminated by the provisions in the partnership agreement provided that the partnership agreement may not eliminate the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing under delaware law a partnership agreement may provide for the limitation or elimination of any and all liabilities for breach of contract and breach of duties including fiduciary duties of a partner or other person to a limited partnership or to another partner or to another person that is a party to or is otherwise bound by a partnership agreement provided that a partnership agreement may not limit or eliminate liability for any act or omission that constitutes a bad faith violation of the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing in addition practitioners should note that contractual standards of duty or conduct set forth in the partnership agreement will replace common law fiduciary duties with respect to delaware limited partnerships whether such standards are higher or lower therefore precise crafting of the language in a partnership agreement with respect to fiduciary duties relating to a delaware limited partnership is important in addition investment advisers whether or not registered owe fiduciary duties to their clients such fiduciary duties are not specifically set forth in the advisers act or established by rules promulgated by the sec but are imposed on investment advisers by operation of law because of the nature of the relationship between the investment advisers and their clients such fiduciary duties are enforceable against investment advisers by means of the anti fraud provisions of section 206 of the advisers act gross negligence does your jurisdiction recognise a gross negligence as opposed to ordinary negligence standard of liability applicable to the management of a private equity fund delaware does recognise a gross negligence standard of liability to the extent such standard is provided for in the applicable partnership agreement as a matter of market practice the exculpation and indemnification provisions in a private equity fund s limited partnership agreement typically carve out acts or omissions that constitute gross negligence but under delaware law a partnership agreement could expressly exculpate or indemnify for such acts or omissions other special issues or requirements are there any other special issues or requirements particular to private equity fund vehicles formed in your jurisdiction is conversion or redomiciling to vehicles in your jurisdiction permitted if so in converting or redomiciling limited partnerships formed in other jurisdictions into limited partnerships in your jurisdiction what are the most material terms that typically must be modified restrictions on transfers and withdrawals restrictions on operations generally provisions regarding fiscal transparency and special investor governance rights on matters such as removal of the general partner or early dissolution of the private equity fund are all matters typically addressed in the provisions of the partnership agreement and will vary from fund to fund typically the partnership agreement will require the consent of the general partner to effect a transfer of a partnership interest in a limited partnership this requirement enables the general partner to maintain the fund s compliance with applicable legal tax and regulatory requirements and exemptions as well as evaluate the appropriateness as a commercial matter of the proposed transferee although there is generally no right for a limited partner to withdraw from a delaware limited partnership under the drulpa the limited partnership agreement for a private equity fund may provide for certain withdrawal rights for limited partners typically only in limited circumstances for legal and regulatory reasons limited partners have the right to petition the delaware court of chancery for withdrawal or similar equitable relief in egregious circumstances eg fraud however obtaining such relief can be difficult in converting or redomiciling a limited partnership formed in a non us jurisdiction into a limited partnership in a us jurisdiction eg delaware particular attention should be given to requirements of the certificate of limited partnership domestication and certificate of limited partnership that may be required to be filed as well as any other requirements of the applicable state s laws relating to maintaining a limited partnership in such jurisdiction see question 2 in addition depending on where the redomiciled fund conducts its business it may be required to obtain qualifications or authorisations to do business in certain jurisdictions any provisions of the partnership law of the state into which such domestication is effected that are otherwise inconsistent with the pre existing governing agreement of such partnership should be reviewed and modified as necessary to ensure conformity with the applicable law consideration should also be given to the tax consequences of converting or redomiciling a limited partnership certain aspects of us securities laws apply differently with respect to us and non us private equity funds for example in determining whether a private equity fund formed in the us will qualify for exemption from registration under the investment company act of 1940 as amended the investment company act all investors both us and non us are analysed for determining the fund s compliance with the criteria for exemption by contrast in the case of a private equity fund formed in a jurisdiction outside the us only us investors are analysed for the purposes of making that same determination assuming certain other requirements are met the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the exchange act and the regulations promulgated thereunder generally require that any issuer having 2 000 or more holders of record or 500 or more holders who are not accredited investors as defined by the sec of any class of equity security and assets in excess of us 10 million register the security under the exchange act and comply with the periodic reporting and other requirements of the exchange act these rules have the practical effect of imposing a limit of 1 999 investors in any single us domiciled private equity fund in addition the exchange act and the regulations promulgated thereunder provide an exemption from the registration requirement described above for a non us domiciled private equity fund that qualifies as a foreign private issuer and has fewer than 300 holders of equity securities resident in the us a private equity fund that is organised outside of the us generally qualifies as a foreign private issuer unless more than 50 per cent of its outstanding voting securities are held by us residents or any of the following is true a majority of its executive officers and directors are us citizens or residents more than 50 per cent of its assets are located in the us or its business is administered principally in the us for purposes of generally accepted us accounting principles to avoid consolidation of the financial statements of a private equity fund with its general partner which is an issue of particular concern for some publicly listed private equity fund sponsors the fund must provide its unaffiliated limited partners with the substantive ability to dissolve liquidate the fund and appoint a third party as liquidator or otherwise remove the general partner without cause on a simple majority basis often referred to as kick out rights fund sponsor bankruptcy or change of control with respect to institutional sponsors of private equity funds organised in your jurisdiction what are some of the primary legal and regulatory consequences and other key issues for the private equity fund and its general partner and investment adviser arising out of a bankruptcy insolvency change of control restructuring or similar transaction of the private equity fund s sponsor depending on the structure of a private equity fund and its general partner and the specific provisions of their operating agreements the bankruptcy or insolvency of the ultimate sponsor of a private equity fund could result in the bankruptcy or dissolution of the private equity fund s general partner or investment adviser or of the fund itself moreover such a bankruptcy or insolvency event could result in the inability of the sponsor to meet its funding obligations with respect to its capital commitment to the private equity fund depending on the terms of the private equity fund s partnership agreement such a default could constitute a cause event and thereby trigger rights of the limited partners to remove the private equity fund s general partner dissolve the private equity fund itself or cause the forfeiture of all or a portion of the general partner s unrealised carried interest or all of these in addition to such cause protections a sponsor bankruptcy may result in a private equity fund s limited partners seeking to exercise the no fault remedies included in many partnership agreements which often permit termination of the investment period removal of the private equity fund s general partner or dissolution of the private equity fund with respect to us bankruptcy law a sponsor that has filed for reorganisation under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code should still be permitted to operate non bankrupt subsidiaries including for example related private equity funds and their general partners as ongoing businesses although this raises a variety of operational issues including for example whether ordinary course investment and private equity fund management decisions must be approved by the bankruptcy court a change of control or similar transaction with respect to an institutional sponsor may also give rise to statutory and contractual rights and obligations including one or both of the following a requirement under the advisers act for registered investment advisers to obtain effective client consent namely consent of the private equity fund s limited partners or a committee thereof to transactions involving an assignment of the sponsor s investment advisory contract which a change of control generally triggers and the ability of the private equity fund s limited partners to cancel the commitment period dissolve the fund remove the general partner or sue the general partner for a breach of a negative covenant against transfers of interests in the general partner under the terms of the private equity fund s partnership agreement regulation licensing and registration principal regulatory bodies what are the principal regulatory bodies that would have authority over a private equity fund and its manager in your jurisdiction and what are the regulators audit and inspection rights and managers regulatory reporting requirements to investors or regulators advisers act registration requirements and exemptions the sec has the authority to regulate investment advisers pursuant to the advisers act investment advisers may also be subject to regulatory requirements at the state level under the advisers act all investment advisers to private equity funds are generally required to be registered with the sec under the advisers act unless they meet one of the following limited exemptions from such registration the venture capital fund adviser exemption investment advisers solely to venture capital funds private funds that represent themselves to their investors and prospective investors as pursuing a venture capital strategy and comply with other significant requirements including limitations of the amount of leverage they may incur and type of assets in which they may invest the foreign private adviser exemption investment advisers who are not holding themselves out to the public in the us as an investment adviser or advising registered funds have no us place of business and have fewer than 15 us clients and investors in total in private funds with assets under management aum from such clients and us investors of less than us 25 million and the private fund adviser exemption investment advisers solely to private funds with aum of less than us 150 million discussed further below however for non us investment advisers the private fund adviser exemption provides that a non us investment adviser would not be required to register as long as the following is true it has no client that is a us person except for qualifying private funds and any assets managed by such adviser at a place of business in the us are solely attributable to private fund assets the total value of which is less than us 150 million a private fund adviser with its principal office and place of business outside of the us that cannot meet the foreign private exemption can often rely on the private fund adviser exemption note that under the private fund adviser exemption the type or number of non us clients or the amount of assets managed outside of the us are not taken into account in determining whether an investment adviser can rely on these exemptions the sec considers an investment adviser s principal office and place of business as the location where the investment adviser controls the management of private fund assets although day to day management of certain assets may take place at another location an investment adviser with its principal office and place of business in the us must count all private fund assets including those from non us clients toward the us 150 million in calculating aum an investment adviser with its principal office and place of business outside of the us need only count private fund assets it manages at a place of business in the us toward the us 150 million limit aum are the securities portfolios for which an investment adviser provides continuous and regular supervisory or management services an investment adviser provides continuous and regular supervisory or management services with respect to a private equity fund from a place of business in the us if its us place of business has ongoing responsibility to select or make recommendations as to specific securities or other investments the fund may purchase or sell and if such recommendations are accepted by the fund the investment adviser s us place of business is responsible for arranging or effecting the purchase or sale however the sec does not view merely providing research or conducting due diligence to be continuous and regular supervisory or management services at a us place of business if a person outside of the us makes independent investment decisions and implements those decisions investment advisers relying on the venture capital fund exemption or the private fund adviser exemption are considered to be exempt reporting advisers eras and are required to report with the sec by filing certain portions of form adv part 1 within 60 days of relying on the exemption these portions require disclosure of certain basic information with respect to the investment adviser its activities and the private funds that it advises an adviser s form adv filing must be amended at least annually within 90 days of the end of the investment adviser s fiscal year and more frequently for certain specific changes the sec is authorised to require an era to maintain records and provide reports and to examine such era s records which means an era s books and records are subject to sec inspection the sec has in the past indicated that it intends to examine eras as a part of the sec s routine examination programme eras are not required to file form pf described below in addition to the exemptions described above certain investment advisers are excluded from the definition of investment adviser and thus are not required to register under the advisers act for example a family office which is generally a company owned and controlled by family members that provides investment advice only to family clients and does not hold itself out to the public as an investment adviser is so excluded from the definition on the other hand subject to certain exceptions investment advisers with less than us 100 million in aum are generally prohibited from registering with the sec under the advisers act and must instead register as an investment adviser of the state in which they maintain a principal office and place of business and be subject to examination as an investment adviser by the applicable securities commissioner agency or office form pf a registered investment adviser with more than us 150 million of private fund aum is required to file form pf with the sec which requires disclosure of certain basic identifying information regarding each private fund an investment adviser advises including gross and net asset value gross and net performance use of leverage aggregate value of derivatives a breakdown of the fund s investors by category eg individuals pension funds governmental entities sovereign wealth funds a breakdown of the fund s equity held by the five largest investors and a summary of fund assets and liabilities hedge fund advisers are also required to report information about fund strategy counterparty credit risk and use of trading and clearing mechanisms quarterly large private fund advisers are required to report more extensive information with the nature of the information dependent upon their strategy additional disclosure requirements for registered investment advisers to private equity funds with more than us 2 billion aum focus on fund guarantees of controlled portfolio company obligations leverage of controlled portfolio companies and use of bridge financing for controlled portfolio companies additional disclosure requirements for registered investment advisers to hedge funds with more than us 1 5 billion aum large hedge fund advisers must report on an aggregated basis information regarding exposures by asset class geographical concentration and turnover and for hedge funds with a net asset value of at least us 500 million they must also report certain information relating to such fund s investments leverage risk profile and liquidity for registered investment advisers that manage only private equity funds as well as smaller hedge fund advisers the form has to be filed annually within 120 days of the fiscal year end large hedge fund advisers must file form pf on a quarterly basis within 60 days of the end of each fiscal quarter unlike form adv filings which are available on the sec s website form pf filings are confidential and such information is exempt from requests for information under foia however the sec is required to share information included in form pf filings with the financial stability oversight council and in certain circumstances us congress and other federal departments agencies and self regulatory organisations in each case subject to confidentiality restrictions we note that for purposes of form pf a fund that is required to pay a performance fee based on unrealised gains to its investment adviser or has the ability to borrow in excess of a certain amount or sell assets short is deemed to be a per se hedge fund regulation applicable to unregistered advisers even unregistered investment advisers whether eras or not are subject to the general anti fraud provisions of the exchange act the advisers act see question 6 state laws and if required to register as a broker dealer with the financial industry regulatory authority finra see question 11 similar rules promulgated by finra and the sec and many of the analogous state regulatory agencies retain statutory power to bring actions against a private equity fund sponsor under these provisions us commodity futures trading commission cftc regulation the cftc has the authority to regulate commodity pool operators cpos and commodity trading advisers ctas under the us commodity exchange act cftc regulations broadly include most derivatives as commodity interests that cause a private equity fund holding such instruments to be deemed a commodity pool and its operator typically the general partner in the case of a limited partnership to be subject to cftc jurisdiction as a cpo and or its adviser typically the investment adviser to be subject to cftc jurisdiction as a cta and in certain cases to become a member of the national futures association nfa the self regulatory organisation for the commodities and derivatives market the cftc regulations will generally apply on the basis of holding any commodity interest directly or indirectly and as such cpo and cta status should be considered with respect to all investment activities and products including for example private funds real estate investment trusts separate managed account arrangements and any subsidiary entities alternative investment vehicles and other related entities and accounts cpos managing private equity funds may claim certain exemptions from registration with the cftc which may include no action relief including for cpos of funds of funds the de minimis exemption under cftc rule 4 13 a 3 providing relief for cpos that engage in limited trading of commodity interests on behalf of a commodity pool and registration lite under cftc rule 4 7 providing relief from certain reporting and record keeping requirements otherwise applicable to a registered cpo if the interests in such pool are offered only to qualified eligible persons which includes a qualified purchaser described in question 24 and non united states persons and corresponding exemptions are available to ctas of private equity funds the confluence of regulatory measures taken in the post financial crisis period including the expansion of the meaning of commodity interests to include most swaps and the repeal of the broad exemption under cftc rule 4 13 a 4 which was commonly relied upon by cpos of private equity funds that rely on the 3 c 7 exemption from registration under the investment company act ie the qualified purchaser exemption described in question 24 effectively placed additional regulatory pressure on private equity fund sponsors to monitor whether their activities will deem their private equity funds to be commodity pools eg because the funds hedge their currency or interest rate exposure by acquiring swaps and to appropriately assess the registration requirements for cpos and determine whether they meet the de minimis exemption from such registration which requires consideration of a number of factors early in the process of structuring a fund and throughout its term if an exemption or other relief is not available a sponsor of a fund that invests in commodity interests including derivatives may be required to register with the cftc and nfa in which case it will become subject to reporting record keeping advertising ethics training supervisory and other ongoing compliance obligations and certain of its personnel will become subject to certain proficiency requirements eg the series 3 exam and standards of conduct in an effort to harmonise the cftc rules with the recent amendments to rule 506 of regulation d under the us securities act of 1933 as amended the securities act that afford private equity funds additional flexibility to engage in general solicitations and general advertising in connection with fundraising activities subject to satisfying certain conditions and procedures see question 24 the cftc issued exemptive relief intended to allow private equity fund sponsors relying on the de minimis exemption or registration lite to take advantage of the additional flexibility to engage in general solicitation by effectively conforming the cftc rules to the previously adopted rule 506 amendments governmental requirements what are the governmental approval licensing or registration requirements applicable to a private equity fund in your jurisdiction does it make a difference whether there are significant investment activities in your jurisdiction the offering and sale of interests in a private equity fund are typically conducted as private placements exempt from the securities registration requirements imposed by the securities act the regulations thereunder and applicable state law in addition most private equity funds require their investors to meet certain eligibility requirements so as to enable the funds to qualify for exemption from regulation as investment companies under the investment company act accordingly there are no approval licensing or registration requirements applicable to a private equity fund that offers its interests in a valid private placement and qualifies for an exemption from registration under the investment company act as a general matter if 25 per cent or more of the total value of any class of equity interests in a private equity fund is held by benefit plan investors such as us corporate pension plans and individual retirement accounts as well as entities whose assets include plan assets such as a fund of funds excluding non employee retirement income security act erisa plans such as us governmental pension plans and non us pension plans the private equity fund must be operated to qualify as an operating company such as a venture capital operating company vcoc or a real estate operating company reoc qualification as a vcoc generally entails the private equity fund having on its initial investment date and annually thereafter at least 50 per cent of the private equity fund s assets valued at cost invested in operating companies as to which the private equity fund obtains direct contractual management rights the private equity fund must exercise such management rights with respect to one or more of such operating companies during the course of each year in the ordinary course of business the sponsor of a private equity fund engaging in certain types of corporate finance or financial advisory services may be required to register as a broker dealer with finra and be subject to similar audit and regulation registration of investment adviser is a private equity fund s manager or any of its officers directors or control persons required to register as an investment adviser in your jurisdiction in the absence of an applicable exemption exception or prohibition a private equity fund s manager will be subject to registration as an investment adviser under the advisers act see question 10 those investment advisers registered under the advisers act whether voluntarily or because an exemption exception or prohibition is not available are subject to a number of substantive reporting and record keeping requirements and rules of conduct that shape the management and operation of their business as well as periodic compliance inspections conducted by the sec and certain state regulators as part of the shift towards more systematic regulation and increased scrutiny of the private equity industry the sec continues to focus on the examination of private equity firms certain private equity industry practices have received significant attention from the sec and have led to a number of enforcement actions against private equity fund advisers in recent years areas that the sec has highlighted to be of particular concern include among others the following allocation of expenses to funds or portfolio companies or both without pre commitment disclosure and agreement from investors including for the compensation of operating partners senior advisers consultants and seconded and other employees of private equity fund advisers or their affiliates for providing services other than advisory services to funds or portfolio companies or both full allocation of broken deal expenses to funds instead of separate accounts co investors or co investment vehicles without pre commitment disclosure and agreement from investors marketing presentations and the presentation of performance information generally receipt by private equity firms of compensation from funds or portfolio companies or both which is outside of the typical management fee or carried interest structure without pre commitment disclosure and agreement from investors as well as an acceleration of monitoring fees receipt by private equity firms of transaction based or other compensation for the provision of brokerage services in connection with the acquisition and disposition of portfolio companies without being registered as a broker dealer allocation of investment opportunities among investment vehicles they manage and between such funds and the private equity fund advisers affiliates or employees allocation of co investment opportunities disclosure of other conflicts of interests to investors including those arising out of the outside business activities of a private equity sponsor s employees and directors valuation methods receipt of service provider discounts by private equity firms that are not given to the funds or portfolio companies without pre commitment disclosure and agreement from investors plans to mitigate or respond to cybersecurity events failure to fully allocate fees from portfolio companies to management fee paying funds to offset such management fees without pre commitment disclosure and agreement from investors and allocation of interest from a loan to the private equity fund adviser only to the adviser or its affiliates without pre commitment disclosure and agreement from investors fund manager requirements are there any specific qualifications or other requirements imposed on a private equity fund s manager or any of its officers directors or control persons in your jurisdiction there are no particular educational or experience requirements imposed by law on investment advisers although the education and experience of certain of an investment adviser s personnel are disclosable items in the form adv as a matter of market practice the required experience level of an investment adviser s management team will be dictated by the demands of investors if required to register as a broker dealer with finra a private equity fund sponsor would need to satisfy certain standards in connection with obtaining a registration eg no prior criminal acts minimum capital testing etc also a private equity fund s sponsor is typically expected to make a capital investment either directly in or on a side by side basis with the private equity fund but see question 16 with respect to limitations on sponsor commitments in bank sponsored private equity funds investors will expect that a significant portion of this investment be funded in cash as opposed to deferred fee or other arrangements political contributions describe any rules or policies of public pension plans or other governmental entities in your jurisdiction that restrict or require disclosure of political contributions by a private equity fund s manager or investment adviser or their employees the sec has adopted rule 206 4 5 a broad set of rules aimed at curtailing pay to play scandals in the investment management industry the rules subject to certain de minimis exceptions prohibit a registered investment adviser as well as an era and a foreign private adviser covered advisers from providing advice for compensation to any us government entity within two years after the covered adviser or certain of its executives or employees covered associates has made a political contribution to an elected official or candidate who is in a position to influence an investment by the government entity in a fund advised by such investment adviser the rules also make it illegal for the covered adviser itself or through a covered associate to solicit or coordinate contributions for any government official or political party where the investment adviser is providing or seeking to provide investment advisory services for compensation to a government entity in the applicable state or locality investment advisers are also required to monitor and maintain records relating to political contributions made by their employees in addition to the sec rule certain us states including california new mexico new jersey and new york have enacted legislation and certain us public pension plans including the california public employees retirement system calpers the california state teachers retirement system calstrs the new mexico state investment council and the new york state common retirement fund have established policies that impose similar restrictions on political contributions to state officials by investment advisers and covered associates use of intermediaries and lobbyist registration describe any rules or policies of public pension plans or other governmental entities in your jurisdiction that restrict or require disclosure by a private equity fund s manager or investment adviser of the engagement of placement agents lobbyists or other intermediaries in the marketing of the fund to public pension plans and other governmental entities describe any rules that require a fund s investment adviser or its employees and agents to register as lobbyists in the marketing of the fund to public pension plans and governmental entities with effect from 20 august 2017 the sec s pay to play rules discussed above broadly prohibit a covered adviser from making any payment to a third party including a placement agent finder or other intermediary for securing a capital commitment from a us government entity to a fund advised by the investment adviser unless such placement agent is registered under section 15b of the exchange act and subject to pay to play rules adopted by the municipal securities rulemaking board or finra the ban does not apply to payments by the investment adviser to its employees or owners certain us states have enacted legislation regulating or prohibiting the engagement or payment of placement agents by an investment adviser with respect to investment by some or all of such state s pension systems in a fund advised by such investment adviser such regulations and prohibitions vary from state to state for example california has enacted legislation that requires placement agents which can include third party placement agents as well as the investment manager s employees officers directors and other equity holders unless such persons spend at least a third of their time managing the securities or assets invested by the investment adviser to register as lobbyists before soliciting investments from its state level public pension plans calpers calstrs and the university of california to the extent it is investing retirement as opposed to endowment assets the california law also prohibits placement agents from receiving fees that are contingent on securing investments from the plans and requires disclosure of any fixed placement fees or other compensation paid to solicit investments from such state pension plans the california law requiring placement agents to register as lobbyists may also require such registration of certain of an investment adviser s own employees and partners who are involved with the solicitation of investments from the california state pension plans such as marketing or investor relations personnel the compensation paid to such employees and partners of the investment adviser who directly solicit the plan is also required to be disclosed in addition investment advisers who retain third party placement agents to solicit the california state pension plans or whose employees and partners are covered by the lobbyist registration law are considered lobbyist employers under california law and are required to make certain public filings in addition to such placement agents and employees kentucky has also recently adopted registration requirements with respect to placement agents soliciting investments from kentucky state pension plans that are similar to those applicable to california state public pension plans various other states may also have lobbying laws that effectively require investment advisers and their employees who solicit state and local pension plans to register as lobbyists counties cities or other municipal jurisdictions may require lobbyist registration or disclosure or both for example in new york city local rules effectively require investment advisers and their employees who solicit local pension plans to register as lobbyists in addition public pension plans may have their own additional requirements in states where state law does not ban placement agent fees or require disclosure the public pension plans themselves may have such bans or requirements bank participation describe any legal or regulatory developments emerging from the recent global financial crisis that specifically affect banks with respect to investing in or sponsoring private equity funds in 2013 the five us regulatory agencies responsible for implementing the volcker rule provisions of dodd frank approved final rules the final rules that generally prohibit banking entities from acquiring or retaining any ownership in or sponsoring a private equity fund and engaging in proprietary trading for purposes of the final rules the term banking entity means any insured depository institution other than certain limited purpose trust institutions any company that controls an insured depository institution any company that is treated as a bank holding company for purposes of the international banking act such as a foreign bank that has a us branch agency or commercial lending subsidiary and any affiliate or subsidiary of such entities there are a number of exceptions to the basic prohibition on banking entities investing in or sponsoring private equity funds in particular banking entities are permitted to invest in covered private funds that they sponsor provided that the investment does not exceed 3 per cent of the fund s total ownership interest or 3 per cent of the banking entity s tier 1 capital and provided that certain other conditions are met for these purposes a covered fund generally include funds that would be investment companies but for the exemptions provided by section 3 c 1 or section 3 c 7 of the investment company act the trump administration has indicated it supports the repeal or modification of key aspects of the volcker rule but whether such legislation will be enacted or in what ultimate form is uncertain taxation tax obligations would a private equity fund vehicle formed in your jurisdiction be subject to taxation there with respect to its income or gains would the fund be required to withhold taxes with respect to distributions to investors please describe what conditions if any apply to a private equity fund to qualify for applicable tax exemptions generally a private equity fund vehicle such as a limited partnership or limited liability company that is treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes would not itself be subject to taxation with respect to its income or gains instead each partner would take into account its distributive share of the partnership s income gain loss and deduction recently enacted legislation that is scheduled to become effective for taxable years beginning after 31 december 2017 however may impose liability for adjustments to a fund s tax returns on the fund itself in certain circumstances in the absence of an election to the contrary the effects of the application of this new legislation on private equity funds is uncertain if the fund generates income that is effectively connected with the conduct of a us trade or business eci including as a result of an investment in us real estate or certain real estate companies the fund will be required to withhold us federal income tax with respect to such income that is attributable to the fund s non us investors regardless of whether it is distributed in general subject to an exception for investments in certain real estate companies trading in stock or securities the principal activity of most private equity funds is not treated as generating eci the fund will also be required to withhold with respect to its non us investors distributive share of certain us source income of the fund that is not eci eg us source dividends and interest unless in the case of interest such interest qualifies as portfolio interest portfolio interest generally includes with certain exceptions interest paid on registered obligations with respect to which the beneficial owner provides a statement that it is not a us person a non us investor who is a resident for tax purposes in a country with respect to which the us has an income tax treaty may be eligible for a reduction or refund of withholding tax imposed on such investor s distributive share of interest and dividends and certain foreign government investors may also be eligible for an exemption from withholding tax on income of the fund that is not from the conduct of commercial activities the foreign account tax compliance act requires all entities in a broadly defined class of foreign financial institutions ffis to comply with a complicated and expansive reporting regime or be subject to a 30 per cent withholding tax on certain payments and beginning in 2019 a 30 per cent withholding tax on gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of us stocks and securities this legislation also requires non us entities that are not ffis either to certify they have no substantial us beneficial ownership or to report certain information with respect to their substantial us beneficial ownership or be subject to a 30 per cent withholding tax on certain payments and beginning in 2019 a 30 per cent withholding tax on gross proceeds from the sale of us stocks and securities this legislation could apply to non us investors in the fund and the private equity fund could be required to withhold on payments to such investors if such investors do not comply with the applicable requirements of this legislation the taxation of a private equity fund vehicle as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes is subject to certain rules regarding publicly traded partnerships that could result in the partnership being classified as an association taxable as a corporation to avoid these rules funds are not commonly traded on a securities exchange or other established over the counter market and impose limitations on the transferability of interests in the private equity fund vehicle local taxation of non resident investors would non resident investors in a private equity fund be subject to taxation or return filing requirements in your jurisdiction non resident investors that invest directly in a private equity fund organised as a flow through vehicle in the us would be subject to us federal income taxation and return filing obligations if the private equity fund or an entity organised as a flow through vehicle into which the private equity fund invests generates eci including gain from the sale of real property or stock in certain us real estate property holding corporations see question 17 in addition all or a portion of the gain on the disposition including by redemption by a non us investor of its interest in the fund may be taxed as eci similar us state and local income tax requirements may also apply local tax authority ruling is it necessary or desirable to obtain a ruling from local tax authorities with respect to the tax treatment of a private equity fund vehicle formed in your jurisdiction are there any special tax rules relating to investors that are residents of your jurisdiction generally no tax ruling would be obtained with respect to the tax treatment of a private equity fund vehicle formed in the us while there are many special taxation rules applicable to us investors of particular relevance are those rules that apply to us tax exempt investors in respect of unrelated business taxable income ubti organisational taxes must any significant organisational taxes be paid with respect to private equity funds organised in your jurisdiction there are no significant taxes associated with the organisation of a private equity fund in the us special tax considerations please describe briefly what special tax considerations if any apply with respect to a private equity fund s sponsor special consideration is given to structure the carried interest such that it is treated as a partnership allocation eligible for taxation on a flow through basis it is sometimes desirable to separate the general partner namely the recipient of the carried interest and the investment manager namely the recipient of the management fee into separate entities see question 32 under the tax reform bill the fund must have a three year holding period rather than the standard one year holding period for an investment or asset in order for carried interest distributions to be eligible for favourable long term capital gain treatment in addition an individual carried interest participant will only be eligible for long term capital gain treatment upon disposition of any interests in a carry vehicle other than capital interests if such participant has a three year holding period for the interests further congress has previously proposed legislation that if enacted would result in carried interest distributions that are currently subject to favourable capital gains tax treatment being subject to higher rates of us federal income tax than are currently in effect whether such legislation would be enacted in addition to changes in the tax reform bill is uncertain in addition some sponsors implement arrangements in which a sponsor waives its right to all or a portion of management fees in order for it or an affiliate to receive an additional distributive share of the private equity fund s returns proposed regulations if finalised could treat participants in such management fee waiver arrangements as receiving compensatory payments for services rather than allocations of the fund s underlying income the preamble to the proposed regulations also indicates that existing safe harbours that treat the grant of a profits interest as a non taxable event may not apply to management fee waiver arrangements tax treaties please list any relevant tax treaties to which your jurisdiction is a party and how such treaties apply to the fund vehicle the us has an extensive network of income tax treaties how a treaty would apply to the fund vehicle depends on the terms of the specific treaty and the relevant facts of the structure other significant tax issues are there any other significant tax issues relating to private equity funds organised in your jurisdiction the tax reform bill has resulted in fundamental changes to the tax code among the numerous changes included in the tax reform bill are a permanent reduction to the corporate income tax rate a partial limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense an income deduction for individuals receiving certain business income from pass through entities changes in the treatment of carried interest which generally requires the fund to have a three year holding period for an investment or asset in order for carried interest distributions to be eligible for favourable long term capital gain treatment as further described in question 21 a partial shift of the us taxation of multinational corporations from a tax on worldwide income to a territorial system along with a transitional rule that taxes certain historical accumulated earnings and rules that prevent tax planning strategies that shift profits to low tax jurisdictions and a suspension of certain miscellaneous itemised deductions including deductions for investment fees and expenses until 2026 the partial limit on the deductibility of business interest expense disallows deductions for business interest expense even if paid to third parties in excess of the sum of business interest income and 30 per cent of the adjusted taxable income of the business business interest includes any interest on indebtedness related to a trade or business but excludes investment interest to which separate limitations apply the impact of the tax reform bill on funds and their portfolio companies is uncertain us tax rules are very complex and tax matters play an extremely important role in both fund formation and the structure of underlying fund investments consultation with tax advisers with respect to the specific transactions or issues is highly recommended selling restrictions and investors generally legal and regulatory restrictions describe the principal legal and regulatory restrictions on offers and sales of interests in private equity funds formed in your jurisdiction including the type of investors to whom such funds or private equity funds formed in other jurisdictions may be offered without registration under applicable securities laws in your jurisdiction exemptions from requirement to register fund interests to ensure that a private equity fund offering securities in the us will satisfy the requirements necessary to avoid registration of the interests in the fund with the sec a private equity fund sponsor will customarily conduct the offering and sale of interests in the private equity fund to meet a private placement exemption under the securities act the most reliable way to do this is to comply with the safe harbour criteria established by rule 506 under regulation d under the securities act compliance with these criteria effectively necessitate among other requirements that each investor in the private equity fund be an accredited investor which generally includes a natural person with a net worth of more than us 1 million or income above us 200 000 in the last two years or us 300 000 in joint income with a spouse for those years and a reasonable expectation of reaching the same income level in the current year and entities with more than us 5 million in assets for purposes of the us 1 million net worth test described above the value of the investor s primary residence is excluded from the calculation of the investor s total assets and the amount of any mortgage or other indebtedness secured by an investor s primary residence is similarly excluded from the calculation of the investor s total liabilities except to the extent the fair market value of the residence is less than the amount of such mortgage or other indebtedness there is also a timing provision in the net worth test designed to prevent investors from artificially inflating their net worth by incurring incremental indebtedness secured by their primary residence to acquire assets that would be included in the net worth calculation under the timing provision if a borrowing occurs in the 60 days preceding the purchase of securities in an exempt offering and is not in connection with the purchase of the primary residence the incremental indebtedness must be treated as a liability for the net worth calculation even if the value of the primary residence exceeds the aggregate amount of debt secured by the primary residence the sec is authorised to adjust the accredited investor definition for individuals every four years as may be appropriate to protect investors further the public interest or otherwise reflect changes in the prevailing economy in addition to satisfying the accredited investor criteria the sponsor must either not make any offers or sales by means of general solicitation or general advertising in which case it can rely on the more traditional rule 506 b exemption or if it does make any offer or sale by means of general solicitation and general advertising in connection with fundraising activities the sponsor must comply with additional requirements including enhanced verification procedures that do not apply to offerings that do not involve any general solicitation or general advertising in order to rely on the exemption in rule 506 c the additional requirements of rule 506 c which are substantial are as follows that all purchasers of securities qualify as accredited investors and that the issuer takes reasonable steps to verify the accredited investor status of all purchasers rule 506 c provides some non exclusive non mandatory methods of verifying that a natural person is accredited eg reviewing tax returns or bank account statements and to the extent these methods are not used or a sponsor is verifying the accredited investor status of an entity in determining whether the steps taken by an issuer to verify eligibility are objectively reasonable sponsors should consider the particular facts and circumstances of each offering and each purchaser including the following the nature of the purchaser and the type of accredited investor that the purchaser claims to be the amount and type of information that the issuer has about the purchaser and the nature terms and manner of the offering given that these increased verification measures with respect to sales under rule 506 c generally result in increased compliance burdens and costs for issuers and in some cases investors are reluctant to provide or are sensitive about providing the additional information required as part of the enhanced verification procedures private equity firms are not yet widely utilising rule 506 c and rule 506 c is not expected to play a significant role in private equity fundraising in the future other factors impeding utilisation of rule 506 c by private equity firms are that use of general solicitation in reliance on rule 506 c may impact other aspects of a private equity sponsor s regulatory compliance regime and the potential impact of pending sec proposed amendments to rule 506 that would create additional burdens for reliance on rule 506 c as described further below for example it is possible that the use of general solicitation or general advertising by a private equity fund under rule 506 c could have an adverse impact on its private placement under the securities laws of other jurisdictions in which it conducts its offering as the securities laws thereof may not permit general solicitation in their current form a private equity fund relying on a private placement safe harbour contained in regulation d under the securities act must file electronically with the sec a notice on form d within 15 calendar days after the first sale of securities form d sets forth certain basic information about the offering including the amount of securities offered and sold as well as whether any sales commissions were paid to any broker dealers and if so the states in which purchases were solicited by such broker dealer for purposes of the form d filing deadline the sec considers the first date of sale to occur on the date on which the first investor is irrevocably contractually committed to invest therefore depending on the terms and conditions of the contract such date could be deemed to be the date on which a private equity fund receives its first investor subscription agreement and not necessarily the typically later closing date the sec has proposed amendments to regulation d which would impose additional procedural requirements on issuers seeking to rely on rule 506 c to engage in a general solicitation by requiring that an initial form d with heightened disclosure requirements be filed at least 15 days before commencing any such general solicitation and that a final amendment to form d be filed within 30 days of the termination of any such offering under other proposed amendments failure to comply with the form d filing requirements whether or not involving a general solicitation would result in an automatic one year disqualification from relying on a rule 506 safe harbour in addition to federal securities law compliance most states have similar notice filing requirements while state registration of securities is pre empted under the securities act private equity sponsors should be cognisant of the state law notice filing requirements in the various jurisdictions in which they will or have offered or sold limited partnership interests to investors many states require a notice filing consisting of a copy of a form d and a filing fee to be made within 15 calendar days after the first sale in the state anti fraud provisions under applicable state laws apply despite the pre emption described above issuers are prohibited from relying on the rule 506 safe harbour whether or not the proposed offering involves a general solicitation if the issuer or any other covered person was subject to a disqualifying event covered persons include the issuer and its predecessors affiliated issuers ie issuers that issue securities in the same offering such as parallel funds and related feeder funds directors and certain officers general partners and managing members of the issuer beneficial owners of 20 per cent or more of an issuer s outstanding voting equity securities calculated on the basis of voting power which could include limited partners in related private equity funds if the issuer and such related fund vote together any investment manager to a pooled investment fund issuer any promoter connected with the issuer and any persons compensated for soliciting investors eg placement agents as well as the general partners directors officers and managing members of any such investment manager or compensated solicitor for purposes of the bad actor rules disqualifying events include certain criminal convictions court injunctions and restraining orders final orders of state and federal regulators sec disciplinary orders stop orders and cease and desist orders suspension or expulsion from a securities self regulatory organisation and us postal service false representation orders disqualification is not triggered by actions taken in jurisdictions other than the us a number of the disqualifying events are required to occur in connection with the purchase or sale of securities and include a look back period of five to 10 years depending on the particular facts surrounding the disqualifying event while only disqualifying events that occur after the rule s effective date 23 september 2013 will disqualify an issuer from relying on rule 506 disqualifying events that occurred prior to such date but within the applicable look back period would nonetheless be required to be disclosed to investors in connection with any sales of securities under rule 506 the bad actor rules will not apply if an issuer can show that it did not know and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known that the issuer or any other covered person was subject to a disqualifying event although this reasonable care exception requires factual inquiry additionally the sec may grant waivers from disqualification under certain circumstances including if the issuer has undergone a change of control subsequent to the disqualifying event exemptions from requirement to register funds to ensure that a private equity fund will satisfy the requirements necessary to avoid regulation as an investment company under the investment company act each investor in the fund will typically be required to represent that it is a qualified purchaser as defined in section 2 a 51 of the investment company act in the event that not all of a private equity fund s investors are qualified purchasers the fund may still qualify for an exemption the 3 c 1 exemption by limiting the number of investors to not more than 100 all of which must still be accredited investors and with respect to which certain look through attribution rules apply a qualified purchaser generally includes a natural person who owns not less than us 5 million in investments a company acting for its own account or the accounts of other qualified purchasers that owns and invests on a discretionary basis not less than us 25 million in investments and certain trusts knowledgeable employees namely executive officers and directors of the sponsor and most investment professionals actively involved with the private equity fund s investment activities are ignored for the purposes of the foregoing requirements if the sponsor of a private equity fund is a registered investment adviser under the advisers act then in certain circumstances each investor may need to represent that it is a qualified client as defined under the advisers act a qualified client generally includes a natural person or company with a net worth exceeding us 2 1 million or that has us 1 million under management with the investment adviser although the sec is required every five years to adjust these dollar amounts for inflation excluding the value attributable to such person s primary residence as further described above types of investor describe any restrictions on the types of investors that may participate in private equity funds formed in your jurisdiction other than those imposed by applicable securities laws described above other than compliance with certain aspects of the anti money laundering provisions of the usa patriot act the patriot act discussed in question 28 as a general matter there are no such restrictions other than those imposed by applicable securities laws described above or which may arise under the laws of other jurisdictions sponsors of private equity funds may choose to limit participation by certain types of investors in light of applicable legal tax and regulatory considerations and the investment strategy of the fund restrictions may be imposed on the participation of non us investors in a private equity fund in investments by the private equity fund in certain regulated industries eg airlines shipping telecommunications and defence see question 16 with respect to recently enacted restrictions on bank holding companies investing in private equity funds identity of investors does your jurisdiction require any ongoing filings with or notifications to regulators regarding the identity of investors in private equity funds including by virtue of transfers of fund interests or regarding the change in the composition of ownership management or control of the fund or the manager there is generally no requirement to notify the state of delaware or the sec as a result of a change in the identity of investors in a private equity fund formed in delaware including by virtue of transfers of fund interests or regarding the change in the composition of ownership of the fund however in the case of a manager who is an investment adviser registered under the advisers act or an era changes in identity of certain individuals employed by or associated with the investment adviser must be reflected in an amendment to part 1 of the investment adviser s form adv promptly filed with the sec and in certain circumstances a change of management or control of the fund or of the manager or investment adviser may require the consent of the investors in the private equity fund in the event of a change of the general partner of a delaware limited partnership an amendment to the fund s certificate of limited partnership would be required to be filed in delaware and such change would need to be accomplished in accordance with such limited partnership s partnership agreement additionally a private equity fund that makes an investment in a regulated industry such as banking insurance airlines telecommunications shipping defence energy and gaming may be required to disclose the identity and ownership percentage of fund investors to the applicable regulatory authorities in connection with an investment in any such company licences and registrations does your jurisdiction require that the person offering interests in a private equity fund have any licences or registrations generally the sponsor of a private equity fund in the us would not be required to register as a broker or dealer under the exchange act as they are not normally considered to be engaged in the business of brokering or dealing in securities the rules promulgated under the exchange act provide a safe harbour from requiring employees and issuers to register as a broker or dealer subject to certain conditions including such employees not being compensated by payment of commissions or other remunerations based either directly or indirectly on the offering of securities if compensation is directly or indirectly paid to employees of the sponsor in connection with the offering of securities the sponsor may be required to register as a broker dealer see questions 10 and 11 if a private equity fund retains a third party to market its securities that third party generally would be required to be registered as a broker dealer money laundering describe any money laundering rules or other regulations applicable in your jurisdiction requiring due diligence record keeping or disclosure of the identities of or other related information about the investors in a private equity fund or the individual members of the sponsor although private equity funds generally have historically not been subject to the anti money laundering regulations of the patriot act on 25 august 2015 the financial crimes enforcement network fincen a bureau of the us department of the treasury proposed regulations that would impose anti money laundering obligations on investment advisers registered with the sec under the advisers act covered advisers covered advisers would be included in the definition of financial institution in regulations implementing the patriot act and consequently would be required among other things to establish and implement risk based anti money laundering programmes and file suspicious activity reports with fincen the proposed rules do not however include a customer identification programme requirement as required for other financial institutions fincen proposes delegating authority to the sec to examine compliance with the proposed rules although these proposed rules are not currently effective as a best practice many private equity funds have already put into place anti money laundering programmes that meet the requirements set forth in the patriot act s regulations these requirements include the following developing internal policies procedures and controls designating an anti money laundering compliance officer implementing an employee training programme and having an independent audit function to test the programme currently there are no regulations in effect that would require the disclosure of the identities of or other related information about the investors in a private equity fund or the individual members of the sponsor if an investment adviser to a private equity fund is registered under the advisers act the investment adviser must disclose on form adv the educational business and disciplinary background of certain individuals employed by or associated with the investment adviser similar disclosure may be required for investment advisers that are or have affiliates that are broker dealers registered with finra see also question 10 for disclosure obligations under form pf exchange listing listing are private equity funds able to list on a securities exchange in your jurisdiction and if so is this customary what are the principal initial and ongoing requirements for listing what are the advantages and disadvantages of a listing because of certain adverse tax consequences arising from status as a publicly traded partnership and the difficulty that such a listing would impose on being able to establish an exemption from registration under the investment company act private equity funds do not typically list on a securities exchange in the us see also question 17 the applicable listing requirements would be established by the relevant securities exchange restriction on transfers of interest to what extent can a listed fund restrict transfers of its interests as discussed above private equity funds do not typically list on any us exchange however if listed the ability of such a fund to restrict transfers of its interest would be dictated by the listing requirements of the relevant securities exchange as well as the other governing agreements of such fund participation in private equity transactions legal and regulatory restrictions are funds formed in your jurisdiction subject to any legal or regulatory restrictions that affect their participation in private equity transactions or otherwise affect the structuring of private equity transactions completed inside or outside your jurisdiction the primary restrictions concerning the types of investments that a private equity fund may make are typically contained in the private equity fund s limited partnership agreement these restrictions often include limits on the amount of capital typically expressed as a percentage of the fund s capital commitments that may be deployed in any one investment a restriction on participation in hostile transactions certain geographic diversification limits a restriction on investments that generate certain types of tax consequences for investors eg ubti for us tax exempt investors or eci for non us investors a restriction on certain types of investments eg venture capital investments blind pool investments direct investments in real estate or oil and gas assets and so on individual investors in a private equity fund may also have the right either pursuant to the partnership agreement or a side letter relating thereto to be excused from having their capital invested in certain types of investments tobacco military industry etc and to participate in certain types of investments in a certain manner eg to participate in ubti or eci investments through an alternative investment vehicle or an entity treated as a corporation for us federal tax purposes or both there may also be limits on and filing requirements associated with certain types of portfolio investments made by a private equity fund for example investments in certain media companies may implicate the ownership limits and reporting obligations established by the us federal communications commission other similarly regulated industries include shipping defence banking and insurance regulatory considerations applicable to mergers and acquisitions transactions generally eg antitrust tender offer rules etc also apply equally to private equity transactions completed by funds consideration should also be given to the potential applicability of the sarbanes oxley act and applicable us state laws relating to fraudulent conveyance issues as discussed in more detail in the us transactions chapter in addition in general if benefit plan investors hold 25 per cent or more of the total value of any class of equity interests in the private equity fund the private equity fund may to avoid being subject to the fiduciary responsibility standard of care under erisa and prohibited transaction rules under erisa and the code need to structure its investments in a manner so as to ensure that the private equity fund will qualify as a vcoc or an reoc within the meaning of the erisa plan asset regulations qualification as a vcoc generally entails having on its initial investment date and annually thereafter at least 50 per cent of the private equity fund s assets valued at cost invested in operating companies as to which the private equity fund obtains direct contractual management rights and exercising such management rights with respect to one or more of such operating companies during the course of each year in the ordinary course of business compensation and profit sharing describe any legal or regulatory issues that would affect the structuring of the sponsor s compensation and profit sharing arrangements with respect to the fund and specifically anything that could affect the sponsor s ability to take management fees transaction fees and a carried interest or other form of profit share from the fund depending on the state in which a private equity fund is formed and operates there may be tax advantages to forming separate entities to receive the carried interest and management fee and other fee payments in respect of the fund and other unique structuring requirements for example funds whose manager has a place of business in new york city typically use this bifurcated structure additionally as noted in question 21 the tax reform bill requires funds to have a three year holding period rather than the standard one year holding period for an investment or asset in order for carried interest distributions to be eligible for favourable long term capital gain treatment in addition an individual carried interest participant will only be eligible for long term capital gain treatment upon disposition of any interests in a carry vehicle other than capital interests if such participant has a three year holding period for the interests further congress has previously proposed legislation that if enacted would result in typical carried interest distributions being taxed at a higher rate and proposed regulations and related guidance may limit the tax benefits of management fee waiver arrangements moreover tax rules limit a sponsor s ability to use fee deferral arrangements to defer payment of tax on compensation and similar profits allocations the sponsor s ability to take transaction fees is likely to be the subject of negotiation with investors in the fund who may seek to have a portion of such fees accrue for their account as opposed to that of the sponsor through an offset of such fees against the management fee otherwise to be borne by such investors in certain circumstances depending on the structure of a private equity fund the manner in which a sponsor may charge a carried interest or management fee can be affected by the requirements of erisa or the advisers act update and trends update and trends what are the most significant recent trends and developments relating to private equity funds in your jurisdiction what impact do you expect such trends and developments will have on global private equity fundraising and on private equity funds generally
as the weather warms up in the northern hemisphere after a bitter winter there is concern that the world is moving towards a synchronised global slowdown this is a massive contrast to only a year ago when the consensus was optimistic about a synchronised global recovery this slowdown is mostly man made the biggest dampener being the us china trade war which aggravated the cyclical chinese slowdown last year on the back of reforms aimed at getting a grip on the debt overhang as brexit moved from tragedy to farce europe also slowed when populist unrest sparked a huge debate on how to deal with the new unknowns right wing populists focus on european fears of being overwhelmed by the growing tide of migrants left wing populists want more welfare spending that right wing conservatives reject meanwhile many emerging markets are in the throes of leadership changes with major elections being called in india and indonesia tensions in the middle east and north africa have worsened with conflict erupting in libya and algeria so far east and south asia are still the growth poles in the global gross domestic product league enjoying rates above 5 per cent per annum but there are signs that this is flagging the world trade organisation is forecasting that global trade growth in 2019 at 2 6 per cent will be slower than the global gdp growth of 3 3 per cent forecast by the international monetary fund a historical signal that recession may be on the horizon for some time it has been apparent that the asian export growth model that relies on cheap labour is already nearing the end of its shelf life the us and european markets have reached maturity in terms of consumption power while protectionism and automation mean that production is shifting back to home markets consequently asian economies will have to look to domestic consumption to sustain growth but for several reasons most asian governments are not ready to make that major policy shift the introduction to the book sustaining economic growth in asia edited by experts from the peterson institute for international economics and the international monetary fund asks what the policy options and growth models in asia are in the face of the long term stagnation of advanced economies first the symptoms of stagnation in europe and america are already evident in japan and south korea which are both suffering from higher dependency ratios more retirees that the existing workforce can support and a shrinking workforce declining interest rates higher domestic debt burdens and lack of domestic investment all point to lower productivity levels which then suggest lower future growth in the past 30 years asia has also begun to show symptoms of the free market disease of growing inequality since the 1970s there has been a swing from paying labour towards rewarding capital and short term speculation to illustrate from 1973 to 2013 productivity in the us went up 74 per cent whereas hourly wages went up only 9 per cent thus while workers were paid peanuts corporate profits and salaries of ceos rose disproportionately thomas piketty has argued that historically concentrations of wealth and landed property account for much of the inequality the political backlash against this inequality is embodied in the populist vote for change blaming all ills on globalisation immigrants and foreigners asian countries which over the past 40 years have been exporting not just their best products but also their top talent to the united states are now forced to rethink their own priorities it is one thing to sell goods in exchange for dollars but to be insulted for causing america s woes begs a major policy shift these policy shifts are already showing up in subtle changes in the asian global supply chain first it is not just china diversifying through outward foreign investment but many manufacturers currently based in china are already shifting to lower wage production centres such as vietnam bangladesh indonesia and the philippines to hedge their geographical risks second almost all are beginning to upgrade digitally led by asia s own digital platforms such as china s alibaba and tencent and indonesia s go jek the asian global supply chain is becoming more services oriented and more regionally networked as the main engine of growth diversifies from exports to the west to exports within asia boosting domestic consumption is clearly the major strategy of the population giants china india and indonesia but the 100 million class economies bangladesh the philippines and vietnam are also set to benefit from home market strengths this leaves the smaller economies struggling to find their niche in the new multipolar diverse and politically divided world if there is one blind spot in this review it is the lack of appreciation of how climate change and the transition to a low carbon economy will fundamentally change the consumption and production patterns in asia as a whole the irrefutable big picture is that as countries move from dependence on fossil fuels to alternative sources of energy there will be a major redistribution of power from former oil producers to the most energy efficient economies this is because the us emergence as a major energy producer will keep oil prices low despite the efforts of the organisation of the petroleum exporting countries to limit production as china and india move into middle income consumption levels there will be bigger strains on natural resources particularly forests marine reefs and food production those who move up the green path best will have the capacity to compete to provide the goods and services everyone needs to deal with the worst effects of climate change the right path will be found through diverse competition and innovation not any centrally planned solutions diversity is asia s strength higher asian consumption is both an opportunity but also a threat especially to our scarce natural resources how each individual economy adapts to this new environment of worsening climate change and the need to provide jobs and food for all will be the major challenge for asia source south china morning post

use the lexology getting the deal through tool to compare the answers in this article with those from other jurisdictions transaction formalities rules and practical considerations types of private equity transactions what different types of private equity transactions occur in your jurisdiction what structures are commonly used in private equity investments and acquisitions types of transactions with the swiss private equity market benefiting from a generally good market environment and a relatively robust outlook all standard transaction strategies to invest in grow or acquire profitable portfolio companies are present in switzerland in terms of transaction values however the bulk of private equity funds still flows into buyout deals rescue or turnaround investments on the other hand remain insignificant in the past three years a consistently large share of about 75 per cent of the total number of private equity deals took the form of venture capital financing rounds start up companies have continued to benefit from increasing investments with approximately 909 million swiss francs compared with approximately 670 million swiss francs in 2015 being raised in 151 rounds of financing in 2016 compared with 120 financing rounds in 2015 however the value of the median of all start up financing rounds remains relatively low approximately 2 5 million swiss francs structures commonly used the majority of buyout or growth investments in switzerland are structured so that the fund incorporates a new swiss company which then serves as a special purpose acquisition vehicle spv to purchase the shares in the target portfolio company while such spv is typically formed with only the minimum share capital of 100 000 swiss francs the fund managers draw down the capital committed by the investors shortly before the transaction in order to fund the spv with the required equity to complete the transaction private equity houses focusing on venture capital investments on the other hand generally acquire participations in portfolio companies directly through one or several of their investment funds by subscribing for shares issued in a capital increase of the target company corporate governance rules what are the implications of corporate governance rules for private equity transactions are there any advantages to going private in leveraged buyout or similar transactions what are the effects of corporate governance rules on companies that following a private equity transaction remain or later become public companies the main rules relating to corporate governance in switzerland are as follows the swiss federal code of obligations co in particular articles 620 et seq which are partly mandatory and govern any swiss stock corporation irrespective of whether it is privately held or listed on a stock exchange the swiss federal act on enforcement of the recommendations of the financial action task force entered into force partly in july 2015 and partly in january 2016 it states inter alia that any shareholder acquiring more than 25 per cent of a company must disclose its ultimate beneficial owners to the company for transparency purposes failing which the rights of the shareholder voting rights rights of dividends are suspended the financial markets infrastructure act the fmia which entered into effect on 1 january 2016 replacing the previously relevant sections of the swiss federal act on stock exchanges and securities trading and its implementing ordinances which inter alia contain rules regarding the disclosure of significant shareholdings and public tender offers with respect to swiss companies listed on a stock exchange in switzerland and non swiss companies with a primary listing on a stock exchange in switzerland the ordinance against excessive remuneration by listed companies which applies to corporations organised under swiss law whose shares are listed on a stock exchange in switzerland or abroad foreign companies only listed on a swiss stock exchange or merely having tax residence in switzerland are not affected and provides inter alia for the mandatory election by the shareholders of the chairman of the board and the members of the remuneration committee an annual binding shareholder vote on the aggregate remuneration of the board and the executive committee and the prohibition of certain forms of remuneration for the members of the board and the executive committee eg severance payments advance payments payments related to the acquisition or disposal of businesses the main principles contained in the above mentioned ordinance are meant to be implemented in the co the bill was adopted by the swiss government in november 2016 and is currently under review by the swiss parliament the listing rules of the six swiss exchange six listing rules and its implementing directives which inter alia contain periodic financial reporting and other continuing and ad hoc reporting rules applying to companies whose shares are listed on the six swiss exchange the directive on information relating to corporate governance of the six swiss exchange which requires swiss companies listed on the six swiss exchange and non swiss companies with a primary listing on the six swiss exchange to disclose in their annual reports certain information on the board and the senior management their compensation and the control mechanisms the directive on the disclosure of management transactions of the six swiss exchange which requires swiss companies listed on the six swiss exchange and non swiss companies with a primary listing on the six swiss exchange to disclose transactions in the company s shares and related instruments by members of the board and the senior management and the swiss code of best practice for corporate governance issued by economiesuisse the umbrella organisation representing the swiss economy which sets forth corporate governance standards in the form of non binding recommendations primarily for listed companies these recommendations are divided into four parts shareholders board of directors and executive management auditing and disclosure and although not binding these rules have become standard for listed companies it follows from the above that the vast majority of corporate governance related rules and regulations applies to listed companies only with the exception of the limited governance related provisions contained in the co that apply to all stock corporations irrespective of whether they are listed or private the mandatory corporate governance rules applying to private companies are thus much lighter and limited to the provisions of the co although such rules are more limited in scope governance issues can for example arise if financial investors eg in the context of venture capital investments hold minority interests in the portfolio company but have far reaching control and veto rights through their representatives in the board of directors of the portfolio company in which case potential conflict of interest scenarios may arise where corporate governance principles will become important it should also be noted that special rules on corporate governance apply to banks and insurance companies and to investment companies with variable capital or fixed capital in particular the finma circulars on corporate governance of banks on corporate governance of insurance companies and on minimum standards for remuneration schemes of financial institutions set forth minimum standards for corporate governance and the remuneration schemes of banks insurance companies and other financial institutions meeting certain financial thresholds issues facing public company boards what are some of the issues facing boards of directors of public companies considering entering into a going private or private equity transaction what procedural safeguards if any may boards of directors of public companies use when considering such a transaction what is the role of a special committee in such a transaction where senior management members of the board or significant shareholders are participating or have an interest in the transaction going private transactions of listed companies in switzerland usually occur through a public tender offer pursuant to the rules of the fmia or a merger pursuant to the swiss merger act sma whereas private equity transactions in general are conducted according to the common rules of the co under swiss law the members of the board of directors are bound by fiduciary duties and by the principle of equal treatment of all shareholders in addition the fmia contains provisions to ensure transparency fairness and equal treatment of shareholders in corporate takeovers in particular the board s fiduciary duties imply the duty to take measures or rather to apply procedural safeguards in order to avoid the effects of potential conflicts of interest the appointment of independent directors or the establishment of a special ad hoc committee is one of these procedural safeguards the special committee shall be composed of at least two members who are not participating or do not have an interest in the transaction other measures include abstention of conflicted board members and obtaining of a fairness opinion should the board of directors issue a recommendation on a public tender offer it will usually obtain a fairness opinion from an independent audit firm or investment bank the board s recommendations will then be based on such fairness opinion members of the senior management may have to abstain from decisions on a transaction in case of a conflict of interest whereas significant shareholders generally do not directly represent the company in a transaction and may pursue their interests as set forth in the articles of association and by exercising their voting right at shareholders meetings disclosure issues are there heightened disclosure issues in connection with going private transactions or other private equity transactions according to the six listing rules listed companies must inform the market of any price sensitive facts that have arisen in their sphere of activity ad hoc publicity price sensitive facts are facts that are capable of triggering a significant change in market prices based on this provision going private transactions might need to be disclosed at an early stage however the issuer may postpone the disclosure of a price sensitive fact if the fact is based on a plan or decision of the issuer and its dissemination might prejudice the legitimate interests of the issuer the issuer must ensure that the price relevant fact remains confidential for the entire time that disclosure is postponed in the event of a leak the market must be informed about the fact immediately moreover if a going private transaction takes the form of a public tender offer the bidder shall publish an offer prospectus and the board of directors of the target shall publish a report containing all necessary information in order for the shareholders to be able to assess the offer the board s report shall describe the effects of the offer on the target and its shareholders it may contain a recommendation on whether to accept the offer or may only set out the pros and cons of the offer without making any recommendation it shall further specify the intentions of the shareholders who hold more than 3 per cent of the voting rights any defensive measures of the target as well as any potential conflicts of interest should a going private transaction be effected by way of a merger see question 6 the board of directors of the target will have to provide a detailed report which inter alia shall explain the consequences of the merger the merger agreement and the exchange ratio such report shall then be verified by an independent auditor furthermore during the 30 days preceding the merger the shareholders have the right to inspect the documentation relating to the merger including the merger agreement the merger report the audit report as well as the financial statements of the companies taking part in the merger timing considerations what are the timing considerations for a going private or other private equity transaction the following elements may inter alia influence the timing of a going private transaction involving a listed company in the case of a going private transaction occurring through a public tender offer the process starts by a pre announcement within six weeks of such pre announcement the bidder shall publish the offer prospectus the offer can be accepted 10 trading days after publication of the prospectus at the earliest the cooling off period the offer shall remain open for 20 to 40 trading days if the offer was successful the bidder must afford the shareholders an additional period of 10 trading days to accept the offer all deadlines may be reduced or extended by the swiss takeover board upon request in the case of a going private transaction occurring through a merger the merger agreement the board report on the merger and the audit report have to be issued 30 days prior to the shareholders resolution on the merger in addition the merging companies might need to observe a consultation period with the employees prior to the merger should the contemplated merger have any consequences on the employment conditions moreover within three months of the publication of the merger creditors may require that their claims be secured for companies whose shares are listed on the six swiss exchange the directive on the delisting of equity securities derivatives and exchange traded products six dd is applicable in principle the six dd requires that the listing must generally be maintained for at least three and a maximum of 12 months from the delisting announcement continued listing period shareholders in general merely have the limited right to challenge the delisting decision with regard to the continued listing period and merger control notifications and approvals governmental consents required in regulated industries and the obtaining of tax rulings as applicable may also influence the timing as they may take a few months depending on the circumstances private equity transactions not involving a listed company generally do not have different timing considerations from any other swiss mergers and acquisitions transactions except that the securing of third party financing may require additional time dissenting shareholders rights what rights do shareholders have to dissent or object to a going private transaction how do acquirers address the risks associated with shareholder dissent going private transactions in switzerland are typically effected through a public tender offer which is followed by a squeeze out of any remaining minority shareholders there are basically two alternate routes for squeezing out minority shareholders of a swiss company listed on a stock exchange in switzerland upon completion of a public tender offer according to the fmia the bidder in a public tender offer may squeeze out the remaining minority shareholders of the target company if such bidder holds more than 98 per cent of the voting rights in the target company in such a case the bidder may apply for a court decision cancelling the remaining equity securities of the target the minority shareholders are entitled to receive the tender offer consideration for the cancelled shares the request to the court must be made within three months of the end of the additional acceptance period for the public tender offer see question 5 alternatively the sma provides for the possibility to squeeze out the minority shareholders by virtue of a squeeze out merger if at least 90 per cent of the shareholders entitled to vote in the absorbed company s ie the target s shareholders meeting agree to such a merger the squeezed out minority shareholders can be forced to accept cash or other kinds of assets in exchange for their shares in the target although the aforementioned thresholds may appear high they are frequently reached in practice if a public tender offer has been successful and the consideration that has been offered is attractive in case of a statutory squeeze out pursuant to the fmia the minority shareholders have the right to adhere to the court procedure and bring forward their arguments however they almost never do so owing to the very limited grounds that can be asserted in such procedure importantly the court has no power to reconsider the tender offer consideration in a squeeze out in accordance with the fmia in contrast the minority shareholders in a squeeze out merger pursuant to the sma have appraisal rights and may challenge the merger resolution arguing that the consideration received in exchange for their shares is not adequate the squeezed out minority shareholders may in such circumstances bring an action within two months of the publication of the merger resolution however such action does not hinder the legal effectiveness of the merger also because of the restrictive case law of the swiss federal supreme court the risk of a successful challenge is rather low if the squeeze out merger is carried out within a short period of time of a public tender offer purchase agreements what notable purchase agreement provisions are specific to private equity transactions sale and purchase agreements in buyout deals and investment agreements in venture and growth capital deals usually contain a comprehensive catalogue of representations and warranties including with regard to title organisation financial statements tax intellectual property employees and social security real estate material contracts and absence of litigation this catalogue is usually reduced in the case of mbos since the buyers have been involved in the management of the target or have profound knowledge about the target or extensive access to the management or both sale and purchase agreements usually also contain specific indemnities including full indemnities with respect to taxes or other special risks identified during the due diligence process in the case of staggered payment of the purchase price in the context of a buyout transaction because of the often thin capitalisation of the purchasing vehicle the seller will usually require a bank guarantee from the purchaser or special undertakings or a guarantee from the parent company in case of venture capital transactions or if the target company continues to have several shareholders upon completion of a buyout transaction the acquirers and any continuing shareholders regularly conclude a shareholders agreement alongside with the purchase or investment agreement see question 13 for key provisions included in such shareholders agreements participation of target company management how can management of the target company participate in a going private transaction what are the principal executive compensation issues are there timing considerations for when a private equity buyer should discuss management participation following the completion of a going private transaction there are two types of equity based incentives participation of the management from the outset mbo or stock option plans providing for a successive participation which may be implemented at any time the federal act on the taxation of employee equity incentive plans which became effective in 2013 and its implementing ordinance are noteworthy in this context while these rules did not fundamentally change the taxation rules previously developed by the practice of the cantonal tax authorities they clarify certain issues that had given rise to varying cantonal practices and provide for additional reporting duties for swiss employers who have employees participating in employee equity incentive plans it is thus important to review any existing tax rulings that had been sought prior to 2013 and to ensure that appropriate reporting procedures have been set up other benefits in the form of remuneration bonuses and further compensation are usually granted through employment agreements although there are no specific timing considerations regarding the determination of management participations any management incentive is however susceptible to creating conflicts of interest in the context of a going private transaction since the management is bound by fiduciary duties and has a duty to act in the best interest of the company accordingly in case of a public tender offer the board report shall disclose any arrangements between the bidder and the board or management of the target company as well as the measures that will be taken in order to avoid any adverse effects of the conflict of interest on the shareholders in case of a merger the merger agreement shall also disclose any advantage granted to the management as regards companies in the financial industry consideration must also be given to the remuneration circular of finma which has been revised and entered into force on 1 july 2017 that sets minimum standards for remuneration schemes in banks insurance companies and other financial institutions meeting certain financial thresholds putting particular emphasis on the sustainability of remuneration practices especially regarding variable remuneration and the prevention of incentive distortions as well as the new ordinance against excessive remuneration see question 2 tax issues what are some of the basic tax issues involved in private equity transactions give details regarding the tax status of a target deductibility of interest based on the form of financing and tax issues related to executive compensation can share acquisitions be classified as asset acquisitions for tax purposes taxes are levied at three different levels in switzerland federal cantonal and municipal the cantonal and municipal rates vary markedly across switzerland as cantons and municipalities are free to determine their tax rates this said the rates are generally below the average tax rates in europe and are reviewed on a yearly basis the ordinary effective corporate income tax rates currently range between approximately 11 per cent for the lowest canton and municipality and approximately 24 5 per cent for the highest special tax regimes such as the auxiliary principal and holding company regimes are in principle still available to date these special tax statuses as well as swiss finance branches are meant to be abolished in order to comply with international accepted standards however as the corporate tax reform act iii was rejected in a popular vote in february 2017 the abolition of these special tax regimes has been delayed a new tax reform is currently being discussed by the swiss parliament but is not expected to enter into force before 2020 despite some cantonal particularities the corporate tax reform which will be implemented in the foreseeable future can be generally described as follows companies that currently benefit from such special status will then forthwith be subject to regular taxation provided that for a limited period of five years after the abolition of such special regimes profits generated from assets and goodwill ie hidden reserves that so far benefited from the special status treatment will be taxed at a lower rate to maintain the attractiveness of the swiss tax system the corporate tax reform will be associated with a general significant decrease by the cantons in their effective corporate income tax rates eg in the canton of vaud as of 2019 the adoption of the patent box pursuant to which specific intangible property income may be subject to reduced taxation under certain circumstances a patent box already exists in the canton of nidwald and a super deduction for r d the special regimes currently still in place are as follows the auxiliary company regime allows companies to benefit from a significant tax exemption of foreign source income provided that the scope of the commercial activity carried out in switzerland is limited the principal company regime is in essence a lump sum exemption of the corporate income tax base granted in consideration of foreign permanent establishments it is available to companies that assume certain key regional functions on behalf of a multinational group and the holding company regime applies to holding structures and mainly consists in the exemption of corporate income tax at cantonal and municipal levels holding companies frequently also benefit from participation relief for income generated from dividends or capital gains from investments in other companies subject to their participations meeting certain conditions or both the participation relief is also available for ordinarily taxed swiss companies if the relevant conditions are met tax holidays namely full or partial exemptions from corporate income and capital taxes for newly established businesses may typically be granted to industrial companies the main criteria for such tax holidays to be granted are the number of new positions created and the investments made in the canton where the company has its corporate seat interest on debt is deductible from taxable profits regardless of whether the debt is subordinated this said there are limitations on the deductibility of interest in connection with shareholder or related party loans based on arm s length rules for interest rates and thin capitalisation rules see question 10 executive compensation generally qualifies as taxable income of the relevant recipient incentive compensation awarded in the form of cash shares or options is taxed at the time of award except for unlisted or restricted options that are taxed upon exercise capital gains realised by swiss resident individuals on privately held assets such as shares are generally exempt from income tax exceptions apply to real property share deals generally cannot be classified as asset acquisitions in switzerland and may trigger a transfer tax of up to 0 3 per cent of the consideration if a securities dealer pursuant to the swiss federal act on stamp duties is involved in the transaction asset deals usually involve vat on assets or services which is typically settled in a notification procedure the issuance of a company s share capital as well as additional contributions in cash or in kind into the company s equity are subject to swiss issuance stamp tax at the rate of 1 per cent however contributions against issuance of new shares not exceeding an aggregate amount of 1 million swiss francs and contributions that qualify as business restructuring are exempt a 35 per cent withholding tax is levied on profit distributions including any hidden dividends and distributions of liquidation proceeds by swiss companies this rate can be reduced or fully reclaimed if the dividend is paid to a swiss resident shareholder or if a double tax treaty applies see question 18 by contrast the repayment of contributions made by direct shareholders into the equity of a swiss resident company is not subject to swiss withholding tax pursuant to the practice of the swiss tax authorities the application of special tax regimes as well as the tax consequences of significant transactions involving swiss resident companies may be and typically are secured by written tax rulings in this connection it is worth pointing out that some tax rulings may be subject to spontaneous exchange of information following implementation of the oecd s base erosion and profit shifting project debt financing debt financing structures what types of debt are typically used to finance going private or private equity transactions what issues are raised by existing indebtedness of a potential target of a private equity transaction are there any financial assistance margin loan or other restrictions in your jurisdiction on the use of debt financing or granting of security interests private equity investors usually provide financing in the form of mezzanine debt or subordinated loans in the context of leveraged buyouts one will generally use senior and junior debt in the form of revolving and term credit facilities provided by financial institutions customarily banks providing the acquisition financing will require that the existing debt be refinanced and that the existing security be released and used as collateral to secure the acquisition financing the target can only provide security interest up to the amount of its freely disposable reserves the target s ability to grant upstream or cross stream guarantees or other types of security shall be included in the corporate purpose clause of the target s articles and must be approved by the shareholders see question 12 similarly a swiss federal supreme court decision in 2014 has set stricter requirements for group financial assistance in particular with regard to the definition of at arm s length upstream and cross stream loans loans that do not meet the relevant requirements reduce the target s ability to distribute dividends as reserves in the amount of the loan have to be created if distributions in excess of free equity have been made the company has a claim for repayment against the recipients of such distributions and the board of directors may become responsible to the company its shareholders and the creditors there are no statutory margin or corporate minimum capitalisation requirements in switzerland however de facto limitations result from the thin capitalisation rules applied by swiss tax authorities interest paid on amounts of debt exceeding certain thresholds may be requalified as a hidden dividend if paid to a shareholder or a related party of a shareholder in addition as per swiss tax law interest shall respect the principle of dealing at arm s length in this context the swiss federal tax administration annually publishes guidelines providing for minimum for loans to shareholders and maximum for loans from shareholders interest rates those rates are deemed to reflect an arm s length remuneration subject to proper evidence the tax authorities may accept interest rates deviating from the yearly guidelines interest paid on excessive debt or that is not in line with the minimum maximum rates would not be tax deductible and would be subject to 35 per cent withholding tax if a loan is granted by a third party but guaranteed by the parent company the thin capitalisation rules also apply debt and equity financing provisions what provisions relating to debt and equity financing are typically found in going private transaction purchase agreements what other documents typically set out the financing arrangements generally speaking there are no specific provisions related to the debt and equity financing in a merger agreement in contrast in the context of a public tender offer the offer prospectus must contain information regarding the financing of the offer as well as a statement from the independent review body that the bidder took all necessary measures so that the financing was available at closing certainty of funds however the bidder is not required to summarise the financing terms and conditions or to publish any financing documents in practice very short statements in the prospectus have become standard for instance it is considered sufficient if the prospectus states that 100 per cent of the offer will be financed through a bank facility this practice is justified by the fact that the review body must in particular assess the financing of the offer and the availability of funds before the offer is published where funds required for the offer are borrowed the review body examines in particular the creditworthiness of the lender and the contractual terms that enable the lender to withhold the disbursement of the funds fraudulent conveyance and other bankruptcy issues do private equity transactions involving leverage raise fraudulent conveyance or other bankruptcy issues how are these issues typically handled in a going private transaction fraudulent conveyance issues are rather exceptional in private equity transactions other than in rescue and turnaround deals in distressed situations however careful consideration has to be given to the structuring of the transaction and the terms of financing provided to a troubled company transactions within a suspect period of up to five years before declaration of insolvency may be challenged if the consideration received was in manifest disproportion to the insolvent debtor s own performance furthermore it must be ensured that the injected funds are not used to replace existing unsecured financing and that there are reasonable prospects of a successful restructuring of the distressed target company as otherwise loans granted to the target might be subordinated to the claims of other creditors in the event of insolvency in this context the more recent amendment of the swiss debt enforcement and bankruptcy act which became effective in 2014 brought about some noteworthy changes with respect to the ability of third parties to challenge a transaction and introduced certain mechanisms to facilitate restructuring measures for insolvent companies like upstream or cross stream loans upstream or cross stream guarantees or other security interests granted by the target in respect of obligations of a parent or an affiliate other than a subsidiary are also subject to various requirements and limitations see question 10 which call for adherence to the formalities applicable to distributions to shareholders and may limit the enforceability of such guarantee for the benefit of an affiliate similarly if the target company does not receive adequate consideration for entering into and maintaining such guarantee any sum received thereunder may be challenged if the target were to become insolvent shareholders agreements shareholders agreements and shareholder rights what are the key provisions in shareholders agreements entered into in connection with minority investments or investments made by two or more private equity firms are there any statutory or other legal protections for minority shareholders shareholders agreements customarily restrict the transferability of shares and provide for a combination of rights in respect of the sale of shares rights of first offer pre emption rights call and put option rights drag along and tag along rights sometimes safeguarded by share escrow arrangements or conditional assignments of shares further common key provisions include voting undertakings special quora and majorities veto rights for certain reserved board and shareholder matters information rights covenants regarding the company s business and management provisions regarding voluntary and mandatory conversion of preferred shares if applicable and board appointment rights in situations where it is important that no single party has control of the board the shareholders agreement may provide for a certain number of independent directors in venture capital financings the shareholders agreement commonly provides for dividend and liquidation preferences and anti dilution protections of the investor occasionally adherence to the shareholders agreement is safeguarded by indemnities for breach of contract or call options exercisable against a breaching party to the limited extent permissible under swiss law certain provisions of the shareholders agreement are generally also embedded in the constitutional documents of the company the swiss private equity and corporate finance association has published a model documentation for venture capital transactions involving institutional investors and is about to launch a simplified model documentation for smaller investments by business angels and similar seed stage investors pursuant to the principle of equal treatment of shareholders the board and the shareholders meeting must give equal treatment to all shareholders core statutory shareholder rights are the right to participate at shareholders meetings information and inspection rights and the right to receive a share of any dividends and liquidation proceeds shareholders also have a pro rata pre emptive right which may be restricted for certain important reasons to any newly issued shares or bonds which are convertible into equity shareholders representing more than 33 33 per cent of the voting rights can block a number of key resolutions for example qualified capital increases limitation of pre emptive rights or corporate reorganisations such as mergers acquisition and exit acquisitions of controlling stakes are there any legal requirements that may impact the ability of a private equity firm to acquire control of a public or private company the fmia provides for a mandatory offer regime a person or group of persons acting in concert and acquiring more than 33 33 per cent of the voting rights of a swiss company listed on a stock exchange in switzerland or of a foreign company if its primary listing is on a stock exchange in switzerland is required to make a public tender offer for all listed shares of that company unless such company s articles of association provide for an opting up up to 49 per cent or opting out of that requirement the majority of swiss listed companies approximately 70 per cent are subject neither to an opting out nor an opting up furthermore any person that reaches exceeds or falls below certain thresholds of voting rights 3 5 10 15 20 25 33 33 50 or 66 66 per cent must notify the company and the stock exchange to carry out a squeeze out merger or a statutory squeeze out in a going private transaction a bidder must hold at least 90 per cent 98 per cent in the case of a statutory squeeze out of the share capital and voting rights of the target see question 6 although voluntary bids in a public tender offer can be made subject to a minimum acceptance condition the acceptance threshold may normally not exceed two thirds of the target s issued shares if the bidder does not previously hold a significant stake exit strategies what are the key limitations on the ability of a private equity firm to sell its stake in a portfolio company or conduct an ipo of a portfolio company in connection with a sale of a portfolio company how do private equity firms typically address any post closing recourse for the benefit of a strategic or private equity buyer a private equity firm s ability to exit its investment very much depends on the terms of the investment documents and especially the shareholders agreement contractual arrangements regarding transfer restrictions and exit rights are particularly decisive while the right to coerce the other shareholders to a sale drag along or to unilaterally request an ipo can facilitate the exit of the private equity investor minimum rights of the common shareholders for example minimum valuation thresholds may have a limiting effect ultimately the terms agreed upon are a direct reflection of the parties negotiation leverage and primarily hinge on the size of the investment and the relative attractiveness of the target for an ipo on the six swiss exchange the target inter alia must have a certain minimum size the listing rules require an adequate free float of the company s securities at the time of listing generally at least 20 per cent of the issuer s outstanding securities in the same category must be in public ownership and the capitalisation of those securities must amount to at least 25 million swiss francs in general private equity firms are reluctant to assume liabilities surviving the exit will aim at a low cap on any indemnities and will seek to include a high de minimis deductible or threshold potential claims for indemnification of the buyer are sometimes secured by holding a portion of the purchase price in escrow for a certain period of time in addition we have seen an increased interest in swiss private equity deals to obtain insurance coverage for otherwise existing exposure under representations and warranties in particular where there is non alignment of involvement knowledge and pockets among numerous sellers portfolio company ipos what governance rights and other shareholders rights and restrictions typically survive an ipo what types of lock up restrictions typically apply in connection with an ipo what are common methods for private equity sponsors to dispose of their stock in a portfolio company following its ipo governance rights and other shareholders rights typically included in shareholders agreements normally do not survive an ipo as shareholders agreements usually terminate upon the ipo otherwise disclosure in the prospectus would be required the survival of board appointment or veto rights is highly unusual if the pre ipo capital structure includes various categories of shares it is customary to simplify the share structure before the ipo shareholders agreements generally anticipate this issue by providing for the mandatory conversion of preferred shares in the event of an ipo lock up provisions are usually subject to negotiation between the private equity firm and the incumbent shareholders typically the investor wants to anticipate the requirements of the underwriters and have the core shareholders agree to execute lock up and market stand off arrangements if and as requested by the underwriters already in the shareholders agreement as otherwise its right to unilaterally request an ipo could be put in question the underwriters generally require that the core shareholders management and founders private equity investors commit themselves to a lock up of between 180 days and 18 months under the six listing rules all shares of the same class must be listed there is no registration requirement for post ipo sales of shares in switzerland hence private equity sponsors are generally free to dispose of their shares in a portfolio company following its ipo subject to any lock up or other contractual arrangements notification duties also apply see question 14 strategies commonly seen are disposals pursuant to a dribble out trading plan in which the shares are sold piecemeal in the secondary market over the course of days or a few weeks depending on market conditions and the size of the stake or trades in a larger block of shares usually to a single buyer target companies and industries what types of companies or industries have typically been the targets of going private transactions has there been any change in focus in recent years do industry specific regulatory schemes limit the potential targets of private equity firms traditionally private equity firms have invested in a wide array of industries in switzerland reflecting the well diversified swiss economy in the recent past the sectors that have experienced most deal activity both in terms of number and value of transactions were pharmaceuticals and life sciences including biotech as well as information and communications technology in particular in venture capital financings it is noteworthy that the three largest capital rounds adc therapeutics mindmaze and cardiorentis and 19 of the top 20 start up financings in 2016 were all in these sectors additionally business and industrial products and services have also attracted a larger share of private equity investments there are no regulatory schemes specifically targeted at private equity firms however there are a number of regulated industries where certain limitations must be considered regulatory restrictions exist for instance in the banking securities trading insurance telecommunications and media sectors generally speaking the acquisition of control or a minority stake of a company holding a banking securities dealer insurance radio or television broadcasting licence is subject to prior notification to or authorisation by the competent regulatory body there are restrictions on permitted foreign ownership in a number of other regulated sectors such as aviation nuclear power generation and other areas of public infrastructure the direct or indirect acquisition of real estate for residential purposes in switzerland by persons abroad non swiss nationals and other foreign entities is subject to legal restrictions and may require a special authorisation special issues cross border transactions what are the issues unique to structuring and financing a cross border going private or private equity transaction there are no foreign exchange control or similar laws generally restricting investments or acquisitions in switzerland by persons or companies domiciled abroad regulatory restrictions exist with regard to certain industries see question 17 rules regarding public tender offers apply irrespective of whether the bidder is a swiss or a foreign company generally speaking any dividends and similar distributions cash or in kind made by a company to its shareholders are subject to a withholding tax of 35 per cent unless they come from paid in share capital or additional capital contributions from the shareholders foreign beneficiaries of dividends may be entitled to a partial or full reduction of the withholding tax in accordance with applicable double taxation treaties between switzerland and the beneficiary s country of tax residence or the agreement on the automatic exchange of information in tax matters between the eu and switzerland to the extent applicable both immigration as well as emigration mergers are admissible under swiss law if the laws of all involved jurisdictions so permit and the merger meets certain minimum criteria while the requirements stated in the law appear straightforward at face value the actual mechanics of a cross border merger prove quite cumbersome in practice consequently rather few transactions other than intragroup reorganisations structured as cross border mergers have been seen thus far except for large companies with substantial existing operations especially in regulated industries such as insurance club and group deals what are some of the key considerations when more than one private equity firm or one or more private equity firms and a strategic partner or other equity co investor is participating in a deal swiss law does not prevent or restrict the participation of two or more private equity firms in a club or a group deal in 2016 about two thirds of the private equity deals approximately 75 per cent of the total funds invested involving swiss target companies were syndicated from a practical perspective the participating investors generally lay down the terms and conditions governing their relationship in a formal shareholders agreement see question 13 this is advisable also because the group often inadvertently forms a simple partnership pursuant to swiss law which imposes default rules regarding governance representation rights profit allocation and other aspects of their relationship in respect of listed targets an additional issue to be considered is that firms partnering in a club deal will generally be regarded as acting in concert under the rules of the fmia as a result their consolidated stakes in the target will be relevant for the assessment as to whether notification and mandatory offer obligations are triggered see question 14 which may make the group susceptible to the actions of any one of the partner investors issues related to certainty of closing what are the key issues that arise between a seller and a private equity buyer related to certainty of closing how are these issues typically resolved certainty of closing is one of the key issues in any kind of mergers and acquisitions transaction the simultaneous signing and closing can simplify smaller transactions as it eliminates the risk of unforeseen events occurring during the period between signing and closing it may also reduce the complexity of the purchase agreement more often however the circumstances of the transaction call for a separation of signing and closing for example to obtain governmental approvals or third party consents or to call funds under equity commitments if there is a need for a separation of signing and closing the parties will require each other to fulfil certain conditions before the transaction closes at the same time it is customary for the transaction agreement to provide for a long stop date ie a date until which the transaction must close failing which the agreement will terminate and pre closing obligations such as covenants regarding the target s conduct of business or certain restructuring measures in view of the high costs incurred by both parties in the context of a transaction there is an increasing use of termination fees in the form of liquidated damages to alleviate the risk that the closing may not occur in public tender offers only limited conditions are permissible in the offer for example regulatory approvals or acceptance thresholds see question 14 a public tender offer may not be made subject to the obtaining of financing the bidder and the target can agree on a break fee provided that this does not result in coercing shareholders to accept the offer break fees must be disclosed in the offer documents as a general rule they should not substantially exceed the cost incurred by the bidder in connection with the offer update and trends update and trends have there been any recent developments or interesting trends relating to private equity transactions in your jurisdiction in the past year 2017 was another strong year for swiss m a despite a difficult international geopolitical context including the decision of the united kingdom to leave the european union and the tumultuous us presidential election as well as complicated domestic politics with the refusal by swiss voters to reform the corporate tax regimes switzerland witnessed the largest transaction in its history with the acquisition of syngenta by china national chemical corporation chemchina completed in 2017 the deal totalled over us 43 3 billion and was the largest outbound investment ever made by a chinese investor this megadeal is another illustration of the rise of chinese investors focus on opportunities in switzerland it follows the investment by the chinese conglomerate hna group in several swiss companies glencore s storage business dufry gategroup and swissport and the sale of the swiss bottle manufacturer sigg to the chinese group haers aside from the sale of syngenta to chemchina the most active sectors in switzerland in 2017 were pharmaceuticals and life sciences major deals in 2017 included the sale of the swiss biotech company actelion pharmaceuticals to the american firm johnson johnson for approximately us 30 billion and the acquisition of basel based capsugel by lonza for us 5 5 billion looking at private equity the low interest rates and strong currency continued to create a favourable situation for outbound deals from swiss private equity houses in line with the past two years a noteworthy deal was the acquisition of an 80 per cent stake in breitling by cvc capital partners venture capital investments in swiss start ups remained strong on the back of having almost tripled in the past five years to reach nearly 1 billion swiss francs more than 60 per cent of sme acquisitions in the first half of 2017 were cross border with over a third coming from north american and japanese companies this favourable environment for swiss start ups is likely to continue since it is supported by the swiss government which created innosuisse a swiss agency starting operation from early 2018 and aiming to promote innovation in switzerland similarly the swiss government recently amended banking regulations in order to lower the requirements for activities in the fintech sector with the goal of opening up innovation in the strategic banking sector

china s bond market sold off sharply this week as a slew of unexpectedly strong economic indicators prompted investors to ask if country s latest round of monetary easing may be drawing to a close the first sign of trouble came when chinese 10 year treasury futures for june delivery the most traded contract fell as much as 0 7 percent in initial deals on monday while they recovered slightly by tuesday afternoon they were still down 0 6 percent from friday s closing price the yield on benchmark 10 year government bonds has risen more than 7 basis points so far this week according to refinitiv data the latest stage of a rout that has pushed the yield up around 33 basis points since the end of march at 3 40 percent the 10 year yield has now retraced to levels last seen in december the latest selling pressure came after robust march credit data on friday raised hopes that china s economy may be starting to stabilise hit by a multi year financial deleveraging campaign and the trade war with the united states china s economic growth slowed to a near 30 year low of 6 6 percent in 2018 data due on wednesday is expected to show the weakest first quarter economic expansion in

measures in recent months are starting to kick in the stronger than expected credit expansion together with a rebound in the inflation reading reinforced market concerns that china may put easing monetary policy on hold said tommy xie head of greater china research at ocbc bank in singapore china s campaign to shore up slowing growth has seen it roll out billions of dollars worth of additional tax cuts and infrastructure spending this year that fiscal stimulus has been accompanied by five cuts to banks reserve requirement ratio rrr over the past year as the people s bank of china pboc worked to encourage lending and reduce borrowing costs for small and private firms economists polled by reuters before friday s credit data had expected three more rrr cuts this year in the current quarter and the next two in line with previous surveys many had pencilled in the next cut for this month though xie said after the strong lending data that there was no urgency to roll out more measures at the moment a summary of a quarterly meeting of the central bank s monetary policy committee published late on monday suggested a more cautious approach the pboc said it would maintain control of money supply floodgates a term absent from the previous quarter s statement when the central bank reiterates risk prevention the easing cycle of monetary policy might be ending said qu qing chief economist at jianghai securities the policy signal conveyed by the pboc meeting suggested that tightening is on the way and a near term reduction in reserve requirement ratio rrrs or interest rates is unlikely he said nomura said in a note on tuesday that there is much less room for easing and stimulus in china this time because of surging debt but added it would be too early to start withdrawing easing measures as a sustainable recovery is still in question still expectations of tightening pushed benchmark five year interest rate swaps irs up to a high of 3 25 percent on tuesday up from 3 12 percent at last week s close frances cheung head of macro strategy for asia at westpac in singapore also cautioned that any signs of a bottoming out in the economy were preliminary at this junction policymakers would not want to suffocate growth and would not like to see funding costs materially higher she said however some traders and market watchers said that liquidity conditions were likely to tighten in mid april as companies make first quarter tax payments boosting demand for cash and sucking funds out of the market such liquidity concerns earlier this month had prompted some analysts to predict an imminent cut to banks reserve requirements iris pang an economist at ing in hong kong said she maintains her expectation for an rrr cut this month as trade war uncertainties linger on there is a need to keep the fast yuan loan growth to help small private firms survive an rrr cut is needed to facilitate fast credit growth pang said in a note china may not need such fast ongoing credit injection into small private firms that said we believe that the central government will allow speedy credit growth to continue for some time at least until it is satisfied that the job market is stable investors looking for indications of a policy shift will be closely watching the pboc s actions when medium term lending facility mlf loans with a value of 366

address the supply shortage issue as a result platinum has seen its viewership more than double over the last week advertisement advertisement analysts are suggesting a rebalancing is due because of the sharp contrast in market surplus for platinum versus a shortfall in palladium the latest report by the world platinum investment council estimated a platinum surplus of 680 thousand ounces for this year while expecting to see a massive deficit of almost 1 million ounces for palladium as witnessed by investors palladium prices skyrocketed and doubled in price since august while platinum only started its rise in february and currently holding a nearly 500 per ounce discount to palladium or 35 both metals are used by carmakers to build catalytic converters and although palladium is the preferred option for gasoline engines while platinum for diesel it is estimated that roughly 5 of the required palladium will be replaced by platinum in the near future given the hefty discount between the two this would lead to a 14 increase in demand for platinum an impetus for price and investment in the sector however palladium prices have eased of late and staged a large painful decline the largest in three years a rebalancing takes time and is warranted by a persistent discount as witnessed in the early 1990s when cheaper palladium replaced the more expensive platinum only to reverse course in 1999 to 2002 when platinum substituted for the pricey palladium however platinum prices may remain subdued in the short term as recently signed projects like the 4 billion joint deal

by arminio fraga rio de janeiro the 1944 bretton woods conference established a multilateral framework for global cooperation on macroeconomic stability trade and development that has endured despite inevitable disruptions and adjustments for 75 years we should celebrate and praise these achievements and although this system of global economic governance is now under serious strain the bretton woods institutions together with more recently established international and regional forums will still have a meaningful long term role to play at the macro level bretton woods was based on fixed but adjustable exchange rates and relied on the newly created international monetary fund to monitor the consistency of national policies and provide financial support to countries facing external shocks the new world bank which began as the international bank for reconstruction and development provided support and advice on long term investment projects for development and reconstruction and another postwar institution the general agreement on tariffs and trade expanded and re established as the world trade organization wto in 1995 provided a framework for advancing free trade based on multilateral rules and dispute mechanisms this global arrangement allowed plenty of room for different national and regional approaches as long as policies did not lead to recurring balance of payments and inflation crises successful countries were able to accumulate more capital especially human and build institutions that made their gains more permanent in many ways the national strategies that paid off were convergence bets ones that aimed to narrow productivity gaps with more advanced economies alongside the economic advances many commentators saw clear signs of political convergence toward more liberal democratic regimes culminating in the fall of the berlin wall and the collapse of the soviet union american political scientist francis fukuyama summarized this narrative with his famous end of history thesis over time the bretton woods regime faced numerous challenges and crises the move away from explicit exchange rate parities to a system of more flexible currencies in the early 1970s marked the end of the original postwar monetary framework but formal and informal inflation targeting subsequently re anchored the system true many developing countries suffered far greater inflation and balance of payments problems than more mature economies but efforts to restructure their international debts and deal with high or hyperinflation were quite successful the world bank and regional development banks adapted to a world of ever greater capital needs by playing a more informational and catalytic role in areas such as infrastructure and institution building and despite slow or no progress at the wto level many bilateral and regional trade and investment arrangements were put in place today however global economic coordination has become more difficult if not outright impossible in some areas on trade despite the proliferation of regional arrangements there has been no meaningful multilateral progress since the uruguay round in 1994 on climate change and the environment a contemporary existential imperative recent negotiations have yielded limited results global public goods remain undersupplied in key areas such as security migration and global health and debt continues to grow in many countries often surpassing levels reached in the run up to the 2008 global financial crisis even some of the regional trade achievements of the past quarter century are now vulnerable such as the european union s single market assuming brexit happens the recently replaced north american free trade agreement latin america s mercosur bloc and the trans pacific partnership in parallel with these economic challenges there is widespread popular frustration at most countries inability to deal with the negative social implications of the current global development model in this context it is no surprise that newer forums such as the g7 g20 and the financial stability board have partly replaced the formal bretton woods institutions because decisions taken in international institutions often carry the force of law many countries increasingly prefer to meet in forums that issue mostly nonbinding statements a point often made by the late tommaso padoa schioppa a former european central bank board member and italian finance minister although not as strong as the original bretton woods design this evolving arrangement may indicate that the global system for economic governance is flexible and can adapt to changing circumstances but for the larger countries or blocs such as the united states the european union china and japan the formal bretton woods system is no longer central to macroeconomic stability trade or finance so what can we say about bretton woods in a world in transition first with the u s less dominant and less willing to provide global economic and financial leadership systemic instability is likely to increase as american economic historian charles kindleberger famously warned this typically occurs in transitional moments when a global hegemon is absent some signs of this are already visible in trade and regional tensions growing leverage and rising nationalism second bretton woods should now be seen to include not only the original institutions but also more recently established global forums and regional arrangements these mechanisms of cooperation constitute a realistic practical response to current challenges third one must ask whether developing countries will continue trying to converge with more advanced economies and whether the expanded bretton woods family of institutions can remain meaningful stewards of global progress my answers tend toward yes to both if one takes a long term view developing countries will aim to emulate the earlier successes of the asian tigers and eastern europe and countries will prefer dialogue and cooperation to the failures of those such as venezuela and north korea that opted out of the global system lastly this hopeful vision may now be under threat from the disturbing shift toward illiberal and populist political regimes around the world but history shows that liberal politics and economic policies have undoubtedly delivered more progress and peace than any other system seventy five years ago economic policymakers gathered at bretton woods to create a new financial order for the postwar world today their successors can still draw on some of these achievements in designing a global economic governance system for the 21 century this article was adapted from a submission to the bretton woods 75

article to print this article all you need is to be registered or login on mondaq com in a letter dated march 19 2019 addressed to the leadership of the national assembly and read at plenary on the floor of the senate on tuesday april 2 2019 president muhammadu buhari declined assent to eight bills earlier passed by the federal parliament one of which was the national housing fund establishment act 2018 the new nhf act predicating this decision on his powers under section 58 4 of the constitution of the federal republic of nigeria 1999 as amended the president specifically attributed his decline to give assent to the new nhf act to the various levies it imposes on nigerians and business entities which as have been argued by relevant industry stakeholders would have negative impact on nigerian workers and also be disruptive and punitive to industries and other sectors of the nigerian economy if allowed to take effect the new nhf act was passed by both chambers of the national assembly to repeal and replace the national housing fund act 1992 the 1992 act 1 this article reviews the controversial provisions of the new nhf act with respect to the statutory contributions required to be made to the national housing fund the fund as well as the mandatory investment required to be made in the fund by banks insurance companies pension funds and cement manufacturing companies importers for the purpose of growing the fund analysis is also made of the negative socio economic impacts which the forceful diversion of funds from the affected individuals and corporates to the fund would likely have on the larger economy from a comparative analysis of the new nhf act to the 1992 act and an evaluation of the lackluster performance of the fund since inception in 1992 to an overview of the moribund mortgage sector in nigeria it is submitted that the fund needs to be grown and the mortgage sector needs to be deepened through an inclusive and incentivizing legal framework in order to successfully build nigeria s mortgage market without causing harm to the other equally vital sectors of the economy it is recommended besides the other suggested policy reform initiatives that the new nhf act be returned to the national assembly for a new round of legislative action geared towards addressing its identified contentious provisions historical objective of the fund the fund was established under the 1992 act purposely to facilitate mobilisation of fund for the provision of houses for nigerians at affordable prices ensure constant supply of loans to nigerians for building purchasing and improvement of residential houses provide incentives for the capital market to invest in property development encourage the development of specific programmes that would ensure effective financing of housing development in particular low cost housing for low income workers provide proper policy control over the allocation of resources and funds between the housing sector and other sectors of the nigerian economy and provide long term loans to mortgage institutions for on lending to contributors to the fund whilst the above aims and objectives of the fund have been retained in the new nhf act the primary purpose of the re enactment was to provide for additional sources of funding for effective financing of housing development in nigeria 2 the fund the statutory sources of contributions to the fund as well as investments in same by affected entities are as follows a contributions by nigerians both in the public and private sectors the new nhf act provides that 2 5 of the monthly income of an employee earning the national minimum wage3 and above either in the public or private sector shall be contributed to the fund4 same rate of contribution is prescribed for a self employed person with equivalent monthly income5 employers of labour are required to deduct at source the prescribed rate of contribution from the monthly salaries of qualifying employees6 and remit same to the federal mortgage bank of nigeria the fmb not later than one month from the date of deduction7 the prescribed contributions by self employed persons are equally required to be remitted to the fmb personally by the affected persons within the same time frame allowed for employers of labour8 the contributions to the fund by the targeted nigerians shall attract an interest of two percent 2 per annum or any other interest rate as may be determined by the fmb9 it should be noted that under the 1992 act self employed persons are not covered and that the interest payable on contributions to the fund by nigerian employees is four percent 4 this is significantly higher than the 2 rate provided in the new nhf act also the contribution of 2 5 of monthly income under the 1992 act is applicable only to workers earning an income of three thousand naira n3 000 and above while the new nhf act is expected to cover workers earning the minimum wage or its equivalent and above b investment in the fund by banks commercial merchant commercial and merchant banks are required by the new nhf act to invest a minimum of ten percent 10 of their profit before tax pbt in the fund at an interest rate of one percent 1 above the interest rate payable on current accounts by banks10 the 10 of pbt to be contributed by banks is required to be collected at the end of every year by the central bank of nigeria cbn for onward remittance to the fmb in the prescribed manner for investment in the fund11 the new nhf act prohibits failure of any bank to make available to the cbn at the end of a year the stipulated contribution for investment in the fund12 and empowers the cbn to apply sanction on any erring bank which may include cancellation of the operating licence of the bank13 we note that the proposed statutory contribution by banks is a clear departure from what is currently applicable under the 1992 act banks are only required to invest in the fund 10 of their loans and advances at an interest rate of 1 above the interest rate payable on current accounts by banks also worthy of note is the fact that no sanction is contained in the 1992 act in respect of failure of a bank to comply with the provisions on contribution to the fund c investment in the fund by insurance companies registered under the insurance act similar to the prescribed investment by banks every registered insurance company is required by the new nhf act to invest a minimum of 10 of its pbt in the fund at an interest rate not exceeding 1 above the interest rate payable on current accounts by banks14 the stipulated investment by an insurance company shall not be affected by any provisions contained in the insurance act cap i17 lfn 2004 or relating to investment of insurance companies in real property15 the new nhf act gives the insurance industry regulator national insurance commission naicom the duty to collect at the end of every year the 10 of pbt required to be contributed by insurance companies16 for onward remittance to the fmb in the prescribed manner for investment in the fund17 failure of any insurance company to make available to naicom at the end of a year the stipulated contribution for investment in the fund is equally stated to be an offence18 for which sanction including cancellation of the operating licence of the erring insurance company may be applied by naicom through the commissioner for insurance19 worthy of note is the fact that under the 1992 act insurance companies are only required to invest a minimum of 20 of their non life funds and 40 of their life funds in real property development of which not less than 50 shall be paid into the fund through the fmb at an interest rate not exceeding 4 also we note that save for application of sanction on erring insurance companies naicom plays no role under the 1992 act with respect to the collection and onward transmission to fmb the contribution by insurance companies for investment in the fund in other words under the extant regime the fmb determines the contribution by insurance companies for the purposes of investment in the fund and issue a demand notice to this effect after a careful examination of the audited annual accounts of each insurance company d investment in the fund by pension fund administrators every registered pension fund administrator pfa is mandated by the new nhf act to invest a minimum of 10 of its pbt in the fund at an interest rate not exceeding 1 above the interest rate payable on current accounts by banks20 the required investment by a pfa shall not be affected by any provision contained in the pension reform act 2014 relating to investment by pfas in real estate development21 the new nhf act gives to the national pension commission pencom the duty to collect from pfas at the end of every year22 for onward remittance to the fmb in the prescribed manner the required contribution to be made for the purposes of investment in the fund23 failure of any pfa to make available to pencom for onward remittance to fmb the required contribution for investment in the fund as prescribed is prohibited24 the new nhf act empowers pencom to apply sanction on any erring pfa which may include cancellation of the operating licence of the affected pfa25 notably pension funds were not included in the resources of the fund under the 1992 act the national insurance trust fund the old pension administrator in nigeria and precursor to the pfas was not under any mandate to invest the assets under management in the fund e financial contributions by the federal government for long term housing loans as contained in the 1992 act the new nhf act also provides that the federal government fg may make any grant of money to the fund as it may determine or deem necessary26 specifically the fg is required to make adequate financial contributions to the fund for the purpose of granting long term loans and advances for housing development in nigeria27 f sustainable development levy on locally produced or imported cement the new nhf act imposes a fresh tax called sustainable development levy the levy on the production and importation of cement in nigeria28 the levy is to be paid and credited into the fund29 and is calculated at the rate of 2 5 ex factory price before transportation cost for each bag of 50kg or its equivalent in bulk30 the duty to assess and collect the levy is conferred on the federal inland revenue service firs 31 under the new nhf act the firs is required to remit the levy collected to the fmb in the prescribed form 32 after proper assessment of the levy due to be paid by a manufacturing company or importer in a year the firs is to issue a notice of the assessment to the affected manufacturer importer following which the levy shall become payable within sixty 60 days 33 where the levy is not paid within the specified period the firs is required to serve on the affected manufacturing company or importer a demand notice for the unpaid levy plus a sum which is equal to 2 of the levy as penalty 34 any manufacturing company or importer that fails to pay the levy imposed within two 2 months of the service of the demand notice commits an offence and liable on conviction in the federal high court to a fine not less than one hundred million naira n100m as stipulated in the new nhf act35 in addition to this a chief executive officer ceo director or officer purporting to act in the capacity of the company importer shall be liable upon prosecution and conviction to a fine of ten million naira n10m or imprisonment for a term of three years or both36 unless it is proven that the act or omission constituting the offence took place without the knowledge consent or connivance of the ceo director or officer37 this is a new development as no tax was imposed on cement manufacturing companies and importers under the 1992 act the levy is thus part of the additional sources of funding created by the new nhf act to boost effective financing of housing development in nigeria comments generally the thrust of the new nhf act is well understood given the fact that the housing sector requires adequate funding to support a robust mortgage system for the provision of affordable homes for nigerians according to data released by the nigerian bureau of statistics nigeria s housing deficit stood at 17 million units as at 2012 today the housing gap continues to widen rapidly with nigeria s burgeoning population currently estimated at 200 million people coupled with low access to housing finance particularly among low and middle income earners and operators in the informal sector of the economy recent reports underpin the country s low rate of access to affordable homes nigeria reportedly has only 25 rate of home ownership compared to 84 in indonesia 73 in kenya and 56 in south africa38 if the current rate of population growth is sustained it is estimated that about us 363 billion would be needed to curb nigeria s current housing deficit of about 20 million units39 therefore the urgent need for policies and regulations geared at deepening the mortgage market is quite understood mortgage finance in nigeria currently stands at 0 58 of gross domestic product gdp 40 this is abysmally low compared to 80 in the united kingdom 77 in the united states of america and 31 in south africa41 in spite of the above and the good intention reflected in the main objective of the new nhf act the legislation as passed by the national assembly contains provisions which would make its implementation difficult and which apparently have potentially counterproductive effects on the housing sector financial market and the nigerian economy at large firstly the 2 5 contribution mandated for qualified individuals amounts to a regressive tax on the people s income for instance a worker placed on the soon to be implemented monthly minimum wage of n30 000 is required to contribute the sum of n750 monthly to the fund while a middle class worker earning n300 000 monthly is required to contribute a sum of n7 500 economists and tax analysts have argued that this is not progressive as it imposes more tax on low income earners than the average and high income earners when the contributions are expressed as a percentage of the income tax paye of the respective workers secondly the imposition on commercial and merchant banks insurance companies and pfas to invest 10 of their pbt in the fund will further reduce the amount of credit available from banks to other sectors of the economy such as loans to micro small and medium enterprises msmes as well as cut the returns on investment to shareholders of banks insurance companies and pfas by forcefully diverting investible funds from more profitable ventures such as capital market instruments trade finance project finance and consumer lending etc at a meager interest rate of 1 above the interest rate payable on current accounts by banks the new nhf act if operational will shrink projected revenues and profit margin of banks insurance companies and pfas as well as trigger further liquidity crisis in the financial market this is not desirable at this time when banks are struggling to return to stability and profitability and insurance companies barely struggling to stay afloat amidst economic recession and stagnancy also given nigeria s past bitter experiences with provident funds and the sensitivity and fragility of pension fund assets vis à vis the poor performance of the fund since its establishment in 1992 caution is advised in the way and manner the growing pension funds in the country is invested thirdly there are no provisions as to the duration of the investment which banks insurance companies and pfas are to make in the fund the new nhf act is silent on whether the capital invested by the affected financial institutions can be withdrawn after a particular period and the mode of such withdrawal it is therefore not clear if a bank insurance company or pfa facing imminent liquidity challenge could resort to making withdrawal out of its stake in the fund fourthly the levy of 2 5 ex factory price before transportation cost for each bag of 50kg or its equivalent in bulk will eventually be passed on to consumers by way of increase in price of a bag of cement a clear unintended consequence of this is that the cost of building a house will further go up thereby defeating the original purpose of making affordable housing available to nigerians through the fund it therefore appears that the levy as proposed in the new nhf act will be counterproductive on implementation fifthly the penalty regime in the new nhf act is not commensurate with the offences created therein the amount of fines prescribed and the terms of imprisonment stipulated for persons individuals and corporates found guilty of contravening any of the provisions in the new nhf act are too heavy and stringent and could cripple the affected sectors rather than boosting the housing sector and the economy the excessive and disproportionate penalties would act as disincentive to investment and further stifle the ease of doing business in nigeria in conclusion whilst we support the need to deepen the mortgage market in nigeria the fund should not be grown at the expense of the other vital sectors of the economy as analyzed in our opinion the first step to take in boosting the fund should be a review of its operation since inception to determine its strength weakness opportunity and threat swot analysis with a view to charting the right path and policy direction for the growth and efficient application of the fund to avoid the likely negative multiplier effects on the economy it is strongly recommended that the new nhf act be subjected to legislative overhaul through wide consultations with relevant stakeholders including the bankers committee nigerian insurers association nia pension fund operators association of nigeria penop manufacturers association of nigeria man nigeria employers consultative association neca nigerian economic summit group nesg labour unions civil society groups and the organized private sector the recommended review should be done and the concerns raised addressed after which the president s assent can again be sought to the new nhf act footnotes 1 the national housing fund establishment bill 2018 was passed in july 2018 by the house of representatives and received concurrent passage by the senate on february 18 2019 as an act of the national assembly 2 see the explanatory memorandum to the new nhf act 3 the current national minimum wage is eighteen thousand naira n18 000 under the national minimum wage amendment act 2011 this figure has been increased to thirty thousand naira n30 000 in the national minimum wage amendment bill 2018 recently passed by the national

operator good morning my name is gigi and i will be your conference facilitator today at this time i would like to welcome everyone to the blackrock incorporated first quarter 2019 earnings teleconference our host for today s call will be chairman and chief executive officer laurence d fink chief financial officer gary s shedlin president robert s kapito and general counsel christopher j meade all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise after the speakers remarks there will be a question and answer period operator instructions thank you mr meade you may begin your conference christopher j meade general counsel good morning everyone i m chris meade the general counsel of blackrock before we begin i d like to remind you that during the course of this call we may make a number of forward looking statements we call your attention to the fact that blackrock s actual results may of course differ from these statements as you know blackrock has filed reports with the sec which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of blackrock to differ materially from what we see today blackrock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward looking statements so with that i ll turn it over to gary gary s shedlin chief financial officer thanks chris and good morning everyone it s my pleasure to present results for the first quarter of 2019 before i turn it over to larry to offer his comments i ll review our financial performance and business results while our earnings release discloses both gaap and as adjusted financial results i will be focusing primarily on our as adjusted results blackrock generated 65 billion of total net inflows in the first quarter or 4 annualized organic asset growth reflecting our differentiated solutions based approach to addressing client needs our first quarter results reflect the benefits of our integrated business model and the investments we ve made to diversify our investment platform enhance our risk management and technology capabilities and build local expertise at global scale first quarter revenue of 3 3 billion was 7 lower than a year ago reflecting the impact of fourth quarter equity market declines on our 2019 base fee entry rate operating income of 1 2 billion was down 11 compared to a year ago while earnings per share of 6 61 was down 1 as lower operating income and a higher effective tax rate were partially offset by higher non operating income and a lower share count in the current quarter non operating results for the quarter reflected 135 million of net investment income driven by higher marks on our unhedged seed capital investments and the revaluation of certain strategic minority investments our as adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 22 and included a 22 million discrete tax benefit related to stock based compensation awards that vested during the quarter we continue to estimate that 24 is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2019 though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of non recurring or discrete items and issuance of additional guidance on tax legislation first quarter base fees of 2 8 billion were down 5 year over year primarily due to the negative impact of non us equity markets and foreign exchange on average aum and an associated mix change favoring lower fee fixed income assets compared to a year ago on a constant currency basis base fees were down 3 year over year sequentially base fees were up 1 or 3 after adjusting for the impact of a lower day count in the first quarter driven by market appreciation organic base fee growth and higher securities lending revenue on an equivalent day count basis blackrock s fee rate increased from 18 basis points in the fourth quarter to 18 2 basis points for the first quarter of 2019 performance fees of 26 million decreased meaningfully from a year ago reflecting lower revenue from liquid alternatives and long only equity products as noted on our fourth quarter earnings call investment under performance entering the first quarter resulted in certain quarterly locking funds falling below high watermarks we saw improved performance in many of these funds during the last three months which better positions us for the remainder of the year continued momentum in institutional aladdin resulted in 11 year over year growth in quarterly technology services revenue and 17 year over year growth on a trailing 12 month basis as larry will discuss in more detail overall demand remains strong for our full range of technology solutions advisory and other revenue of 49 million was down 22 million year over year primarily reflecting lower earnings attributable to an equity method investment on a sequential basis the decline reflected lower fees from advisory and transition management assignments total expense decreased 4 year over year primarily due to lower compensation and volume related expense employee compensation and benefit expense was down 54 million or 5 year over year reflecting lower incentive compensation driven in part by lower operating income sequentially compensation and benefit expense was up 5 primarily reflecting higher seasonal payroll taxes and an increase in issuance and mark to market of deferred compensation partially offset by lower incentive compensation driven in part by lower performance fees direct fund expense was down 19 million or 7 year over year primarily reflecting the negative impact of equity and foreign exchange markets on average index aum g a expense was up 1 year over year reflecting higher technology expense partially offset by the impact of product launch costs in the first quarter of 2018 sequentially g a expense decreased 61 million reflecting seasonally lower marketing and promotional expense lower professional services expense and 31 million of contingent consideration fair value adjustments related to prior acquisitions recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018 our first quarter as adjusted operating margin of 41 9 was down 220 basis points from a year ago reflecting the negative impact of markets and foreign exchange on quarterly base fees and a strategic decision to continue investing responsibly for the long term while we are always margin aware we have deep conviction in the stability of our business model which allows us to better navigate the financial challenges associated with short term market volatility since year end beta has been constructive organic growth has improved and a number of our hedge funds are back above high watermarks all of which contributed to 9 growth in our assets under management and position us well for the second quarter we remain focused on funding our most critical strategic initiatives to optimize organic growth and significantly advance two of these strategic initiatives technology and illiquid alternatives during the first quarter we are confident these investments will enhance outcomes for clients and generate long term value for shareholders last month we announced the binding offer and exclusive agreement to acquire efront the world s leading end to end alternative investment management software and solutions provider as clients increasingly add to their alternatives allocations the ability to seamlessly manage portfolios and risk across public and private asset classes on the single platform will be critical the combination of efront with aladdin will set a new standard in investment and risk management technology and reinforce aladdin s value proposition as the most comprehensive investment operating system in the world subject to the french works council process we expect the transaction to close in the second quarter we have also announced the first close of long term private capital ltpc is an innovative perpetual direct private equity fund designed to create value for the long term limit reinvestment risk and operate with lower volatility than comparable vehicles it s a crucial new component of blackrock s comprehensive alternative investment capabilities which now include hedge fund solutions real asset private credit and direct private equity ltpc is another example of blackrock s ability to assess the market organically develop our capabilities and deliver the products and solutions clients need most our capital management strategy has always been to first invest in our business and then return excess cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases as previously announced we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 5 to 3 30 per share of common stock and repurchased 1 6 billion worth of common shares in the first quarter including 1 3 billion repurchased in a private transaction at approximately 413 per share we have now completed our targeted level of share repurchases for 2019 but will remain opportunistic should relative valuation opportunities arise blackrock is having deeper and more strategic conversations with a greater number of clients than ever before and our first quarter results highlight the value of the investments we ve made to assemble the industry s broadest offering of active and index investment strategies coupled with technology and portfolio construction tools the diversity of our platform positions us to serve clients needs in a variety of market environments and enables us to generate consistent and differentiated organic growth quarterly net inflows of 65 billion were positive across active and index strategies as well as in our cash management business blackrock s institutional franchise generated 29 billion of net inflows representing 4 annualized organic asset growth flows were led by momentum in fixed income reflecting continued demand for liability driven investment solutions and our top performing active strategies institutional active net inflows of 15 billion were driven by 13 billion of active fixed income flows reflecting strong activity in our insurance client channel momentum in our illiquid alternatives franchise continued into 2019 record quarterly net inflows of 6 billion were led by infrastructure real estate private credit and the previously mentioned first close of ltpc in addition we have approximately 22 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of strategies representing a significant source of future base and performance fees ishares net inflows of 31 billion reflect a global client demand for a diverse range of strategies including core fixed income factor and sustainable etfs we saw record quarterly flows in fixed income ishares as clients continue to adopt etfs for corporate emerging market and high yield bond exposures approximately 40 of ishares flows in the quarter were in higher fee products outside of the core resulting in annualized organic base fee growth of 7 in line with organic asset growth in the quarter retail net outflows of 1 billion reflected industry pressures in international equities and world allocation strategies partially offset by strength in blackrock s municipal fixed income franchise and event driven liquid alternative funds finally blackrock s cash management platform saw 6 billion of net inflows as we continue to grow our cash business leverage scale for clients and delivered innovative distribution and risk management solutions through a combination of cachematrix and aladdin in summary our first quarter results highlight the breadth of our investment strategies coupled with our industry leading technology and portfolio construction capabilities and an ability to service clients on a global scale while we will never be immune to beta headwinds and the impact those headwinds can have on our short term financial results we intend to remain focused on investing in our highest growth priorities and exercising prudent expense discipline to ensure we meet the critical needs of clients and shareholders alike our goal remains to deliver consistent and differentiated organic growth in the most efficient way possible with that i ll turn it over to larry laurence d fink chairman and chief executive officer thank you gary and good morning everyone and thank you for joining blackrock s first quarter call blackrock s broad investment platform generated 65 billion of total net inflows in the first quarter representing 4 organic asset growth and 3 organic base fee growth the breadth of our investment capabilities spanning index alphaseeking alternatives and cash coupled with our industry leading technology and portfolio construction capabilities allowed us to generate strong flows and importantly meeting the evolving needs of our global clients blackrock s commitment to staying ahead of our client needs continues to resonate and we are deepening those relationships with our clients throughout the world more than ever before following significant declines in equity markets in the fourth quarter of last year investors reversed their risk tolerance at the start of 2019 us markets have regained their losses and both developed and emerging market equities although not fully recovering around about 10 year to date high yield fixed income the most challenged category last year is now seeing inflows improved investor sentiment has been driven in part by easing concerns around the global monetary policy and trade the federal reserve and other central banks are emphasizing a more patient approach to monetary policy quieting investment investors fears of tightening monetary policy and conditions late in our cycle and investor focus on trade tensions have declined relative to last year as negotiations between the united states and china progresses despite strong market performance year to date average market levels are still lower than they are a year ago and investor optimism remains fragile as geopolitical risks in global growth concerns persist while recent developments in china should increase global capital investment spending notably weak eurozone pmi data it signals further slowdown in europe and the uk although a hard brexit has been avoided in the near term those issues remain unresolved in this global context clients are continuing to turn to blackrock our focus has always been and always will be to listen to our clients goals and challenges so we could better anticipate and evolve ahead of our clients needs today clients are increasingly asking for more transparency they are searching for more value and most importantly like we re seeing in so many other industries clients are looking for more convenience and they want sustainable long term returns but they also want everyone focusing on their outcomes and these are the major issues that are impacting i would say the asset management industry today i wrote in my letter to shareholders this year about the need for more dialogue around long term outcomes as we ve done throughout our history blackrock continues to invest in our investment platform and our technology to deliver the outcomes our clients are looking for every decision we make is centered on enhancing our ability to partner with our clients in two months we will cross the 10 year anniversary of blackrock s announcement to acquire barclays global investors over the last 10 years our strategy behind the merger has resonated being agnostic across alpha and index strategies allows us to have a different voice a differentiating voice for our clients much has changed for our industry and for blackrock in this past decade rather than looking for individual products clients are increasingly seeking a partner to help them create tailored portfolios it s only by delivering that to clients that we can drive growth and create long term value for our shareholders and that is why we continue to evolve our platform and our organization today blackrock s strategy for delivering long term growth is centered on three main drivers capturing the shift from product selection to portfolio construction leading in technology across the asset management value chain and gaining global and local expertise in high future growth markets around the world we do all of this with the ultimate goal again of enhancing our clients experience and deepening our client relationships globally last year we launched the client portfolio solutions team to formally bring together the strategic advantages that enable us to create a whole portfolio solution for both institutional and wealth clients leveraging blackrock s differentiated research our investment and technology capabilities in portfolio construction client portfolio solutions generated more than 11 billion of net inflows in the first quarter and continues to gain strong momentum we are expanding our capabilities across portfolio building blocks and investing in areas of highest client demands and etfs are one of those areas ishares generated 31 billion of net inflows in the first quarter and once again captured the number one market share of etf flows globally in europe as well as the high growth categories including fixed income etfs factor etfs and sustainable etfs this quarter flows reflects the diversity of our ishares platform by region in addition we saw 17 billion of net inflows in us ishares and we generated 15 billion of net inflows in european ishares which represented a 17 organic growth in higher fee ishares categories including fixed income factors and sustainable etf we generated a total of 38 billion of net inflows and core ishare generated 19 billion in the first quarter while these flows were partially offset by outflows from a handful of equity ishares which reflects the reversal of strong fourth quarter tax related inflows ishares continues to benefit from long term secular trends including the global shift to portfolio construction and to fee based wealth management financial advisors are increasingly adopting models to customize portfolio for clients in a simple and scalable way the use of models is driving demand for both etfs and high performing alpha strategies in addition to digital tools that help advisors better see where risks and fees are being allocated and blackrock is well positioned for that after more muted growth in 2018 we are seeing renewed demand for fixed income securities blackrock generated 80 billion of fixed income inflows across active and index products flows were led by increasing adaptation of fixed income etfs which generated 32 billion of net inflows across high yield emerging market bonds and treasuries non etf index fixed income flows of 29 billion were driven by strong demand for ldi strategies as clients immunize their portfolios and we saw diversified flows into our top performing active fixed income platform with net inflows of 18 billion across core fixed income municipal bonds and high yield strategies performance in our active fixed income strategies remain strong with 83 and 85 of assets above benchmark or peer median for the three year and five year period we are constantly innovating across our platform to meet client needs and delivering growth for shareholders for example in cash management where we generated 6 billion of inflows in the quarter we are leveraging our cachematrix technology to improve convenience and transparency for our clients we are also innovating on the types of cash management strategies we offer to clients and last week we launched a liquid environmentally aware fund or leaf as a prime money market fund with an environmentally focused investment strategy the fund will use 5 of its net revenues to purchase and retire carbon offsets and direct a portion of the proceeds to our conservation efforts increasingly clients want sustainable strategies that provide financial returns and target a measurable social or economic impact blackrock s goal is to make those strategies more accessible to more people beyond dedicated sustainable investment funds we re also integrating environmental social and government risk factors across all our investment processes we firmly believe business relevant sustainable data is useful for all of our portfolio managers and ultimately result in decision making that delivers better long term results for our investors and our clients with our continued focus on evolving ahead of clients needs we re also developing an innovative new private equity vehicle designed to meet institutional client needs for the long term high quality private company exposures blackrock long term private capital strategy ltpc offers institutions the opportunity to invest on the continuum between publicly traded equities and leveraged buyout style private equity the fund will have a perpetual structure and an active ownership approach designed to create value for the long term at the end of the first quarter ltpc secured 1 25 billion of capital commitments from cornerstone investments including ltpc blackrock had a record quarter in our illiquid alternative business with 6 billion of net inflows as client continue to search for yield and attractive risk adjusted returns we also deployed 2 billion of committed capital in the first quarter and have another 22 billion of remaining capital to deploy as we look to bridge the gap between public and private assets we also realize that clients benefit when alternative investments are evaluated inside a portfolio level risk management framework that is why we announced last week our exclusive agreement subject to conditions to acquire efront this acquisition will deepen blackrock s strength in two of our strategic growth areas our illiquid alternatives and technology and will enable portfolios that span traditional and alternative asset classes to be managed much more comprehensively technology is changing every aspect of the asset management landscape and blackrock s results milestones and continuum innovation are only possible because we have prioritized making technology essential to our entire business strong global momentum continues in our aladdin business driving 11 growth over year over year in our technology services revenues a number of new client wins in the first quarter including santander the first asset manager to use aladdin in markets such as brazil argentina spain portugal and momentum in investments we re making in technology will continue to drive our technology services revenues growth to the low to mid teens going forward blackrock s long term strategy is to provide technology across asset management value chain and we are expanding our technology platform beyond our core aladdin business to deepen our value proposition with clients and partners and generate direct technology revenues for the firm as the investment management ecosystem seeks deeper integration along investment lifecycles we are extending aladdin to our asset servicing providers to further unlock the network effects of aladdin platform earlier this month we announced a strategic alliance with bank of new york mellon to deliver an integrated data technology and asset management service capability to shared clients through provider aladdin by enabling access to investment management and servicing capabilities on one platform client will be able to further optimize and optimize their operating models and reduce operating expenses what are the biggest opportunities for aladdin going forward is to make the language of portfolio construction for wealth management wealth managers financial advisors individual investors aladdin wealth is now live with nine clients based in the us uk continental europe and asia we see tremendous opportunities for aladdin wealth to become the infrastructure of a wealth management landscape but more importantly it provides blackrock with an opportunity to deepen our value proposition and brand with wealth partners and their financial advisors accelerating trends including the movement toward portfolio solutions and a wider product usage a necessity of operating scale enhanced regulatory reporting are creating the need globally for a more comprehensive and a more flexible technology driven solution aladdin remains well positioned to capitalize on these trends as the industry leading whole portfolio investment operating system just as we continue to innovate and evolve our investment and technology business to meet our clients needs we re also evolving blackrock s leaders and we re evolving our organization to enhance client experiences with blackrock we made organizational leadership changes every few years because we firmly believe these changes bring great benefits to our clients to our shareholders and to our leaders themselves recent announcements are centered on bringing blackrock closer to our clients deepening our relationships with them and more efficiently and more effectively delivering all of blackrock s capabilities to our clients these changes help us maintain our entrepreneurial spirit by bringing in fresh ideas to different areas of the firm and further developing our leaders around the world i can say very proudly that i have never been more excited about blackrock s organization and our people than any time in our history we begin 2019 by maintaining our steadfast focus on client needs this will continue to position blackrock as the right partner for our clients and a leader in the growth areas of the future with that let me open it up for questions questions and answers operator operator instructions your first question comes from craig siegenthaler from credit suisse your line is now open laurence d fink chairman and chief executive officer hi craig craig siegenthaler credit suisse analyst hey good morning larry so we continue to see blackrock expand further in the tech sector here we saw this again in the first quarter the acquisition of efront my question is how will blackrock clients use this software technology and also more importantly how do you plan on monetizing this technology including potentially supporting your alternative fundraising effort laurence d fink chairman and chief executive officer so we look at technology in five business brands across blackrock and we re focused on every businesses actually we had a leadership retreat last week this past weekend and we spoke about how we have to work on technology in every business there s not a business at blackrock that should be untouched with technology technology has to be the component of shaping how we do business so we look at technology in five different areas we look at technology to deliver better alpha using more data sources we re using technology now as i spoke about in my prepared remarks creating technology for more convenient portfolio construction obviously we re using technology with more operational efficiencies aladdin provider is a good example throughout our history we re using more and more technology for risk management and now we re using technology to create more convenience with our clients by delivering better tools for distribution and so we re framing technology across all these businesses efront really is a great example of us using a technology to really help us in delivering two out of the three major long term strategies that we spoke about in my shareholder letter we speak about why technology has to be driving blackrock and why alternatives have to continue to drive the future of blackrock and efront helps us deliver in those two key categories the third one is china if i have to say a fourth one is retirement but those are two of the key characteristics of our forward growth strategy related to efront in itself it is going to be provided as a new revenue set component of aladdin and it is going to be an add on cost to our aladdin platform and so it will be integrated on top of the aladdin platform over time but it will be another sleeve and we re actually you know there were some overlaps with the clients and the remaining new clients that were part of efront so it allows us to have broader depth globally worldwide and so we look at this acquisition as another milestone of us really trying to build technology across all asset categories and we did cite that we had some weaknesses in alternative technology and aladdin and this really helps us accelerate the added sleeves of alternative technology on aladdin so this will be another revenue center for blackrock as a part of the aladdin platform craig siegenthaler credit suisse analyst thank you larry operator thank you our next question is from robert lee from kbw your line is now open robert lee kbw analyst great good morning larry good morning everyone thanks for taking my question maybe just flesh out a little bit on the alternatives platform obviously you spent in addition to the efront you spent a lot of time and energy some acquisitions organic growth can you maybe where do you feel like you stand with your alternatives platform in terms of do you feel like at this point you have most of the strategies covered and it s more about kind of scaling with subsequent funds or there s still places you feel like there s maybe holes ph you re looking to fill laurence d fink chairman and chief executive officer let me have gary start it off and i ll try to answer it if i need to gary s shedlin chief financial officer yeah rob i think we feel that we re very well situated on the illiquid platform at the moment obviously we ve got a range of products now that span kind of across the more major categories lptc firmly puts us in the direct private equity obviously we have a significant real estate business an infrastructure business a private credit business we have a variety of solutions oriented businesses whether it be fund of hedge funds fund of private equity and broader alternative solutions so i think we feel like we ve got a foot in every one of the high growth markets i think you know when we add it all up today we ve got about 65 plus billion in illiquid plus another 22 billion or so of committed capital to go so that gives us a fair amount of scale i think when you look at the individual businesses one could argue that individually they re not big enough and so that will come obviously with successor funds and continuing to develop continue to deliver the returns that our investors expect and so obviously as we do that successor funds will get bigger and we will continue to opportunistically look for tactical opportunities to create more scale in those businesses but as i think we ve been very very clear culture is incredibly important to us we re not really looking to buy out anybody we re really looking to buy in people who want to be a part of our very differentiated platform and we see those opportunities as we ve seen in the past with our new partners from tennenbaum or first reserve and others we ll do things that basically make sense not only for clients but also for our shareholders so bottom line is we ll continue to see what s out there and be opportunistic but we feel like we ve got a pretty good growth platform right now laurence d fink chairman and chief executive officer as you know rob we have been very systematic in how we have been approaching this it has not been what i would call it metamorphic by any means if you think about just our infrastructure platform we started really infrastructure in 2012 by lifting out a team of people we are over 20 billion now in infrastructure growing quite nicely we are raising a couple more funds so it s been very systematic and i think the same thing will be done over with ltpc over time that s going to continue to grow we actually have opportunities that continue to build that out we have real estate and so over time this is a growth area our first quarter was up 6 billion in growth that was a record quarter for us as gary suggested we have 20 billion or 22 billion of the drag of committed capital right now and that they will be put to work we look at this as a real opportunity and our clients are looking to us to be really focused on these type of opportunities so i am pretty constructive on where we are at this point in time robert s kapito president can i add one thing the other part that we are pretty excited about is that we have done some institutional surveys and it shows that the largest reallocation is going to be to the alternative space so we do need to have a wide product base to be able to satisfy our current clients needs but also you know that we are very important to the retail base and they want exposure to the alternatives area so we re also working very closely with our retail distribution partners to create the appropriate wrappers to put the alternatives that have the appropriate risk and reward for those clients that are looking for it so it s not just institutional investors it s also retail investors that are looking to us for some exposure in the alternative space robert lee kbw analyst okay thank you can i ask may be a tactical follow up question larry you mentioned there being some kind of reversal of the fourth quarter etf equity flows that were driven by tax reasons but broadly across the industry despite this big rebound in the market it kind of feels like demand for equities in general both index and active have been pretty muted is this really more just symptomatic of the people bifurcating their portfolios more going to alternatives than obviously better fixed income demand or is there something else going on underneath that business laurence d fink chairman and chief executive officer so on the question we saw strong rerisking for those were in cash that allocated back into fixed income we saw that predominantly a lot of investors were believing that interest rates are going to go higher central banks really continue to tighten and obviously the change in central bank forward forecast and their behaviors many investors were underinvested and put duration to work across the board as we have seen as rob kapito just mentioned we are seeing investors continue to barbell i think going more and more heavy into alternative spaces what the first quarter showed also that investors are still selling equity exposures as an industry there were major outflows again in overall global equities as an industry this is one of the reasons why i actually believe we are at a pivot point now where equity markets despite the rally can have much more upside because the amount of under investments investors have in equities they have not rerisked in equities in the first quarter and so to me we believe as you are starting to see renewed economic activity in the united states from the slow pace of the first quarter and we are moving closer to about a 2 5 economy in the second quarter we are seeing stronger economic signals out of china from all the fears we had in the third and fourth quarter so i would argue there is a high probability going forward that investors are going to begin to rerisk across the equity platforms and what we hear from investors and we see investors coming in every day seeing our leaders seeing rob seeing me and the biggest question is we are being asked continuously where should we put our money there is huge pools of money sitting in the sideline and many people now we are going to have the continued downdraft in the fourth quarter they thought interest rate is going to go higher a lot of as i said the bigger risk is that clients are under invested not over invested so we see more upside here especially in equities robert s kapito president so one thing on the tactical comment if you started last year with a 60 40 stock mix which is what most people have by the time you got to somewhere in october that number would have been 80 20 which is really too much risk so you saw a lot of tactical asset allocation changes to get their portfolios back to 60 40 which means you have to sell stock and buy bonds and at the same time the risk free rate during the year went from zero to 3 so bonds look pretty good coming out of cash so i think we saw that in november and december that added to the fuel for the first time being able to take a tax loss for a very long time but now in the first quarter that people are getting back to where they wanted to be i think the risk on trade is coming back into the marketplace and you see that reflected in where they are allocating their money tactically now operator thank you your next question comes from patrick davitt from autonomous research your line is now open patrick davitt autonomous research analyst hi good morning guys laurence d fink chairman and chief executive officer hi how are you patrick davitt autonomous research analyst i am well thanks you mentioned that the nine live aladdin for wealth clients could you update us where you think we are on the ramp up of noticeable incremental flow from those nine go lives update us on the pipeline of new go lives this year and are there any meaningful milestones you are looking to just see a more noticeable uptick in flows from that channel robert s kapito president so we re very optimistic on the aladdin for wealth because for the first time it gives a lot of the financial advisors the ability to look and test their clients portfolios to make sure that they are taking the right risk in them and so as they come on we are building it together they are asking can we do this can we do this what can we show our clients and of course within each system the things that these firms are able to send out to their clients have to be approved to send out that takes a little time so there s a little bit of a lag so there was a lag in implementation and now we are in process with many of them on getting them on to the systems and to understand how it works and what they can actually use for their clients so it has been an eye opening experience for many of their clients what we didn t realize was that aladdin for wealth can be used as an asset gathering tool and most clients in the retail area have accounts at more than one firm and if you are one of the firms that can show your client the risk and reward of their portfolios and then improve it that is a great advantage and we are seeing a lot of money move for those who have aladdin to do with from people that don t have it also the business has moved from individual stock and bond picking to asset allocation and portfolio construction and that s what the financial advisors are expected to be able to do by using aladdin for wealth they are able to take not only one portfolio but hundreds of portfolios and organize them in an appropriate way for risk return using portfolio construction it also helps each of these individual institutions utilize their models as well as have an alternative model to compare it against blackrock s models and so aladdin for wealth is helping the financial advisor to have tools for better decision making right at their fingertips and also of course if they are using our portfolio allocation or our tools there s a high probability that they may look favorably upon our products in portfolio construction today because of the way the compensation system works they want to use the cheapest products that they can find to do that portfolio allocation and those wind up being etfs and index product of which we have a significant market share so aladdin for wealth is helping the financial advisors have the tools to do their job better it s helping us to be part of the infrastructure and the ecosystem to build out better tools and technology for firms that unfortunately under invested in technology and at this time cost is very important to be able to buy it at a good price and have it maintained is i think just going to grow for the future so we are very excited about it but as we have done with aladdin as we have brought clients on we are learning as well what some of the advisors need and we are building it together to have the best tools and the tools will also create an ecosystem that also is working with their custodians so that it s much easier and larry mentioned the word convenience so it s a tool that s right at their fingertips so they can log on and get really good information and very good scrubbed data so that they can have a better system gary s shedlin chief financial officer but patrick just to be clear just some of the terminology i just want to make sure we are clear on i mean the most significant immediate impact from a p l standpoint is obviously to see the revenue show up in our technology services line which is where the aladdin wealth line will hit there s two components to aladdin wealth there s kind of that what i would call more of the top down kind of home office view which is really driving the technology revenue and then there will be that bottoms up impact that basically will happen at the individual advisor level which will generate the flows which i think was your initial question keep in mind a lot of this is happening real time we are rolling it out right now at many places there is an element of training and getting all of these advisors up to speed on all the new tools that they will have at their disposal so the flow the flow deltas which will then drive our base fees is going to take a little bit longer than the immediate impact of that technology revenue that you are going to see much more immediately in other situations like envestnet where we that is not in aladdin wealth but is basically putting our portfolio construction technology on the desktop of the rias that have again i think there you will see basically more impact in base fees because there s no specific technology revenue associated with that type of partnership laurence d fink chairman and chief executive officer but early indications for the aladdin wealth users who ve been on the longest there is evidence of increased flows to blackrock we don t have enough statistics to really identify where it is we don t have enough data with all the different users as we said nine clients worldwide and we re in conversation with many more clients so our objective is to have as rob just suggested the architecture for risk in the wealth management channel using aladdin for wealth operator thank you your next question comes from michael cyprys from morgan stanley your line is now open laurence d fink chairman and chief executive officer hi michael michael cyprys morgan stanley analyst hey good morning hey thanks for taking the question hey just on another question on aladdin here with efront that now brings you into alternatives just curious as you look across the aladdin platform what other adjacencies could make sense or capabilities that you d like to see strengthened with aladdin particularly as you look across the competitive landscape today gary s shedlin chief financial officer i think we are committed to being an end to end provider for risk management and analytics across from the front to the back so i think we ve been building out a lot of that in particular ourselves i think the decision to do efront was a conscious decision frankly that it was going to take us a lot longer to build that our belief is that the efront transaction accelerates our development in the private asset classes conservatively by five plus years so i think we felt we needed to attack there when we can otherwise i think we ll continue to add on all the obvious adjacencies when we think about an end to end provider and we ll continue again to be tactical and opportunistic to basically balance where we think it makes sense to buy versus where we think it makes sense to build laurence d fink chairman and chief executive officer but it s clear that we are if you look at our strategy in terms of inorganic opportunities we are scrubbing we are reviewing we are really trying to understand the whole technology environment that s where we are focused on i have been saying this over quarters and quarters we are not focused on asset management m a in the developed markets we are focused on if there is an inorganic opportunity in technology that adds more opportunities to be as gary said end to end provider whether that s a data provider or a new technology or ai we will continue to be either building it or using it using opportunities to acquire and that s what we re very much focused on and we have a whole team continuously looking at the whole ecosystem worldwide operator thank you your next question is from alex blostein from goldman sachs your line is now open laurence d fink chairman and chief executive officer hi alex alexander blostein goldman sachs analyst hi good morning guys thanks for taking the question so gary maybe just a refresher on some of the guidance that you guys provided in the beginning of the year given the fact that markets moved pretty considerably over the course of q1 maybe how you guys are thinking about outlook for g a for the rest of the year i think your original guide implies something in a 1 6 billion kind of annual number does that still hold and then any other comments around expenses would be helpful thanks gary s shedlin chief financial officer thanks alex i would say really short answer is no change in guidance i think that as we said at the beginning of the year we are very focused on managing the entire discretionary expense base we continue to see our 2019 kind of core level of g a expense to be essentially flat to our core level for last year and we are continuing to invest i mean as always there are things that come up that are effectively kind of not manageable so we saw another let s call it i would say roughly 15 million to 20 million of kind of like non core g a in this quarter between paying some fees to get efront done and some more purchase price contingency fair market value adjustments and some fx implications but in terms of what we are managing we are continuing to stick to the plan that we laid out for our board in january i think that we try to anticipate we saw some volatility and as i said in my prepared remarks we are very much focused on the long term not trying to manage doing margin on a quarter to quarter basis obviously we saw a lot of that beta come back which obviously better positions us i think we feel a little bit better with the markets where they are right now than when we went into our budgeting season back in the fall but we re going to continue to keep an eye down the field and play offense and continue trying to optimize growth in the most efficient way possible operator thank you your next question comes from jeremy campbell from barclays your line is now open jeremy campbell barclays analyst hi thanks guys just wanted to ask a quick one on the advisory and other line i know you guys had mentioned some items that moves it on a year over year and sequential basis but it was a pretty big step down and so i guess just what s the outlook and how should we think about that line going forward from this lower 1q type level robert s kapito president so our other revenue line item is really made up of three main components the biggest component frankly is an equity method investment that we have had for a number of years which is obviously where we are getting our attributable share of somebody else s earnings and that one is a little more complicated because we don t control that and that frankly on a quarter over quarter basis i am sorry on a year over year basis was the most significant change there the other two businesses that are effectively in that is our fma business our financial markets advisory business as well as our transition investment management business i would say those are both smaller revenue line items where there is significantly more consistency and those are both businesses that are important to blackrock that we continue to look to grow and annuitize as much as we can albeit both of those tend to have some what i would call more capital market centric elements to them so they are a little bit volatile really the biggest piece of that year over year change was the equity method now i think everybody knows who that is and you guys can track that as well as we can operator thank you your last question comes from ken worthington from jpmorgan your line is now open laurence d fink chairman and chief executive officer hi ken ken worthington jpmorgan analyst hi thank you for squeezing me in can you help us frame how ishares operating margins and ishares margins on incremental revenue have evolved over the last say two years or three years clearly core is much bigger fee rates are down but assets are way up so given the various cross current i was hoping to frame how margins might look in ishares and to what extent the significant growth in core and in ishares overall have impacted the margins on incremental revenue there gary s shedlin chief financial officer so ken as you know we don t talk about margins of our individual businesses we are very focused on a one blackrock model to avoid all of our businesses operating as silos it s very important to our culture and it s how we manage the business day in and day out so we don t have those types of fully allocated p ls for our businesses because we don t think it engenders the right behavior day to day i can help you on the revenue line item i think back in december we were at goldman and we talked about what we see as effectively the long term growth potential for ishares and etfs i think we outlined a 12 to 15 kind of top line asset growth rate i think we do anticipate certain sectors growing faster than others which is why we have tried to point people to an organic base fee rate that will be less than that historically i think we have seen an organic base fee rate somewhere around 6 points to 7 points less than that which is part of the slide we put out at goldman don t hold me exactly for those numbers you ll have to go see it but i think that s about what it was and that takes into account both mix change in terms of faster growth in the core but also as well as some of the strategic pricing investments that we have made and will likely continue to make that makes sense both for clients and for our shareholders alike this quarter in particular we actually saw organic base fee growth equal to organic asset growth it was right in the 7 area and again i think that is a function again of about 40 of the flows being outside of the core and that s an area whether it be fixed income strategic beta factors esg or other precision exposures frankly that tend to be more capital markets centric and the importance of that obviously is that those are higher fee than the core itself and i think we do continue to believe very strongly that as we see growth in the core we also see growth outside of the core as people are tactically allocating portfolios around the core etfs so that s what i would tell you about the revenue i think we feel very comfortable that our ishares business will be growing in excess of our 5 longer term growth target but as it relates to specific margins i ll leave that to you guys to try and sort through we don t manage the business that way operator ladies and gentlemen we have reached the allotted time for questions mr fink do you have any closing remarks laurence d fink chairman and chief executive officer i do i want to just thank everybody for joining this morning and your continued interest in blackrock i believe our first quarter results are directly linked to the investments we made over time and our deep partnerships we built with our clients globally i think we differentiate ourselves by continuing to leverage our

let us see the background of the unholy trinity or impossible trinity or trilemma every country is challenged with international monetary policy which will in return decide the fate of the economic growth three strategies available are a fixed exchange rate free flow of capital movement an independent monetary policy within the country this concept theory says that no country can achieve all there elements in its favour at the same time period at any given time two policies can be made use of for country benefit let s dig deep into the cause and effect of these three policies not in any order of importance a fixed exchange rate ever since the nixon shock in the 1970s almost all countries exchange rates were free floated due to the extensive global trade and the usd becoming the reserve currency of that time hence for a country to hold an exchange rate fixed is a challenge based on the level of foreign reserves one may hold hence to hold an exchange rate stable a country s central bank will have to infuse or buy back the currency in question based on the demand and supply for the currency in question still the world is dependent or benchmarking exchange rates in relation to the usd therefore no country has unlimited usd reserves to infuse since economies are more dependent on imports however the china story is different since they are the manufacturer to the world and exports supersede imports resulting in trade surpluses with many countries therefore china is capable of holding the exchange rate fixed if they desire due to arbitrage gains in forex trading eventually the exchange rates will find an equilibrium away from the fixed exchange rate the importance of a stable exchange rate is to maintain a stable or predictable inflation situation in a country free flow of capital movement all countries try to attract fdis and investments for development free flow of capital means that there are no restrictions on international investments capital can move in and out of a country without any restrictions hence based on capital movement a country reserve situation may vary sporadically and further will have a direct correlation or to the exchange rate an independent monetary policy within the country this is where a country will try to stimulate the economy by lowering the interest rates in the country it will make credit cheaper prompting more consumption and investment within the country but a lower interest rate will have a negative correlation to attracting foreign investments to the bond markets and put more pressure on reserves due to excessive demand and imports if the rate is made too high still the country will experience a higher inflation in return will impact the exchange rate investments will look at the real interest rate in its decision to move capital for investments interest rate is determined by a country in relation to inflation status and comparison to the reserve currency to attract investments whilst maintaining the exchange rate stable most of the countries have their country strategy to compete in the world market by mixing the right proportion of the above three strategies it is similar to tuning a sounds equaliser to the liking of the listener if we dissect that the listener is the nation equaliser is the strategies spoken above tuning is done by the authorities regulator of a country let s look at this from sri lankan economy point of view we have seen two unusual spurts in exchange rate depreciation once in the year 2012 after many years of trying to peg the currency to show economic growth with the budget proposal to devalue the currency by 3 overnight resulting in 12 depreciation in that year thereafter the year 2018 52 day saga bad communication of the debt repayment and forex traders making a quick buck out of the situation resulting over 19 depreciation 153 5 in jan 2018 to 183 in dec 2018 source these are all manmade issues which were never in the interest of the country but of petty party politics sri lanka lacks real fdi instead what the country attracted was hot money to bond and equity markets as per the graphs the country vulnerability in terms of investments by foreigners in sri lanka is quite visible so called fdis to hambantota port or roads and railroads of that nature from china came with conditions that the contractor must be a chinese entity consultants are from china even those who worked on sites were chinese what does it mean the loan given or the capital inflow goes back to china how will the reserves improve with fdis of this nature we need real fdis for increasing manufacturing capabilities and to reap benefits at the trade account level here comes the funniest part of sri lanka all parties are requesting lower interest rates but the inherent issues of sri lanka interest rate determinants has not been addressed however much the central bank or politicians request the banks to reduce lending rates it cannot be done due to the following reasons whatever the government taxes placed on the financial sector on the providers of finance banks and lfcs it will be passed on to the customer by the virtue of pricing mechanism in the industry hence it is bad business taxing banks unnecessarily since it gets passed on to the client lending rate cost of funds operation costs taxes b d provisions inflation risk margin profit margin etc when the basel iii says keep x of car either tier i or ii our central bank places x y z as the capital requirement for extra cautiousness this by itself bring in the cost of capital more and inefficiency in price determinant follow the global requirement by having any extra car have we benefitted from any correspondence banking relationship or have the rating agencies given any consideration on that whilst having deposit insurance schemes the central bank insist banks keep statutory liquid assets slar at 20 level and our banks obediently maintain at 28 levels this is potential money that can be put for good use in the economy just parked with the government securities due to bad fiscal management by governments these investments bring lesser returns than the market hence to achieve the required roe banks jack up interest rates with its clients to compensate the opportunity lost srr statutory reserve requirement by itself is an opportunity cost to the financial sector whilst having all the other risk management tools such as slar deposit insurance scheme single borrower limit b d provisioning slfrs9 rwa car minimum voting share related party monitoring balanced bod all these are risk mitigation initiatives but added costs to the industry and must arrive at the right risk return model for the country without having a single spoon to serve all alike the central bank must not look at risk elimination but take the calculated risk model and improve economic activities dilemma of the pensioners who rely most on the interest earned on their deposits due to lack of retirement benefit schemes annuity schemes lack of entrepreneurial skills government s inability to have a reliable direct taxation which is applicable to every person irrespective of the profession or connections this will reduce reliance on taxing the banking sector and indirect taxations which every person is subject to pay irrespective of income levels reduce reliance on budget deficit financing through local or foreign further borrowings this will reduce the crowding liquidity of the money market and to stabilise the interest rates soe reforms and infuse additional cadre to productive sectors through compulsory re training skills relevant to the nation this will reduce the recurrent expenses in the budget as a result the budget deficit will be less and borrowings and crowding liquidity in the money market will be maintained stabilising the interest rate direct benefits to the economy through reduced interest rates will be immediate as follows subject to country reserve situation credit growth consumerism increased investments in productive sector increase entrepreneurship since cost of borrowing is low there is hardly any foreign investment left to be taken out due to interest rates usa fed will not be increasing rates in 2019 as per the communications and a great opportunity for sri lanka to bring the lending rates to single digit and sustain as shown above sri lanka has failed to capitalise on the right blend strategies of unholy trinity or in whichever combination and failed to tune the equaliser with the right policies it is sri lanka which has failed not that the world is treating us bad in conclusion my humble request to all politicians authorities regulators professional bodies and chambers of commerce is to come together as one body nation to draw up a strategy for sri lanka to compete in the world market no matter what party is in power the national strategy must continue my message to the reader is do not tolerate petty party politics at the expense of national interest we have bigger issues in hand the good news is that all issues can be managed with right strategies embraced and commitment to

opinion columnist shortly after the government was sworn in august 2018 they agreed to an economic and monetary reform programme since then much of this ambitious plan has been implemented and the consequences have been a sharp deterioration in living standards and disposable incomes what has been already carried out first they had to deal with the burgeoning fiscal deficit which had reached over 15 of the gross domestic product and 40 of the state budget they raised taxes and forced all government ministries to live within their allocated resources in a few months government was operating on a cash basis and had a fiscal surplus then they delinked the new forms of currency in use from the united states dollar effectively trying to move away from the us as a primary means of exchange although this created a new problem that of price discovery what was everything worth and in what currency the government then gave everyone the right to open foreign currency accounts at their bank and hold any foreign currency receipts in those accounts at first this was not trusted but today just six months later these means of holding foreign currency are accepted then came the february monetary statement from the reserve bank in this statement government announced that the conversion rate of 1 1 for currency retained by the reserve bank for use in importing essentials was being abandoned and would in future be determined on a willing seller willing buyer basis in a futile effort to restrain the movement of currency markets to a market driven rate the reserve bank fixed an artificial peg of 2 5 1 and tried to hold the open market rate at that level as any student of economics could have told the government in the absence of unlimited amounts of us dollars which the rbz governor could supply to the markets at 2 5 1 they could never hold the rate at that level if fundamentals dictated otherwise in two weeks the bank was forced to allow a daily shift and the interbank rate fell to 3 1 then another attempt to hold the rate at that level and the market rates to 4 6 1 everyone needs to understand where this situation puts those who actually generate foreign exchange the miners farmers industrialists and tourism operators then there are the interests of those living in the diaspora who send home about us 10 million a day to help their families and to pay for things like medical services and education for these interests if we assume that about us 20 million a day is involved then the difference in local revenue in real time gross settlement dollar zwl would range from zwl 60 million at 3 1 and zwl 90 million at 4 5 1 that is a margin increase of 50 no exporter or beneficiary of diaspora remittance money can afford to ignore that sort of margin so when the reserve bank tries in violation of the monetary policy statement in february and therefore unlawfully to hold the rate at a level below what is perceived as the real rate then those holding foreign currency balances will shift their sales of such currency to the informal market so over the past month i doubt if us 100 million has been traded on the formal interbank market the effect of such activity is the opposite to what the reserve bank was trying to achieve price discovery is accepted as being the rate in informal markets and this then sets the rate at which local prices are determined in many establishments prices are listed in us dollars and the company then uses a rate 4 1 to determine what we pay in zwl or in bond notes this has the effect of driving inflation rates even higher one very unexpected development is that the much despised bond notes issued as a surrogate local paper currency is actually trading at much stronger levels that the zwl in fact at 3 5 or 3 8 to 1 but the situation is actually worse than that because trade margins in the informal sector are much higher than those levied on any formal markets and between banks margins of 5 to 10 on individual transactions are reported this means traders operating in the informal market are making huge profits and are reluctant to allow the trade to move into the formal market in this they are in fact supported by the banks themselves my own view is that if the reserve bank had allowed full implementation of the monetary policy this would have quickly resulted in the formal interbank market handling the bulk of the trades in foreign exchange in a transparent manner sales margins would decline to 1 5 or less and the commercial banks would be strengthened under such circumstances i am also quite sure that market rates would strengthen to 3 1 or even less this would reduce market prices as soon as this was recognised as the real market rate it would also allow everyone who needed foreign exchange to buy what they needed on the market through their banks the conversion rates used by everyone for price discovery would decline to 3 1 or less exactly where the rbz wants rates to stabilise my own view is that we need a weak currency to stimulate the productive sector and strengthen export activity if we under these circumstances decided to hold the rate at say 3 5 1 we would have to buy us dollars rather than sell them to hold the rate at a lower rate this would allow the rbz to build up their foreign reserves something we are going to have to do for debt clearance in the long term but what we are not facing up to is the need to mitigate the impact of these massive swings in policy on ordinary consumers since the programme was initiated inflation has been at hyperinflation levels for months and prices have doubled or trebled while incomes have stagnated in the previous dispensation our export industries were being used to subsidise the prices of essential consumer items such as fuel maize meal cooking oil and bread this was crippling our exporters and boosting consumption of imported essentials and thus driving up the import bill it could not have been allowed to carry on or the country would be completely crippled now we have effectively boosted the revenues of all exporters and the local receipts on diaspora remittances by a factor of 3 4 exporters profit margins as expressed in local currencies have soared and tax receipts been boosted the problems created by this strategy are massive the legacy debts of all those who had thought they were trading at 1 1 and were able to secure currency at this rate suddenly found themselves in a market where they have to pay 3 1 or 4 1 for foreign exchange to settle legacy debts owned to parent companies or suppliers in addition we are now faced with a situation where maize currently being sold at zwl 240 a tonne will have to go zwl 1 000 a tonne or more four times the present prices the same applies to bread and cooking oils fuel is already up by a factor of three this a nightmare and has to be tackled immediately and no one wants to do so because of the consequences in april government raised salaries by 18 to 30 and the private sector is now following suit but much more is needed we must start now to plan to raise salaries by another 25 in june and again in october then i suggest that the pay as you earn ceiling in rtgs dollars should be raised to several thousand dollars a month to give wage earners more disposable income fast growth is coming in the wider economy but will lag a bit because it takes time to get the increased capacity in place in the meantime we must manage the aftermath of change eddie cross is a former mdc policy advisor and economist he writes in his personal

major permian projects advance substantial growth compared to previous period houston kinder morgan inc nyse kmi today announced that its board of directors approved a cash dividend of 0 25 per share for the first quarter 1 00 annualized payable on may 15 2019 to common stockholders of record as of the close of business on april 30 2019 this is a 25 percent increase over the fourth quarter 2018 dividend kmi is reporting first quarter net income available to common stockholders of 556 million compared to 485 million in the first quarter of 2018 and distributable cash flow dcf of 1 371 million a 10 percent increase over the first quarter of 2018 in the first quarter of 2019 kmi continued to fund most of its growth capital through operating cash flows with no need to access capital markets for that purpose during the first quarter kmi also paid down 1 3 billion of maturing bond debt with cash from the return of capital distribution from the trans mountain sale we are pleased to continue the dividend growth plan that we outlined to shareholders during the summer of 2017 said richard d kinder executive chairman we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and have been upgraded by two of the three ratings agencies we are well positioned for a successful 2019 and remain on positive outlook for an upgrade by fitch later in the year contributions from our natural gas pipelines segment were up substantially compared to the first quarter of 2018 chief executive officer steve kean noted we continued to make progress on two projects critical to the development of resources in the permian basin the gulf coast express and permian highway pipeline projects as well as our elba liquefaction facility continued kean on the regulatory front we were very pleased to achieve settlements with our shippers on both tennessee gas pipeline tgp and el paso natural gas epng that address the federal energy regulatory commission s ferc s 501 g process these two agreements pending ferc approval should resolve the vast majority of kmi s 501 g exposure kmi president kim dang said the first quarter of 2019 showed that we continue to benefit from strategically located fee based assets that generate predictable cash flows from a network that provides our customers with unmatched flexibility our commercial and operating performance continues to be very good and we generated first quarter earnings per common share of 0 24 compared to 0 22 per common share in the first quarter of 2018 and dcf of 0 60 per common share representing 7 percent growth over the first quarter of 2018 this resulted in more than 800 million of excess dcf above our declared dividend as noted above kmi reported first quarter net income available to common stockholders of 556 million compared to 485 million for the first quarter of 2018 and dcf of 1 371 million up 10 percent from 1 247 million for the comparable period in 2018 these increases were due to greater contributions from the natural gas pipelines segment and lower preferred equity dividend payments partially offset by the elimination of kinder morgan canada earnings following the trans mountain sale and reduced contributions from our co 2 segment kmi s project backlog for the first quarter stood at 6 1 billion approximately 400 million more than the fourth quarter of 2018 with additions of approximately 600 million in new projects primarily in the natural gas pipelines segment offset by approximately 200 million in projects placed in service and other project capital adjustments excluding the co 2 segment projects kmi expects projects in the backlog to generate an average project ebitda multiple of approximately 5 5 times 2019 outlook for 2019 kmi s budget contemplates declared dividends of 1 00 per common share dcf of approximately 5 0 billion 2 20 per common share and adjusted ebitda of approximately 7 8 billion adjusted ebitda is likely to be slightly below budget while dcf is expected to be on budget as lower interest expense offsets the slightly lower adjusted ebitda kmi budgeted to invest 3 1 billion in growth projects and contributions to joint ventures during 2019 kmi expects to use internally generated cash flow to fully fund its 2019 dividend payments as well as the vast majority of its 2019 discretionary spending without the need to access equity markets due to the adjusted ebitda impact discussed above kmi now expects to end 2019 with a net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio of approximately 4 6 times but still consistent with its long term target of approximately 4 5 times kmi does not provide budgeted net income attributable to common stockholders the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to dcf and adjusted ebitda or budgeted project net income the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to project ebitda due to the impracticality of predicting certain amounts required by gaap such as unrealized gains and losses on derivatives marked to market and potential changes in estimates for certain contingent liabilities kmi s budgeted expectations assume average annual prices for west texas intermediate wti crude oil of 60 00 per barrel and henry hub natural gas of 3 15 per million british thermal units mmbtu consistent with forward pricing during the company s budget process the vast majority of revenue kmi generates is fee based and therefore not directly exposed to commodity prices for 2019 we estimate that every 1 per barrel change in the average wti crude oil price impacts dcf by approximately 9 million and each 0 10 per mmbtu change in the price of natural gas impacts dcf by approximately 1 million the primary area where kmi has commodity price sensitivity is in its co 2 segment with the majority of the segment s next 12 months of oil and ngl production hedged to minimize this sensitivity the segment is currently hedged for 35 581 barrels per day bbl d at 55 59 bbl in 2019 18 223 bbl d at 56 35 bbl in 2020 9 400 bbl d at 55 06 bbl in 2021 3 700 bbl d at 56 77 bbl in 2022 and 300 bbl d at 54 73 bbl in 2023 overview of business segments the natural gas pipelines segment had another strong quarter the segment s financial performance for the first quarter of 2019 was significantly higher relative to the first quarter of 2018 said dang the transmission assets saw higher revenue on tgp due to contributions from projects placed into service in 2018 from epng due primarily to increased permian related activity and on kinder morgan louisiana pipeline kmlp due to the sabine pass expansion that went into service in december 2018 the segment also benefited from continued growth on its gathering and processing assets in louisiana and texas due to increased drilling and production in the haynesville and eagle ford basins respectively natural gas transport volumes were up 4 5 bcf d or 14 percent compared to the first quarter of 2018 this constitutes the fifth quarter in a row in which volumes exceeded the previous comparable prior year period by 10 percent or more much of the increase in the first quarter of 2019 was primarily driven by increased production in the dj and permian basins that benefited epng wyoming interstate company and colorado interstate gas pipeline company as well as new projects placed into service on tgp and kmlp natural gas gathering volumes were up 21 percent from the first quarter of 2018 due primarily to higher volumes on the kinderhawk and south texas midstream systems ngl volumes which are now being reported in the natural gas segment due to an internal reporting reorganization were up 4 percent compared to the first quarter of 2018 natural gas is critical to the american economy and to meeting the world s evolving energy needs objective analysts project u s natural gas demand including net exports of liquefied natural gas lng and exports to mexico will increase from 2018 levels by 32 percent to nearly 119 bcf d by 2030 of the natural gas consumed in the u s about 40 percent moves on kmi pipelines and roughly the same percentage holds true for u s natural gas exports analysts project that future natural gas infrastructure opportunities through 2030 will be driven by greater demand for gas fired power generation across the country forecast to increase by 15 percent net lng exports forecast to increase almost five fold exports to mexico forecast to rise by 39 percent and continued industrial development particularly in the petrochemical industry the products pipelines segment earnings were down slightly compared with the first quarter of 2018 as strong performances by calnev plantation kmst and bakken crude were offset by reduced contributions from kinder morgan crude condensate kmcc and sfpp dang said crude and condensate pipeline volumes were up 8 percent compared to the first quarter of 2018 though lower re contracted rates reduced earnings contributions total refined products volumes were flat versus the same period in 2018 terminals segment earnings were up modestly compared to the first quarter of 2018 contributions from our liquids business which accounts for nearly 80 percent of the segment s total earnings were up almost 1 percent due to strength in key hubs along the houston ship channel and in edmonton alberta including the impact of our new base line terminal joint venture said dang these gains were partially offset by tank lease costs at kml s edmonton south terminal paid pursuant to the lease arrangement with trans mountain that was extended for a 20 year term and became a third party arrangement due to the trans mountain sale dang continued contributions from our bulk business were roughly flat compared to the first quarter of 2018 co 2 segment earnings were down 20 percent versus the first quarter of 2018 primarily on lower ngl and crude oil prices as well as slightly lower crude oil volumes our realized weighted average crude oil price for the quarter was down 19 percent at 48 67 per barrel compared to 59 72 per barrel for the first quarter of 2018 largely driven by our midland cushing basis hedges our weighted average ngl price for the quarter was down 4 41 per barrel or 15 percent from the first quarter of 2018 said dang first quarter 2019 combined oil production across all of our fields was down 3 percent compared to the same period in 2018 on a net to kmi basis with a 25 percent increase in tall cotton volumes offset by declines at our other assets co 2 volumes were up 5 percent on a net to kmi basis compared to the first quarter of 2018 mcelmo dome achieved record production in the quarter while doe canyon experienced lower production compared to the previous comparable period first quarter 2019 net ngl sales volumes of 10 1 thousand barrels per day mbbl d were down 1 percent compared to the same period in 2018 other news corporate on february 1 2019 kmi used its share of the january 3 2019 return of capital distribution from the trans mountain sale to pay down 1 3 billion of maturing bond debt kmi as holder of an approximately 70 percent majority voting interest in kinder morgan canada limited tsx kml notes that following the trans mountain sale and given that the original purpose of kml as a funding vehicle for the trans mountain expansion no longer exists kml announced that it would undertake a strategic review of kml to determine a course

earnings before depreciation depletion amortization and amortization of excess cost of equity investments dd a and certain items segment ebda before certain items net income before interest expense taxes dd a and certain items adjusted ebitda adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per common share are presented herein certain items as used to calculate our non gaap measures are items that are required by gaap to be reflected in net income but typically either 1 do not have a cash impact for example asset impairments or 2 by their nature are separately identifiable from our normal business operations and in our view are likely to occur only sporadically for example certain legal settlements enactment of new tax legislation and casualty losses dcf is calculated by adjusting net income available to common stockholders before certain items for dd a total book and cash taxes sustaining capital expenditures and other items dcf is a significant performance measure useful to management and by external users of our financial statements in evaluating our performance and to measure and estimate the ability of our assets to generate cash earnings after servicing our debt and preferred stock dividends paying cash taxes and expending sustaining capital that could be used for discretionary purposes such as common stock dividends stock repurchases retirement of debt or expansion capital expenditures we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to dcf is net income available to common stockholders a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to dcf is provided herein dcf per share is dcf divided by average outstanding shares including restricted stock awards that participate in dividends segment ebda before certain items is used by management in its analysis of segment performance and management of our business general and administrative expenses are generally not under the control of our segment operating managers and therefore are not included when we measure business segment operating performance we believe segment ebda before certain items is a significant performance metric because it provides us and external users of our financial statements additional insight into the ability of our segments to generate segment cash earnings on an ongoing basis we believe it is useful to investors because it is a measure that management uses to allocate resources to our segments and assess each segment s performance we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to segment ebda before certain items is segment earnings before dd a and amortization of excess cost of equity investments segment ebda segment ebda before certain items is calculated by adjusting segment ebda for the certain items attributable to a segment which are specifically identified in the footnotes to the accompanying tables adjusted ebitda is calculated by adjusting net income before interest expense taxes and dd a ebitda for certain

net income available to common stockholders before certain items adjusted earnings is used by certain external users of our financial statements to assess the earnings of our business excluding

project as earnings before interest expense taxes dd a and general and administrative expenses attributable to such project or for joint venture projects our percentage share of the foregoing management uses project ebitda to evaluate our return on investment for capital projects before expenses that are generally not controllable by operating managers in our business segments we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to project ebitda is project net income our non gaap measures described above should not be considered alternatives to gaap net income or other gaap measures and have important limitations as analytical tools our computations of dcf segment ebda before certain items and adjusted ebitda may differ from similarly titled measures used by others you should not consider these non gaap measures in isolation or as substitutes for an analysis of our results as reported under gaap dcf should not be used as an alternative to net cash provided by operating

buenos aires argentina s inflation rate accelerated for the third straight month in march the government statistics agency said on tuesday prompting the central bank to unveil fresh measures to temper raging inflation and protect the embattled peso currency the recession hit country s consumer prices rose 4 7 for the month taking the year to date increase to 11 8 rolling 12 month inflation is running at 54 7 the national institute of statistics and censuses indec said that s a very bad number said alberto bernal chief emerging markets strategist at xp investments in new york adding it would force the country s central bank to keep already sky high rates elevated to help protect the peso currency argentina has been taking measures to fight inflation since last year when prices rose 47 6 battering consumers spending power and dampening president mauricio macri s popularity ahead of make or break national elections later this year latin america s no 3 economy has also been hit by broader financial turmoil that has left a third of the population in poverty forced interest rates upward and sent the beleaguered peso currency tumbling against the dollar argentine central bank chief guido sandleris said in a press conference after the data that the bank believed the pace of inflation would start to ease from april he added the central bank would reinforce the contractionary bias of monetary policy which includes freezing a non intervention peso trading range until year end and holding off from buying dollars to rein in the currency if it strengthens outside the range until the end of june the bank had bought nearly 1 billion at the start of the year to help bring the currency back inside the range the international monetary fund said it welcomed the central bank s announcements we are confident that continued efforts in this direction will help to bring inflation down in the coming months imf spokesman gerry rice said in a tweet intense data goldman sachs said in a client note that the significantly larger than expected jump had been driven by rising prices for food clothing regulated tariffs and seasonal school tuition fees the investment bank described the march data as intense adding that while the annual inflation figure should moderate it would still likely end 2019 at an extraordinarily high 36 argentina s peso one of the year s worst performing currencies globally fell 1 79 percent on tuesday after recovering last week from recent record lows against the dollar economists polled by argentina s central bank earlier this month sharply raised their forecast for full year 2019 inflation to 36 from a previous estimate of 31 9 analysts said price rises could be starting to peak and should start to slow from next month march was the fastest rise since october last year when prices rose 5 4 only in may we will be able to see monthly inflation slowing due to lower impact of tariffs and because it is a month with few seasonal increases said lorenzo sigaut gravina a director at consultancy ecolatina
opinion columnist get latest news by email subscribe powered by shortly after the government was sworn in august 2018 they agreed to an economic and monetary reform programme since then much of this ambitious plan has been implemented and the consequences have been a sharp deterioration in living standards and disposable incomes what has been already carried out first they had to deal with the burgeoning fiscal deficit which had reached over 15 of the gross domestic product and 40 of the state budget they raised taxes and forced all government ministries to live within their allocated resources in a few months government was operating on a cash basis and had a fiscal surplus then they delinked the new forms of currency in use from the united states dollar effectively trying to move away from the us as a primary means of exchange although this created a new problem that of price discovery what was everything worth and in what currency the government then gave everyone the right to open foreign currency accounts at their bank and hold any foreign currency receipts in those accounts at first this was not trusted but today just six months later these means of holding foreign currency are accepted then came the february monetary statement from the reserve bank in this statement government announced that the conversion rate of 1 1 for currency retained by the reserve bank for use in importing essentials was being abandoned and would in future be determined on a willing seller willing buyer basis in a futile effort to restrain the movement of currency markets to a market driven rate the reserve bank fixed an artificial peg of 2 5 1 and tried to hold the open market rate at that level as any student of economics could have told the government in the absence of unlimited amounts of us dollars which the rbz governor could supply to the markets at 2 5 1 they could never hold the rate at that level if fundamentals dictated otherwise in two weeks the bank was forced to allow a daily shift and the interbank rate fell to 3 1 then another attempt to hold the rate at that level and the market rates to 4 6 1 everyone needs to understand where this situation puts those who actually generate foreign exchange the miners farmers industrialists and tourism operators then there are the interests of those living in the diaspora who send home about us 10 million a day to help their families and to pay for things like medical services and education for these interests if we assume that about us 20 million a day is involved then the difference in local revenue in real time gross settlement dollar zwl would range from zwl 60 million at 3 1 and zwl 90 million at 4 5 1 that is a margin increase of 50 no exporter or beneficiary of diaspora remittance money can afford to ignore that sort of margin so when the reserve bank tries in violation of the monetary policy statement in february and therefore unlawfully to hold the rate at a level below what is perceived as the real rate then those holding foreign currency balances will shift their sales of such currency to the informal market so over the past month i doubt if us 100 million has been traded on the formal interbank market the effect of such activity is the opposite to what the reserve bank was trying to achieve price discovery is accepted as being the rate in informal markets and this then sets the rate at which local prices are determined in many establishments prices are listed in us dollars and the company then uses a rate 4 1 to determine what we pay in zwl or in bond notes this has the effect of driving inflation rates even higher one very unexpected development is that the much despised bond notes issued as a surrogate local paper currency is actually trading at much stronger levels that the zwl in fact at 3 5 or 3 8 to 1 but the situation is actually worse than that because trade margins in the informal sector are much higher than those levied on any formal markets and between banks margins of 5 to 10 on individual transactions are reported this means traders operating in the informal market are making huge profits and are reluctant to allow the trade to move into the formal market in this they are in fact supported by the banks themselves my own view is that if the reserve bank had allowed full implementation of the monetary policy this would have quickly resulted in the formal interbank market handling the bulk of the trades in foreign exchange in a transparent manner sales margins would decline to 1 5 or less and the commercial banks would be strengthened under such circumstances i am also quite sure that market rates would strengthen to 3 1 or even less this would reduce market prices as soon as this was recognised as the real market rate it would also allow everyone who needed foreign exchange to buy what they needed on the market through their banks the conversion rates used by everyone for price discovery would decline to 3 1 or less exactly where the rbz wants rates to stabilise my own view is that we need a weak currency to stimulate the productive sector and strengthen export activity if we under these circumstances decided to hold the rate at say 3 5 1 we would have to buy us dollars rather than sell them to hold the rate at a lower rate this would allow the rbz to build up their foreign reserves something we are going to have to do for debt clearance in the long term but what we are not facing up to is the need to mitigate the impact of these massive swings in policy on ordinary consumers since the programme was initiated inflation has been at hyperinflation levels for months and prices have doubled or trebled while incomes have stagnated in the previous dispensation our export industries were being used to subsidise the prices of essential consumer items such as fuel maize meal cooking oil and bread this was crippling our exporters and boosting consumption of imported essentials and thus driving up the import bill it could not have been allowed to carry on or the country would be completely crippled now we have effectively boosted the revenues of all exporters and the local receipts on diaspora remittances by a factor of 3 4 exporters profit margins as expressed in local currencies have soared and tax receipts been boosted the problems created by this strategy are massive the legacy debts of all those who had thought they were trading at 1 1 and were able to secure currency at this rate suddenly found themselves in a market where they have to pay 3 1 or 4 1 for foreign exchange to settle legacy debts owned to parent companies or suppliers in addition we are now faced with a situation where maize currently being sold at zwl 240 a tonne will have to go zwl 1 000 a tonne or more four times the present prices the same applies to bread and cooking oils fuel is already up by a factor of three this a nightmare and has to be tackled immediately and no one wants to do so because of the consequences in april government raised salaries by 18 to 30 and the private sector is now following suit but much more is needed we must start now to plan to raise salaries by another 25 in june and again in october then i suggest that the pay as you earn ceiling in rtgs dollars should be raised to several thousand dollars a month to give wage earners more disposable income fast growth is coming in the wider economy but will lag a bit because it takes time to get the increased capacity in place in the meantime we must manage the aftermath of change eddie cross is a

focused on safety and quality special attention is being devoted to improving the lithium grade of brine feedstock brine quality improved brine quality has multiple benefits including higher lithium recoveries lower cost of production and increased product quality and consistency battery grade carbonate production was temporarily suspended while brine quality recovered during march following rain in january and february customers requiring battery grade lithium carbonate were supplied from inventory during this period production of battery grade lithium carbonate will recommence in the june quarter six of the eight stage 1 harvest ponds have now been cleared of harvestable salt which precipitated through the evaporation process the final two ponds are currently being harvested pond harvesting enables the recovery of brine that is retained in the salts which can then be processed in the plant with the increase in area from development of stage 2 ponds future salt harvesting will become a continuous process where ponds are harvested on a rotational basis over a three year cycle future production guidance orocobre expects that full year production for fy19 will be approximately the same as that achieved in fy18 which was 12 470 tonnes year to date production has been 9 150 tonnes which is up from 8 874 tonnes over the same period in fy18 stage 2 expansion at olaroz the stage 2 expansion of olaroz is fully funded with cash and proposed debt funding arrangements progress to date construction of key items for the stage 2 expansion such as ponds secondary liming plant roads and camp upgrades continued to advance during q3 fy19 at quarter end approximately us 29 million has been spent on the first phase of expansion activities including the construction of new roads vegetation clearing construction of new evaporation and harvest ponds secondary liming plant eight boreholes currently four drilling rigs onsite with two more contracted to start mid may the expansion of existing site infrastructure and camp accommodation continued including a new health center for the extended work force office space for the expansion team and warehouses for equipment the new camp accommodation facilities and catering facilities were completed during the quarter as part of the stage 2 expansion the process flow diagrams layouts and equipment lists were finalised during the quarter an engineering procurement management and construction epcm company has been selected after a tender process the successful company was jacobs a well known international construction company with more than 20 years experience in argentina through its subsidy company ch2m hill who has built many mining chemical petroleum plants jacobs in association with worleyparsons a company that has more than 20 years experience in the design and construction of lithium plants in chile and argentina will oversee the chemical process review and design the project s budget and timeline are now being reviewed by orocobre and jacobs six new harvest ponds 16a 16b 17a 17b 18a 18b have been filled with concentrated brine and are operational replacing pond area that is temporarily unavailable due to salt harvesting activities as discussed earlier two additional harvest ponds r11 r12 were completed during the quarter and will be filled with concentrated brine during the june quarter two new evaporation ponds 15a 15b have now been filled with concentrated brine and are operational vegetation clearing and construction of three new evaporation ponds has commenced 14c 20a 21a brine transfer ducts are also under construction engineering and civil works for the secondary mobile liming plant were completed during the quarter including the construction of concrete slabs and the delivery of tanks with installation to commence during the june quarter the secondary liming plant will have the capacity to treat up to 300 l s of brine during the quarter construction began on a new reactor for the existing primary liming plant this reactor will enable the primary liming plant to process a higher flow rate of brine before the stage 2 liming plant is built permitting brine stocks to be increased and facilitating the rapid filling of stage 2 ponds a mobile secondary liming plant is expected to be installed by late april between both plants there will be capacity to treat up to 600 l s of brine shared value program and community sdj s community engagement and investment initiatives during the march quarter continued in accordance with the company s shared value approach education with the start of the 2019 calendar year sdj welcomed a new intake of students to the employee education program sdj continued towards its goal of having 100 of sdj s community employees holding secondary education qualifications by 2025 enhancing educational infrastructure within communities remains a key focus with a new music hall and laboratory facility inaugurated in olaroz and an institutional improvement plan implemented collaboratively with susques primary school to renovate amenities for local students transparency initiatives included a presentation and consultation with communities on the most recent update to sdj s environmental impact assessment as well as quarterly environmental monitoring activities conducted with participants from local communities empowerment the focus during the quarter was on the evaluation of community suppliers to identify opportunities for focused development and capacity building sdj is committed to ensuring these suppliers are supported to not only stabilise and scale their operations over coming years but also to operate in a socially and environmentally responsible manner production and natural resources programs to strengthen local artisanal production were progressed during the quarter with significant developments in the fibre spinning project in huancar and the development of a waste upcycling initiative in susques to build awareness of individual responsibility and contribution to protect the local environment market and sales lithium market orocobre views current market conditions as a short term correction which has led much of the market to overlook strong long term demand fundamentals driven by growth in the electric vehicle ev and energy storage system ess segments accordingly orocobre maintains long term demand forecasts in line with the consensus of other major producers in the range of 18 to 20 cagr between 2018 and 2025 seaborne supply during q3 fy19 the spread of pricing in the seaborne market widened to reflect an increasingly complex market environment as factors including strategic partnering product qualification periods broad product specification ranges contract length and time at which the contract price was negotiated resulted in a greater range of pricing outcomes seaborne prices and market balance were unaffected by widespread rainfall across south america having a lower than anticipated impact of 5 kt lce based on supplier guidance nonetheless there may be potential for a delayed impact later in the year as the downstream battery chain enters the peak production period and should the chinese market and economy improve chinese market following the conclusion of china s new year holiday period independent chinese conversion plants demonstrated little appetite to build inventory despite widespread announcements of lower spodumene prices in 2019 similarly chinese lithium chemical customers were resistant to establishing long term agreements instead preferring to negotiate on a shipment by shipment basis as communicated by key suppliers during the most recent earnings calls as a result chinese imports continued to decline as suppliers became increasingly focused on key long term growth markets with less volatility including south korea japan and europe chinese ev policy market the compound effect of china s economic instability and the later than anticipated nev new electric vehicle policy announcement meant there was little to drive chinese demand after much anticipation the updated chinese nev policy was announced late in the quarter on 26 march indicating subsidies would be cut by between 47 and 60 for ev s that met the minimum range requirement orocobre views the progressive reduction to china s ev policy as an effective way of improving the technical standards and performance of china s battery and ev industry despite the current industry restructuring china continues to record robust electric vehicle sales achieving 198 year on year growth in january 2019 includes full battery ev bev and plug in hybrid phev while ev sales as a proportion of total sales increased to 8 1 in december 2018 compared with 3 8 a year

first they had to deal with the burgeoning fiscal deficit which had reached over 15 of the gross domestic product and 40 of the state budget they raised taxes and forced all government ministries to live within their allocated resources in a few months government was operating on a cash basis and had a fiscal surplus then they delinked the new forms of currency in use from the united states dollar effectively trying to move away from the us as a primary means of exchange although this created a new problem that of price discovery what was everything worth and in what currency the government then gave everyone the right to open foreign currency accounts at their bank and hold any foreign currency receipts in those accounts at first this was not trusted but today just six months later these means of holding foreign currency are accepted then came the february monetary statement from the reserve bank in this statement government announced that the conversion rate of 1 1 for currency retained by the reserve bank for use in importing essentials was being abandoned and would in future be determined on a willing seller willing buyer basis in a futile effort to restrain the movement of currency markets to a market driven rate the reserve bank fixed an artificial peg of 2 5 1 and tried to hold the open market rate at that level as any student of economics could have told the government in the absence of unlimited amounts of us dollars which the rbz governor could supply to the markets at 2 5 1 they could never hold the rate at that level if fundamentals dictated otherwise in two weeks the bank was forced to allow a daily shift and the interbank rate fell to 3 1 then another attempt to hold the rate at that level and the market rates to 4 6 1 everyone needs to understand where this situation puts those who actually generate foreign exchange the miners farmers industrialists and tourism operators then there are the interests of those living in the diaspora who send home about us 10 million a day to help their families and to pay for things like medical services and education for these interests if we assume that about us 20 million a day is involved then the difference in local revenue in real time gross settlement dollar zwl would range from zwl 60 million at 3 1 and zwl 90 million at 4 5 1 that is a margin increase of 50 no exporter or beneficiary of diaspora remittance money can afford to ignore that sort of margin so when the reserve bank tries in violation of the monetary policy statement in february and therefore unlawfully to hold the rate at a level below what is perceived as the real rate then those holding foreign currency balances will shift their sales of such currency to the informal market so over the past month i doubt if us 100 million has been traded on the formal interbank market the effect of such activity is the opposite to what the reserve bank was trying to achieve price discovery is accepted as being the rate in informal markets and this then sets the rate at which local prices are determined in many establishments prices are listed in us dollars and the company then uses a rate 4 1 to determine what we pay in zwl or in bond notes this has the effect of driving inflation rates even higher one very unexpected development is that the much despised bond notes issued as a surrogate local paper currency is actually trading at much stronger levels that the zwl in fact at 3 5 or 3 8 to 1 but the situation is actually worse than that because trade margins in the informal sector are much higher than those levied on any formal markets and between banks margins of 5 to 10 on individual transactions are reported this means traders operating in the informal market are making huge profits and are reluctant to allow the trade to move into the formal market in this they are in fact supported by the banks themselves my own view is that if the reserve bank had allowed full implementation of the monetary policy this would have quickly resulted in the formal interbank market handling the bulk of the trades in foreign exchange in a transparent manner sales margins would decline to 1 5 or less and the commercial banks would be strengthened under such circumstances i am also quite sure that market rates would strengthen to 3 1 or even less this would reduce market prices as soon as this was recognised as the real market rate it would also allow everyone who needed foreign exchange to buy what they needed on the market through their banks the conversion rates used by everyone for price discovery would decline to 3 1 or less exactly where the rbz wants rates to stabilise my own view is that we need a weak currency to stimulate the productive sector and strengthen export activity if we under these circumstances decided to hold the rate at say 3 5 1 we would have to buy us dollars rather than sell them to hold the rate at a lower rate this would allow the rbz to build up their foreign reserves something we are going to have to do for debt clearance in the long term but what we are not facing up to is the need to mitigate the impact of these massive swings in policy on ordinary consumers since the programme was initiated inflation has been at hyperinflation levels for months and prices have doubled or trebled while incomes have stagnated in the previous dispensation our export industries were being used to subsidise the prices of essential consumer items such as fuel maize meal cooking oil and bread this was crippling our exporters and boosting consumption of imported essentials and thus driving up the import bill it could not have been allowed to carry on or the country would be completely crippled now we have effectively boosted the revenues of all exporters and the local receipts on diaspora remittances by a factor of 3 4 exporters profit margins as expressed in local currencies have soared and tax receipts been boosted the problems created by this strategy are massive the legacy debts of all those who had thought they were trading at 1 1 and were able to secure currency at this rate suddenly found themselves in a market where they have to pay 3 1 or 4 1 for foreign exchange to settle legacy debts owned to parent companies or suppliers in addition we are now faced with a situation where maize currently being sold at zwl 240 a tonne will have to go zwl 1 000 a tonne or more four times the present prices the same applies to bread and cooking oils fuel is already up by a factor of three this a nightmare and has to be tackled immediately and no one wants to do so because of the consequences in april government raised salaries by 18 to 30 and the private sector is now following suit but much more is needed we must start now to plan to raise salaries by another 25 in june and again in october then i suggest that the pay as you earn ceiling in rtgs dollars should be raised to several thousand dollars a month to give wage earners more disposable income fast growth is coming in the wider economy but will lag a bit because it takes time to get the increased capacity in place in the meantime we must manage the aftermath of change

article to print this article all you need is to be registered or login on mondaq com in a letter dated march 19 2019 addressed to the leadership of the national assembly and read at plenary on the floor of the senate on tuesday april 2 2019 president muhammadu buhari declined assent to eight bills earlier passed by the federal parliament one of which was the national housing fund establishment act 2018 the new nhf act predicating this decision on his powers under section 58 4 of the constitution of the federal republic of nigeria 1999 as amended the president specifically attributed his decline to give assent to the new nhf act to the various levies it imposes on nigerians and business entities which as have been argued by relevant industry stakeholders would have negative impact on nigerian workers and also be disruptive and punitive to industries and other sectors of the nigerian economy if allowed to take effect the new nhf act was passed by both chambers of the national assembly to repeal and replace the national housing fund act 1992 the 1992 act 1 this article reviews the controversial provisions of the new nhf act with respect to the statutory contributions required to be made to the national housing fund the fund as well as the mandatory investment required to be made in the fund by banks insurance companies pension funds and cement manufacturing companies importers for the purpose of growing the fund analysis is also made of the negative socio economic impacts which the forceful diversion of funds from the affected individuals and corporates to the fund would likely have on the larger economy from a comparative analysis of the new nhf act to the 1992 act and an evaluation of the lackluster performance of the fund since inception in 1992 to an overview of the moribund mortgage sector in nigeria it is submitted that the fund needs to be grown and the mortgage sector needs to be deepened through an inclusive and incentivizing legal framework in order to successfully build nigeria s mortgage market without causing harm to the other equally vital sectors of the economy it is recommended besides the other suggested policy reform initiatives that the new nhf act be returned to the national assembly for a new round of legislative action geared towards addressing its identified contentious provisions historical objective of the fund the fund was established under the 1992 act purposely to facilitate mobilisation of fund for the provision of houses for nigerians at affordable prices ensure constant supply of loans to nigerians for building purchasing and improvement of residential houses provide incentives for the capital market to invest in property development encourage the development of specific programmes that would ensure effective financing of housing development in particular low cost housing for low income workers provide proper policy control over the allocation of resources and funds between the housing sector and other sectors of the nigerian economy and provide long term loans to mortgage institutions for on lending to contributors to the fund whilst the above aims and objectives of the fund have been retained in the new nhf act the primary purpose of the re enactment was to provide for additional sources of funding for effective financing of housing development in nigeria 2 the fund the statutory sources of contributions to the fund as well as investments in same by affected entities are as follows a contributions by nigerians both in the public and private sectors the new nhf act provides that 2 5 of the monthly income of an employee earning the national minimum wage3 and above either in the public or private sector shall be contributed to the fund4 same rate of contribution is prescribed for a self employed person with equivalent monthly income5 employers of labour are required to deduct at source the prescribed rate of contribution from the monthly salaries of qualifying employees6 and remit same to the federal mortgage bank of nigeria the fmb not later than one month from the date of deduction7 the prescribed contributions by self employed persons are equally required to be remitted to the fmb personally by the affected persons within the same time frame allowed for employers of labour8 the contributions to the fund by the targeted nigerians shall attract an interest of two percent 2 per annum or any other interest rate as may be determined by the fmb9 it should be noted that under the 1992 act self employed persons are not covered and that the interest payable on contributions to the fund by nigerian employees is four percent 4 this is significantly higher than the 2 rate provided in the new nhf act also the contribution of 2 5 of monthly income under the 1992 act is applicable only to workers earning an income of three thousand naira n3 000 and above while the new nhf act is expected to cover workers earning the minimum wage or its equivalent and above b investment in the fund by banks commercial merchant commercial and merchant banks are required by the new nhf act to invest a minimum of ten percent 10 of their profit before tax pbt in the fund at an interest rate of one percent 1 above the interest rate payable on current accounts by banks10 the 10 of pbt to be contributed by banks is required to be collected at the end of every year by the central bank of nigeria cbn for onward remittance to the fmb in the prescribed manner for investment in the fund11 the new nhf act prohibits failure of any bank to make available to the cbn at the end of a year the stipulated contribution for investment in the fund12 and empowers the cbn to apply sanction on any erring bank which may include cancellation of the operating licence of the bank13 we note that the proposed statutory contribution by banks is a clear departure from what is currently applicable under the 1992 act banks are only required to invest in the fund 10 of their loans and advances at an interest rate of 1 above the interest rate payable on current accounts by banks also worthy of note is the fact that no sanction is contained in the 1992 act in respect of failure of a bank to comply with the provisions on contribution to the fund c investment in the fund by insurance companies registered under the insurance act similar to the prescribed investment by banks every registered insurance company is required by the new nhf act to invest a minimum of 10 of its pbt in the fund at an interest rate not exceeding 1 above the interest rate payable on current accounts by banks14 the stipulated investment by an insurance company shall not be affected by any provisions contained in the insurance act cap i17 lfn 2004 or relating to investment of insurance companies in real property15 the new nhf act gives the insurance industry regulator national insurance commission naicom the duty to collect at the end of every year the 10 of pbt required to be contributed by insurance companies16 for onward remittance to the fmb in the prescribed manner for investment in the fund17 failure of any insurance company to make available to naicom at the end of a year the stipulated contribution for investment in the fund is equally stated to be an offence18 for which sanction including cancellation of the operating licence of the erring insurance company may be applied by naicom through the commissioner for insurance19 worthy of note is the fact that under the 1992 act insurance companies are only required to invest a minimum of 20 of their non life funds and 40 of their life funds in real property development of which not less than 50 shall be paid into the fund through the fmb at an interest rate not exceeding 4 also we note that save for application of sanction on erring insurance companies naicom plays no role under the 1992 act with respect to the collection and onward transmission to fmb the contribution by insurance companies for investment in the fund in other words under the extant regime the fmb determines the contribution by insurance companies for the purposes of investment in the fund and issue a demand notice to this effect after a careful examination of the audited annual accounts of each insurance company d investment in the fund by pension fund administrators every registered pension fund administrator pfa is mandated by the new nhf act to invest a minimum of 10 of its pbt in the fund at an interest rate not exceeding 1 above the interest rate payable on current accounts by banks20 the required investment by a pfa shall not be affected by any provision contained in the pension reform act 2014 relating to investment by pfas in real estate development21 the new nhf act gives to the national pension commission pencom the duty to collect from pfas at the end of every year22 for onward remittance to the fmb in the prescribed manner the required contribution to be made for the purposes of investment in the fund23 failure of any pfa to make available to pencom for onward remittance to fmb the required contribution for investment in the fund as prescribed is prohibited24 the new nhf act empowers pencom to apply sanction on any erring pfa which may include cancellation of the operating licence of the affected pfa25 notably pension funds were not included in the resources of the fund under the 1992 act the national insurance trust fund the old pension administrator in nigeria and precursor to the pfas was not under any mandate to invest the assets under management in the fund e financial contributions by the federal government for long term housing loans as contained in the 1992 act the new nhf act also provides that the federal government fg may make any grant of money to the fund as it may determine or deem necessary26 specifically the fg is required to make adequate financial contributions to the fund for the purpose of granting long term loans and advances for housing development in nigeria27 f sustainable development levy on locally produced or imported cement the new nhf act imposes a fresh tax called sustainable development levy the levy on the production and importation of cement in nigeria28 the levy is to be paid and credited into the fund29 and is calculated at the rate of 2 5 ex factory price before transportation cost for each bag of 50kg or its equivalent in bulk30 the duty to assess and collect the levy is conferred on the federal inland revenue service firs 31 under the new nhf act the firs is required to remit the levy collected to the fmb in the prescribed form 32 after proper assessment of the levy due to be paid by a manufacturing company or importer in a year the firs is to issue a notice of the assessment to the affected manufacturer importer following which the levy shall become payable within sixty 60 days 33 where the levy is not paid within the specified period the firs is required to serve on the affected manufacturing company or importer a demand notice for the unpaid levy plus a sum which is equal to 2 of the levy as penalty 34 any manufacturing company or importer that fails to pay the levy imposed within two 2 months of the service of the demand notice commits an offence and liable on conviction in the federal high court to a fine not less than one hundred million naira n100m as stipulated in the new nhf act35 in addition to this a chief executive officer ceo director or officer purporting to act in the capacity of the company importer shall be liable upon prosecution and conviction to a fine of ten million naira n10m or imprisonment for a term of three years or both36 unless it is proven that the act or omission constituting the offence took place without the knowledge consent or connivance of the ceo director or officer37 this is a new development as no tax was imposed on cement manufacturing companies and importers under the 1992 act the levy is thus part of the additional sources of funding created by the new nhf act to boost effective financing of housing development in nigeria comments generally the thrust of the new nhf act is well understood given the fact that the housing sector requires adequate funding to support a robust mortgage system for the provision of affordable homes for nigerians according to data released by the nigerian bureau of statistics nigeria s housing deficit stood at 17 million units as at 2012 today the housing gap continues to widen rapidly with nigeria s burgeoning population currently estimated at 200 million people coupled with low access to housing finance particularly among low and middle income earners and operators in the informal sector of the economy recent reports underpin the country s low rate of access to affordable homes nigeria reportedly has only 25 rate of home ownership compared to 84 in indonesia 73 in kenya and 56 in south africa38 if the current rate of population growth is sustained it is estimated that about us 363 billion would be needed to curb nigeria s current housing deficit of about 20 million units39 therefore the urgent need for policies and regulations geared at deepening the mortgage market is quite understood mortgage finance in nigeria currently stands at 0 58 of gross domestic product gdp 40 this is abysmally low compared to 80 in the united kingdom 77 in the united states of america and 31 in south africa41 in spite of the above and the good intention reflected in the main objective of the new nhf act the legislation as passed by the national assembly contains provisions which would make its implementation difficult and which apparently have potentially counterproductive effects on the housing sector financial market and the nigerian economy at large firstly the 2 5 contribution mandated for qualified individuals amounts to a regressive tax on the people s income for instance a worker placed on the soon to be implemented monthly minimum wage of n30 000 is required to contribute the sum of n750 monthly to the fund while a middle class worker earning n300 000 monthly is required to contribute a sum of n7 500 economists and tax analysts have argued that this is not progressive as it imposes more tax on low income earners than the average and high income earners when the contributions are expressed as a percentage of the income tax paye of the respective workers secondly the imposition on commercial and merchant banks insurance companies and pfas to invest 10 of their pbt in the fund will further reduce the amount of credit available from banks to other sectors of the economy such as loans to micro small and medium enterprises msmes as well as cut the returns on investment to shareholders of banks insurance companies and pfas by forcefully diverting investible funds from more profitable ventures such as capital market instruments trade finance project finance and consumer lending etc at a meager interest rate of 1 above the interest rate payable on current accounts by banks the new nhf act if operational will shrink projected revenues and profit margin of banks insurance companies and pfas as well as trigger further liquidity crisis in the financial market this is not desirable at this time when banks are struggling to return to stability and profitability and insurance companies barely struggling to stay afloat amidst economic recession and stagnancy also given nigeria s past bitter experiences with provident funds and the sensitivity and fragility of pension fund assets vis à vis the poor performance of the fund since its establishment in 1992 caution is advised in the way and manner the growing pension funds in the country is invested thirdly there are no provisions as to the duration of the investment which banks insurance companies and pfas are to make in the fund the new nhf act is silent on whether the capital invested by the affected financial institutions can be withdrawn after a particular period and the mode of such withdrawal it is therefore not clear if a bank insurance company or pfa facing imminent liquidity challenge could resort to making withdrawal out of its stake in the fund fourthly the levy of 2 5 ex factory price before transportation cost for each bag of 50kg or its equivalent in bulk will eventually be passed on to consumers by way of increase in price of a bag of cement a clear unintended consequence of this is that the cost of building a house will further go up thereby defeating the original purpose of making affordable housing available to nigerians through the fund it therefore appears that the levy as proposed in the new nhf act will be counterproductive on implementation fifthly the penalty regime in the new nhf act is not commensurate with the offences created therein the amount of fines prescribed and the terms of imprisonment stipulated for persons individuals and corporates found guilty of contravening any of the provisions in the new nhf act are too heavy and stringent and could cripple the affected sectors rather than boosting the housing sector and the economy the excessive and disproportionate penalties would act as disincentive to investment and further stifle the ease of doing business in nigeria in conclusion whilst we support the need to deepen the mortgage market in nigeria the fund should not be grown at the expense of the other vital sectors of the economy as analyzed in our opinion the first step to take in boosting the fund should be a review of its operation since inception to determine its strength weakness opportunity and threat swot analysis with a view to charting the right path and policy direction for the growth and efficient application of the fund to avoid the likely negative multiplier effects on the economy it is strongly recommended that the new nhf act be subjected to legislative overhaul through wide consultations with relevant stakeholders including the bankers committee nigerian insurers association nia pension fund operators association of nigeria penop manufacturers association of nigeria man nigeria employers consultative association neca nigerian economic summit group nesg labour unions civil society groups and the organized private sector the recommended review should be done and the concerns raised addressed after which the president s assent can again be sought to the new nhf act footnotes 1 the national housing fund establishment bill 2018 was passed in july 2018 by the house of representatives and received concurrent passage by the senate on february 18 2019 as an act of the national assembly 2 see the explanatory memorandum to the new nhf act 3 the current national minimum wage is eighteen thousand naira n18 000 under the national minimum wage amendment act 2011 this figure has been increased to thirty thousand naira n30 000 in the national minimum wage amendment bill 2018 recently passed by the national

the updated resource estimate has more than doubled from the previous resource announced in may 2018 to 4 8 mt of lithium carbonate equivalent lce of measured and indicated resources contained in 1 8 km3 of brine and 1 5 mt of inferred resource olaroz lithium facility click here for more information on olaroz safety unfortunately an incident occurred at olaroz during the quarter resulting in a lost time injury lti being recorded the person has now returned to work on full duties as of 31 march operations had achieved 20 days without an lti based on the in depth safety audit conducted by dupont which evaluated sales de jujuy s a sdj safety performance an improvement roadmap was developed to address the key risks and priorities identified the company and dupont are continuing to work together to develop and foster the company s safety culture production sales and operational update production and sales during the quarter orocobre provided an update on the impact of rainfall and expected production for the remainder of the financial year rainfall exceeded the same period in 2017 and 2018 resulting in dilution of brine feedstock there were no material production stoppages nor disruption to the import of supplies or the export of finished product however fy19 was the highest q3 production achieved to date up 10 on pcp orocobre continues to expect fy19 production to be approximately the same as that achieved in fy18 production for the march quarter was 3 075 tonnes up from 2 802 tonnes on pcp and down 19 from 3 782 tonnes in the december quarter sales were 3 530 tonnes of lithium carbonate with a realised average price of us 9 451 tonne on a fob basis and total sales revenue of us 33 4 million the average price received during the quarter was 11 down qoq prices achieved outside of china were influenced by growing competition from increased chinese exports responding to subdued domestic demand gross cash margins for the quarter excluding export tax

focused on safety and quality special attention is being devoted to improving the lithium grade of brine feedstock brine quality improved brine quality has multiple benefits including higher lithium recoveries lower cost of production and increased product quality and consistency battery grade carbonate production was temporarily suspended while brine quality recovered during march following rain in january and february customers requiring battery grade lithium carbonate were supplied from inventory during this period production of battery grade lithium carbonate will recommence in the june quarter six of the eight stage 1 harvest ponds have now been cleared of harvestable salt which precipitated through the evaporation process the final two ponds are currently being harvested pond harvesting enables the recovery of brine that is retained in the salts which can then be processed in the plant with the increase in area from development of stage 2 ponds future salt harvesting will become a continuous process where ponds are harvested on a rotational basis over a three year cycle future production guidance orocobre expects that full year production for fy19 will be approximately the same as that achieved in fy18 which was 12 470 tonnes year to date production has been 9 150 tonnes which is up from 8 874 tonnes over the same period in fy18 stage 2 expansion at olaroz the stage 2 expansion of olaroz is fully funded with cash and proposed debt funding arrangements progress to date construction of key items for the stage 2 expansion such as ponds secondary liming plant roads and camp upgrades continued to advance during q3 fy19 at quarter end approximately us 29 million has been spent on the first phase of expansion activities including the construction of new roads vegetation clearing construction of new evaporation and harvest ponds secondary liming plant eight boreholes currently four drilling rigs onsite with two more contracted to start mid may the expansion of existing site infrastructure and camp accommodation continued including a new health center for the extended work force office space for the expansion team and warehouses for equipment the new camp accommodation facilities and catering facilities were completed during the quarter as part of the stage 2 expansion the process flow diagrams layouts and equipment lists were finalised during the quarter an engineering procurement management and construction epcm company has been selected after a tender process the successful company was jacobs a well known international construction company with more than 20 years experience in argentina through its subsidy company ch2m hill who has built many mining chemical petroleum plants jacobs in association with worleyparsons a company that has more than 20 years experience in the design and construction of lithium plants in chile and argentina will oversee the chemical process review and design the project s budget and timeline are now being reviewed by orocobre and jacobs six new harvest ponds 16a 16b 17a 17b 18a 18b have been filled with concentrated brine and are operational replacing pond area that is temporarily unavailable due to salt harvesting activities as discussed earlier two additional harvest ponds r11 r12 were completed during the quarter and will be filled with concentrated brine during the june quarter two new evaporation ponds 15a 15b have now been filled with concentrated brine and are operational vegetation clearing and construction of three new evaporation ponds has commenced 14c 20a 21a brine transfer ducts are also under construction engineering and civil works for the secondary mobile liming plant were completed during the quarter including the construction of concrete slabs and the delivery of tanks with installation to commence during the june quarter the secondary liming plant will have the capacity to treat up to 300 l s of brine during the quarter construction began on a new reactor for the existing primary liming plant this reactor will enable the primary liming plant to process a higher flow rate of brine before the stage 2 liming plant is built permitting brine stocks to be increased and facilitating the rapid filling of stage 2 ponds a mobile secondary liming plant is expected to be installed by late april between both plants there will be capacity to treat up to 600 l s of brine shared value program and community sdj s community engagement and investment initiatives during the march quarter continued in accordance with the company s shared value approach education with the start of the 2019 calendar year sdj welcomed a new intake of students to the employee education program sdj continued towards its goal of having 100 of sdj s community employees holding secondary education qualifications by 2025 enhancing educational infrastructure within communities remains a key focus with a new music hall and laboratory facility inaugurated in olaroz and an institutional improvement plan implemented collaboratively with susques primary school to renovate amenities for local students transparency initiatives included a presentation and consultation with communities on the most recent update to sdj s environmental impact assessment as well as quarterly environmental monitoring activities conducted with participants from local communities empowerment the focus during the quarter was on the evaluation of community suppliers to identify opportunities for focused development and capacity building sdj is committed to ensuring these suppliers are supported to not only stabilise and scale their operations over coming years but also to operate in a socially and environmentally responsible manner production and natural resources programs to strengthen local artisanal production were progressed during the quarter with significant developments in the fibre spinning project in huancar and the development of a waste upcycling initiative in susques to build awareness of individual responsibility and contribution to protect the local environment market and sales lithium market orocobre views current market conditions as a short term correction which has led much of the market to overlook strong long term demand fundamentals driven by growth in the electric vehicle ev and energy storage system ess segments accordingly orocobre maintains long term demand forecasts in line with the consensus of other major producers in the range of 18 to 20 cagr between 2018 and 2025 seaborne supply during q3 fy19 the spread of pricing in the seaborne market widened to reflect an increasingly complex market environment as factors including strategic partnering product qualification periods broad product specification ranges contract length and time at which the contract price was negotiated resulted in a greater range of pricing outcomes seaborne prices and market balance were unaffected by widespread rainfall across south america having a lower than anticipated impact of 5 kt lce based on supplier guidance nonetheless there may be potential for a delayed impact later in the year as the downstream battery chain enters the peak production period and should the chinese market and economy improve chinese market following the conclusion of china s new year holiday period independent chinese conversion plants demonstrated little appetite to build inventory despite widespread announcements of lower spodumene prices in 2019 similarly chinese lithium chemical customers were resistant to establishing long term agreements instead preferring to negotiate on a shipment by shipment basis as communicated by key suppliers during the most recent earnings calls as a result chinese imports continued to decline as suppliers became increasingly focused on key long term growth markets with less volatility including south korea japan and europe chinese ev policy market the compound effect of china s economic instability and the later than anticipated nev new electric vehicle policy announcement meant there was little to drive chinese demand after much anticipation the updated chinese nev policy was announced late in the quarter on 26 march indicating subsidies would be cut by between 47 and 60 for ev s that met the minimum range requirement orocobre views the progressive reduction to china s ev policy as an effective way of improving the technical standards and performance of china s battery and ev industry despite the current industry restructuring china continues to record robust electric vehicle sales achieving 198 year on year growth in january 2019 includes full battery ev bev and plug in hybrid phev while ev sales as a proportion of total sales increased to 8 1 in december 2018 compared with 3 8 a year earlier qualifications contracts the joint venture through exclusive sales agent ttc is currently progressing commercial discussions with customers in regard to longer term supply contracts for both

imf chief christine lagarde efe in march 1912 the mayor of tokyo yukio ozaki gave the city of washington d c 3 020 cherry trees the saplings adapted well to their new surroundings and over time spread throughout the capital and its suburbs so for 107 years springtime in washington has brought the gorgeous spectacle of the cherry blossoms but cherry blossoms are not the only things that arrive in numbers here each spring with them come bankers from every corner of the globe thousands of them they flock here for the spring meetings of the international monetary fund imf and the world bank who invite the finance ministers and central bankers of virtually every nation last week 2 800 of them arrived they were joined by 800 journalists 350 representatives of various international organizations and countless private bankers who came to meet them and other clients all of them come hoping to get a better read on the pulse of the global economy politicizing central banks would add even more uncertainty to an international financial system that has not yet fully recovered from the 2008 crisis this year the bankers were worried gina gopinath the imf chief economist has warned of strong headwinds to economic progress predicting that 70 of the world economy will grow slower this year latin america and europe will be hardest hit the factors contributing to the slowdown are many and varied but they include trump s ongoing trade wars with china and europe possible tightening of financial markets a slowing chinese economy brexit and the uncertainty about which economic policies will be adopted by a significant number of countries as is typical of these massive conventions what matters isn t what happens at the official sessions but what is heard in the corridors and discussed behind closed doors one issue that is not on the official agenda but was talked about incessantly was the growing threat to the independence of central banks their independence often irritates heads of state who would prefer to have control of their country s monetary policy president trump for example has fiercely criticized the federal reserve for raising interest rates higher interest rates tend to contract economic activity something that no president wants but on the other hand leaving interest rates too low can stimulate inflation something that is unacceptable to central banks the fundamental mission of these institutions is to contribute to economic stability and especially to prevent prices from rising this tension between the preferences of chief executives and the objectives of their central banks always exists and for this reason it is important to protect them from the political pressures that they are often subjected to not surprisingly this year s attendees in washington were concerned about president trump s push to place two political allies stephen moore and herman cain on the board of governors of the federal reserve moore and cain simply don t have the credentials and experience to make informed decisions on the monetary policy for the world s most important central bank moore himself admitted i m not an expert on monetary policy the concern is not only that trump s nominees may be confirmed by the senate but that the president s capture of the central bank will set a precedent that legitimizes the move and inspires other leaders with a propensity to concentrate power and undermine the checks and balances of democracy to do the same the independence of a central bank s decisions from the president s electoral interests is an important factor for stability politicizing central banks would add even more uncertainty to an international financial system that has not yet fully recovered from the 2008 crisis gina gopinath has warned of strong headwinds to economic progress predicting that 70 of the world economy will grow slower this year two other concerns were widely discussed at this year s meeting economic inequality and its implications for political stability the organization for economic co operation and development oecd a group that brings together 36 of the most prosperous countries reported that the standard of living for their middle classes has been stagnant for a decade education and housing costs for middle income families have skyrocketed while increased automation hits both their employment prospects and their income naturally these conditions have strong political repercussions and have contributed to surprises such as brexit and the rise throughout the developed world of political movements with radical agendas a few days ago instead of attending yet another world bank seminar i accepted the invitation of a group of seven bankers to go see the cherry blossoms it was a very pleasant walk where inevitably the conversation focused on all these concerns and more in these types of conversations consensus is rare but to my surprise there was a clear consensus in our stroll over the need to reform urgently the capitalist system but what should these reforms consist of on that there was no consensus moises naim is a distinguished fellow at the carnegie endowment for international peace

not all of the results were grim and many economists believe china is on the verge of gaining momentum ap photo representational image by alexandra stevenson china s already sluggish economy slowed even more in the first three months of the year new data shows underscoring the urgency behind beijing s push to flood the country s financial system with new loans meant to get growth back on track officials reported wednesday that the chinese economy the world s second largest grew 6 4 in the year s first quarter compared with the same period in 2018 that was slower than the second half of last year when shoppers pared back the stock market slumped and private businesses pleaded for help advertisement not all of the results were grim and many economists believe china is on the verge of gaining momentum other figures suggest consumer confidence is rising factory output is ticking up and the world after several tough months is buying more chinese goods beijing needs such hopeful signs as it tries to reach a trade deal with the trump administration while under pressure to lift conditions at home there is a caveat the signs of improvement most likely do not stem from a sudden burst of confidence in the strength of the country s economy among chinese business leaders instead the positive glimmers are largely a product of the hundreds of billions of dollars that beijing has pumped into the country s economy in recent months and the loans that officials have pressed state run banks to make all of that comes at a cost and raises a question about how willing beijing is to spend to keep growth going this time they used an overwhelming amount of force to boost the economy said larry hu chief china economist at macquarie group that is why the economy stabilized in the first quarter advertisement the chance of a double dip in which growth drops again before picking up later this year is high hu added the recovery is not that solid he said they front loaded the policy firepower at the start of the year in many ways china s policymakers are reverting to an earlier approach doling out more loans in exchange for a short term increase in confidence the strategy helped keep growth surging over the past decade even after the 2008 global financial crisis but it left the country awash in debt that threatens to hamper the economy in the years ahead in the early years of china s boom companies and local governments could borrow liberally knowing that accelerating growth could help ensure that their gambles paid off now that the country s economy is huge and maturing it has become increasingly difficult for china to simply grow its way out of its debt china already is in the midst of the largest credit bubble the world has ever seen said victor shih an associate professor at the university of california san diego and shih added the chinese government has not been able to wean itself off its debt habit advertisement the government simply cannot afford to think about the medium term and must focus on short term continuation of the credit bubble he said the latest round of financial largesse more than 2 trillion was remarkable in size and scale economists said the broadest measure of new borrowing in china known as total social financing jumped to 1 2 trillion in the first quarter while bank lending hit a record high of 865 billion according to hu at macquarie group local governments prompted by the central government raised 100 billion in new money through special bonds compared with 11 5 billion in the first quarter of last year when the same local governments were scolded for borrowing too much and hiding their debt advertisement on tuesday the organization for economic cooperation and development warned of the potential hazards of such heavy borrowing saying it could yield bigger economic imbalances in the future the organization revised its outlook for china s growth to 6 2 per cent for this year and 6 per cent for 2020 citing the heightened risks of a housing collapse and growing geopolitical tensions even as it struggles through an economic slowdown china is a major driver of world economic growth ludger schuknecht the organization s deputy secretary general said in a report yet china is at a crossroads facing serious domestic and external challenges to maintaining its strong position over the long term schuknecht said the organization also warned that the country s trade war with the united states would weigh on exports and overall growth as it searches for engines to power growth globally the world needs china to pull through economically last year beijing reported that growth had softened to its slowest pace since 1990 amid mounting signs that the trade war was already beginning to take a toll spooking investors new export orders dropped to multiyear lows prompting factories to cut overtime and send workers home early before the chinese holiday season advertisement companies appeared to have more resources to hire and expand in the first three months of the year some of this was the result of a pledge last year by the central bank to pump 175 billion into the system mostly to help small and midsize companies although the data remains weak for manufacturers the sector saw a double digit jump in revenue in the first three months of the year compared with the last quarter of 2018 according to the economic consulting firm china beige book making deep cuts to corporate taxes is among the new policies beijing hopes will stimulate economic activity the state council has announced a series of such cuts that are expected to free up 300 billion to help jump start the economy if its current measures do not work beijing could try more unconventional policies to stimulate sectors like the property market advertisement the sector which by some measures accounts for up to 30 percent of china s economic growth is saddled with too many unsold apartments and too many unfinished projects the slowdown in property sales and the glut of empty apartments 65 million units according to one estimate have started to worry economists property new starts this year are down from the same period last year land sales also dropped in the first quarter and could continue to fall chinese officials have said they have a handle on what they see as a modest slowdown economists say the government still needs to get the debt problem fully under control this rally didn t appear out of nowhere analysts at china beige book wrote and there are at least three compelling reasons to doubt its staying power credit credit and credit
triblive s daily and weekly email newsletters deliver the news you want and information you need right to your inbox washington a noticeable shift has taken place on wall street and among many economists and business leaders in recent weeks fears of an imminent recession have faded and been replaced with cautious optimism especially about 2020 a trend that bodes well for president donald trump as he seeks re election the international monetary fund is a good example it made headlines last week when it slashed its global growth forecast to the lowest pace since the financial crisis but it is not as gloomy as it sounds the imf also predicted a rebound for later this year and slightly stronger growth next year for the world economy which should be a positive for the united states after the weak start growth is projected to pick up in the second half of 2019 wrote imf chief economist gita gopinath in a blog post the imf isn t alone in its optimism the u s stock market had one of its best starts to the year since 1998 and is now within striking distance of hitting an all time high goldman sachs says the likelihood a recession in the next year has been cut in half to 10 there s a plausible story to tell that explains why this optimism has taken root it goes like this a u s china trade agreement looks likely the chinese economy appears to be stabilizing and the federal reserve and other central banks have shown they will do whatever it takes to keep this expansion going many of the major fears that drove the stock market down at the end of last year and caused anxiety about a u s and global recession by 2020 have subsided instead of a recession some are now talking about an upside surprise in which the u s economy could grow faster than expected especially if businesses start to spend more as trump s trade war cools and the fed doesn t raise interest rates the economy could grow more than 2 this year i think that s going to be the big surprise said scott minerd global chief investment officer at guggenheim investments almost no independent expert thinks the economy will achieve above 3 growth in 2019 and 2020 as the white house predicts but most forecasters are now in the 2 to 2 5 range for 2019 and about 2 for 2020 which is likely good enough to keep unemployment low and wages rising at a robust pace how the economy fares in spring 2020 is likely to play a large role in trump s re election chances according to election experts like larry sabato of the center for politics at the university of virginia the best guess now is that the economy in early to mid 2020 won t be the huge growth trump likes to boast about but there s a decent chance it will be doing well enough to give him an edge against his democratic opponent if unemployment is still 3 5 to 4 and gas is still 2 75 and the stock market is still near a record high then the economy is probably at the president s back or at least not a headwind said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics if you plug that scenario into our election model trump wins or it s close predicting where the u s economy is headed is notoriously difficult perhaps even more so now when it s showing clear signs of slowing down from the robust pace of growth last summer and it s unclear whether the nation is experiencing a slight deceleration or something deeper on the upside u s companies continue to hire at a robust pace and wages are rising including for lower skilled workers which should make americans comfortable enough to keep spending the housing market is also showing signs of a rebound another indication that people are still confident about the economy and their own personal finances china a nation trump often berates also is providing a boost to the global and u s economies by stimulating its own the world s second largest economy said wednesday that growth was 6 4 in the first quarter slightly better than expected and a sign that china has stabilized despite the trade war but not all is well the u s manufacturing sector has had a noticeable slowdown this year and business and consumer sentiment while still high by historical levels is down from where it was a few months ago europe also continues to look weak and has to sort out britain s exit from the eu in the fall a no deal situation would be the first time in about 45 years or so that we ve had a large negative supply shock to an advanced economy said bank of england governor mark carney we don t know how to time recessions but the list of things that could trigger one is getting longer not shorter said diane swonk chief economist at grant thornton a lot of land mines remain trump has repeatedly blamed the fed especially chairman jerome powell for dragging the economy down by raising interest rates too quickly last year the fed raised interest rates a full percentage point but economists investors and business leaders no longer see the fed as a worry after powell indicated that the central bank is on hold and unlikely to raise rates again this year with the fed on hold trump is likely to play a large role in whether the economy and markets beat expectations or disappoint based on what happens with trade and the federal budget on trade he has dubbed himself a tariff man sparking fears that his trade war won t end many are now asking after trump finalizes a deal with china will he turn his ire on europe or japan the europeans barely take our agricultural products and yet they can sell mercedes benz and they can sell everything they want in our country trump said monday signaling his ongoing desire to reduce the u s trade deficit with germany it s not fair trump has yet to remove any tariffs he has put in place even the steel and aluminum tariffs on canada and mexico which he said were a bargaining tactic did not change after the revised north american free trade agreement nafta was finished last fall all of the optimism about the economy assumes the u s china trade conflict is rolled back and mr trump doesn t start imposing auto tariffs on the eu and asia said joseph brusuelas chief economist at accounting firm rsm trump s best chance to spur the economy might be in striking a budget deal with house speaker nancy pelosi d calif in september pelosi and trump could easily keep funding levels the same as this fiscal year or even go a little higher the white house is going to have to come to the table with speaker pelosi said brusuelas the only tool you can use to boost the economy before the election is government spending especially if the fed stays on hold

central bank digital currencies cbdcs featured prominently when global financial leaders met for this year s world bank group and international monetary fund imf joint spring meetings in the united states faced with emerging disruptive technologies like bitcoin their discussions also focused on how money and payments are taking on new forms throughout the world there wasn t any determined conclusion to the debates but the imf s christine lagarde admitted that cryptocurrencies have shaken the established global financial order also read the struggle to buy bitcoin in crypto starved botswana 50 chance sweden will issue cbdc in next 10 years it is not surprising that cbdcs continue to be a topic of interest at the spring meetings held this year in washington d c from april 8 12 lagarde the managing director of the imf has in the past urged central banks to consider issuing digital currency to make transactions more secure she argues that state backed cryptocurrencies could satisfy public policy goals related to financial inclusion consumer protection privacy and fraud prevention at the latest round of meetings central bank officials experimenting with cbdcs including those from canada sweden and uruguay provided updates on their work while debating the potential features and technological design of such currencies in one of the panel discussions titled cbdc should central banks issue digital currencies swedish central bank deputy governor cecilia skingsley revealed that there was a greater than 50 chance the risbank would issue its own digital currency e krona within the next decade the discussion around cbdcs is very important because of the notion of money and how we organise societies around money skingsley stated in sweden the value of bank notes and coins in circulation now accounts for just 1 of gdp she revealed that compares with about 10 in the eurozone and 20 in japan skingsley said just 1 in 10 people use cash for payments in sweden a development which has made the e krona a possible alternative she explained people now find that digital payments and keeping their money in digital form is much more suitable to their needs it means that within a couple of years given current trends swedes will no longer have access to central bank money because notes are the central bank money non cash transactions soar cashless transactions or various kinds have soared around the world in recent years bitcoin for example was created to challenge the conventional financial system and return the ownership of money to the people beyond the reach of the state but this vision has not endeared it to global financial gurus who are steeped in tradition unsurprisingly many national governments have raised concerns about cryptocurrencies and have called for tighter regulation to counter these threats a number of central banks have started to ponder whether and how to adapt cbdcs about 25 of central banks around the world are now actively exploring the possibility of issuing state backed cryptocurrencies even though only a handful of trials have been reported the eastern caribbean central bank and the central bank of the bahamas have both announced advanced plans to conduct blockchain based cbdc pilots the case for central bank digital currencies in canada a central bank digital currency is steadily and carefully taking shape speaking at the imf spring meetings bank of canada deputy governor timothy lane illustrated the costs and benefits risks and opportunities of issuing cbdcs one of his key contributions centered on the relationship between interest rates and a central bank digital currency lane elaborated some people have suggested that cbdc should be interest bearing including that it should allow the possibility of negative interest partly that also would be the reason for introducing it which is the idea that if you want to provide more money for policy stimulus you could breakthrough the zero lower bound however lane added that for this whole thing to be viable the public would actually have to be convinced that this is something they want to hold i suppose this is part of the primary motivation both the world bank and imf appear resolute on virtual money the bretton wood institutions announced an in house experimental blockchain token of their own aptly named learning coin the idea is for staffers to have a hands on approach to learning about blockchain technology through a purpose built mobile phone app employees can read curated content and watch videos related to blockchain in exchange for earning the valueless learning coin which can only be redeemed in house special drawing rights but the concept of a unique unit of exchange isn t exactly new to the imf in 1969 the organization created what it called special drawing rights sdr an asset that almost functions as a currency sdr is used for transactions between central banks and the imf more or less what some countries are trying to achieve with large value blockchain based interbank payment experiments for example jasper i ii in canada khokha in south africa and stella i in europe similarly at least six international banks have revealed plans to issue stablecoins backed by fiat currency on ibm s world wire to allow for faster and cheaper cross border remittances and payments there are some similarities in both systems the value of the sdr is based on a basket of five currencies the u s dollar the euro the chinese renminbi the japanese yen and the british pound sterling stablecoins derive their value from fiat currency canada s timothy lane indicated that it will take a little more time for central bank digital currencies to become useful for cross border payments as that requires greater regulatory collaboration others are simply encouraged that the cbdc discussion has remained open and topical at the imf conferences it s clear that the government and private sector are both very interested in learning more about cbdc and what the future of digital payments might look like ashley lannquist of the world economic forum told news bitcoin com it s commendable that the imf and world bank group have decided to embrace and feature dialogues on central bank digital currency setting an important example for other international organizations what do you think about

news national by staff reporter finance and economic development minister professor mthuli ncube has expressed confidence that the rtgs dollar will stabilise and gain value beyond the prevailing market volatility as government forges ahead with implementation of fiscal reform measures he said the new framework under the staff monitored programme smp between government and the international monetary fund imf will help open new foreign financial flows to the economy assist foreign debt clearance efforts and create a stable currency environment prof ncube said he expected the official interbank exchange rate to converge with the raging parallel market rate soon as the government continues to implement prudent fiscal measures that do not fuel the black market the smp from imf has opened doors for immediate foreign financial inflows to support cyclone idai recovery efforts and help mobilise a global financial package for arrears clearance and create a stable currency for zimbabwe the rtgs would stabilise and even strengthen he posted on his twitter account in february the reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz floated the local reference currency dubbed rtgs dollar at 2 5 to one us dollar after abandoning the 1 1 fixed rate the rate has steadily gone up to slightly above three rtgs dollars per us dollar while on the black market the rate is between 4 1 and 5 2 this week however prof ncube has said government was maintaining a tight fiscal regime in order to contain the parallel market it s early days we just introduced the new currency regime a little over a month ago so it the new currency is trying to find its way it is trying to find equilibrium it will get there and close that gap between the parallel market and the official floating market he told bloomberg tv in washington the united states the black market cannot carry on you know why because on the fiscal front things are very tight because previously the fiscus was a source of money growth and therefore creating weaknesses on the currency and currency volatility currently things are very tight we are running a surplus for the last four months in terms of primary deficit so we do not expect the currency to come under pressure neither is money supply growing on the contrary expect month to month inflation to go negative in the next few months so the currency rate cannot run away too far prof ncube said foreign currency supply was expected to increase as the tobacco marketing season progressed we are looking forward to an improved tobacco season we earn about a billion dollars from the sale of tobacco globally so we expect that to stabilise the market over the next few months he said

a noticeable shift has taken place on wall street and among many economists and business leaders in recent weeks fears of an imminent recession have faded and been replaced with cautious optimism especially about 2020 a trend that bodes well for president trump as he seeks reelection the international monetary fund is a good example it made headlines last week when it slashed its global growth forecast to the lowest pace since the financial crisis but its outlook is not as gloomy as it sounds the imf also predicted a rebound later this year and slightly stronger growth next year for the world economy which should be a positive for the united states after the weak start growth is projected to pick up in the second half of 2019 imf chief economist gita gopinath wrote in a blog post the imf isn t alone in its optimism the u s stock market had the best first quarter since 1998 and is now within striking distance of hitting an all time high goldman sachs says the likelihood of a recession in the next year has been cut in half to 10 percent advertisement there s a plausible story to tell that explains why this optimism has taken root a u s china trade agreement looks likely the chinese economy appears to be stabilizing and the federal reserve along with other central banks has shown it will do whatever it takes to keep this expansion going many of the major fears that drove the stock market down at the end of last year and prompted anxiety about a u s and global recession by 2020 have subsided instead of a recession some are now talking about an upside surprise in which the u s economy could grow faster than expected especially if businesses start to spend more as trump s trade war cools and the fed doesn t raise interest rates the economy could grow more than 2 percent this year i think that s going to be the big surprise said scott minerd global chief investment officer at guggenheim investments almost no independent experts say the economy will achieve growth above 3 percent in 2019 and 2020 as the white house predicts but most forecasters are now in the range of 2 to 2 5 percent for 2019 and around 2 percent for 2020 which is probably good enough to keep unemployment low and wages rising at a robust pace advertisement how the economy fares in spring 2020 is likely to play a large role in trump s reelection chances according to election experts such as larry sabato of the center for politics at the university of virginia the best guess now is that the economy in early to mid 2020 won t produce the huge growth trump likes to boast about but there s a decent chance it will be doing well enough to give him an edge against his democratic opponent if unemployment is still 3 5 to 4 percent and gas is still 2 75 and the stock market is still near a record high then the economy is probably at the president s back or at least not a head wind said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics if you plug that scenario into our election model trump wins or it s close predicting where the u s economy is headed is notoriously difficult perhaps even more so now when it s showing clear signs of slowing from the robust pace of growth last summer and it s unclear whether the nation is experiencing a slight deceleration or something deeper on the upside u s companies continue to hire at a robust pace and wages are rising including for lower skilled workers which should make americans comfortable enough to keep spending the housing market is also showing signs of a rebound another indication that people are still confident about the economy and their personal finances advertisement china a nation trump often berates also is providing a boost to the global and u s economies by stimulating its own the world s second largest economy china said wednesday that growth was 6 4 percent in the first quarter slightly better than expected and a sign that china has stabilized despite the trade war but not all is well the u s manufacturing sector has had a noticeable slowdown this year and business and consumer sentiment while still high by historical levels is down from where it was a few months ago europe also continues to look weak and has to sort out britain s exit from the european union in the fall a no deal brexit situation would be the first time in about 45 years or so that we ve had a large negative supply shock to an advanced economy said bank of england governor mark carney diane swonk chief economist at grant thornton said we don t know how to time recessions but the list of things that could trigger one is getting longer not shorter a lot of land mines remain advertisement trump has repeatedly accused the fed especially chair jerome h powell of dragging the economy down by raising interest rates too quickly last year the fed raised interest rates a full percentage point but economists investors and business leaders no longer see the fed as a worry now that powell has indicated the central bank is on hold and unlikely to raise rates again this year with the fed on the sidelines trump is likely to play a large role in whether the economy and markets beat expectations or disappoint based on what happens with trade and the federal budget on trade he has dubbed himself tariff man sparking fears that his trade war won t end many are now asking after trump finalizes a deal with china will he turn his ire on europe or japan the europeans barely take our agricultural products and yet they can sell mercedes benz and they can sell everything they want in our country trump said monday signaling his ongoing desire to reduce the u s trade deficit with germany it s not fair advertisement trump has yet to remove any tariffs he has put in place even the steel and aluminum tariffs on canada and mexico which he said were a bargaining tactic did not change after the north american free trade agreement was revised last fall and became the u s mexico canada agreement all of the optimism about the economy assumes the u s china trade conflict is rolled back and mr trump doesn t start imposing auto tariffs on the e u and asia said joseph brusuelas chief economist at the accounting firm rsm trump s best chance to spur the economy might be striking a budget deal with house speaker nancy pelosi d calif in september the federal budget is supposed to be cut for the next fiscal year in a process known as sequestration but pelosi and trump could easily keep funding levels the same as this fiscal year s or even go a little higher advertisement the white house is going to have to come to the table with speaker pelosi brusuelas said the only tool you can use to boost the economy before the election is government spending especially if the fed stays on hold

china might just get donald trump re elected in 2020 despite the us president s best efforts to prevent it in the topsy turvy world of post global politics trump hailed last year s plunge in china s stock market as proof that his policies were working except that the us stock market crashed during the fourth quarter the us president blamed the federal reserve claiming that the fed s excess stringency had cost the dow jones industrial average 5 000 to 10 000 points that s not quite true the fear of a deflationary contraction of the world economy in conjunction with tighter fed policy was at fault now china s csi 300 index is up 39 year to date 36 in us dollar terms triple the dow jones 13 gain we haven t heard any presidential tweets about that the us market is starting to take cues from the chinese market and that s good for political fortunes of the us president the most important development in world markets during the past 24 hours was a jump in chinese bank h shares almost all the top performers in the hang seng china enterprises index were banks and insurers led by china construction bank with a one day gain of nearly 4 bank investors took heart from another month increase in the 70 cities index for new home prices up 0 61 in march another indicator that china s stimulus strategy is working in the new york session major indices closed virtually unchanged after a higher start but the performance of individual sectors is nonetheless of great interest banks started the day lower after bank of america warned that its net interest margin would continue to shrink but by the end of the day the whole bank universe had moved up in lockstep while the most defensive sector real estate investment trusts fell by 2 5 it s risky to make too much out of one day s rotation but the turnaround in the banks and the plunge in reits both suggest that investors are repositioning for a less lugubrious market environment deflation risk has dominated investor concerns since last fall i have pointed to the relationship between commodity prices and so called breakeven inflation the inflation rate at which an investor would get the same return on an ordinary treasury note and an inflation indexed treasury note late in 2018 and early 2019 10 year breakeven inflation failed to rise with commodity prices a divergence that bothered the federal reserve it indicated that the specter of disinflation continued to haunt the market during the past two weeks though breakeven inflation has converged on its long term relationship to commodity prices these are green shoots to be sure rather than a proper spring but they nonetheless suggest that china s unexpected quick recovery from the slower growth regime caused by the trump tariffs seems to have changed market expectations for the better as i noted yesterday china surprised the world by managing domestic demand adroitly enough to insulate its economy against the effects of the trump tariffs that in turn is good news for the rest of the world china accounts for more than a third of world economic growth and a significant slowdown in the chinese economy would send a chill wind whipping through the whole world economy the risk of a china slowdown raised fears of deflation now that china has proven its ability to manage through the trade war deflation fears seem to be subsiding of course the us economy is still slowing the latest data point came from the federal reserve s industrial production index which showed year on year growth of just 1 and slightly negative 3 month growth the problem in the us and world economy remains lower than expected capital investment despite the largest corporate tax cut in us history that is in large part the fault of the trade war which created uncertainty about the location of global supply chains and put capex on hold the best thing trump could do for his own re election campaign would be to put the trade war behind him
strong financial performance spurred by completed project calgary april 17 2019 prnewswire the kinder morgan canada limited tsx kml board of directors has declared a dividend for the first quarter of 2019 of 0 1625 per restricted voting share 0 65 annualized payable on may 15 2019 to restricted voting shareholders of record as of april 30 2019 kml s restricted voting share dividends are eligible dividends for canadian income tax purposes kml s strategic infrastructure operations across western canada had a strong first quarter thanks largely to contributions from the fourth quarter 2018 completion of the base line terminal said kml board chairman and ceo steve kean kml continues to be a valuable entity with assets that are underpinned by multi year take or pay contracts with high quality customers and stable cash flows following the trans mountain sale and given that the original purpose of kml as a funding vehicle for the trans mountain expansion no longer exists we announced that we would undertake a strategic review of kml to determine a course of action that maximizes value to all kml shareholders said dax sanders kml chief financial officer the options we are evaluating include among others continuing to operate as a standalone enterprise a disposition by sale and a strategic combination with another company this process involves a rigorous analysis of a variety of potential alternatives and while the complexity of the situation is requiring more time than we previously anticipated the process is near its conclusion we expect to complete the review and announce the outcome in the coming weeks kml reported first quarter income from continuing operations of 21 3 million an increase of 7 3 million from the first quarter of 2018 distributable cash flow dcf from continuing operations was 22 4 million down 5 percent compared to the comparable prior year period dcf from continuing operations for the quarter included a 14 0 million increase in cash tax payments which include payments related to 2018 that were not required until 2019 partially offset by greater contributions from both the pipelines and terminals segments versus the same period in 2018 in the first quarter kml generated earnings per restricted voting share from continuing operations of 0 12 kml produced dcf from continuing operations of 0 19 per restricted voting share relative to our declared 0 1625 per restricted voting share dividend overview of business segments earnings in our terminals segment were up 21 percent compared to the first quarter of 2018 noted john schlosser kml president earnings contributions from the edmonton area terminals were up 20 percent compared to the first quarter of 2018 driven by storage capacity additions at our new base line terminal joint venture as well as higher rates on re contracted tank leases at our north 40 and edmonton south terminals which more than offset modest declines in volume based ancillary revenues volume at our edmonton area terminals was down 9 2 million barrels or 34 percent year over year as mandated production curtailments compressed pricing differentials and pressured crude by rail economics the take or pay nature of our contracts largely insulates segment earnings from short term volume fluctuations contributions from our vancouver wharves facility were up 27 percent compared to the first quarter of 2018 driven by higher bulk tonnage principally sulphur and agricultural products as well as continued strong distillate volumes continued schlosser pipeline segment earnings were up 4 million compared to the first quarter of 2018 led by cochin cochin s increased earnings were largely due to reduced operation and maintenance costs along with slightly higher revenue and favorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations 2019 outlook kml s 2019 budget contemplates declaring a dividend of 0 65 per restricted voting share generating adjusted ebitda of 213 million and dcf from

interest expense taxes depreciation depletion and amortization dd a and adjusted for certain items adjusted ebitda segment earnings before dd a and certain items segment ebda before certain items and adjusted earnings all of which are financial measures that do not have any standardized meaning as prescribed by gaap non gaap measures dcf adjusted ebitda segment ebda before certain items and adjusted earnings should not be considered alternatives to gaap net cash provided by operating activities net income or segment ebda respectively computed under gaap or any other gaap measures and such non gaap measures have important limitations as analytical tools the computations of dcf adjusted ebitda segment ebda before certain items and adjusted earnings may differ from similarly titled measures used by others accordingly the use of such terms may not be comparable to similarly defined measures presented by other entities and investors should not consider these non gaap measures in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of results reported under gaap management compensates for the limitations of these non gaap measures by reviewing our comparable gaap measures understanding the differences between the measures and taking this information into account in its analysis and its decision making processes discontinued operations are included in our non gaap measures in the accompanying tables for the three months ended march 31 2018 the non gaap measures dcf from discontinued operations and adjusted ebitda from discontinued operations are reconciled to income from discontinued operations the most directly comparable gaap measure in notes 2 and 4 to the preliminary earnings contribution by business segment tables non gaap measures from continuing operations reflect our ongoing operations and have been presented as dcf from continuing operations adjusted ebitda from continuing operations and adjusted earnings from continuing operations in addition dcf per restricted voting share presented herein reflects our january 4 2019 one for three reverse stock split and is presented as dcf from continuing operations per split adjusted restricted voting share for all periods presented the most comparable gaap measure to the above non gaap measures from continuing operations is income from continuing operations and the accompanying tables and notes thereto include reconciliations of the above non gaap measures to income from continuing operations in addition our aggregate dcf and adjusted ebitda are presented in notes 2 and 4 to the preliminary earnings contribution by business segment tables certain items are items that are required by gaap to be reflected in net income but typically either i do not have a cash impact for example unrealized and realized foreign exchange gains and losses on the kmi loans and asset impairments or ii by their nature are separately identifiable from our normal business operations and in our view are likely to occur only sporadically for example certain gains or losses on asset sales divestiture costs legal settlements and casualty losses dcf is net income before dd a adjusted for i income tax expense and cash income taxes paid refunded ii sustaining capital expenditures and iii certain items dcf is an important performance measure used by us and by external users of our financial statements to evaluate our performance and to measure and estimate our ability to generate cash earnings after servicing our debt and preferred stock dividends paying cash taxes and expending sustaining capital that could be used for discretionary purposes such as distributions or expansion capital expenditures kml uses this performance measure and believes it provides users of its financial statements a useful performance measure reflective of our ability to generate cash earnings to supplement the comparable gaap measure dcf should not be used as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities computed under gaap we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to dcf is net income dcf per split adjusted restricted voting share is dcf divided by average outstanding split adjusted restricted voting shares including stock awards that participate in dividends segment ebda before certain items is used by management in its analysis of segment performance and management of our business the company believes that segment ebda before certain items is a useful measure of operating performance because it measures segment operating results before dd a and certain expenses that are generally not controllable by the operating managers of the respective business segments such as general and administrative expense interest expense income tax expense general and administrative expenses include such items as employee benefits insurance rentals certain litigation expenses and shared corporate services including accounting information technology human resources and legal services segment ebda before certain items is calculated by adjusting segment ebda for the certain items attributable to a segment as applicable which are specifically identified in the footnotes to the accompanying tables if any adjusted ebitda is used by the company and external users of its financial statements in conjunction with net debt to evaluate certain leverage metrics adjusted ebitda is ebitda adjusted for certain items as applicable we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda is net income the company evaluates adjusted ebtida in total and does not allocate adjusted ebitda amongst equity interest holders as it views adjusted ebitda as a measure against our overall leverage adjusted earnings is net income before certain items adjusted earnings is used by certain external users of our financial statements to assess the earnings of our business excluding certain items as another reflection of our ability to generate earnings we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to adjusted earnings is net income net debt cash and adjusted net debt cash as used in this news release are non gaap financial measures that management believes are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our leverage individually and in conjunction with adjusted ebitda net debt cash is calculated by adding 50 percent of our outstanding preferred equity and subtracting cash and cash equivalents from debt adjusted net debt cash is net debt cash with the cash component as of december 31 2018 reduced by the amount of cash distributed as a return of capital on january 3 2019 to our voting shareholders we believe the most comparable measure to net debt cash and adjusted net debt cash is debt net of cash and cash equivalents as reconciled in the notes to the accompanying preliminary consolidated balance sheets page reconciliations of each of the foregoing non gaap measure along

washington the u s trade deficit fell to an eight month low in february as imports from china plunged temporarily providing a boost to president donald trump s america first agenda and economic growth in the first quarter the surprise second straight monthly narrowing in the trade gap reported by the commerce department on wednesday was also driven by soaring aircraft exports which are likely to reverse after boeing halted deliveries of its troubled 737 max aircraft max planes have been grounded indefinitely following two deadly crashes economists warned the trade deficit would remain elevated regardless of whether the united states and china struck a trade deal that was to the white house s liking because of americans insatiable appetite for cheaper imports talks between washington and china to resolve the bitter trade war have been dragging the united states is also embroiled in conflicts with other trading partners including the european union contributing to big swings in exports and imports data in recent months even if trade negotiations are resolved in such a way as to reduce the bilateral trade deficit with china one of the trump administration s stated goals this would likely divert trade flows to other countries and have little impact on the top line u s trade deficit said emily mandel an economist at moody s analytics in west chester pennsylvania the trade deficit tumbled 3 4 to 49 4 billion in february the lowest level since june 2018 economists polled by reuters had forecast the trade shortfall widening to 53 5 billion in february the politically sensitive goods trade deficit with china a focus of the trump administration s protectionist trade policy decreased 28 2 to 24 8 billion in february as imports from the world s no 2 economy plunged 20 2 u s exports to china jumped 18 2 in february washington last year imposed tariffs on 250 billion worth of goods imported from china with beijing retaliating with duties on 110 billion worth of american products trump has defended the duties as necessary to protect domestic manufacturers from what he says is unfair foreign competition trump has delayed tariffs on 200 billion worth of chinese imports the white house argues that substantially reducing the trade deficit would lift annual economic growth by at least 3 on a sustainable basis a feat that economists have said is impossible because of low productivity and population growth the economy grew 2 9 in 2018 the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies while u s treasury debt prices rose marginally stocks on wall street fell growth estimates raised february s smaller trade deficit suggests the economy will probably avoid a sharp slowdown in growth that had been feared at the start of the year the goods trade deficit declined 1 7 to an eight month low of 72 0 billion in february when adjusted for inflation the overall goods trade deficit fell 1 8 billion to 81 8 billion also the lowest since last june goldman sachs raised its first quarter gross domestic product estimate by four tenths of percentage point to a 2 1 annualized rate the atlanta federal reserve bumped up its gdp forecast to a 2 4 pace from a 2 3 rate the economy grew at a 2 2 rate in the fourth quarter it sounds like pencils are being sharpened in order to revise up first quarter gdp forecasts said jennifer lee a senior economist at bmo capital markets in toronto in february goods exports increased 1 5 to 139 5 billion the surge in goods exports is unlikely to be sustained given slowing global economic growth the dollar s strength last year means u s manufactured goods are less competitive on foreign markets shipments of civilian aircraft soared by 2 2 billion in february exports of motor vehicles and parts increased by 0 6 billion there was a small rise in soybean exports economists expect soybean exports to remain moderate because of an outbreak of swine flu that has reduced demand for soybean meal in china in february imports rose 0 2 to 259 1 billion consumer goods imports increased by 1 6 billion in february led by a 2 1 billion rise in imports of cellphones and other household goods imports of industrial supplies and materials fell by 1 2 billion capital goods imports rose slightly pointing to slower business spending on equipment crude oil imports fell to 173 7 million barrels the lowest since march 1992 from 223 1 million barrels in january an increase in domestic production has seen the united states become less dependent on foreign oil we see more potential for stronger imports in coming months which would reestablish a trend toward wider deficits said andrew hollenhorst an economist at citigroup in new york
gov phil murphy s proposal to raise taxes on new jersey s wealthiest residents has inspired a raft of opposition from business leaders and many fellow democrats even as the governor s allies step up pressure on lawmakers to embrace a so called millionaires tax the tension between the two camps was on full display during a recent town hall at camden county college where a public employee heavy crowd erupted in chants of millionaires tax while senate president stephen sweeney a foe of the idea was instead making the case for rollbacks to pension and health benefits for public workers the money to be raised from a higher tax rate on income over 1 million 447 million is relatively small compared with murphy s 38 6 billion budget proposal but the issue has become a stand in for a larger political battle over how to deal with new jersey s deteriorating fiscal health here are the arguments for and against a millionaires tax which will likely feature in negotiations between murphy and lawmakers as they approach a june 30 deadline for finalizing a new state budget tax fairness central to murphy s proposal is promoting what he calls tax fairness or asking wealthy residents and big corporations to pay more toward programs that will help the middle class and working families in an era of worsening income inequality murphy sought the same policy last year but he was forced to retreat during last minute budget wrangling he settled instead for a multimillionaires tax that raised the marginal tax rate on each dollar earned over 5 million from 8 97 percent to 10 75 percent the governor now wants to expand that higher rate to take effect on each dollar earned over 1 million affecting about 18 000 state residents and 19 000 non state residents according to estimates from the treasury department a joint rutgers eagleton fairleigh dickinson university poll released this month said more than 70 percent of residents support the proposal under murphy s plan the 477 million raised from the new rate would help new jersey pour more than 200 million in new money into public schools avoid nj transit fare hikes boost the state s pension payment by more than a half billion dollars and build modestly on programs such as universal pre kindergarten and tuition free community college all while adding to the state s surplus a key factor in how ratings agencies weigh a state s creditworthiness more garden state news nj preschoolers have highest autism rates ever in us contentious bill nj legalizes assisted suicide as murphy signs bill into law overreliance on millionaires but opponents point out that new jersey already has one of the most progressive income tax structures in the country meaning the state s biggest earners making up less than 3 percent of taxpayers account for more than 40 percent of income tax revenues making new jersey even more dependent on high earners is unwise these critics say a recent report from wall street credit rating agency moody s suggests why during the financial crisis a decade ago states with a high dependence on income taxes saw large declines in revenue from those taxes new jersey for example experienced an 18 percent drop in collections from its income tax the state s largest source of revenue further raising taxes on the wealthy is risky when another recession is widely believed to be around the corner moody s implied a similar decline in income at a time when income taxes on the highest earners make up a larger share of these states total revenue could present california connecticut new jersey and new york with new budgetary pressure the report said the specter of millionaire flight new jersey s heavy reliance on high earners has fueled another argument against a millionaires tax stated most clearly by former gov chris christie during his first budget address as governor in 2010 if you tax them they will leave the effect and scale of outmigration has been fiercely debated in recent years with the new jersey business industry association or njbia depicting an exodus that has cost the state millions of residents and billions in lost economic activity however since new jersey last raised its top marginal tax rate in 2004 from 6 37 percent to 8 97 percent the number of tax returns with income over 1 million has more than doubled according to the state division of taxation and an ambitious 2016 study by stanford sociologists and u s treasury department economists it examined every federal tax return with more than 1 million in reported income filed in every state from 1999 to 2011 concluded that millionaire tax flight is occurring but at such low rates that it has little socioeconomic impact for high income people deciding where to live taxes are really just not a major consideration cristobal young an author of the study who has since moved to cornell university said in an interview more important factors are family social and job considerations his research found if new jersey is concerned about migration out of the state they really need to be looking at low income individuals young said those are the people who are moving out of state those are the people who can t afford to live in new jersey because of the very high cost of housing uncompetitive for business but the argument made by the njbia and other business organizations extends beyond the phenomenon of outmigration they say a millionaires tax will be yet another strike against new jersey in its attempt to attract top talent and new businesses businesses in new jersey already feel beset upon after murphy has worked with democratic lawmakers to enact a higher corporate business tax new sick leave requirements expanded family leave and a 15 minimum wage all policies that business groups say will increase the cost of doing business in new jersey a millionaires tax could affect some of the more than 4 000 small businesses whose owners pay taxes on business income through their personal tax returns and could make new jersey less attractive to high earning executives looking at new places to set up shop said michele siekerka njbia president and ceo you re going from being the highest to extreme outlier siekerka said referring to the fact that new jersey already has the highest marginal income tax rate in the region the cumulative impact of these policies must be paid attention to reform first tax second sweeney was long a champion of a millionaires tax under christie but he reversed his position after the 2017 federal tax overhaul imposed a cap on state and local tax deductions that had the effect of raising the effective tax rate on many of new jersey s wealthiest residents because they could no longer write off all their state and local taxes on their federal tax returns to sweeney d gloucester the debate over a millionaires tax is secondary to the more pressing conversation about getting the state s spending under control sweeney has spent recent weeks touting the recommendations of a path to progress report he spearheaded last year that sought to address some of new jersey s thorniest structural problems from the high costs of public education to ballooning debt and a severely underfunded pension system two of the report s most controversial recommendations call for shifting public workers from what is now the equivalent of a platinum level plan on the affordable care act exchange to a gold level plan while also converting new and recent hires to a so called hybrid plan that allows only a portion of their salary to be pensionable in sweeney s view raising taxes without fixing the underlying structural problems is counterproductive murphy however is a fierce ally of public sector unions and has refused to publicly endorse any proposal that would cut their pension or health benefits instead his administration has worked with the unions to identify hundreds of millions of dollars in health care savings an approach he says is more effective than legislating cuts in their positions murphy sweeney and assembly speaker craig coughlin d middlesex all have the power to block a proposal they don t like on the other hand they can t get anything done without one another it remains to be seen whether one argument about the millionaires tax wins out over the others or whether the many ways of looking at the issue lead to a political standoff that could shut down state government and deepen the divides between various factions of the democratic party email pugliese northjersey com

marginal tax rate in 2004 from 6 37 percent to 8 97 percent the number of tax returns with income over 1 million has more than doubled according to the state division of taxation and an ambitious 2016 study by stanford sociologists and u s treasury department economists it examined every federal tax return with more than 1 million in reported income filed in every state from 1999 to 2011 concluded that millionaire tax flight is occurring but at such low rates that it has little socioeconomic impact for high income people deciding where to live taxes are really just not a major consideration cristobal young an author of the study who has since moved to cornell university said in an interview more important factors are family social and job considerations his research found if new jersey is concerned about migration out of the state they really need to be looking at low income individuals young said those are the people who are moving out of state those are the people who can t afford to live in new jersey because of the very high cost of housing uncompetitive for business but the argument made by the njbia and other business organizations extends beyond the phenomenon of outmigration they say a millionaires tax will be yet another strike against new jersey in its attempt to attract top talent and new businesses businesses in new jersey already feel beset upon after murphy has worked with democratic lawmakers to enact a higher corporate business tax new sick leave requirements expanded family leave and a 15 minimum wage all policies that business groups say will increase the cost of doing business in new jersey a millionaires tax could affect some of the more than 4 000 small businesses whose owners pay taxes on business income through their personal tax returns and could make new jersey less attractive to high earning executives looking at new places to set up shop said michele siekerka njbia president and ceo you re going from being the highest to extreme outlier siekerka said referring to the fact that new jersey already has the highest marginal income tax rate in the region the cumulative impact of these policies must be paid attention to reform first tax second sweeney was long a champion of a millionaires tax under christie but he reversed his position after the 2017 federal tax overhaul imposed a cap on state and local tax deductions that had the effect of raising the effective tax rate on many of new jersey s wealthiest residents because they could no longer write off all their state and local taxes on their federal tax returns to sweeney d gloucester the debate over a millionaires tax is secondary to the more pressing conversation about getting the state s spending under control sweeney has spent recent weeks touting the recommendations of a path to progress report he spearheaded last year that sought to address some of new jersey s thorniest structural problems from the high costs of public education to ballooning debt and a severely underfunded pension system two of the report s most controversial recommendations call for shifting public workers from what is now the equivalent of a platinum level plan on the affordable care act exchange to a gold level plan while also converting new and recent hires to a so called hybrid plan that allows only a portion of their salary to be pensionable in sweeney s view raising taxes without fixing the underlying structural problems is counterproductive murphy however is a fierce ally of public sector unions and has refused to publicly endorse any proposal that would cut their pension or health benefits instead his administration has worked with the unions to identify hundreds of millions of dollars in health care savings an approach he says is more effective than legislating cuts in their positions murphy sweeney and assembly speaker craig coughlin d middlesex all have the power to block a proposal they don t like on the other hand they can t get anything done without one another it remains to be seen whether one argument about the millionaires tax wins out over the others or whether the many ways of looking at the issue lead to a political standoff that could shut down state government and deepen the divides between various factions of the democratic party email pugliese northjersey com

slowdown has increasingly weighed on its trading partners from japan to germany advertisement government support is gradually having an effect though the economy still faces pressure mao shengyong spokesman at the national bureau of statistics cautioned on wednesday quarterly growth was supported by a sharp jump in industrial production which surged 8 5 per cent in march on year the fastest in over 4 1 2 years that handily beat analysts estimates of 5 9 per cent and 5 3 per cent seen in the first two months of the year output of construction materials such as steel and cement as well as machinery showed strong gains industrial output growth will likely remain steady with exports expected to keep expanding mao said advertisement exports rebounded more than expected in march but

the timing of the announcement was curious the supreme court declined to hear the appeal challenging the state of hawaii s exclusion of migrants from the compacts of free association nations from its medicaid program on monday nov 3 2014 by that afternoon the administration of gov neil abercrombie announced its intentions to remove patients who had been enrolled in medicaid the hawaii department of human services had a plan ready for rollout those 18 and under and pregnant women would continue to receive medicaid the aged blind and disabled would continue to receive state funded benefits under a medicaid like plan those 19 through 64 years of age were moved onto private insurance plans via affordable healthcare act mechanisms of note abercrombie was a lame duck by nov 3 he had lost in the democratic party primary to david ige who went on to defeat republican james duke aiona and independent mufi hannemann the next day tuesday nov 4 2014 what was the reason for the alacrity to announce the plan to remove cofa migrants from medicaid rolls abercrombie had previously noted that he had to pursue the case in federal court because of his fiduciary responsibility presumably to the taxpayers of hawaii to minimize entitlements he had said that as long as he was governor micronesians would continue to be covered by medicaid personal communication april 8 2014 they were indeed removed from medicaid rolls only immediately after his tenure ended however it could not have escaped his notice that denying medicaid to indigent people as one must be below 133 of federal poverty levels to qualify for medicaid would result in adverse health outcomes for them on the face of it this would seem to belie his reputation as a liberal cory lum civil beat perhaps abercrombie was taking one for the team in the sense that he sought to fix a troublesome public policy and budgetary conundrum prior to fellow democrat gov david ige s taking the reins ige thereby didn t have to appear to be a heartless chief executive during his first days in office while the children of cofa migrants born in the u s are u s citizens cofa migrants cannot vote in hawaii thus hawaii politicians need not pay attention to micronesians as a voting constituency the general populace of hawaii had been subjected for years to political pronouncements about the cost of cofa migrants and a commonly held belief is that this cost should be borne by the federal government such logic ignores the fact that employed cofa migrants pay both federal and state payroll taxes and all participants in the economy pay the state general excise and use tax the inability of cofa migrants to vote is thus a form of taxation without representation their exclusion from medicaid means that they are taxed while being barred from benefitting from the social commons abercrombie s disdain for micronesians is evident in a recent pronouncement people come here they have no job they don t even have to have a job they don t have to pay any taxes if they get enough to get airfare they can go from the airport to queen s hospital the exclusion of cofa migrants from medicaid in hawaii had been first proposed by republican gov linda lingle in mid 2009 in the wake of the great recession during this period the hawaii delegation to the u s congress including then rep abercrombie worked to reinstate cofa migrant eligibility for medicaid at the federal level attempting to insert such language into the affordable care act ronen zilberman civil beat 2018 on july 1 2010 during the waning days of the lingle administration cofa migrants were placed on a severely limited program called basic health hawaii in december 2010 however circuit court judge michael seabright placed an injunction against basic health hawaii agreeing with the plaintiffs that they had a constitutional right to equal protection under the law having defeated republican duke aiona in the general election of november 2010 as abercrombie was inaugurated as governor in december 2010 it was his prerogative to allow judge seabright s decision to stand given abercrombie s liberal reputation cofa migrants and their friends and allies were hopeful that he would do so the state however appealed to the federal circuit court which decided in favor of the state s power to exclude cofa migrants from medicaid the circuit court decision became the final word when the supreme court declined to hear an appeal the legal battle is over the only way in which cofa migrants could participate in medicaid now is via an act of the u s congress shrinking public services should one interpret gov abercrombie s actions then as his taking one for the team the power elite of the state the power elite believes in neoliberal market solutions that is to say they want to minimize the public commons they want to shrink public services such as public education or public health care the power elite sends its children to private schools they would not set foot in a community health center or a county hospital they want to pay less tax because they don t want their tax dollars going to educate the poor or caring for the poor as civil rights organizer joakim jojo peter noted a few days before his passing my issue has always been that if there s a lot of this structural discrimination or structural barriers against you that starts with the government the state government and the federal government and it filters down to the community and it s all crashing in on you you have very little recourse for the power elite it matters little which party is in power as long as their interests are taken care of as noam chomsky notes about national politics in the u s there is basically one party the business party it has two factions called democrats and republicans which are somewhat different but carry out variations on the same policies the power elite prefers that their a team the republicans be in power when the a team makes a major mess of things and to demonstrate the pretense that the country remains a democracy it s time to call in the b team the democrats when the casinos of wall street go broke it s time for a bipartisan bailout by the taxpayers when the numbers of uninsured in america becomes a national disgrace the solution is to subsidize the premiums to enroll more people with private insurance companies liberals talk about caring for everybody but when it comes down to it they take care of their corporate backers for hawaii its polity dominated by the democrats it is expected that even the liberal wing of the democratic party will take care of the power elite building walls within polite these days less so discourse regarding migrants in the u s ranging from a wall building to b high tech border patrolling cofa migrants forever remain migrants the compacts of free association allow citizens of the marshall islands the federated states of micronesia and palau free entry to the u s and the right to work without a visa but there is no pathway to permanent residency or u s citizenship many scientists are calling the present the anthropocene epoch because human activity is changing the physical nature of the planet the energy intensive neoliberal free trade hyper capitalism of recent decades is accelerating the pace of this change in the coming decades climate change will force many more to seek higher ground the mean elevation in the marshall islands is 2 meters above sea level making it particularly susceptible to sea level rise historically the human rights of the marshallese have been run over roughshod by nuclear testing and human experimentation the main lagoon of chuuk in the federated states of micronesia is severely polluted from the u s bombing campaign of world war ii the island of peleliu of palau remains densely littered with debris from the fierce world war ii battle fought there kwajalein atoll in the marshall islands remains under u s military jurisdiction will americans continue to exclude cofa migrants from access to health care despite having assumed responsibility for the health and welfare of micronesians after world war ii the united states failed its responsibilities to the islanders who consequently continue to suffer from inadequate health care limited education opportunities and marginal economic development the compacts were negotiated to preserve u s strategic interests in the pacific with limited benefit to micronesians themselves who might not need to seek education employment and health care here in the u s had the u s fulfilled its responsibilities inevitably more people of the cofa nations will migrate to the u s will americans continue to exclude cofa migrants from access to health care will we build walls or tear them down in the present day the denial of the human right to health is an insidious step toward the denial of other human rights the first clause of article 25 of the universal declaration of human rights adopted by the united nations in 1948 reads everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well being of himself and of his family including food clothing housing and medical care meanwhile exclusion from medicaid by making it clear to all concerned that cofa migrants are non qualified aliens per the language of the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of 1996 the cofa migrant is redefined as the other despite their legal right to live in hawaii in this way the erosion of the human right to health underscores the fact that cofa migrants are not quite equal to americans and can be treated differently by the state conversely the fact that cofa migrants are not american citizens justifies the denial of the human right to health we would do well to keep in mind the words of jojo peter who spoke at civil beat s recent beingmicronesian in hawaii event

an index fund is an investment that tracks a market index typically comprising stocks or bonds index funds generally invest in all the components of the index they track and have fund managers whose job is to make sure that the index fund performs the same as the index 1 pick an index 1 pick an index there are hundreds of indexes you can track using index funds the most popular index is the s p 500 index which includes 500 of the top companies in the u s stock market here s a short list of some additional top indexes broken down by which part of the market they cover large u s stocks s p 500 dow jones industrial average nasdaq composite s p 500 small u s stocks russell 2000 s p smallcap 600 international stocks msci eafe msci emerging markets msci eafe msci emerging markets bonds bloomberg barclays global aggregate bond in addition to these broad indexes you can find sector indexes tied to specific industries country indexes that target stocks in single nations style indexes emphasizing fast growing companies or value priced stocks and other indexes that limit their investments based on their own filtering systems 2 choose the right fund 2 choose the right fund for your index once you ve chosen an index you can generally find at least one index fund that tracks it for popular indexes like the s p 500 you might have a dozen or more choices all tracking the same index if you have more than one fund option for your chosen index you ll want to ask some basic questions first which index fund most closely tracks the performance of the index second which index fund has the lowest costs third are there any limitations or restrictions on an index fund that prevent you from investing in it and finally does the fund provider have other index funds you re also interested in using the answers to those questions should make it easier to pick the right index fund for you 3 buy shares 3 buy index fund shares you can open a brokerage account that allows you to buy and sell shares of the index fund that interests you alternatively you can typically open an account directly with a mutual fund company that offers an index fund you re interested in again it pays to look at costs and features when deciding the best way to buy shares of your index fund some brokers charge extra for their customers to buy index fund shares making it cheaper to go directly through the index fund company to open a fund account that said many investors prefer to have all their investments held in a single brokerage account plus many brokers allow customers to buy fractional shares of index

market expert to do it investors find index funds especially useful for many reasons minimal investment research you can rely on the index fund s portfolio manager to simply match the underlying index s performance over time managed investment risk diversification leaves you less likely to suffer big losses if something bad happens to one or two companies in the index lots of choices you can buy broad index funds such as those that track the s p 500 or more focused index funds that invest in specific sectors or trends low fees index funds are usually far less costly than alternatives like actively managed funds that s because an index fund manager just has to passively buy the stocks or other investments in an index you don t have to pay them to try to come up with stock picks of their own tax efficiency index funds are quite tax efficient compared with many other investments index funds generally don t have to do as much buying and selling of their holdings as actively managed funds so they avoid generating capital gains that can add to your tax bill building your portfolio over time when you use index funds you are a passive investor you can invest month after month and ignore short term ups and downs confident that you ll share in the market s long term growth and build your nest egg why not invest why not invest in index funds as simple as index funds are they re

a certain benchmark index if you want to prove your mettle as a superior investor index funds won t give you that chance short term downside risk index funds track their markets in good times and bad they can be volatile places to put your money when the index your fund is tracking plunges your index fund will plunge as well investors may have been reminded of this lesson in the 2022 bear market lots of different stocks the diversification of an index fund works both ways depending on the index you choose you could end up owning some stocks you d rather not own while missing out on others you d prefer to address some of these shortcomings and give you greater flexibility you can always keep a mix of index funds and other investments if you plan to use index funds solely however you ll have

it wasn t so long ago that epistemic closure was supposedly the exclusive province of republicans for years self satisfied liberal analysts maintained that the fox news channel and talk radio had incepted a kind of mood disorder in the conservative body politic that refused all evidence or information challenging to its most deeply held beliefs every intellectual movement needs to constantly question itself otherwise it becomes stale wrote former republican official turned gop critic bruce bartlett in a typical 2010 remark conservatives have sort of reached a position of intellectual closure observers with no clear interest in the republican party s well being or the health of the conservative movement offered sorrowful aperçues about this disorder in the wake of mitt romney s 2012 loss msnbc host rachel maddow counseled conservatives and republicans to pop the factual bubble they have been so happy living inside if they do not want to get shellacked again the atlantic s marc armbinder mourned as follows i want to find republicans to take seriously but it is hard that was not he confessed because the right s more serious voices didn t exist but because they are marginalized even self marginalizing the gop these ubiquitous liberal voices advised would have to break its addiction to this self reinforcing feedback loop if it was ever again going to be a nationally representative institution in 2019 the democratic party is giving signs of suffering from a form of epistemic closure of its own after the 2010 midterm election brought barack obama s aggressive legislative agenda to a halt the party s progressive wing has been in the political wilderness the progressives spent most of the decade incubating a set of ambitious and far reaching ideas policies that never seem to have been examined along the way by a single skeptical eye they have now emerged from their cocoon as the revivified democratic party has taken charge of the house of representatives and readies itself for a 2020 challenge to donald trump and the progressives who are besotted with them seem genuinely surprised that their policy preferences are being greeted with skepticism at best and astonishment at worst the emblematic policy is a smorgasbord of desiderata called the green new deal only some of which is dedicated to environmental remediation the democratic party s climate catastrophists appear to have convinced themselves that the only surefire way to prevent runaway climate change is the radical transformation of the economy to call this 10 year plan ambitious is an understatement the initial proposal for a green new deal congressional subcommittee called for the shuttering of all fossil fuel generating power plants replacing the country s energy grid enhancing its water related infrastructure upgrading every residential and industrial building in the united states scaling back america s industrial agriculture sector to local scale eliminating all greenhouse gas emissions produced by transportation and exporting this technological and paradigmatic revolution around the world this was no rough draft within weeks more than 60 house democrats co sponsored a legislative resolution backing these measures democratic 2020 hopefuls including elizabeth warren kamala harris kirsten gillibrand cory booker julian castro pete buttigieg tulsi gabbard and amy klobuchar have endorsed the green new deal in whole or in concept as aspirational given all this support you might think that the kinks of this wild eyed proposal were worked out long ago you d be wrong the green new deal s chief proponent representative alexandria ocasio cortez promoted the plan in a frequently asked questions faq document published on her website the faq explained that america would be reducing its fossil fuel emissions to zero while eliminating nuclear power generation which would be beyond the capacity of existing technology to achieve in a 10 year time frame the faq also said the green new deal would eventually retire the internal combustion engine the document confessed that emissions from livestock and airplanes might not be eliminated entirely at the end of a decade but we d be well on our way it would use highspeed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary an implausible notion considering that even california s progressive governor gavin newsom couldn t make a bullet train linking the bay area and silicon valley work at a reasonable cost indeed the faq was disdainful of the notion that cost should be part of the equation the question isn t how will we pay for it the faq insisted but what will we do with our new shared prosperity the faq was a disaster it was mocked dismissed and eventually scrubbed from the internet the federalist s david harsanyi called it a manual for how to tear down modernity the faq was a recipe for economic armageddon wrote the washington examiner s tom rogan in what may be the sincerest admission that ocasio cortez had done her party no favors the new york times headline read ocasio cortez team flubs a green new deal summary and republicans pounce but rather than fall on their swords and acknowledge the crudity of their rollout of the policy ocasio cortez s advisers tried to convince observers that their eyes had deceived them robert hockett a cornell law professor and adviser to ocasio cortez told fox news channel s tucker carlson that the faq was a doctored document that someone else has been circulating her chief of staff saikat chakrabarti later claimed it was only one of many early drafts that got leaked to the press once it was exposed to the sunlight the green new deal instantly began to wilt what would it do to help the millions of people who would be displaced amid the abolition of any occupation that is made possible by the burning of fossil fuels well it commits the government to guaranteeing a job to all people of the united states ocasio cortez s boosters were especially humiliated by a phrase in the faq that promised occupations to those who are unwilling to work but the unwilling are surely part of a category as broad as literally everyone in america to be sure a federal jobs guarantee has been the great hope of the progressive left for generations but it s tough to generate traction for that kind of plan while at the same time outlawing most of the productive economy a brookings institution analysis of some of the leading proposals for a federal jobs program found that there are about 50 million americans who could take advantage of such a program some who are currently unemployed but many more who are employed full or part time making less than 15 per hour such a program would have positive effects the number of underemployed workers would collapse poverty rates would decline and wages would rise as competition for low skill occupations increased but what kinds of work would this program guarantee some proposals would expand the ranks of teachers teachers assistants office support professionals personal care providers construction and maintenance workers and police and security officers but that would be little consolation for those employed in the millions of occupations that would be phased out by the green new deal many of which require professional expertise accumulated over the course of a lifetime and provide competition commensurate with those skillsets a petroleum engineer would not be fulfilled by his new position as a public safety officer making minimum wage the most aggressive jobs programs would require 5 trillion over ten years according to brookings but that wouldn t cover the costs associated with providing displaced americans job training educational resources and access to a college degree that too is in the green new deal but it s not new free college has become a staple part of the progressive platform making a four year college degree a debt free proposition has become a feature of the democratic pitch to voters and few have put as much meat on its bones as senator bernie sanders his plan would cost the federal treasury 470 billion over 10 years but the financial strain is the least of his proposal s objectionable effects ironically free college would exacerbate the very inequality he and other progressives claim to oppose prior to 1998 the united kingdom experimented with taxpayer funded university education but the scheme became untenable when more and more people began to seek degrees as demand for skilled labor increased the effect of free college was social stratification qualified students sought out schools with the most resources while lower tier colleges stagnated as their incentives to innovate dried up these perverse incentives disappeared when the u k introduced market reforms into the higher education system and contrary to progressives expectations enrollment continues to rise we can already see the pernicious effects of free college on social mobility in states that have tried to make college debt free state level programs that cover the cost of college after students take advantage of federal aid divert resources to middle class students and away from poorer degree seekers two studies one from the institute of higher education policy and another conducted by ed trust found that state level free college programs without restrictions provided less benefit to lower income students and undergraduate students who are over 25 years old than they would receive from colleges outside the state where they reside these students still cannot afford college because they struggle with non tuition costs such as books housing and transportation wrote ed trust senior higher education policy analyst katie berger this organization also found that the 200 free college programs in 41 states often limit eligibility based on gpa credit accumulation and residency this helps manage costs but also has a disproportionate impact on the students least served by higher education and fail to address our nation s college affordability problem what s more states and municipalities struggling to comply with a federal higher education mandate would face a widely expanded pool of applicants forcing them to enlarge their unwieldy armies of non faculty administrators between 1985 and 2005 the cost of a four year degree exploded in that same period the number of faculty in higher education increased by only 50 percent while administrators increased by 85 percent and their staffs ballooned by a staggering 240 percent those administrative professionals are not performing make work jobs they re navigating a complex labyrinth of federal regulations and performing managerial oversight that full time faculty cannot free college would only exacerbate the conditions that have led college costs to increase by 500 percent in roughly those same two decades which suggests that the estimated costs of sanders s proposal are on the low end for some democrats the promise of economic security would not be satisfied by the promise of employment and education for them economic security means a guaranteed income provided by the government that would in one go raise every american over the annual poverty threshold while prominent democratic lawmakers including hillary clinton and joe biden were sour on the idea only a few years ago the green new deal subcommittee proposal endorses basic income programs goaded by tech sector giants including mark zuckerberg elon musk and richard branson the california democratic party has now embraced the idea of a universal basic income senators kamala harris and cory booker have also endorsed the concept of a ubi ray dalio manager of the hedge fund bridgewater associates estimated that providing every american with 12 000 per year the current poverty threshold would cost approximately 3 8 trillion every year that is approximately 21 percent of gdp and about 78 percent of all tax revenues if a price tag amounting to 38 trillion over 10 years doesn t make you sweat how about the fact that this old idea has been an objective failure everywhere it s been tried finland recently experimented with a program that provided 2 000 unemployed people with a basic income and no reporting requirements for two years while the recipients experienced more happiness and less stress than the control group the administrators found to their distress that the program members were not encouraged by their guaranteed income to go out and find a job they simply lived off the pilot program s per diem what s more the finnish government concluded that the program applied to all its 5 5 million people would require across the board income tax hikes of nearly 30 percent the nation discontinued the experiment in july 2017 ontario also experimented with a ubi and encountered many of the same problems as finland this was all predictable due to prior experience with the idea in the united states the negative income tax as it was called was essentially a minimum income that phased out as earnings increased in 1968 the white house office of economic opportunity selected a series of communities in new jersey to test the nit the number of hours worked by the program s beneficiaries declined and those who lost a job while on this form of assistance took longer to find new work than did those without it what s more as the stanford research institute sri found the experiment did not increase nuclear family cohesion as theorists expected instead it exacerbated the conditions that were leading families to come apart the sri researchers the study read hypothesized that the availability of the income guarantee to some families reduced the pressure on the breadwinner to remain with the family while the benefit reduction rate also reduced the value to the family of keeping a wage earner in the unit it goes without saying that there can be no economic security without the peace of mind provided by health care coverage perhaps that s why health care mandates are also part of the green new deal which let us recall is supposedly about fighting climate change this is just one element of the democratic party s embrace of ever more radical approaches to health insurance after the end of the obama presidency the obamacare plan was not only challenged programmatically by the republicans who successfully sought to remove its mandate but philosophically by democrats pushing for a single payer system in 2017 one third of the democratic caucus in the senate backed bernie sanders s medicare for all single payer plan and it has only become more popular in the years since today more than half of the democratic party s representatives in the house want to open medicare up to all americans they regularly point to polling that suggests most voters are on their side but that enthusiasm dissolves the minute americans take a cursory glance under medicare for all s hood presidential candidate kamala harris s experience is illustrative shortly after launching her presidential bid harris sat down with cnn host jake tapper who asked her about the provisions in the single payer bill she co sponsored that would all but do away with private insurance let s eliminate all that she said dismissively let s move on the firestorm that followed these comments suggests that harris hadn t thoroughly gamed this out it would take a mighty transition to move from where we are to that said the number two democrat in the senate dick durbin senator tim kaine added that he too would be uncomfortable forcing the 80 percent of americans with employer sponsored private insurance into a government program i m not going to say you have to give it up he said you can t just pull the rug out from underneath everybody s feet senator gary peters cautioned senator chris murphy advocated some form of health care reform that would be more politically palatable and ultimately more popular than harris s statutory prohibition private plans california senator dianne feinstein said simply i m not there yet what we learned from this is that most americans might not have known that expanding medicare to all americans essentially nationalizes the health insurance industry sanders s proposal makes employer sponsored health insurance illegal and would likely crowd most other plans out of the marketplace by leaving them with an unsustainably small risk pool that would force approximately 150 million americans and their dependents into a government sponsored insurance monopoly every one of the 16 senate democrats who co sponsored sanders s single payer bill knew this but harris s unwise acknowledgement prompted a democratic stampede away from medicare for all s central plank many senate democrats balked at the idea that you could simply legislate a 900 billion per year industry out of existence overnight fellow presidential candidate cory booker who also co sponsored sanders s bill went wobbly even countries that have vast access to publicly offered health care still have private health care he said when asked if he too wanted to eliminate private insurance so no with the pressure on harris relented her advisers confessed that the senator was suddenly amenable to health care reform plans short of single payer once again this progressive idea that gained such purchase among democrats blew up on the tarmac the first time it met an even mildly skeptical audience and the nationalization of the health insurance industry was only the most obvious of sanders style single payer s drawbacks two independent analyses of his plan pegged its costs at around 32 trillion over 10 years those costs would presumably be offset by a series of assumptions among them the accrued savings from lower prescription costs and a reduced administrative burden on hospitals but most of the savings comes from the assumption that doctors and hospitals would make do with a radical reduction in payments up to of 40 percent less than what they get from private insurers without negatively affecting the quality or availability of care environmental and economic policy aren t the only public affairs in which the democratic party has allowed their youngish left flank to lead them into uncharted territory the party is also staking out new ground when it comes to law enforcement amid congressional negotiations aimed at avoiding another government shutdown democrats came up with a new demand they wanted to decrease the number of beds in immigration and customs enforcement ice detention centers democrats proposed and republicans eventually agreed to a 17 percent reduction in the carrying capacity of ice facilities ostensibly with the goal of forcing the trump administration to prioritize the arrest and deportation of violent illegal aliens but the artificial cap on immigration officials ability to detain and remove any illegal immigrant from the country not just at the border marked a dramatic departure for democrats it was only a decade ago that democrats as prominent as now senate minority leader chuck schumer made a conspicuous point of using the phrase illegal immigrants an expression that has fallen out of favor on the left to communicate their commitment to enforcing immigration law and to protect low skilled american laborers from unfair competition democrats at the time often voted in favor of provisions that strengthened border security today not only do democrats oppose trump s border wall they re talking themselves out of support for any physical partitions along the border with mexico i d take the wall down said former texas congressman and potential 2020 presidential aspirant beto o rourke when asked if he would order the removal of existing border barriers senator gillibrand seemed to agree i could support it she said presuming that tearing down the partitions that currently separate the united states and mexico made sense of course it most certainly does not when on rare occasion these democratic utopians deign to consider how the country will pay for their multitrillion dollar schemes the stop gap measures they support are laughable representative ocasio cortez suggested higher marginal tax rates as high as 60 or 70 percent on your 10 millionth dollar but only about 16 000 americans showed that much taxable income in 2016 the last year in which relevant government data are available her tax hike would raise only about 720 billion over a decade a little more than what the united states spends on discretionary non defense items in a single year anyone who took a passing glance at ocasio cortez s proposal knew that democrats would soon be looking for a bigger pool of americans to squeeze that s why senator elizabeth warren proposed a wealth tax as with so many progressive proposals the value of this plan rests entirely on the notion that this idea is common to europe so why shouldn t it be adopted here but this too doesn t get the job done two university of california berkeley economists estimated that warren s plan for a 2 percent tax on the assets of households worth over 50 million and a 3 percent tax on those worth over 1 billion would raise about 2 7 trillion over a decade that would just about match what america shells out for its entitlement programs in one year or it would if warren s proposal was consistent with the constitution which it almost certainly is not the 16th amendment which gave birth to the federal income tax permits the government to levy tax on incomes not to expropriate private property when the government wants it the courts have upheld this amendment s original parameters by finding that inheritance taxes are constitutional only if they target the transfer of wealth not the wealth itself moreover warren proposes a 40 percent one time exit tax on americans who try to evade her tax by renouncing their citizenship this over broad and discriminatory provision infringes on basic rights even if it didn t it s probably unenforceable if progressives are looking for a bigger pool of money to tax they can find it most readily through economic growth more jobs mean more people paying income and payroll taxes to say nothing of consumption taxes they pay when they patronize local businesses which use that revenue in turn to hire more people and so on but for some on the left this reliable cycle of growth isn t just confusing it s unwelcome take for example the campaign waged by new york s progressives against amazon s plan to provide new york city with 25 000 new jobs each averaging an annual salary of 150 000 the centerpiece of their grievance one that eventually led amazon to conclude that investing in new york city simply wasn t worth the aggravation was 2 8 billion in tax incentives available not just to amazon but any company that qualified these activists insisted that this money would be better spent at home on much needed infrastructure projects if we were willing to give away 3 billion for this deal we could invest those 3 billion in our district ourselves if we wanted to a triumphant ocasio cortez insisted this exposes a fundamental misconception about what tax abatements are that money can t be invested in other programs because it hasn t been earned yet earnings have not yet been generated from which the money would come and now they never will only if one sees all income and revenue as public property to be doled out as a product of governmental beneficence could one adopt such a deluded view of tax incentives these progressives do not advocate a flatter and fairer tax code they don t resent tax incentives per se they only resent this one firm in part because it is so successful ocasio cortez was celebrating the preservation of the status quo at the expense of economic development and individual prosperity this is what it means today to be a progressive the policies democrats warmed to in their wilderness years are unlikely to be realized if one of them wins the white house in 2020 but that is cold comfort an influential mass of democratic voters support these radical ideas and the party s presidential candidates are campaigning on them democrats may be convincing themselves that the popularity of some of these proposals in polls insulates them from criticism but that popularity has already proven illusory if even gentlest incredulity can bring the whole progressive edifice crashing down democrats may want to consider going back to the drawing board while they still can
washington the u s trade deficit fell to an eight month low in february as imports from china plunged temporarily providing a boost to president donald trump s america first agenda and economic growth in the first quarter the surprise second straight monthly narrowing in the trade gap reported by the commerce department on wednesday was also driven by soaring aircraft exports which are likely to reverse after boeing halted deliveries of its troubled 737 max aircraft max planes have been grounded indefinitely following two deadly crashes economists warned the trade deficit would remain elevated regardless of whether the united states and china struck a trade deal that was to the white house s liking because of americans insatiable appetite for cheaper imports talks between washington and china to resolve the bitter trade war have been dragging the united states is also embroiled in conflicts with other trading partners including the european union contributing to big swings in exports and imports data in recent months even if trade negotiations are resolved in such a way as to reduce the bilateral trade deficit with china one of the trump administration s stated goals this would likely divert trade flows to other countries and have little impact on the top line u s trade deficit said emily mandel an economist at moody s analytics in west chester pennsylvania the trade deficit tumbled 3 4 to 49 4 billion in february the lowest level since june 2018 economists polled by reuters had forecast the trade shortfall widening to 53 5 billion in february the politically sensitive goods trade deficit with china a focus of the trump administration s protectionist trade policy decreased 28 2 to 24 8 billion in february as imports from the world s no 2 economy plunged 20 2 u s exports to china jumped 18 2 in february washington last year imposed tariffs on 250 billion worth of goods imported from china with beijing retaliating with duties on 110 billion worth of american products trump has defended the duties as necessary to protect domestic manufacturers from what he says is unfair foreign competition trump has delayed tariffs on 200 billion worth of chinese imports the white house argues that substantially reducing the trade deficit would lift annual economic growth by at least 3 on a sustainable basis a feat that economists have said is impossible because of low productivity and population growth the economy grew 2 9 in 2018 the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies while u s treasury debt prices rose marginally stocks on wall street fell growth estimates raised february s smaller trade deficit suggests the economy will probably avoid a sharp slowdown in growth that had been feared at the start of the year the goods trade deficit declined 1 7 to an eight month low of 72 0 billion in february when adjusted for inflation the overall goods trade deficit fell 1 8 billion to 81 8 billion also the lowest since last june goldman sachs raised its first quarter gross domestic product estimate by four tenths of percentage point to a 2 1 annualized rate the atlanta federal reserve bumped up its gdp forecast to a 2 4 pace from a 2 3 rate the economy grew at a 2 2 rate in the fourth quarter it sounds like pencils are being sharpened in order to revise up first quarter gdp forecasts said jennifer lee a senior economist at bmo capital markets in toronto in february goods exports increased 1 5 to 139 5 billion the surge in goods exports is unlikely to be sustained given slowing global economic growth the dollar s strength last year means u s manufactured goods are less competitive on foreign markets shipments of civilian aircraft soared by 2 2 billion in february exports of motor vehicles and parts increased by 0 6 billion there was a small rise in soybean exports economists expect soybean exports to remain moderate because of an outbreak of swine flu that has reduced demand for soybean meal in china in february imports rose 0 2 to 259 1 billion consumer goods imports increased by 1 6 billion in february led by a 2 1 billion rise in imports of cellphones and other household goods imports of industrial supplies and materials fell by 1 2 billion capital goods imports rose slightly pointing to slower business spending on equipment crude oil imports fell to 173 7 million barrels the lowest since march 1992 from 223 1 million barrels in january an increase in domestic production has seen the united states become less dependent on foreign oil we see more potential for stronger imports in coming months which would reestablish a trend toward wider deficits said andrew hollenhorst an economist at citigroup in new york

zimbabwe is failing to keep prices of goods down because it is refusing to let its new currency the real time gross settlement dollar to trade freely on the market economist eddie cross who is also a member of president emmerson mnangagwa s advisory council argues that if the rtgs dollar was allowed to trade freely on the interbank market the black market rate of the rtgs dollar against the united states dollar could actually decline from 5 1 to 3 1 the rate which the reserve bank of zimbabwe seems to be comfortable with writing in newsday today cross argued those with foreign currency stood to make a profit of 50 percent by trading on the black market rather than on the interbank market no exporter or beneficiary of diaspora remittance money can afford to ignore that sort of margin he said so when the reserve bank tries in violation of the monetary policy statement in february and therefore unlawfully to hold the rate at a level below what is perceived as the real rate then those holding foreign currency balances will shift their sales of such currency to the informal market so over the past month i doubt if us 100 million has been traded on the formal interbank market the effect of such activity is the opposite to what the reserve bank was trying to achieve price discovery is accepted as being the rate in informal markets and this then sets the rate at which local prices are determined in many establishments prices are listed in us dollars and the company then uses a rate 4 1 to determine what we pay in zwl or in bond notes this has the effect of driving inflation rates even higher one very unexpected development is that the much despised bond notes issued as a surrogate local paper currency is actually trading at much stronger levels that the zwl in fact at 3 5 or 3 8 to 1 but the situation is actually worse than that because trade margins in the informal sector are much higher than those levied on any formal markets and between banks margins of 5 to 10 on individual transactions are reported this means traders operating in the informal market are making huge profits and are reluctant to allow the trade to move into the formal market in this they are in fact supported by the banks themselves my own view is that if the reserve bank had allowed full implementation of the monetary policy this would have quickly resulted in the formal interbank market handling the bulk of the trades in foreign exchange in a transparent manner sales margins would decline to 1 5 or less and the commercial banks would be strengthened under such circumstances i am also quite sure that market rates would strengthen to 3 1 or even less this would reduce market prices as soon as this was recognised as the real market rate it would also allow everyone who needed foreign exchange to buy what they needed on the market through their banks the conversion rates used by everyone for price discovery would decline to 3 1 or less exactly where the rbz wants rates to stabilise my own view is that we need a weak currency to stimulate the productive sector and strengthen export activity if we under these circumstances decided to hold the rate at say 3 5 1 we would have to buy us dollars rather than sell them to hold the rate at a lower rate this would allow the rbz to build up their foreign reserves something we are going to have to do for debt clearance in the long term but what we are not facing up to is the need to mitigate the impact of these massive swings in policy on ordinary consumers since the programme was initiated inflation has been at hyperinflation levels for months and prices have doubled or trebled while incomes have stagnated 759 views

charlie charles scharf thanks magda good morning everyone and thanks for joining us before turning over to mike to take you through the first quarter financials in more detail let me share some high level thoughts about our performance reported earnings per share were 0 94 down from 1 10 a year ago revenue was down 7 both fees and net interest income declined expenses were down 1 and after tax earnings decreased 20 return on tangible common equity was 21 a few thoughts on our results our performance this quarter was mixed several of our fee based metrics in investment services were consistent with recent results while we experienced weakness in investment management and net interest income the year over year declines in revenue and earnings per share were primarily driven by the changing mix and cost of our deposits and the impact of the prior year asset management outflows we also saw lower foreign exchange volumes and volatility volume reductions and spread compression and securities lending and lower clearance volumes in pershing in addition the impact of divestitures and asset gains and particularly strong markets and deposit balances in last years first quarter also made the year over year comparison more difficult last quarter we said that if our rate assumptions played out we would expect net interest revenue to be flat to a little up versus the fourth quarter as you ll see it was down 5 subsequent to our last earnings call rates across the entire yield curve declined versus our assumptions deposit balances declined and we saw changes to the mix between interest and non interest bearing deposits we see significant competitive pressure for deposits i ll let mike discuss that in more detail as we ve said we remain focused on our expense base and our overall expenses remained well controlled while we continued to significantly increase our investment in technology and infrastructure our assets under custody and or administration reached 34 5 trillion up 3 reflecting higher market values and net new business partially offset by change in foreign currency translation rates let s go through our businesses starting with asset servicing asset servicing fees were down year over year largely due to lower foreign exchange and securities lending volumes and lower activity from existing clients on a linked quarter basis fee based metrics were generally consistent we continued to see growth in alternatives with recent wins and a strong pipeline in real estate credit funds private debt and private equity let me make a few additional comments about our blackrock strategic alliance we have said we will work with third parties to more closely integrate the front to back operating model and this is one meaningful example of how we will use data and tools to benefit our clients working on our own solutions and with third parties for the past few years we ve been working with blackrock to transform the investment manager operating model through our collaboration we ve driven increased quality and efficiency with high straight through processing rates increased transparency throughout the investment lifecycle accelerated information delivery and synchronized data that supports core functions for asset managers those benefits are available to our common clients in addition to benefits related to our new integration by integrating our data insight accounting and servicing tools into aladdin we offer seamless connectivity transparency and near real time insight to our common clients through a single platform these joint capabilities bring immediate benefits across the investment lifecycle by helping clients simplify workflows improve efficiency and drive performance in addition we re working closely with blackrock to bring more tools and functionality to the market soon this is the beginning of us offering additional value added services ourselves and working with third parties in pershing revenue was down year over year primarily due to the impact of the two previously disclosed client losses which will no longer impact year over year growth after the first quarter we also experienced lower clearance volumes than a year ago quarter when they were particularly strong this was partially offset by growth in total client assets we ve been successful in converting our broker dealer pipeline into signed business and are currently onboarding more new business than we have in many years this will start to show up in our results in the latter part of the year and we will have a more meaningful impact next year in addition the pipeline remained strong in issuer services revenue was down reflecting lower fees in depositary receipts the corporate trust business continued to grow despite a slower debt issuance market we are acting with a greater sense of urgency and our work in repositioning our sales and service teams has yielded incremental growth in rising asset classes like insurance linked securities and clos we re continuing to focus on the structured finance market where we are capturing additional market share and will benefit when issuance volumes recover we have begun converting clients onto our new clo platform which we got up and running in less than six months clients are already benefiting from our loan reporting platform which provides them with access to high quality loan and clo compliance data the combination of the two platforms will allow us to automate a number of functions and become more scalable in treasury services revenue was down slightly due to lower net interest revenue while total client deposits continued their upward trend the benefit was offset by the change in mix between non interest bearing and higher cost interest bearing deposits as clients more actively managed their balances we re focusing our relationship and sales teams on growing higher margin areas of our business including electronic payments liquidity and trade and associated deposits from our global clients we have seen some very positive results year to date in terms of client wins in these higher margin areas our focus on fx payments is showing early signs of progress with a growing pipeline in clearance and collateral management we reported 8 revenue growth we again benefited from the full run rate of the newly converted government clearing broker dealer clients higher clearance volumes related to the heightened level of u s treasury issuances and increased market volatility and growth in collateral management activity from new clients as well as increased activity from existing clients we re investing to extend the service to market participants help clients optimize their funding needs and provide more options for our clients as part of those investments we ve been developing capabilities to help market participants with new margin requirements for derivative transactions not cleared with the central counterparty clearing house since 2016 we ve been providing services to over half of institutions that are currently effective and we will start to assist smaller institutions that are coming into scope later this year turning to investment management it was another tough quarter for asset management with revenues down to 17 reflecting the impact of divestitures and cumulative assets under management outflows over the last 12 months on the positive side outflows have slowed significantly from the fourth quarter and investment performance across some key strategies has been strong which contributed to the improvement inflows and generated solid performance fees to further abate outflows weâ re developing multi asset capabilities at mellon we re realizing savings and supporting back office functions and reinvesting and developing enhanced capabilities that deliver solutions for our clients wealth management fee revenue was mainly impacted by lower net interest revenue and lower fees while still small weâ ve seen positive flows over the last few quarters in terms of talent last month we announced that senthil kumar will be joining our executive committee as chief risk officer in july senthil is an accomplished risk executive with extensive experience he knows the global financial markets he has a deep understanding of the regulatory agenda and he s the right leader to continue to strengthen our risk culture and capabilities while partnering with our business to support our growth agenda lester owens has joined us as head of operations and he is beginning to revisit how we process securities and cash with the goal of gaining material efficiencies and improving service quality and we made several important hires in the digital area to focus on building and launching new digital offerings and reimagining the end to end client journey as we look ahead while the current expectations for the yield curve will likely negatively impact our revenue growth for the next several quarters we will remain disciplined on expenses and continue to build out capabilities which should eventually enable stronger growth as you can see on page 3 of the financial highlights document we re adding new capabilities and unique functionality to help our clients become more efficient and make better investment decisions we re building and upgrading platforms in many of our businesses to better support our clients attract new clients and capture market share and we re investing in technology and digitization to drive a more efficient and complete product set than we have today while we certainly aren t happy with this level of performance we remain focused on building the franchise and remain confident in the actions we re taking with that let me turn the call over to mike michael santomassimo thanks charlie let me run through the details of our results for the quarter note that all comparisons will be on a year over year basis unless otherwise specified beginning on page 4 of the financial highlights document in the first quarter total revenue was down 7 to 3 9 billion total fee revenue was down 9 year on year with just over a third of that driven by adverse currency translation due to a stronger dollar the impact of divestitures and asset management and asset gains in the first quarter of 2018 i will cover the other drivers later in my commentary sequentially many of the investment services fee based metrics were consistent with or had small variations versus the fourth quarter with the exception of issuer services or volatility quarter to quarter is normal within investment management fees were down due to the timing of performance fees and lower investment management fees net interest revenue was down 8 driven by lower non interest bearing deposits and loan balances higher deposit rates and the impact of hedging activities this was partially offset by higher yields in the securities and loan portfolios the lower day count is a revenue drag of approximately 1 versus the fourth quarter non interest expense was down 1 the stronger u s dollar had a favorable impact of approximately 1 and sequentially expenses were down slightly excluding the notable items booked in the fourth quarter of 2018 this resulted in a 17 decline in pretax income to 1 2 billion 910 million in net income applicable to common shareholders a 15 decrease in earnings per share to 0 94 which was helped by our common stock repurchases which reduced the share count and partially offset decline in net income and our pretax operating margin was 31 now moving to capital and liquidity on page 5 our capital and liquidity ratios remain strong as of march 31 our key ratios increased since year end primarily due to earnings unrealized gains on our investment securities portfolio and capital related to stock awards offset by capital distributions common equity tier 1 capital totaled 18 2 billion as of march 31 and our cet1 ratio was 11 under the advanced approach our average lcr in the first quarter was 118 and the slr was 6 3 in response to legislation passed last year the u s agencies released a proposal at the end of march that would exclude central bank placements with some limitations from the denominator in the slr for us and a couple of our peers as written this proposed change would add about 130 basis points to 140 basis points to our slr while we support this proposal and it adds flexibility to our day to day balance sheet management our binding capital constraint remains the tier 1 leverage ratio in ccar looking at net interest revenue on page 6 first quarter net interest revenue was down 8 to 841 million and was down 5 sequentially sequentially the day count accounted for approximately 1 of the decline in net interest revenue year over year our deposit balances decreased as discussed last year our deposits in the first quarter of 2018 were higher than expected given the elevated deposits last year it might be more helpful to look at the sequential change in deposits non interest bearing deposits continue to decline as clients redeployed balances the higher yielding alternatives or used the cash for other needs our interest bearing deposits were also down slightly versus the fourth quarter as i ve mentioned each quarter over the last year pricing continues to be competitive and betas are high the rates on interest bearing deposits increased from 86 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2018 to 99 basis points this quarter on the surface this would imply the positive beta of approximately 50 across all currencies when you focus on core interest bearing u s dollar client deposits excluding wholesale funding betas have been on average a little lower than 100 although the rate curve is flattened and expectations for future hikes have lessened we have not seen â yet seen a decline in the competitive pressure for deposits higher yields in our securities and loan portfolios where the primary driver in the increase of the yield on our interest earning assets which was partially offset by the impact of lower deposits and loans and higher deposit pricing loan balances decline year over year and sequentially driven by lower margin loans in pershing due to lower client activity and lower volumes in other areas due in part to normal paydowns the net interest margin decreased 2 basis points to 1 2 sequentially the nim declined 4 basis points also note that the effects of certain hedging activities are recorded in fee revenue and not reflected in net interest revenue or the net interest margin is negatively impacted net interest revenue by a little more than 1 and the nim by approximately 2 basis points against both comparative periods the offsetting benefit is reflected in fx and other trading and is not included in the net interest margin page 7 details our expenses on a consolidated basis expenses of 2 7 billion were down 1 the stronger u s dollar had a favorable impact of approximately 1 we remained vigilant on managing expenses and funded our increased investment in technology with ongoing efficiency efforts and other decreases and expenses including lower incentive expense volume related expenses and lower bank assessment charges please note that the technology expenses are included in staff professional legal and other purchase services and software and equipment expenses we continue to believe we have opportunity to drive more efficiency across the organization in the coming quarters now turning to page 8 total investment services revenue was down 5 asset servicing revenue was down 7 to 1 4 billion primarily reflecting lower foreign exchange activity lower net interest revenue due to lower deposit lower client activity and the unfavorable impact of a stronger u s dollar we are asked a lot about pricing pressure and asset servicing while there continues to be pricing headwinds the pressure has been consistent with recent years we haven t seen a meaningful uptick from the trend pershing revenue was down 5 to 554 million previously disclosed loss business impact at growth by approximately 3 the remaining decline was primarily related to lower clearance volumes compared to the first quarter of 2018 when volumes were particularly strong the decline was partially offset by growth in client assets and good growth in the ria servicing business although ria servicing is a smaller piece of the revenue it grew roughly 10 year over year the sequential decreased reflects â lower net interest revenue primarily due to lower margin loans which was a result of lower client activity as discussed previously the new business that we were onboarding will start to show up in our results and a lot of part of the year and have a more meaningful impact in 2020 issuer services revenue was down 5 to 396 million primarily reflecting lower fees and depositary receipts and lower net interest revenue due to lower deposits in corporate trust partially offset by slightly higher volumes given that the timing of fees in depositary receipts can vary quarter to quarter based on client activity it s more meaningful to focus on fees over the full year versus one single quarter the sequential decrease primarily reflects lower depositary receipts fees volumes and net interest revenue in corporate trust treasury services revenue was down slightly to 317 million primarily reflecting lower net interest revenue although total deposits are up in this business with the greatest traction coming from clients in asia we were seeing the impact of lower non interest bearing deposits and higher competitive pressure on pricing for interest bearing deposits clearance and collateral management revenue was up 8 to 276 million primarily reflecting growth and collateral management and clearance volumes while the majority of the growth in this business was driven by the conversion of new clients due to a competitor exiting the u s government clearing business we are seeing growth from other new clients and also increased activity particularly in the u s average tri party collateral management balances were up 21 reflecting the strong growth a few additional items of note as you can see foreign exchange and other trading revenue was down 7 within that foreign exchange revenue within the segment was down 18 driven by lower client volumes and lower volatility and securities revenue was down 8 assets under custody and or administration increased 3 year over year to 34 5 trillion primarily reflecting higher market values and net new business offset by the impact of stronger u s dollar which negatively impacted assets under custody administration growth by approximately 2 turning to page 9 although we have already covered all the details for investment services hopefully this will be an easy reference page for you it summarizes the key drivers that affected revenue versus the first quarter of 2018 for each of the investment services businesses now turning to page 10 for the investment management business highlights total investment management revenue was down 14 asset management revenue was down 17 year over year and 3 sequentially to 637 million almost half of the year over year decrease resulted from the impact of the 2018 divestitures and the unfavorable impact of a stronger u s dollar principally versus the british pound the rest of the decrease primarily reflects the cumulative impact of assets under management outflows over the last year in lower performance fees the sequential decreased primarily reflects the timing of performance fees and the impact of outflows partially offset by higher equity market values our overall flows were flat in the quarter we had 4 billion of outflows from equities driven in part by lower performing strategies in a shift to pathos and 2 billion of outflows from index products primarily driven by two clients withdrawing assets multi asset and alternative outflows were 4 billion fixed income and cash turned to inflows with 3 billion and 2 billion respectively our liability driven investment strategies had 5 billion in inflows after strong inflows in the second half of last year and the pipeline for ldi remains strong overall assets under management of 1 8 trillion is up 7 versus the end of the fourth quarter primarily due to higher markets wealth management revenue was down 5 year over year and essentially flat sequentially to 302 million with a year over year decrease primarily reflecting lower net interest revenue and fees within wealth management client assets decreased 1 and were up sequentially to 253 billion wealth management client deposits grew both year over year and sequentially however net interest revenue overall decline due to lower loans and higher deposit pricing now turning to our other segment on page 11 fee revenue decreased year over year primarily reflecting asset related gains recorded in the first quarter of 2018 also just to reminder that the last year we recorded 49 million of net securities losses related to the sale of approximately 1 billion of debt securities non interest expense decreased year over year reflecting lower incentive expense the sequential decreased primarily reflects the expenses associated with severance and relocating our corporate headquarters both recorded in 4q 2018 looking ahead to the second quarter there were a few things to consider for your modeling with respect to the net interest revenue i ll walk you through the assumptions for the key variables impacting nir as of today our total deposit balances and non interest bearing deposits are a little lower than the average deposits in the first quarter we are expecting net average non interest bearing deposits will continue to come down short term rates have declined since the first quarter and the yield curve has flattened as a result we expect the yield and our securities portfolio to be relatively flat to the first quarter as i mentioned earlier competition for deposits is still high and thus we expect that the rate paid on interest bearing deposits will increase a little given these assumptions we would expect net interest revenue to decline between 3 and 5 in the second quarter versus the first quarter given the levels of assets under management we should benefit modestly versus the first quarter in investment management fees and lastly we continue to expect the full year 2019 effective tax rate to be approximately 21 with that operator can you please open the lines for questions question and answer session operator thank you our first question comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead elizabeth graseck hi good morning charles scharf good morning betsy elizabeth graseck couple of questions one on the deposit guidance â the nir guidance that you just laid out i know you gave us a lot of detail around 2q and i guess i m just wondering as we think forward from there do you anticipate that the deposit competition would slow and then really it s a function of yield curve or is there anything that you expect youâ d be doing in the balance sheet to shift the trajectory of nir if this current rate environment held michael santomassimo yes hey betsy itâ s mike i ll take a shot and charlie can add if you want i think if rates sort of stay where they are we would expect over time that pricing sort of stabilizes as i said in my remarks we haven t quite seen that yet but we would expect pricing to stabilize as we go and as you sort of think about the new rate environments and things we can do on the balance sheet we re doing all the things you would sort of expect us to do as we sort of look to optimize as we look forward both on the funding side and how we sort of manage the securities portfolio primarily elizabeth graseck okay anything on like bringing down other wholesale cost of funds or shifting the liability structure at all that might help out here michael santomassimo yes we re looking at all of that and i think there s things we can do both on our long term debt that we ve got both on tenor and quantum as well as sort of all of the funding sources that weâ re sort of looking at elizabeth graseck okay thanks all right and then separate topic on the efficiency improvements that you outlined maybe give us a sense as to the quantum of that and kind of the time frame that you think that that would occur over charles scharf sure hey betsy it s charlie so when we talked last quarter what we said was we re continuing to significantly increase our investment in technology and we wouldn t expect to see a meaningful change in expenses this year so obviously embedded in there are a whole series of efficiency improvements that we expect to get throughout the year and we feel very good about our ability to deliver that i ll say that we are in the early stages of figuring out kind of what s next taking it to the next level we have several new people who have joined us as i mentioned lester who runs over 20 000 of the 50 000 people i think we all have â we all believe that there s continued meaningful opportunity to become more efficient and improve the quality and so hopefully we would expect there to be more but not quite sure on the timing yet elizabeth graseck okay and then just lastly onâ charles scharf all i can say is just you can assume that we re pushing as hard as we can elizabeth graseck okay and then just lastly on the announcement that you made with blackrock regarding the aladdin functionality that you re enabling your clients to benefit from could you give us a sense as to how much you think that is going to help out either on your efficiency or your client s efficiency and i know in the press release you highlighted this was the first of many or â enhancements that you re anticipating maybe give us some color on the roadmap that you re expecting with this strategic alliance charles scharf yes so i put it into two different categories thereâ s series of things that we ve been working with blackrock for a long period of time line that relate to the processing requirement that we have between what aladdin does and what our capabilities are and as we have gone through that journey with them and by the way just to be clear a lot of it is â i m not saying this is just us weâ ve just taken the efficiency with which we process our transactions to an extraordinarily high level that we haven t seen in many other places and so that s an opportunity which benefits us because we become more efficient but it obviously benefits to the asset manager as well because they see efficiencies on their side as well as quality improvement with the extraordinarily high rates of straight through processing that we ultimately have so those are our opportunities that common clients have and then in addition to that we ve introduced a series of analytical capabilities that benefit both operations professionals and investment managers embedded in the aladdin technology that we think provides further benefits so i think as we look at it it benefits us for sure but it also creates additional capabilities for clients that today â that are available in the marketplace today this isn t something that we re dreaming of this isn t an idea that we have it s there today and our goal is to continue to expand the integration and to think about other third parties that are important for our clients who are non aladdin clients elizabeth graseck got it okay that s very helpful thank you so much charlie charles scharf thanks betsy operator thank you our next question comes from the line of glenn schorr with evercore isi please go ahead glenn schorr hi thanks so much looking for a little more color on the comments around the significant deposit pressure and we all know it s real and ongoing but i m curious on how it manifests itself how the dialogue happens and more importantly if you have metrics around overall client profitability that you can price per client i m just looking for a little bit behind the scenes if i could michael santomassimo hey glenn itâ s mike sure so as you know most of what we do is a â it operates in a pretty competitive marketplace right across lots of strong competitors both here in the u s and outside the u s and so our clients are â and many of our clients are doing business with multiple providers both in the asset servicing space and the treasury services space so the price transparency around deposits is there for clients and so they re very well informed and in dialogue with all of those competitors and so it happens naturally and sort of the conversation around what am i getting paid on my deposits and here s what so and so is sort of offering and so very natural conversation sort of with clients and that â as i said that transparency is very much there in the marketplace now just keep in mind as you know most of our deposits are linked to operational activities but there is ability for clients to sort of move deposits on the margin to take advantage of where there are differences and what clients are sort of paying so i think that s the nature of that what was the second part of the question charles scharf our client profitability michael santomassimo client profitability sorry yes so we do very detailed client profitability for our clients and have a very good sense of what s driving that and can be smart about pricing both deposits as well as sort of the overall relationship in a way that optimizes it by client so we feel pretty good about that charles scharf yes and i ll just add to it i think it s a strong discipline that exists not just in how much we make on nii of the client but it s a relationship view where we see all the activity that we do with the client across the entire firm and i think we try and be smart about maximizing profit and returns relative to what the relationship looks like glenn schorr okay i appreciate that just one other quick one and we could stay high level but the notion of non transparent etfs obviously is on display with the secâ s recent comments so the question is from both asset management asset servicing i would think from asset managementâ s stand point i m curious on your thoughts on how much of a benefit and how much product design you might have in motion and on the flip side is there risk on the asset servicing side simply because i think of a generically of â look these products if they succeed in the future or succeed because they bring a lower cost and lower cost investment management fee lower cost on the servicing side so how much of an impact is that there for you guys charles scharf glenn we re looking at that now as you know it s not a big piece of the pie now nor do i personally think it will be a big piece anytime soon but we re spending some time looking at it now both in the asset management side and asset servicing make sure we understand it fully glenn schorr okay i appreciate it guys thanks charles scharf thanks operator thank you weâ ll next go to brian bedell with deutsche bank brian bedell hi great thanks good morning guys i just to go back to the deposit questions to charlie and mike can you talk a little bit about some of your organic growth initiatives the progress on the priorities that you highlighted in the presentation in terms of the ability to grow deposits organically and then youâ ve potentially stabilized the net interest revenue profile maybe regrow it maybe later in the year or is that longer term michael santomassimo yes i think â just sort of think about the organic growth initiatives i mean charlie sort of highlighted a bunch of them by business and as we said this will take some time to really be meaningful across any of the businesses or sort of in total but we re seeing good traction in a lot of it charlie highlighted the corporate trust activity that we re seeing we re seeing some green shoots in sort of that business as we sort of build out the capabilities pershing continues to be strong and getting stronger in terms of the pipeline asset management has been doing a good job building out some differentiated strategies like risk parity and a whole bunch of other items that will build over time we ve seen â also seen some good performance in some of the key strategies that will take in that business as well and so i think we feel confident sort of our ability to sort of execute on these but as we ve said it will take some time to see it come into the picture i think â do you want to add anything charlie charles scharf no i just â we re going to hide behind the facts of the quarter right they are what they are nii is disappointing that s obviously clear when you look at the results but when we look at the underlying metrics of the progress that we re making which is what will drive the long term performance within the asset servicing business we feel very good about the pipelines and the types of things that we re seeing the things that we ve announced with blackrock and other things we re working on are what s going to drive the success in the future both in fees and ultimately in our ability to attract deposits which come at that business we ve talked about pershing extensively about getting through these couple of losses that we ve had but we ve got a lot more coming and we feel great about the pipeline there issuer services we talked about the share that we re taking or i should say winning back in some respects in the corporate trust business treasury services we feel very good about the way we re building the business and what the opportunities are there clearance and collateral management is done extremely well not just because of the conversions from jpmorgan but just the underlying growth that we ve been able to generate there and investment management we had the outflows last year but performance is coming back so i just â we do have to get through the reality of the interest rate environment but the things that we re doing to drive growth over a period of time we don t feel any worse about and i think on the margin we feel slightly better and we re continuing to drive it but it will take time to show up in the numbers brian bedell that s super helpful and then just on the back to the blackrock announcement i think its 40 or so clients said â i think we saw in the press in terms of common clients between blackrock and bank of new york can you just talk about the timing of the integration of their services on the two platforms and then the organic growth potential from that combined offering as you look to your other bny clients that are not using aladdin right now but maybe could either switch and sort of how you think about that in the long term paradigm of integrating the front through back office given the sort of industries shift in that direction charles scharf yes as i said before the additional capabilities and the widgets in the apps that we have created the integrated into aladdin are available immediately and our ability to integrate data in a more seamless way to help drive the more efficient operational process that s available today so we made the announcement we re in conversation with the common clients that we have to make sure they understand what the capabilities are and so we ll see what the next couple of months what the uptick is again we feel very good about the value add that s there and as i said we re continuing to â the capabilities that we announced aren t the end of the road we re continuing to build new capabilities which will be integrated beyond aladdin as i said we believe that we should be an open platform in fact most asset managers use more than one provider to the extent they want to use aladdin we re obviously there to support them today but we also want to be where our clients are and so there are a lot of very strong platforms out there that our clients use you can assume that we re having lots of discussions and the benefits that we ve been able to bring to aladdin we would assume we would able to bring to other providers as well so we can help a bunch of broader set of our clients brian bedell thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of michael carrier with bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead michael carrier thanks guys maybe just a two part question you gave a lot of guidance on the net interest income just wanted to get sense given the rebound in the markets can you provide some context on how you see that benefiting some of the fee revenues ahead and then have you seen any improvement on the transaction side across some of your businesses like throughout the quarter given the weak start that we saw across the capital markets at beginning of the quarter charles scharf yes i ll start on the second part first mike i think transaction volumes were pretty muted all quarter so we didn t see really any big uptick in the second part as we sort of came out of the quarter so it was pretty consistent and if you recall last year last year s volumes were very high particularly in the first half of the first quarter of 2018 so we certainly didn t see even as the market rallied in the first quarter at least in the u s we didn t see that transaction volume sort of follow with it so i think that s the case i think on just the overall market impact i think you can see in our disclosures in asset management what the aum looks like so that will give you a good sense of how we re entering the quarter by asset class and how to think about that and then on the asset servicing side in particular just if you recall roughly two thirds are a little less of our aci is fixed income and so we get the benefit of the market impact on the rest of other pieces of aci â so you get a sense of how to model that as you go into the second quarter michael carrier okay thanks a lot operator thank you our next question comes from the line of brennan hawken with ubs please go ahead adam beatty thank you and good morning this is adam beatty in for brennan just wanted to step back for a sec and talk about eps growth you guys said earlier you outlined being able to grow adjusted eps off for 2018 base could you just outline for us what are the key building blocks or drivers of that where you expect to have that growth thanks michael santomassimo well just to be clear as we ve laid out here it s a different environment today than when we made those remarks and so our ability to fill exactly those words is certainly far more challenging and i m not sure how to answer the question other than revenues and expenses right i mean we have the pressures that we ve seen in nii which we ve laid out fees presumably will continue to grow both with the net wins that weâ re seeing in our businesses the improved flows in asset management and the market levels and as we ve talked about we re going to continue to be very disciplined on expenses and continue to see what else is available adam beatty understood thank you then just to hone in on deposits particularly non interest bearing deposits they were down a fair bit and you ve talked a bit about that how much of that do you view as seasonal versus the yield seeking that you identified and what s the outlook should we expect the stabilization from here charles scharf i wouldn t think of the decline as seasonal i don t know that would be the right way to think about it and look i think as we ve said for a while and as i said in my remarks we would expect those to come down a little bit more in the second quarter and i wouldn t go any further than that at this point adam beatty great thank you for taking our questions operator thank you our next question comes from the line of alex blostein with goldman sachs please go ahead alexander blostein thanks hi guys good morning so first question just looking for a little bit more color on beyond sort of second quarter commentary and specifically as the yield curve has flattened out here can you help us think through the repricing risk on the fixed side of the securities portfolio to kind of where you reinvested today whatâ s rolling on versus what s rolling off and if the curve kind of stays at its current state what sort of the spread pressure we should anticipate over the next coming quarters michael santomassimo yes so alex this is mike so i think what we ve said in the past which is still the case call it a third of the securities portfolio reprices every quarter roughly a third so that s either maturing securities or floating that sort of coming into what the current rate â what the yield curve looks like so i think you can sort of use that as the basis to do your modeling and then i think as i said for the second quarter we would expect pricing to inch up a little bit on interest bearing deposits and so that ll give you a sense of how to think about the compression there alexander blostein okay and then on the expense outlook i don t know if i heard you guys update the guidance there but i think on the last call you talked about sort of flattish maybe slightly higher expenses for the year which i think call it 10 9 billion expense base last year obviously the environment has changed where you guys are doing what you can on that front so a nice reduction in the headcount this quarter but i guess as you look beyond does the expense got hold still kind of flattish expenses for the year or should we anticipate slightly lower costs charles scharf i think i answered this earlier i think we are still very comfortable with what we ve said which is we re continuing to significantly increase the investment in technology and offset it with efficiencies that we re getting elsewhere and so our ability to deliver on that i think we still feel very very good about we ve got some new people in some big jobs here that are continuing to dive in and figure out what comes next we all feel like we ve got a lot more opportunity than we ve currently addressed but not exactly sure what the timing is so more to come as the year unfolds operator thank you sir our next question comes from vivek juneja with j p morgan please go ahead vivek juneja hi thanks charlie i just wanted to follow up on something you mentioned earlier you said the widgets are already for the aladdin to be able to roll that out to all your clients but you also talked about developing stuff for the others are you already ready with developing products for other providers like aladdin or is that something in process where are you in that process charles scharf yes that s a good question and so just to be clear the capabilities that we have in these applications in widgets can be integrated into countless operating environments elsewhere as long as they can accept them so these weren t built necessarily for one specific environment and so we re going full speed with others vivek juneja okay great and so is the next step now just sort of going out and offering this to your asset servicing clients and is this something that you d get paid for charlie a separate fee or does it roll into the overall fee rate can you walk through sort of what it means from our revenue and business standpoint now that you have this and can provide this charles scharf yes so for the things that we have rolled out now these are â they re actually capabilities that existing clients currently have in our asset servicing space and so whatever we get paid for the business we have with them they have access to those capabilities what the integration with aladdin does is it makes it far far easier to actually access our capabilities at the act at the same time they re accessing all of the information and capabilities that lead up to the time we get involved in the trade so just think of the ability to be â have one screen with your front end on one part of the screen your backend on the other and being able to answer questions real time effectively on one screen and so to the extent that we build out additional capabilities just like we wouldn t our typical business those are things that we might or might not charge for but what we re doing today is what we re getting paid for vivek juneja okay charles scharf but i would say that there is relatively little uptick on the things that we have created because it s hard to use them in concert with the front end and what we ve done with aladdin solves that problem vivek juneja okay great now if we â compare this with what state street did by buying crd do you feel this sort of completely fills that without having â you having to do the acquisition or does this more stuff that you need to add or built from a capability standpoint charles scharf yes listen i think we ve been very very clear that we don t believe that owning a front end is necessary or even the right thing i m certainly given what our businesses as i said before many â most asset managers use multiple providers staying at the forefront of building capabilities on the front end is an entire business unto its own that has changed and will continue to change dramatically that s not our sweet spot but there are others that do nothing but this that focus on that and some of them are really good at it and so what we want to do is make sure that we re working as closely together as we can not just on integrating capabilities but working on common data sets in a whole series of things that do make the process much more seamless than it s been and so that s the journey that we re on and we think that s it would be extremely attractive to asset managers and asset owners vivek juneja great thank you very much operator thank you weâ ll next go to the line of ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead kenneth usdin hi thanks good morning guys just a big picture question on just the activity levels i think for the last couple of quarters we ve been understanding just how good the year ago was and getting down to some different level now can you just characterize what do you think of the activity that we saw across the businesses in the first quarter and if you re getting any sense that you re feeling that this is either a baseline or more stable or more just and trying to put it into perspective and how you would think about a kind of a normal environment michael santomassimo hey ken itâ s mike i think given sort of the moves in the market that you ve seen over the last couple quarters i think the activity is definitely a little more muted than what we would have expected in terms of just pure transaction activity across the different businesses is it a new normal it s hard to say right i think that could change tomorrow depending on sort of how investors are sort of feeling and the activity levels that are sort of coming off the back of that so â but i would definitely say it s a little more muted than what we would have thought just given the moves and that are happening in the market kenneth usdin okay follow up on the deposit competition that you mentioned last quarter you talked about a 100 betas obviously with rates stopping we can t really measure beta anymore but when you talk about competition for those deposits how do you gauge when that starts to abate what do you think itâ s driving that pressure and do you have a feel for the magnitude of deposit costs increase you re still expecting michael santomassimo yes look i think it s â i think the way we re going to know itâ s abating is based on the client dialogue that we re having right which is happening every day right across different teams so we get real time information about sort of what we re seeing in the marketplace and so i think that will be the best judge as we start to see those dialogues change a bit but do you would expect as we discussed earlier that as rate sort of stayed here for a while that that pressure would it be at some point charles scharf yes and just how we re building on it to that the way we know is we sit in the room with the business leaders and we d go through exactly what they are seeing in the marketplace as they talk to clients because it s not like we just sit and look at a bunch of reports and see numbers go up or down those conversations where s the money coming from where s the money going to and exactly what rates are we paying what rates are others paying and i just echo what mike said is i think as we ve gone through a period of change people have done some different things in the marketplace but as rates stabilize you would expect deposit â the rates that people pay to do the same as well michael santomassimo ken i would just add i think if you looked across the folks that we compete with every day in our businesses and you could actually see into those businesses you would see the same dynamic it s just more transparent here kenneth usdin yes okay last quick one just on ccar obviously we know you just submitted you guys did a nice job asking for that re up for last year capital ratios continue to build can you help us frame just how you re thinking about capital return in the context of still being in a really strong position versus still waiting for some of the things from the fed to swing one way or the other charles scharf i think we ve said what we have to say on capital right which is to the extent that we re not going to be using it to grow we believe we should return it and we feel good about our position and the process is the process kenneth usdin okay very good thank you guys charles scharf thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy of rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy thank you good morning following up on the deposit commentary that you guys had this morning have you been able to determine from your customers â the customers that are taking deposits out of non interest bearing which ones are putting into interest bearing versus putting it into their own businesses have you been able to decipher how much is going into their own business versus than just moving in over for a higher yielding deposits michael santomassimo yes i think it s almost an impossible question to answer with any degree of like certainty by client but i think as you sort of look at the themes like it s clear people are managing their cash more â they re trying to optimize the yield to get on their cash and being a little â having more urgency around that and some are â some asset managers are putting to work some companies that we deal other corporates that we deal with maybe investing but it s hard to say that with any degree of certainty gerard cassidy i see okay thanks and then second if chairman paul pivots similar to what fed reserve chairman greenspan did following the 1994 1995 tightening cycle where they were raising rates in the spring of 1995 and cut by july if we see rate cuts and some of the futures markets is calling that the fed funds are able to be cut this year how quickly do you think your deposit betas could fall in that kind of environment charles scharf i think it s â i mean obviously we ll have to see what s happening at that time but if rates start to decline we would expect that we would recapture that very quickly gerard cassidy great thank you michael santomassimo thanks gerard operator thank you our next question comes from the line of brian kleinhanzl with kbw please go ahead brian kleinhanzl great good morning quick question on the loans you mentioned that there was lower client activity driving down the balances in the lending can you just maybe highlight it or give a little bit more color as to what the client activity was was it decreasing and is that expected to increase at any point michael santomassimo yes like loans are really small driver for us as you know from our balance sheets but just to give you a sense of a little bit of color we have margin loan activity or other securities based lending activity in pershing as an example and we saw that come down we don t think that s a permanent decline but we saw that come down based on activity in the quarter that s just an example but it s a pretty small driver overall for the results brian kleinhanzl okay and then just separate question on asset servicing you mentioned you saw a growth in the alternatives was that new or was it alternative clients new to outsourcing or was it just building relationships from clients that are already outsourced charles scharf the mix both brian kleinhanzl okay thanks charles scharf okay i think that s the last one thanks we appreciate everyone dialing in thanks for the time we ll talk soon michael santomassimo thanks everyone operator thank you this concludes today s conference call webcast a replay of this conference call webcast will be available on the bny mellon investor relations website at 2 p m eastern standard time today have a good day

gov phil murphy s proposal to raise taxes on new jersey s wealthiest residents has inspired a raft of opposition from business leaders and many fellow democrats even as the governor s allies step up pressure on lawmakers to embrace a so called millionaires tax the tension between the two camps was on full display during a recent town hall at camden county college where a public employee heavy crowd erupted in chants of millionaires tax while senate president stephen sweeney a foe of the idea was instead making the case for rollbacks to pension and health benefits for public workers the money to be raised from a higher tax rate on income over 1 million 447 million is relatively small compared with murphy s 38 6 billion budget proposal but the issue has become a stand in for a larger political battle over how to deal with new jersey s deteriorating fiscal health here are the arguments for and against a millionaires tax which will likely feature in negotiations between murphy and lawmakers as they approach a june 30 deadline for finalizing a new state budget tax fairness central to murphy s proposal is promoting what he calls tax fairness or asking wealthy residents and big corporations to pay more toward programs that will help the middle class and working families in an era of worsening income inequality murphy sought the same policy last year but he was forced to retreat during last minute budget wrangling he settled instead for a multimillionaires tax that raised the marginal tax rate on each dollar earned over 5 million from 8 97 percent to 10 75 percent the governor now wants to expand that higher rate to take effect on each dollar earned over 1 million affecting about 18 000 state residents and 19 000 non state residents according to estimates from the treasury department a joint rutgers eagleton fairleigh dickinson university poll released this month said more than 70 percent of residents support the proposal under murphy s plan the 477 million raised from the new rate would help new jersey pour more than 200 million in new money into public schools avoid nj transit fare hikes boost the state s pension payment by more than a half billion dollars and build modestly on programs such as universal pre kindergarten and tuition free community college all while adding to the state s surplus a key factor in how ratings agencies weigh a state s creditworthiness more garden state news nj preschoolers have highest autism rates ever in us contentious bill nj legalizes assisted suicide as murphy signs bill into law overreliance on millionaires but opponents point out that new jersey already has one of the most progressive income tax structures in the country meaning the state s biggest earners making up less than 3 percent of taxpayers account for more than 40 percent of income tax revenues making new jersey even more dependent on high earners is unwise these critics say a recent report from wall street credit rating agency moody s suggests why during the financial crisis a decade ago states with a high dependence on income taxes saw large declines in revenue from those taxes new jersey for example experienced an 18 percent drop in collections from its income tax the state s largest source of revenue further raising taxes on the wealthy is risky when another recession is widely believed to be around the corner moody s implied a similar decline in income at a time when income taxes on the highest earners make up a larger share of these states total revenue could present california connecticut new jersey and new york with new budgetary pressure the report said the specter of millionaire flight new jersey s heavy reliance on high earners has fueled another argument against a millionaires tax stated most clearly by former gov chris christie during his first budget address as governor in 2010 if you tax them they will leave the effect and scale of outmigration has been fiercely debated in recent years with the new jersey business industry association or njbia depicting an exodus that has cost the state millions of residents and billions in lost economic activity however since new jersey last raised its top marginal tax rate in 2004 from 6 37 percent to 8 97 percent the number of tax returns with income over 1 million has more than doubled according to the state division of taxation and an ambitious 2016 study by stanford sociologists and u s treasury department economists it examined every federal tax return with more than 1 million in reported income filed in every state from 1999 to 2011 concluded that millionaire tax flight is occurring but at such low rates that it has little socioeconomic impact for high income people deciding where to live taxes are really just not a major consideration cristobal young an author of the study who has since moved to cornell university said in an interview more important factors are family social and job considerations his research found if new jersey is concerned about migration out of the state they really need to be looking at low income individuals young said those are the people who are moving out of state those are the people who can t afford to live in new jersey because of the very high cost of housing uncompetitive for business but the argument made by the njbia and other business organizations extends beyond the phenomenon of outmigration they say a millionaires tax will be yet another strike against new jersey in its attempt to attract top talent and new businesses businesses in new jersey already feel beset upon after murphy has worked with democratic lawmakers to enact a higher corporate business tax new sick leave requirements expanded family leave and a 15 minimum wage all policies that business groups say will increase the cost of doing business in new jersey a millionaires tax could affect some of the more than 4 000 small businesses whose owners pay taxes on business income through their personal tax returns and could make new jersey less attractive to high earning executives looking at new places to set up shop said michele siekerka njbia president and ceo you re going from being the highest to extreme outlier siekerka said referring to the fact that new jersey already has the highest marginal income tax rate in the region the cumulative impact of these policies must be paid attention to reform first tax second sweeney was long a champion of a millionaires tax under christie but he reversed his position after the 2017 federal tax overhaul imposed a cap on state and local tax deductions that had the effect of raising the effective tax rate on many of new jersey s wealthiest residents because they could no longer write off all their state and local taxes on their federal tax returns to sweeney d gloucester the debate over a millionaires tax is secondary to the more pressing conversation about getting the state s spending under control sweeney has spent recent weeks touting the recommendations of a path to progress report he spearheaded last year that sought to address some of new jersey s thorniest structural problems from the high costs of public education to ballooning debt and a severely underfunded pension system two of the report s most controversial recommendations call for shifting public workers from what is now the equivalent of a platinum level plan on the affordable care act exchange to a gold level plan while also converting new and recent hires to a so called hybrid plan that allows only a portion of their salary to be pensionable in sweeney s view raising taxes without fixing the underlying structural problems is counterproductive murphy however is a fierce ally of public sector unions and has refused to publicly endorse any proposal that would cut their pension or health benefits instead his administration has worked with the unions to identify hundreds of millions of dollars in health care savings an approach he says is more effective than legislating cuts in their positions murphy sweeney and assembly speaker craig coughlin d middlesex all have the power to block a proposal they don t like on the other hand they can

washington gov jay inslee joins dan pfeiffer from the campaign trail in new hampshire to talk about why climate change is the defining issue of his presidential campaign what he s learned from running a state government and his plan to beat donald trump learn more about jay inslee here show notes transcription below pod save america april 16 2019 interview dan pfeiffer and jay inslee dan pfeiffer he s the governor of washington and a democrat running for president jay inslee governor thanks for being here jay inslee yeah beautiful day to run for president pfeiffer aren t they all inslee i think we picked the right state too pfeiffer that s right you were the first ever pod save america live show guest when we were in seattle early 2017 inslee now you guys owe your tremendous success to me there pfeiffer that s what we tell everyone it s all because of governor inslee i wanted to start with the issue that you ve put at the center of your campaign climate change you have billed yourself as the climate change candidate you ve said that what distinguishes you from other candidates is that this is going to climate change campaign what does that mean in terms of how you re running your campaign how are you different from other candidates in terms of climate change inslee well number one i am the only candidate who is saying very specifically and unequivocally that defeating climate change has to be the number one priority of the united states it has to be the first foremost and paramount duty of the next president and i firmly believe that i believe the urgency of the moment is unparalleled actually in human history because we ve got exactly one more chance to turn this ship around or our children and our grandchildren and live very very degraded existences it is an existential threat that is not an overstatement the science is clear on this it is accelerating it s now starting to touch us where we live it s burning down our towns like paradise california where i visited it s flooding the midwest i was in hamburg iowa yesterday where a town it s been there since 1858 never flooded before and it s been virtually destroyed we re having to raise are our roads in the seacoast here in new hampshire they re you know they ve got sea coast issues so everywhere you go you re learning that this is a beast that has to be confronted and and so we have to have a president to do this and i am saying unequivocally that it has to be job one because it is not job one it will not get done it takes as you know enormous capital to restructure your economy and that s fundamentally what we re going to have to do and so that is a unique position to have said that it s also unique because i actually believe it it has an added benefit because i truly believe this i ve been working on this for over 20 years co authored a book about it in 2007 helped fund the start the u s climate alliance a couple of years ago and we now have 23 states in that regard introduced legislation in 2003 so this has been a longtime pursuit of mine and i think that i m uniquely qualified amongst the field to understand from a policy perspective what really needs to get done and the third uniqueness and there may be a theme in our discussion is that instead of having just talked about this i ve actually done things about it and we ve you know we ve developed a huge wind industry six billion dollar wind industry in our state in part because of the initiative i worked on we ve built the spin off companies because of my clean energy development fund we are electrifying our transportation system now we re going to have 50 000 electric cars on the road here fairly shortly we just passed a 100 percent clean electrical grid bill through our house and i hope to sign that shortly so that is unique having been an executive and i have learned having been a member of congress and an executive that there is a difference between making speeches and actually figuring out the mechanics and the hard work to get something done so those are three differences that make me unique pfeiffer what is the inslee plan to deal with climate change looks like inslee well we will be rolling out a very comprehensive plan here and in the weeks to come but i ll give you just a summary if you will bottom line is that we need to have a clean energy economy in the next several decades and that has to happen it is a scientific necessity there is no doubt about this and the good news is we know we are capable of doing this because we re seeing the beginning of that technological revolution we re seeing wind turbines and in iowa by the way trump is wrong wind turbines do not cause cancer they cause jobs ok this is about jobs fundamentally and it is important to say that because this is a unique moment where you have two things happening at the same time just at the right time number one it s a matter of urgent peril but it is a matter of tremendous economic promise so our plan is to build on economic promise of clean energy jobs that are now starting across the nation we would have a multi sectoral approach where we basically go and look at our economy and build new clean energy jobs to build this decarbonised system in transportation it means we need to electrify transportation system which we are doing rapidly both will buy some regulatory touch and some incentives to help people finance it it means building electric charging stations up and down our roads which we re doing in washington state it means doing the r d it is necessary to continue the development of batteries that are so important to the whole clean energy world so you need to build a decarbonised transportation system that means building enormous infrastructure because we know they can t build a birdhouse in washington d c but we have 70 billion dollars of infrastructure and transportation 70 percent of which is for public transportation right now which is low carbon so when your transportation system is a dramatic reversal of the huge carbon dioxide emissions that we have now we need an enormous r d effort our research and development has been pathetic in the past we spent more money developing one kind of jeep than the entire clean energy system of the united states it means going to a fossil free electrical grid and as i indicated we just passed a bill a couple days ago that would have 100 percent electrical grid moving fairly rapidly and were closing off our coal fired plants just in the next several years and throughout this 100 percent clean electrical grid millions of jobs associated with building everything from wind turbines and solar plants to public transportation and effort to finance this in part by removing the enormous subsidies that taxpayers are shackled with twenty seven billion dollars right now go to the oil gas companies that gravy train needs to stop and throughout this we need to embed the idea and adjust transition adjust transition means you take care of the victims frequently communities of poverty and communities of color to focus our efforts on the first victims and also help those who were in industries that are going to transition to do the things like we re doing in centralia in our coal plant which we have a 55 million dollar fund to help the people during that transition so that s a quick run through the future pfeiffer so a couple of questions on that recognizing that you re going to roll out all the details later on but do you see your plan as dramatically different slightly different as the green new deal that has been proposed in congress inslee oh i think it s very much consistent with the goals of this and by the way i think the green new deal has been helpful it s helpful because it s got people talking about climate change so that s good it s helpful because it s raised people s ambitions as to the scope of this and it s helped bring in more people communities of color and those in all kinds of new communities to see themselves and part of this discussion so i think it s been really helpful but we all know including the drafters of the green new deal we re going to have to all work together to develop the policies to actually make it happen and that s where i come in working with other people to do that we re going to have these very specific proposals and it will be based on 20 years of work this is not a bumper sticker this is a lifetime work of mine and i m excited about rolling it out pfeiffer so the politics of climate change are very difficult and they have been for a long time you know in your state this past fall there was a carbon fee that was on the ballot you worked very hard to get that elected the state rejected it in some places and defeated very handily in the rural areas what did you learn from that defeat that you would apply to efforts in an entirely administration to enact climate change legislation that will require even if you get rid of the filibuster someone like joe manchin or other conservative democrats to vote for it inslee well number one i learned that look you re up against the biggest special interests in world history the oil and gas companies putting 32 million dollars to defeat this and as you know with 32 million dollars you can blow a lot of smoke and create a lot of discordant and deceptive information and that s hard to beat at the ballot i learned that the most important renewable energy source in america is is perseverance meaning you can t give up you just gotta go to plan b c and d and that s what we re doing and the good news is that we have multiple avenues to to defeat climate change not just one policy or your or you re toast there s all kinds of policies and so what we re doing now is we turn right around and developed a policy a portfolio of things that if i get them through my legislature we ll have roughly the same carbon pollution reduction as the initiative would have had i m very excited about getting those those things through the third thing i have learned and it s not so much about the initiative is that the the jobs you can create here are not just in urban areas this is a small town rural job development program that we re going to be talking about on the trail so you know our carbon fiber manufacturing for electric cars this is in seattle it s in moses lake small town in central washington our biggest solar panel isn t in everett and you know in the western courts in a town of 300 in eastern washington this is a job creator in multiple places and that s important for democrats we need to win in the midwest we need to do a little better in some of these areas and this is a great job creator to move forward now you mentioned the filibuster i don t want to leave the conversation without talking about that there is absolutely no way to make progress on this without eliminating the filibuster and that s why i m dedicated to that and i ve been saying this for several years and was the first candidate to say that running for president because you really cannot be dedicated to climate change legislation or health care legislation or anything of any dimension unless the filibuster goes it has been weaponized by mitch mcconnell and we have to step up to the plate and realize that senatorial push needs to go now how do we do it with the democrats you might not get a vote at times with maybe one democrat we ve got to pick up a couple more seats to give us a little bigger margin and the voters are going to have a shot i think in 2020 we have a good reason to believe if we buckle down we can win more seats i believe that pfeiffer i m glad you brought up the filibuster i wanted to just run through a couple of similar norm related proposals that you have been talked about on the trial so electoral college inslee look i believe in democracy and then the electoral college is an artifact of the 13 colonies and it needs to go we have popularly elected officials it is kind of the same idea of the reason to get rid of the filibuster you should have one person one vote and don t give whoever wants the status quo one and a half votes in a filibuster or you know in privileged states in the electoral college so yes and by the way we can do this without a constitutional amendment because we have this state s agreement where we have states that have agreed and my state is one of them to be bound by the popular vote to cast our electoral votes that way so this can be done even without a constitutional amendment pfeiffer statehood for d c and puerto rico inslee i think it s the right thing i supported it back in 93 94 and it s even become more acute as those populations have grown and you see a little bit why it s necessary when you see how callously indifferent donald trump has been to folks who don t look like him he has two views of that and statehood is it s been demonstrated why statehood is important so that these americans can participate in the process pfeiffer last one on this topic changes to the composition or term limits of the supreme court inslee why i think the thing we should start with is making sure that that seat that was stolen is regained and you know if there is another nomination by a republican president we need to make sure that seat is remedied because by the way that seat was not just stolen from democrats it was stolen from the american people i would not totally rule out other issues amongst all of them i ve heard of any changes in the supreme court would be an idea of having rotating members in the court of appeals so you d have a broader group of judges that could sit over time to sort of reduce the politicization but i m not sold on that yet let s just make sure we right the way first the way it is which is to regain that seat pfeiffer last week senator sanders introduced the latest version of his medicare for all legislation it was co sponsored by nearly all of your fellow candidates who are currently serving in the senate what is your reaction to the sanders proposal and do you have a health care medicare for all or health care plan for your campaign inslee yeah well the first thing i would say is regrettably senator sanders bill is going nowhere because he won t come out against the filibuster unless you get rid of the filibuster there s no way major health care reform is going to pass that s just a reality so i m hopeful over time he will follow my lead and join me in saying the filibuster needs to go my view is that my state is a little bit of a template for what we should do on a federal level we hope to be the first state to embrace a public option i have a bill advancing right now and we ve been very successful in the implementation of obamacare we ve had one of the largest drops of uninsured of any state because our implementation has been so effective and it s one of the things i ve learned being governor you actually got to produce you got implement it s not just putting it on paper our opioid efforts have been very not totally successful but other people are looking at us for guidance then on the federal level obviously we need universal health care and i believe the next step ought to be a medicare for all who want it right now which i think you can pass rather than a 10 year argument which gives you a lower age for automatic eligibility for medicare and crucially an ability for everyone who wants it to to enter the medicare system and i think that s the most rapid way that we can make a transition here together with obviously bargaining with pharmaceuticals so we can reduce the pharmaceutical costs that people are exposed to pfeiffer and another issue that has a lot of discussion on the campaign trail is gun safety laws and you lost your seat in congress for in part because of votes on on gun gun control laws what did you learn from that and how would you approach that issue as president inslee well what i what i learned as you know i cast one of the pivotal votes during the clinton registration to ban assault weapons and when i did that i knew i was jeopardizing my seat in congress and that did happen i was freed for other duties by the voters and you know it is painful to lose something you really believe in which is working in congress but what i learned is is that you never regret what you do for conviction and i ve never regretted that vote i ve always believed it was right vote then i believe it s right vote now i really had no regrets and the thing that shows there is a little justice in this sorry world is that now i m governor of a state that has embraced three measures very aggressive measures actually probably one of the leading states on gun safety now so we ve adopted bans on you know bump stocks we ve adopted extreme risk protection acts we ve we ve adopted increasing age for you know assault weapons we ve adopted bills to require gun owner responsibility so now as governor i ve been able to move the ball and we are now you know the nra is in retreat in our state because we have a governor who s been able to push back against them with the courage of my convictions and that s working so i think the country is ready for common sense gun legislation i m happy to pursue it as president and we need somebody with a spine to do it i think i ve demonstrated i have that capability pfeiffer and i take it from this you think that politics have changed on this issue since the 90s inslee yes yes there s no question that politics have changed you know there s kind of a general theme here i think politics is changing much more rapidly than many politicians understand changed on gun safety dramatically because the losses in our schools and i m willing to confront trump on this by the way i went to the white house and personally confronted him after the shootings and he wanted to arm first grade teachers with pistols on their hip but i went looked him in the eye and said that s a ridiculous idea and by the way you should quit tweeting so much and listen to educators they re changing on marijuana where we have legalized marijuana in our state and it has been a unbridled success in a variety of ways and i have they re changing on issues of criminal justice reform where i now have offered pardons to people who had marijuana convictions and i ve ended the death penalty they re changing on climate change very rapidly because people have seen the destruction this is no longer just a line on a graph it s actual seeing cities burned down they re changing on the willingness of people to embrace helping working people that s why i ve been successful we ve passed the best paid family leave in america we ve passed the highest minimum wage i ve been the first person to be the first governor to pass net neutrality we ve passed a gender pay equity bill because we have this radical notion that women should be paid the same as men the point i want to make is i think we need leaders who recognize the foment and the willingness of americans to move forward and we ve done that in my state and i think this is a template for success for the united states all of the things i ve just mentioned that we ve accomplished in washington i think we can do federally pfeiffer and what would your approach be that would be different than the one president obama took to try to get some of those things done like how does that changing politics manifest itself in a strategy to enact these pieces of legislation these policies inslee well i think the things we ve done in washington should be federal policies and there s a couple that we have not yet passed that i hope to in the future and again i believe as the politics change we will be able to do this why could i do this where the incredibly talented amazingly dynamic president obama can not because we re later in the in the arc of history there s more people want to do it now and i think we re in that position to recognize that ability to do that pfeiffer another issue that s gotten a lot of discussion on the campaign trail is the role that large tech companies have in our economy you re the governor of washington state and seattle is one of the tech centers in america amazon is headquartered there microsoft s also in your state if you were to be president you would have regulatory authority over these companies and is amazon in your view too big too powerful in need of a greater regulatory scrutiny how would you approach these companies inslee well i think that there is a need for for some approaches to some of these issues that needs modernization regardless of the size of the company if you look at internet privacy for instance we need privacy legislation that will give consumers and users adequate degree of privacy we need that for small medium and large companies and that s why we are moving forward with a privacy bill right now my legislature is not a done deal yet we re working on some kinks if we get it passed it ll probably be on the equivalence actually better i think than the california law and i think that that s kind of thing that we ought to do federally i think that we have to look at tax policy that where we ve had tax policies were large corporations which where they have not simply paid their freight now that s most obviously apparent in the oil and gas industry and coal industry where there s 27 billion dollars of of subsidy that needs to be eliminated we need to take that money back not not reaching into taxpayers pockets and take it out to give to these companies that have no particular claim to it and that money can be used for clean energy efforts as well i think that we need to look for ways to not allow large corporations to hold communities hostage on the issue of jobs and there s been this pernicious practice where communities corporation will say you know if i don t get a tax break of x i want to move 20 000 jobs somewhere and then have two communities compete to the lowest common denominator i think that we ought to think about ways to use the federal tax code to eliminate their ability to do those i think on the antitrust side there are some things that antitrust should always be under review because you have to look at it under the current situation there might be some things we can look at that i m not necessarily about that there should be some like just bright line of dollars i don t think that probably gets to the real heart of the problem in antitrust sense which is to really look at you know what the impact is in that particular industry i think that s a better approach moving forward pfeiffer governor i also wanted to ask you about another issue involving criminal justice reform and electoral reform in the state of vermont this is something bernie sanders has been talking about recently voting rights are inalienable in that felons do not have to reapply for them afterwards is that something that you think should be nationwide should voting rights be an inalienable in this country inslee well in a sense they are or can be in our state because you just have to apply and if you if you ve fulfilled your obligation and we ve reduced what you have to do at this point to make it achievable yes we want people when they ve done their pennance to be able to regain their place in democracy and that s important to give people respect to make them feel they re part of the community and everything we can do to help them get back into jobs is very very important we re doing some really good things in my state criminal justice reform one of the which is banning the box so right now unfortunately a lot of places you know on your job application they ask have you ever been convicted of a crime and if you say yes you never even get a second look so we ve banned that process we have eliminated the death penalty because of the racial disparity that has been so pernicious through our criminal justice system i mentioned that we i ve offered i m the first governor to offer pardons for those for marijuana convictions because the drug war we know has been one of the reasons for such high rates of incarceration of communities of color so we re moving forward and a lot of different ways to reduce some of the racial disparity in our system and i m glad we re moving forward i hope we do it federally pfeiffer if you were president you obviously have the ability to give out pardons for those sorts of unfair drug related sentences that s something you would be open to doing as you came in office inslee i would certainly look at this because i think we ve seen particularly in the drug war onerous measures that have that have created more heartache than they ve created safety for citizens and i think that part of the things i ve done on the pardons and legalization of marijuana which i believe we should do federally obviously which i would suggest to people we ve had a very good success on this we ve had no great significant increase for useful involvement we ve had seven hundred million dollars generated for schools for kids and health care for people so i would look at that think about that i can t tell you the really blanket thing i can commit to you right now but i think it is something worthwhile looking at pfeiffer on the foreign policy side bibi netanyahu won re election recently which poses great if not mortal threat to the idea of a peace process and a two state solution as president how would you look to reinvigorate that process and engage with both the israelis and the palestinians inslee well i would start with the presumption that i ve been a long supporter of a democratic and secure israel it is a it s a dream to continue that and i d want to be committed to the security of israel but i would also be committed to a two state solution which netanyahu s most recent comments have jeopardized and i would be willing to have that creative discussion to try to keep this effort alive to try to get some solution here and i am willing to have that conversation and hopefully it s productive now i don t have because no human has a way to snap your fingers and solve this problem but i think a willingness to have a simultaneously commitment to the security of israel and a commitment to have a democratic israel which is very difficult if you don t eventually end up with a two state solution to have both of those so i would be committed to every way productively to try to achieve that pfeiffer another issue the president s face is the relationship between presidents and congress when it comes to using military force and you know we have been operating off of a now 17 year old authorization for use of military force from after september 11th to authorize troops in syria is now mike pompeo has floated a theory that you could use that for a conflict with iran how would you think as president about the balance between asking congress for authority and the inherent authority of a commander in chief to wage war inslee well the first thing is i wouldn t ask for the authority if it was a if it was a boneheaded idea and that s one of the reasons i was such a vocal opponent of the iraq war pfeiffer i tee ed you up for the iraq war thing inslee thank you it s still very painful thing because i saw a disaster looming it was clearly based on intelligence that was puffed up it was based on people who had no concept what they were doing during the bush administration and it was very painful to me because i saw this it was like watching a train headed for a canyon where the bridge was out and i could not stop it and i did everything i could to stop it so the first thing i would do was to be appropriately humble on our ability to think that we can reshape cultures and countries and i think that we ve seen quite a number of stakes my lifetime where presidents have been a little bit too conceited about their ability to reshape other cultures and so i would start there i do think that in the sanctions for war that they have to be much more limited and i voted for the essentially after 9 11 i voted for the for the authorization never dreamed that it would have been to this extent and if we had our life to live over again we would have tried to put more side boards on it but i think we certainly need to do do that right now because of this administration s absolute chaotic unprincipled go it alone policy that threatens the iran deal and if they re seriously thinking of that and you never know what trumps really seriously thinking about but if they really are then the congress doesn t need to specifically rein that in and maybe there s some possibility to do that because some of the republicans are starting to understand the danger he represents when you have senator grassley calling trump s view on wind power idiotic you know maybe we ll get some help to try to rein in this rogue president pfeiffer you are one of i think we re at 15 16 candidates running for president it s a historically large historically diverse historically talented field of democrats as you think about your campaign how do you plan to stand out in a way to allow you to make your case to voters and have a real shot to win this nomination inslee well first off i respect all the other candidates i think there s probably about 15 of them who would make fine vice presidents in their future so we ll see about that well look i started out in two principal means number one as we ve talked about i m the only candidate who s committed to make defeating climate change number one and i think that s a very important thing because i ve learned as a governor to govern is to choose and setting a priority is the most important thing you do as a president and so i have laid out my prioritisation no other candidate has been willing to commit to that and i think it s probably because they don t believe it or maybe they re just afraid because they listen to their pollsters and think that this too isn t important enough i disagree with him on that in fact there is a poll in iowa of democratic primary voters showing that defeating climate change is tied for the number one priority of voters so that is a fundamental difference it is a fundamental difference having had the chops to be able to do this because i ve been at this for 20 years and it s a fundamental difference that i ve actually achieved progress in my state knowing how to actually get this done and the deeper ones the additional one because some people said well is that the only thing you re running on i said no i m running on the fact that i m the only executive who s got the best paid family leave and it is i ve passed the best paid family leave in the united states because i believe very intrinsically that we have to allow working families to be able to have a life we ve passed the best the best minimum wage no one else can see that in this race no one else can say that they signed the first net neutrality bill in the united states and this is something i worked on in congress for quite a period of time couldn t get it done in congress but i got it done as a chief executive we ve adopted the gender pay equity bill and no one else can say that they ve got one i don t think is good as is we do we ve done a reproductive parity act there are a few other states that have that but i think in this field they re probably the only one passed one as a governor and i think another point is that i ve been able to have some real successes even with the republican senate so we passed a couple of years ago the best and biggest transportation package in the history of our state 70 billion dollars worth of work and i did that even with the republican senate we had a similar success on education funding and through working for a lot of equity to get a bill through we have several billion dollars of additional help including real big advances in early childhood education and this is something i ve believed in for a quarter of a century and we ve now got slots for an additional eight thousand students we ve had a tuition decrease we ve had one of the most robust richest financial plan for for scholarships for our students and importantly of all the things that i ve been able to do one of the to me the most gratifying is i ve got 12 percent pay increases for educators last year this is a it s a big deal to me because i think the best thing you need is a is a good teacher in the classroom my dad was a biology teacher so i m a believer in this pfeiffer the first debates coming up in a couple of months here the dnc put in place standards to get into that debate involving polling numbers and an ability to generate contributions online how is your campaign doing in meeting that threshold inslee we re still working on it and as you know anyone who would like to help on that get sixty five thousand donors and go to jay inslee dot com and i do hope people will think about that because regardless who you want to serve we want to make sure climate change is on that debate stage we want to make sure we ve got somebody who s very aggressive on this issue who is never gonna let this happen again where in the last three presidential cycles we had exactly four minutes of debate time so if you believe climate change needs to be on that stage you can go to jay inslee dot com and can send anything from a buck on up that would be wonderful to make sure that that works pfeiffer do you think the thresholds the dnc set are fair or good idea inslee i haven t really thought through that whatever they are they are you know having some threshold makes sense i couldn t argue with that right now pfeiffer last question for you governor democrats very much want in polls they said they want someone who can win which is an obvious answer because why would you want someone who would lose right but the ability to and everyone s gonna have their own argument you know no one really knows what electability is every candidate will have an argument whoever the nominee is has to be someone who can deal with trump right and their are different theories about how to do that and i think a lot of us believe that the approach we took in 2016 obviously did not work and trump was able to dominate the conversation and drown out democratic messaging if you were the democratic nominee what would be your theory about dealing with trump as he s giving you some ridiculous nickname he s tweeting about you you know you re seeing absurd unfair and inaccurate attacks how would you navigate those waters inslee well i know he likes nicknames but the only thing he s going to call me is mr president and that s about all he s going to get to do look i feel very comfortable in a confrontation with him in part because i ve already had one at the white house that i described and i think i m a very good contrast because i am an optimist look i m an optimist about defeating climate change i really believe we can and will do this he is a pessimist i m a person who believes in the can do spirit of america he s in the can t do we just can t do this we can t invent new wind turbines right we can t and we can t invent electric cars i m a person who believes in the expansionist nature of the american story that we re we have been in a very unique country that has led the world in so many different ways he just wants to hide from the world and and break up every alliance we have and have a much diminished view of the ambitions of the united states i m a person who believes in diversity and inclusion he believes that diversity is a vice because he is he is threatened by people who don t look like him he fundamentally believes that for him to win somebody else has to lose and that s why he s damaged so much our international relationships i believe that he d do better when you work with other countries that s one of the reasons i committed to the paris climate change agreement so i think i m a very good contrast to him as a person in outlook and i also believe in my ability to win tough races one of the reasons is we this last year won seven governorships while i was the chair of the democratic governors association and one of the reasons we won those seats is we insisted on having messages that responded to the desire for economic growth for job growth for better schools for better roads and we addressed that sort of effort that really spoke to some of those people we didn t reach in 2016 i know how to win wisconsin michigan minnesota illinois and kansas because we did it this year in the governor s races and i think that kind of message i represent is the one that allowed me to succeed when i started my political career in about a 63 percent republican district and agricultural community in a town of 3000 where i learned to win because i spoke to people about where they live about their need for jobs in this clean energy jobs message is fundamentally a job creation message and i believe that in 2007 when i co authored this book which is about how you create clean energy jobs so i feel very good about the contrast and the prospects of winning this and i think we re gonna be a united party and i like to carry that flag pfeiffer governor inslee thank you for joining us on pod save america inslee thanks keep talking
