bsac earnings call for the period ending december 31 2019 banco santander chile bsac 0 40 q4 2019 earnings call 10 00 a m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks operator ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by and welcome to the q4 2019 banco santander chile earnings conference call i would now like to hand the conference over to cfo emiliano muratore please go ahead sir emiliano muratore chief financial officer good morning everyone welcome to banco santander chile s fourth quarter 2019 results webcast and conference call this is emiliano muratore cfo and i m joined today by robert moreno managing director of investor relations and our chief economist claudio soto thank you for attending today s conference call despite a challenging quarter we have made advances in our strategy and look forward to sharing with you our progress before we get into our results claudio will give us some insight into the macro environment and our expectations for the rest of the year claudio soto chief economist thank you emiliano activity contracted abruptly in the fourth quarter due to the social unrest that affected chile october s metrics fell more than 5 against september in november there was partially recover with a 1 gain we estimate activity continued improving in december as the social unrest receded all in all we estimate the economy fell by more than 2 year on year in the last quarter and the year as a whole expanded 1 1 going forward activity will depend to a large extent on the domestic political scenario confidence has declined and risk premiums have increased on top of that uncertainty regarding the constitutional process will affect new investment projects against that backdrop a substantial fiscal stimulus will help to support domestic demand on the other hand the real depreciation of the peso of about 10 will boost export all in all we see a 4 decline in gross capital formation for the year as a whole private consumption will expand at around 1 and export will speed up to 3 3 gdp in total will grow 1 this year until now official figures do not show a significant deterioration in the labor market however layoffs during the last days of december increased relevantly although we estimate that there won t be significant layoffs in the coming months job creation will slow down therefore unemployment will increase up to 8 to 8 5 during the year cpi inflation increased in the last month and closed 2019 just at the 3 target of the central bank which led to a uf inflation variation of 2 7 during the first quarter cpi inflation will increase about 3 5 driven by the currency depreciation however in the second part of the year it will slow down as the low growth of the economy creates slackness after an important cut in monetary policy rate in mid 2019 we do not expect further cuts this year the central bank made clear that while they are intervening in the fx market a rate cut will be incoherent moreover given the volatility seen in financial asset prices we estimate the board will be particularly careful in deciding its next move regarding fiscal policy we estimate that public deficit will reach between 4 5 and 5 of gdp thus public debt will rise fast while the government has room to expand its expenditure a credible commitment toward a fiscal consolidation in the future will be important to ensure that debt converges toward a reasonable the social conflict with during the weeks was spurred by several factors including a slower economic growth after the commodity boom a persistent although declining inequality lack of safety nets for the growing middle class and corruption scandals at different levels in response to these events almost all political parties agreed to launch a process for an eventual change in the constitution the process begins with a referendum that will take place on april 26 citizens will decide if they want a new constitution or not and if so which body will write it down in writing the new constitution each article in it will have to be approved by two third of the constituent body once written the new constitution will be put back to chileans in a second referendum that we estimate will take place in march 2022 in parallel the government is looking to speed up some of the reforms that were already in discussion the bill that modernizes the tax system should be approved this week in its new design there will be no full integration of the income tax as it is it was originally proposed and there will be a focus on helping the smaller enterprises and increased taxes to the wealthy with this reform the government seeks to collect an additional clp2 2 billion regarding pensions one of the most demanded reform by the population the amendment bill proposes increasing the mandatory contributions from 10 up to 16 with increased per year of the extra contribution 3 will finance a new solidarity fund this reform will be implemented over a 12 year transition period robert moreno manager of investor relations okay thank you claudio so if you move now on to slide 7 i wanted to also briefly discuss some of the reforms and regulations that may affect the bank both positively and maybe negatively just to note not all of these reforms are finalized and many are in the initial discussions firstly beginning in january 1 of this year there is already in place a new regulation whereby banks have to automatically use available checking account funds to pay off our clients associated credit line this will have an impact on nims of around 8 basis points this year another potential risk going forward is more consumer protection through fraud compensation there is ongoing discussion about limiting the responsibility of clients in case of loss threat or fraud of debit and credit cards in light of these developments we are trying to limit the exposure of our clients to credit card fraud through education marketing campaigns daily transfer amount limits better chip technology improved atm software and other technological improvements but we cannot assure this level will not increase the financial costs related to cyber crime credit card fraud and insurance coverage as many of you know our regulator has been publishing the regulations for the implementation of basel iii in chile just this week the regulator published the model for risk weighting of credit risk from our preliminary evaluation this is broadly in line with our expectations and we continue to believe that the effect on our bank should be neutral to positive in terms of our capital ratios according to the bank regulator credit risk weighted assets will decrease 20 for the system under this new method we are still estimating the impact for us by december of this year banks must publish the risk weighted assets under basel iii other possible developments which we view as positive are the creation of a consolidated positive credit bureau and what is called financial portability these two measures should improve bank penetration levels especially through the development of new digital banking services moving on to slide 8 we wanted to give a strategy update of the bank 2019 was a landmark year in innovations as we see on slide 9 superdigital was piloted and launched and now has over 18 000 clients during the first half of 2020 we will have the official launch of superdigital which was postponed in the fourth quarter we also made advances in our acquiring business which we will go into detail shortly in november we also received the final approval from a regulator to acquire 51 of santander consumer and began consolidating this company in that month this portfolio represents around 1 of our total loan book 8 of our consumer loans and has an roe greater than 18 during the quarter our life program continued to grow strongly despite the social turmoil reaching over 136 000 clients a new private banking model will also be launched during the first half of this year on slide 10 we show the most relevant advances we made in the fourth quarter at the end of december the president of the bank claudio melandri made the first transaction through our acquiring system which is currently being piloted in the work cafe we expect to roll this out in the first semester of 2020 the acquiring business will be branded as getnet as we help grupo santander build a global brand name in this business klare our digital insurance platform will also be launched during the first half of this year the subsidiary was officially created but we are still waiting for final regulatory approvals to start operations remember that this is a 100 digital platform where clients will be able to customize and compare different insurance products these two initiatives will help bolster our fee income in the coming years on slide 21 we can see that we had a strong client we also had a strong client growth in the last during the year during the fourth quarter despite the social unrest on average we opened more than 23 new accounts each month that means we managed to open 66 more accounts compared to the same quarter of 2018 we also had the highest market share in terms of net increase in current accounts in 2019 we opened 26 of all new checking accounts in the market this also has given way to an increase in client loyalty as well as digital clients as seen on slide 12 we measure loyalty as clients with at least four products who must also surpass a minimum usage and profitability standards throughout the year we had an increase in loyal high income individuals as well as smes digital clients also kept expanding increasing 13 and reaching over 1 2 million clients our work in digitalization as well as other initiatives has also helped us improve our client satisfaction as seen on slide 13 we have consistently improved both our net promoter score and net global satisfaction closing the gap with our top contender another important topic that santander pushed during the year was esg as can be seen on slide 14 during last year our mission put an emphasis on not only to be the best bank but to do so responsibly we have always been a market leader but this year but in 2009 we put more focus on communicating our esg initiatives and this in turn helped us to improve in many ranking and indices this year for example we were able to improve our esg score as measured by vigeo eiris from a limited score of 38 out of 100 to a robust score of 58 this put us well above our chilean and latin american peers and ranked us number 8 in the world and number 4 in emerging markets for best esg standards for retail banks one such initiative in line with the responsible banking is that now our clients can compensate their carbon footprint as can be seen on slide 15 we are the first bank in the country to give our clients the opportunity to become carbon neutral clients can compensate their footprint through either directly buying certified carbon credits or contributing to an environmental project here in chile clients only have to go into their account online and they can see how many kilos of carbon dioxide they have emitted how much it translates into monetary terms and the breakdown of where the co2 emissions are coming from this initiative was launched during the end of november and during the month of december 312 tons of co2 were compensated through carbon credits clients also contributed to the foundation for a project in a national park close to coquimbo and in one month already 20 of the total financing of this project was achieved on slide 16 we show how our strategy and continued pursuit has also gained us in recognition for the second year in a row we were recognized within the top 3 in the country for best in corporate governance by a survey carried out by ernst young ey we are also very proud of climbing the ranks in great place to work on fifth place overall last year to number 3 in companies with over 1 000 employees once again we were awarded bank of the year for 2019 by the renowned magazine the banker moving on to slide 17 we will now go into the results for the fourth quarter and the full year on slide 19 we show that net income attributable to our shareholders for 2019 was clp552 billion translating to an roe of 16 7 remember that during the year we had an increase in provisions of clp31 billion in july as the new model for smes set out by our regulator came into effect as the social unrest continued from october onwards we also decided to take on an additional provision of clp16 billion for our consumer model when adjusted for these extraordinary provisions roe reached 17 7 for the year please turn to slide 19 the bank s total deposits increased 7 7 year over year and 2 7 quarter on quarter during the quarter the central bank lowered the monetary policy rate again by 25 to 1 75 this led to a decrease in the cost of funds to lower time deposit costs on the other hand demand deposits had a record year in terms of growth in 2019 increasing 18 8 8 quarter on quarter and 17 8 year over year as a reminder demand deposits are non interest bearing our liquidity ratios also remained healthy with the lcr ratio finishing the year at 143 and the nsfr at 108 on slide 20 we review loan growth total loans increased 8 1 in 2019 in line with guidance and 2 6 quarter on quarter loans to individuals was the fastest growing segment in 2019 led by an increase in lending to high income earners this was also driven in part by the incorporation of santander consumer in november following the final approval from our regulator this contributed clp451 billion of consumer loans as of december 2019 representing 8 of the consumer loan book going forward we expect loan growth of 5 for this year with more or less the same growth across all segments on slide 21 we show the evolution of nims the quarter on quarter increase in the net interest margin was mainly due to the higher uf inflation rate a decrease of 25 basis points in the short term interest rate and the improved funding mix these positive effects were partially offset by the negative impact of lower long term interest rates that drove a record level of refinancing of mortgages in the year with this in mind on slide 22 we wanted to show you the evolution of certain market factors that should help to sustain margins in 2020 as you can see on this slide the yield on the central bank s two year note fell steadily during 2019 but began recovering during the fourth quarter this should help loan spreads at the same time the central bank cut the monetary policy rate this should lower funding costs during 2020 in addition we have seen an increase in inflation which is positive for margins we also expect a positive push from santander consumer which should boost margins by 10 basis points as well on the other hand we do have headwinds coming from the regulatory changes as well as slower economic growth therefore we are leaving our guidance for nims with a stable outlook for the year at around 4 1 on slide 23 we can see that the asset quality had a slight deterioration during the quarter due to the social unrest in chile with npls and the impaired loan ratio increasing 10 basis points to 2 1 and 5 9 respectively by segment smes were the most affected within our loan book we have been proactive in trying to help our sme clients by either refinancing or giving grace periods for them to recover explaining the uptick in impaired commercial loans as well our coverage ratio increased in the consumer loan portfolio during the quarter as we set aside additional provisions for clp16 billion to cover possible higher risk levels and any greater provisions required by the bank regulator for this portfolio in 2020 in mortgages we have maintained a focus on originating mortgage loans among high income earners and with an average loan to value below 80 this has been a key factor in maintaining healthy asset quality in this product moving on to slide 24 we can see that the cost of credit ended the fourth quarter at 1 9 and 1 3 for the whole year when adjusted by the onetime charge previously mentioned the cost of credit was 1 7 in the quarter incorporation of santander consumer had an effect on the cost of credit of 10 basis points in the quarter going forward our cost of credit should remain stable at 1 3 to 1 4 in 2020 due to the expected increase in unemployment lower economic growth of 1 for the year and the incorporation of santander consumer this will be partially contained by the bank s minimal exposure to low income retail lending only less than 1 of the loan book today is to low income earners on slide 25 we show how non interest income was a positive contributor to our revenues this reflects that despite lower growth we successfully continued to generate greater business income with our new and existing clients financial transactions had an overall strong year especially in client treasury as demand for treasury products remained strong throughout 2019 fee income rebounded nicely in the second half of the year led by a rebound in card fees due to the migration of our cards to an interchange fee model and greater usage an increase in collections fees from santander consumer which we started to consolidate in the quarter and an increase in financial advisory among our corporate clients in total non interest income increased 25 in 2019 in 2020 fee income should continue to recover as many of our initiatives such as klare should begin contributing and new client and client loyalty growth remains high all in we expect non net interest income to rise above loan growth in 2020 on slide 26 we show our distribution network as of the end of the year we had 377 branches of which 53 were work cafes during the social unrest we had 70 branches which suffered damages with 15 inoperable most of the damage was covered by insurance which is reflected in other operating income in the quarter at the same time we recognized an impairment of clp2 8 billion due to destroyed assets and branches we do not expect any material additional charges due to social unrest in 2020 however our digital channels have been able to serve our clients efficiently during these times driving upward our productivity levels in 2020 employee headcount decreased compared to last year however when compared to the previous quarter there was uptick as we began consolidating santander consumer the incorporation of santander consumer added about 200 employees to the bank headcount going forward we do not believe headcount should increase further please turn to slide 27 operating expenses remained flat in the quarter with a year on year growth of 3 9 the bank consistently delivers world class levels of efficiency with a ratio of 38 3 in the quarter and 40 for the year the bank continues to spend on marketing communication cyber security and technology developments as well as improvements to our distribution network but the efficiency ratio should remain around 40 for 2020 as well please turn to slide 28 as of december 2019 we reached a core capital ratio of 10 1 and our bis ratio reached 12 9 the solid capital ratios at the end of the quarter gives the bank room to grow and to continue implementing our investment plan as we stated before the cmf has been publishing a series of regulations that map out the transition of banks to basel iii firstly the cmf published for discussion the definition of systemic banks the regulator then published for discussion the determination of the operational risk coefficient which are all very much in line with the recommendations made by the basel committee in basel iv we estimate that operational risk should add on around 7 to our risk weighted assets very much in line with our original estimates more recently this week the regulator published for discussion the credit risk weightings according to the regulator using information for december 2018 the regulations proposed should reduce credit risk assets by 23 compared to current regulations which will lead to a total savings for the industry of 4 5 billion however this will be compensated by the incorporation of operational and market risks we continue to believe that the transition to basel iii or iv will be neutral to positive for this bank in 2019 we distributed an annual dividend of 60 of the previous year s profits which led to a dividend yield of 3 7 for 2020 we expect a similar level of payout which places our current dividend yield at above 4 the final dividend proposal will be decided by the board in march to finalize we will now move on to our outlook for 2020 on slide 30 the social unrest in chile continues to create uncertainty in the local economy we expect investment to contract in 2020 it should be compensated by the export sector and higher fiscal spending from the reforms initiatives proposed to address the social issues however our ambitious investment plan which is focused on digitalization and technological improvements and new businesses such as acquiring will continue to progress in 2020 we expect loan growth in 2020 to reach 5 with higher growth coming from retail loans margin should benefit from higher inflation particularly in the first semester and the impact of santander consumer however this will be compensated may be compensated by regulatory changes such as the automatic payment of credit lines therefore nim should remain stable at around 4 1 our improving client service in digital channels has enhanced our ability to capture new clients and cross sell existing ones and this should continue driving non interest income slightly above loan growth considering the expectation that unemployment will increase this year and the onetime provisions already taken in 2019 we now expect cost of credit to remain stable at 1 3 to 1 4 of loans average loans the efficiency ratio should also remain around 40 even including our ambitious investment plan and the effective tax rate will remain on average around 21 to 22 with this outlook we believe a return on average equity of around 17 is attainable at this time we will gladly answer any questions you may have questions and answers operator and our first question comes from the line of ernesto gabilondo with bank of america ernesto gabilondo bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi good morning emiliano robert and claudio and thanks for the opportunity to my questions my first question is in the economic outlook as you mentioned the economic growth is expected to decelerate in 2020 so considering the potential increase in chile s debt from 27 to 40 in the next years the implementation of our progressive tax reform the implementation of the pension reform and the challenges of reaching a constitutional agreement do you see the possibility of a negative outlook for chile from credit rating agencies later this year i will this will be my last my first question and then i will ask a couple of questions robert moreno manager of investor relations okay first of all up to now rating agencies have been positive regarding chile s outlook they have been supportive of the strategy the government is pursuing the information regarding the evolution of the deficit has been made public already since a couple of weeks so the agencies already incorporated that information into their evaluation and up to now in general their evaluation is relatively positive now there are risks there is a risk on the activity on the one hand in general we see more downside risk than upside risk for activity and also of course the impact of the pension reform may not be completely incorporated in the forecast for the evolution of the public deficit into the future therefore we see some risk of a revision of the outlook for the economy in the future ernesto gabilondo bank of america merrill lynch analyst great thank you so much and then a couple of questions the first one is in terms of your expectations for loan growth so we know this loan growth of 8 in 2019 i think it was partially explained by the acquisition of the consumer portfolio but how do you see the organic and total loan growth in 2020 under this scenario you mentioned 5 but just want to know if this is considering an organic growth or it s excluding the consumer portfolio and especially i will appreciate your expectations in the sme segment we have seen several merchants that have not been able to reopen their businesses and we think that social unrest is expected to come back in march after being in holidays and then my last question is if it would be reasonable to expect low to mid single digit earnings growth in 2020 and with that we will reach your 17 roe for this year thank you robert moreno manager of investor relations okay so the 5 is the year end versus year end so it includes it s organic obviously in the first half of the year we re comparing it will be higher because we ll be including santander consumer compared to last year when we were not or when we reach the end of the year it should be around 5 so take that as organic and smes smes is a large segment for the bank it s around 15 of the loan book and there we have companies that sell up to around 3 million but there s more than 200 000 companies and the focus will be obviously in the larger smes the smes that also are more involved in the export business chile many sectors so there are sectors that are going to perform well this year as claudio said the export sectors should be have a strong year the prices of chile s exports have been relatively robust copper has been a little volatile but the other ones have been very very strong and we re obviously probably going to avoid some of them maybe the smaller smes until we have better economic figures and obviously in smes there s a lot of stores and commerce which suffered in october november we did see improvements in december and in january things have been really calm as you said we don t march is a big question mark everyone is kind of on vacation now but given that the government has taken a lot of steps to reform to do reforms they announced the constitutional reforms i m not saying that social unrest will disappear but we don t believe it will at the levels we saw in october november because a lot has been done and the democratic institutions are slowly churning out the reforms that everyone has been asking for so i would say smes are kind of the weak link in the loan book but we think things should slowly get better and not worse okay ernesto gabilondo bank of america merrill lynch analyst perfect thank you and then for my last question emiliano muratore chief financial officer about the net income growth robert moreno manager of investor relations net income growth yeah so exactly so basically we ve always said it comes true we should have a mid to high single digit eps growth right so basically i think the important thing here is that despite the lower loan growth our revenue growth last year revenues grew like 5 6 we re not expecting revenue growth to slow down because margins should be relatively stable non interest income should be high or good or strong or similar to loan growth and the big question mark and we did give some guidance is the cost of credit okay ernesto gabilondo bank of america merrill lynch analyst perfect very helpful thank you very much operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of jason mollin with scotiabank jason mollin scotiabank analyst hello everyone my first question is a follow up on loan growth do you consider this outlook conservative and you talk about the upside and downside risk to this 5 for total loans and my second question is about the new client data that you showed with santander chile achieving a 26 share of the net increase in clients can you talk about these clients do they come from other banks are these clients new to the system what kind of clients are they thank you very much emiliano muratore chief financial officer hello jason regarding the let s say the bias or the loan growth guidance i think that it s a bit biased to the downside as claudio was mentioning that our 5 is consistent with the 1 gdp growth that as of today we see maybe more downside risk than upside risk to that gdp and that would imply also the loan growth expectation to be a little bit more biased to the downside if we consider like risk scenarios although today our base case and maybe best estimate is that 1 for gdp 5 for loan growth but in terms of risk scenarios i would say that the downside is a bit higher than the upside robert moreno manager of investor relations and regarding the so we had as we said in the presentation growth of 26 and a net increase in checking accounts through october so this is mainly the middle high income portion of the clients and this is a mix of everything getting since these are checking accounts this is mainly people who are already in the system so i would say it s clients coming from other banks i think this has a lot to do with the fact that our client service has been steadily improving our digital services have always been very good the fact that the work cafe has really helped their image and so forth so checking accounts is really a reflection of all the efforts we ve done on many fronts and mainly is there a little bit of cross selling we ve been very successful in opening checking accounts not only in chilean pesos but in dollars and we re also obviously capturing market from other clients the new entrants are basically coming through santander life and superdigital especially santander life santander life they re opening debit card accounts so it s not included in the checking account and that has also been very strong santander life has been very well perceived by clients remember that there was social unrest but santander life s merit program is very much in line with what people are looking for they will be recognized for their efforts and the digital onboarding in santander life kept things going even when branches were closed okay jason mollin scotiabank analyst thank you very much operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of thiago batista with ubs thiago batista ubs analyst hi guys i have two questions the first one is a follow up on the macro overview or the macro outlook about the unemployment ratio how much you guys are expecting for unemployment ratio in chile in 2020 and also if this explains the potential increase in cost of risk when it s increased the 1 3 to 1 4 guidance for cost of risk if this should be caused by this increase in the unemployment ratio in chile my second question is about the medium term roe so i know that there s a lot of moving parts nowadays in chile but do you believe it s possible to work with the roe of 19 and 20 as used to be a couple of years ago or the 17 tend to be the new level robert moreno manager of investor relations on unemployment we expect unemployment to go up up to 8 to 8 5 this year we are starting at around 7 in november that 7 already accounts for part of the event of the social unrest and up to now the labor market a significant deterioration however because of the slow growth we re expecting for this year unemployment should go up now having said that our risks are more to the downside than there is a risk to the upside in terms of unemployment but in no case we are seeing unemployment reaching two digit levels emiliano muratore chief financial officer yes and relating that to cost of risk the increase in cost of risk during the last quarter had to do in part with let s say the employment situation worsening a bit not so far yet but not too much yet but yes the expectations are unemployment going up and regarding long term roe we honestly i think that it is still like too early to assess or let s say recalibrate long term roe expectations at this moment because although the situation in chile has been relatively let s say abrupt and big during these last few months i think it s too early to change or to let s say guide the long term roe after this situation and we will need to have to see the time passing and maybe during this year we got to have a clearer picture of let s say the new long term expectation for the economy and for the bank thiago batista ubs analyst okay thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of tito labarta with goldman sachs tito labarta goldman sachs analyst hi good morning thanks emiliano and robert for the call my question in terms of asset quality i guess and the cost of risk you saw a little bit of deterioration in the quarter do you think this will continue throughout the year i know you mentioned higher unemployment so it probably will but just wanted to get a sense how much do you think it could deteriorate from here and also with the cost of risk right it s a bit more elevated than in the past given the uncertainty which makes sense but do you think that you can if things go well you eventually get back to that 1 1 cost of risk that we saw in the past or do you think just given the uncertainty beyond this year it could likely remain more elevated at that 1 3 1 4 level or even higher just to get a sense on maybe some sensitivity on asset quality and cost of risk that you expect thank you emiliano muratore chief financial officer yeah i think it s important what you mentioned that before up to september before all this situation in chile we were with that underlying cost of risk of around 1 that is consistent with all the changes we have made in the composition of the loan book so when you look at the cost of risk of the last quarter and also the total for the year around 1 35 we think that assuming the underlying risk of the portfolio that it was consistent with that 1 the new environment in terms of employment and consumption and economic activity we think that it s going to be unlikely to go as low as we were before all this so that 1 1 1 looks too challenging but also we think that the situation from where we are in the last quarter especially after seeing the behavior of the portfolio in october november and december that it has been sequentially better month after month october was the one with the biggest noise and disruption but then november and december we saw a kind of good behavior of the delinquency in the portfolio so i would say that as low as we were before october it s unlikely that but we don t see the full year cost of risk going higher than we had last year tito labarta goldman sachs analyst okay thanks emiliano it s helpful operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of neha agarwala with hsbc neha agarwala hsbc analyst hi thank you for taking my question first on the regulatory side do you foresee any other regulatory changes that are not incorporated in your guidance maybe higher tax rate and the second question is on the asset quality i understand that you re being more cautious on the retail and construction sector any other sector or segment that you are trying to hold on and not grow as much this year thank you so much emiliano muratore chief financial officer helo neha regarding the regulation we don t see and actually there is not any other piece of regulation on the table under discussion apart from the ones we mentioned so we are not factoring in any other piece in our outlook for the year and in terms of asset quality and sectors actually i think that it s going to depend the growth on the demand of credit that it will also be different among other sectors we are still seeing i would say kind of normal decent demand coming from middle market corporates all the external sector exporters and all that so and we haven t seen any significant slowdown in loan growth in those segments then when you go to smes the demand is also nice now a bit lower because of the general situation but no there is no any specific sector that we think that we need to slow down or stop we do want to be let s say prudent in exploring like new clients and we want to work more with our client base clients that we know that we have been working with them in the past so maybe in terms of calibrating the growth strategy maybe the biggest tweak would be like not being extremely aggressive in capturing new clients especially in lending i mean going into lending to new client that is maybe the biggest change if you compare the current stance to what we had before neha agarwala hsbc analyst okay and if i can ask another question could you update us on the ifrs implementation emiliano muratore chief financial officer probably it s by january next year when all the disclosing regulation is implemented in chile i would say that by january 2021 we will be fully ifrs except for credit losses provisioning that is the part where we are not ifrs and we are not going to be in the near future and so in the long term our expectation is to convert fully to ifrs because remember that now all the issuers not just banks are under the same regulator the cmf and all the other issuers are under full ifrs so i think that in the long term i expect to see conversions to full ifrs but in the near future we expect to be as we are in full ifrs except for provisions that will stay with this more standardized expected loss model created by the regulator robert moreno manager of investor relations just as a clarification we are ifrs except for the credit provisions and the change that s coming now is the format how we publish all our financials that will change to more or less what you see in other parts of the world and that should be finished by the end of this year beginning of next year okay neha agarwala hsbc analyst okay great thank you so much operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of sebastian gallego with credicorp sebastian gallego credicorp analyst hi good morning thanks for the presentation i have several questions the first one on asset quality as well more follow up on asset quality i just want to get a sense if you can break down per segment on commercial consumer and mortgage where do you see the most deterioration in terms of asset quality delinquencies or npls second question is related to margins i just want to get a sense of under which scenario are you considering or what s your base case scenario for inflation or uf inflation on a quarterly basis just to reach stableness in your guidance and final question is regarding basel iii standards when you read the article that was published by the regulator they mentioned that even though the risk weighted assets or the credit risk weighted assets will decline this will be compensated by the other risk weighted assets market and operational the question is do you expect that to actually compensate or do you actually believe that the net effect will be a decline in risk weighted assets thank you robert moreno manager of investor relations okay so regarding your first question which is the asset quality break down basically obviously there s potential for consumer lending to deteriorate but we really have a really high coverage so remember we took clp16 billion in additional provisions we have very little loan growth in the low end of the market so i think that is a good you could say insurance policy so maybe npls could rise but i don t expect a huge deterioration of the cost of risk in consumer lending okay and mortgage is similar as well and remember all of this is using the current 1 percent gdp forecast and unemployment forecast we discussed and mortgage as well in mortgage we have decent loan to value ratios and we ve also focused growth more on the higher end so obviously there could be some deterioration but we feel like we ve it could be contained and the big question mark really comes from the sme sector where i think you saw it in the fourth quarter and you and we re probably there where we could see potential further deterioration and the need to increase the cost of risk so i would say that s the basic breakdown and that s why we are forecasting a cost of risk of 1 3 to 1 4 okay emiliano muratore chief financial officer regarding the inflation expectations for the full year today we are expecting a 2 7 uf5 variation on the quarterly profile i would say it s relatively stable i mean 0 7 0 8 for the different quarters starting in this quarter so that s why with that inflation assumption we are foreseeing still stable nims and regarding the impact of basel iii on the numbers one of the i would say one of the things we found is that the regulator is incorporating some kind of complexity in the standard method when to calculate the weighting so it s we don t have our fine print our numbers today but if you the regulator mentioned that there will be a 23 reduction in risk weighted assets coming from risk so if we do that if we take that 23 for us and we assume that credit risk will fall 23 and we take into account the operational regulation that is already under consultation so we know how it will be and if you then you have market risk of the x there in that equation and but if you take the scenario of keeping the same model that today we have under basel i which is a very let s say harsh and prudent model if you take those numbers we see our cet1 around 11 that is roughly like 100 basis point higher than what we have today but there are i would say in that calculation the two big questions are that 23 of reduction coming from credit risk how close we are to that average above or below we will know that in the weeks when we are able to do the all the simulations and calculations and then market risk how close it is the basel iii model the basel iv model compared to the basel i we have today but that s the kind of number we are seeing so far sebastian gallego credicorp analyst perfect very clear thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of jorg friedemann with citibank jorg friedemann citibank analyst thank you very much for taking my question i have also a couple of follow ups if possible just for me to understand you explained several times already regarding your cost of risk guidance and asset quality expectations but in this quarter you actually took a proactive stance and buildup coverage in advance before a more severe deterioration came in so is this the same rationale that you are going to follow going forward to come up with this 1 3 to 1 4 or are you going to be more reactive to npl deterioration from now on so the question is if we re going to continue building up coverage in the expectation of things to deteriorate or you are going to be only more reactive going forward so this is the first question and the second question if you could give us an update on the payout taking into consideration these regulations of basel iii that are coming in thank you robert moreno manager of investor relations okay so regarding your first question i think maybe one way to explain it is during 2019 we had a cost of risk of 1 3 but we had like one timer s right so we had clp16 billion in the fourth quarter and the clp31 billion in the third if you take that out our cost of risk was 1 1 so you can say with all the events last year we would have been at like 1 1 1 and with an increase at 1 3 is what i m saying so the actual impact of all of this is a 20 on a comparable basis is like a 20 basis increase so i would say there was in the fourth quarter some kind of proactive this year it s going to be more i would say a little more like reactive because of the proactiveness we already did ok so on a comparable basis we re going from like 1 cost of risk to 1 3 1 4 and that s how we view it and we feel comfortable with that considering that we ve already done last year okay and the second on the payout so as we said in the just a little while ago given the information we have now regarding our current capital ratios and what we ve seen and what we can infer from the new regulations we expect to pay out of 2019 earnings which would be paid in april to be around 60 similar payout which gives you a current dividend yield of around like 4 or so now the board still hasn t decided on its final resolution and what it will propose to the shareholders meeting and that will be informed at the end of march okay emiliano muratore chief financial officer and so maybe let s say well definitely we said loan growth expectations are not so high and are a bit biased to the downside so that the pressure on the capital shouldn t come from let s say faster loan growth there are a few pieces of the regulation for basel iii to be put under presentations market risk being one of them and some others so those are the maybe the risk on the payout having without having any relevant negative surprise coming from the basel iii regulation you should expect the payout to be stable compared to last year jorg friedemann citibank analyst that s very clear i appreciate it thank you very much operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of piedad alessandri with credicorp piedad alessandri credicorp analyst hi thank you for allowing some questions i know there are no new regulations under discussions but are you considering the possibility of an increase on bank taxes considering the increase in debt for the government or do you see the possibility of a specific tax for the banks emiliano muratore chief financial officer no actually we are not at this moment considering any of those taxes in the future there is nothing being discussed and so under the current tax reform nothing like that is under discussion so going to your question no we are not considering that piedad alessandri credicorp analyst thank you very much operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of yuri fernandes with j p morgan yuri fernandes j p morgan analyst hi emiliano hi robert i have a question regarding margins are you being conservative here looking to your inflation outlook you had like flattish inflation too like the cpi at 2 7 and santander chile you have like a benefit that maybe your peers and should not have you just consolidated a consumer finance company that helped margins and you also had a very good performance on demand deposits so if you are really right on the flattish margins for 2020 i think the outlook here is negative for the system right because it s maybe down for your peers and for the system so that s the first one regarding margins are you conservative here or not and i have a follow up on asset quality you had many many questions here but just checking about the renegotiated portfolio if you can provide some color on how big was the increase this quarter when are you renegotiating those loans you can provide any metric any color so we can track these and keep an eye on how the renegotiated book is behaving thank you emiliano muratore chief financial officer okay so first on nim i would say that it s not so conservative because you re right in the sense that we have many tailwinds for nims like the central bank cut rates recently the slope of the curve recovered and now we have let s say a decent slope between the shorter end and the longer end then inflation is going to be stable or maybe with some upside risk if the fx keeps high or and depreciating so i would say that in general the new origination all these factors are positive factors for nims maybe the thing that you are not factoring in is that all the big flow of mortgages refinancing that we had last year it was mainly during the second half of last year so we are still seeing that let s say snowball effect in the full year margin for this year so and maybe that s why without factoring in that more refinancing mortgage effect you can see it as conservative but this effect is going to hit harder during the full year in 2020 than it was in 2019 which was only part of the year robert moreno manager of investor relations asset quality yeah so the best way to go monitoring that is the impaired loan ratio that s why we include that because in very simple terms the impaired loan ratio on slide 23 if you can look at there that includes the npls plus mainly the renegotiated loans so if you look at the commercial loans the impaired loan ratio went from 6 7 to 7 that s the biggest impact we had there in asset quality and that s the renegotiation of these sme loans in tourism restaurants hotels small shops so the best way to go monitoring how that behaves is impaired loan ratio and obviously our provisioning models which aren t ifrs 9 but they are forward looking they have to take so when you renegotiate you just don t sweep problems under the table you have to take provisions anyway so that s why provisions were high apart from the because if you take out the clp16 billion you still get a relatively large amount of provisions because we were increasing provisions for these impaired loans so as the year progresses not only do you look at npls but keep a track of how the impaired loan ratio evolves because that s a good indicator of the overall in fact the impaired loan ratio is very similar to the stage 3 of ifrs 9 okay yuri fernandes j p morgan analyst no super clear robert thanks for the answers if i just may ask one thing on the cost of risk it s fair to assume that it should be much higher in the first half of the year especially in the first q and then gradually decrease right and the average should be the 1 3 1 4 you mentioned in the guidance right robert moreno manager of investor relations yeah i think that should be correct yes yuri fernandes j p morgan analyst thank you operator thank you and i m showing no further questions at this time so with that i ll turn the call back over to cfo emiliano muratore for closing remarks emiliano muratore chief financial officer thank you all very much for taking the time to participate in today s call we look forward to speaking with you again soon operator duration 63 minutes call participants emiliano muratore chief financial officer claudio soto chief

banco santander chile nyse bsac q4 2019 earnings call 10 00 a m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks operator ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by and welcome to the q4 2019 banco santander chile earnings conference call i would now like to hand the conference over to cfo emiliano muratore please go ahead sir emiliano muratore chief financial officer good morning everyone welcome to banco santander chile s fourth quarter 2019 results webcast and conference call this is emiliano muratore cfo and i m joined today by robert moreno managing director of investor relations and our chief economist claudio soto thank you for attending today s conference call despite a challenging quarter we have made advances in our strategy and look forward to sharing with you our progress before we get into our results claudio will give us some insight into the macro environment and our expectations for the rest of the year claudio soto chief economist thank you emiliano activity contracted abruptly in the fourth quarter due to the social unrest that affected chile october s metrics fell more than 5 against september in november there was partially recover with a 1 gain we estimate activity continued improving in december as the social unrest receded all in all we estimate the economy fell by more than 2 year on year in the last quarter and the year as a whole expanded 1 1 going forward activity will depend to a large extent on the domestic political scenario confidence has declined and risk premiums have increased on top of that uncertainty regarding the constitutional process will affect new investment projects against that backdrop a substantial fiscal stimulus will help to support domestic demand on the other hand the real depreciation of the peso of about 10 will boost export all in all we see a 4 decline in gross capital formation for the year as a whole private consumption will expand at around 1 and export will speed up to 3 3 gdp in total will grow 1 this year until now official figures do not show a significant deterioration in the labor market however layoffs during the last days of december increased relevantly although we estimate that there won t be significant layoffs in the coming months job creation will slow down therefore unemployment will increase up to 8 to 8 5 during the year cpi inflation increased in the last month and closed 2019 just at the 3 target of the central bank which led to a uf inflation variation of 2 7 during the first quarter cpi inflation will increase about 3 5 driven by the currency depreciation however in the second part of the year it will slow down as the low growth of the economy creates slackness after an important cut in monetary policy rate in mid 2019 we do not expect further cuts this year the central bank made clear that while they are intervening in the fx market a rate cut will be incoherent moreover given the volatility seen in financial asset prices we estimate the board will be particularly careful in deciding its next move regarding fiscal policy we estimate that public deficit will reach between 4 5 and 5 of gdp thus public debt will rise fast while the government has room to expand its expenditure a credible commitment toward a fiscal consolidation in the future will be important to ensure that debt converges toward a reasonable the social conflict with during the weeks was spurred by several factors including a slower economic growth after the commodity boom a persistent although declining inequality lack of safety nets for the growing middle class and corruption scandals at different levels in response to these events almost all political parties agreed to launch a process for an eventual change in the constitution the process begins with a referendum that will take place on april 26 citizens will decide if they want a new constitution or not and if so which body will write it down in writing the new constitution each article in it will have to be approved by two third of the constituent body once written the new constitution will be put back to chileans in a second referendum that we estimate will take place in march 2022 in parallel the government is looking to speed up some of the reforms that were already in discussion the bill that modernizes the tax system should be approved this week in its new design there will be no full integration of the income tax as it is it was originally proposed and there will be a focus on helping the smaller enterprises and increased taxes to the wealthy with this reform the government seeks to collect an additional clp2 2 billion regarding pensions one of the most demanded reform by the population the amendment bill proposes increasing the mandatory contributions from 10 up to 16 with increased per year of the extra contribution 3 will finance a new solidarity fund this reform will be implemented over a 12 year transition period robert moreno manager of investor relations okay thank you claudio so if you move now on to slide 7 i wanted to also briefly discuss some of the reforms and regulations that may affect the bank both positively and maybe negatively just to note not all of these reforms are finalized and many are in the initial discussions firstly beginning in january 1 of this year there is already in place a new regulation whereby banks have to automatically use available checking account funds to pay off our clients associated credit line this will have an impact on nims of around 8 basis points this year another potential risk going forward is more consumer protection through fraud compensation there is ongoing discussion about limiting the responsibility of clients in case of loss threat or fraud of debit and credit cards in light of these developments we are trying to limit the exposure of our clients to credit card fraud through education marketing campaigns daily transfer amount limits better chip technology improved atm software and other technological improvements but we cannot assure this level will not increase the financial costs related to cyber crime credit card fraud and insurance coverage as many of you know our regulator has been publishing the regulations for the implementation of basel iii in chile just this week the regulator published the model for risk weighting of credit risk from our preliminary evaluation this is broadly in line with our expectations and we continue to believe that the effect on our bank should be neutral to positive in terms of our capital ratios according to the bank regulator credit risk weighted assets will decrease 20 for the system under this new method we are still estimating the impact for us by december of this year banks must publish the risk weighted assets under basel iii other possible developments which we view as positive are the creation of a consolidated positive credit bureau and what is called financial portability these two measures should improve bank penetration levels especially through the development of new digital banking services moving on to slide 8 we wanted to give a strategy update of the bank 2019 was a landmark year in innovations as we see on slide 9 superdigital was piloted and launched and now has over 18 000 clients during the first half of 2020 we will have the official launch of superdigital which was postponed in the fourth quarter we also made advances in our acquiring business which we will go into detail shortly in november we also received the final approval from a regulator to acquire 51 of santander consumer and began consolidating this company in that month this portfolio represents around 1 of our total loan book 8 of our consumer loans and has an roe greater than 18 during the quarter our life program continued to grow strongly despite the social turmoil reaching over 136 000 clients a new private banking model will also be launched during the first half of this year on slide 10 we show the most relevant advances we made in the fourth quarter at the end of december the president of the bank claudio melandri made the first transaction through our acquiring system which is currently being piloted in the work cafe we expect to roll this out in the first semester of 2020 the acquiring business will be branded as getnet as we help grupo santander build a global brand name in this business klare our digital insurance platform will also be launched during the first half of this year the subsidiary was officially created but we are still waiting for final regulatory approvals to start operations remember that this is a 100 digital platform where clients will be able to customize and compare different insurance products these two initiatives will help bolster our fee income in the coming years on slide 21 we can see that we had a strong client we also had a strong client growth in the last during the year during the fourth quarter despite the social unrest on average we opened more than 23 new accounts each month that means we managed to open 66 more accounts compared to the same quarter of 2018 we also had the highest market share in terms of net increase in current accounts in 2019 we opened 26 of all new checking accounts in the market this also has given way to an increase in client loyalty as well as digital clients as seen on slide 12 we measure loyalty as clients with at least four products who must also surpass a minimum usage and profitability standards throughout the year we had an increase in loyal high income individuals as well as smes digital clients also kept expanding increasing 13 and reaching over 1 2 million clients our work in digitalization as well as other initiatives has also helped us improve our client satisfaction as seen on slide 13 we have consistently improved both our net promoter score and net global satisfaction closing the gap with our top contender another important topic that santander pushed during the year was esg as can be seen on slide 14 during last year our mission put an emphasis on not only to be the best bank but to do so responsibly we have always been a market leader but this year but in 2009 we put more focus on communicating our esg initiatives and this in turn helped us to improve in many ranking and indices this year for example we were able to improve our esg score as measured by vigeo eiris from a limited score of 38 out of 100 to a robust score of 58 this put us well above our chilean and latin american peers and ranked us number 8 in the world and number 4 in emerging markets for best esg standards for retail banks one such initiative in line with the responsible banking is that now our clients can compensate their carbon footprint as can be seen on slide 15 we are the first bank in the country to give our clients the opportunity to become carbon neutral clients can compensate their footprint through either directly buying certified carbon credits or contributing to an environmental project here in chile clients only have to go into their account online and they can see how many kilos of carbon dioxide they have emitted how much it translates into monetary terms and the breakdown of where the co2 emissions are coming from this initiative was launched during the end of november and during the month of december 312 tons of co2 were compensated through carbon credits clients also contributed to the foundation for a project in a national park close to coquimbo and in one month already 20 of the total financing of this project was achieved on slide 16 we show how our strategy and continued pursuit has also gained us in recognition for the second year in a row we were recognized within the top 3 in the country for best in corporate governance by a survey carried out by ernst young ey we are also very proud of climbing the ranks in great place to work on fifth place overall last year to number 3 in companies with over 1 000 employees once again we were awarded bank of the year for 2019 by the renowned magazine the banker moving on to slide 17 we will now go into the results for the fourth quarter and the full year on slide 19 we show that net income attributable to our shareholders for 2019 was clp552 billion translating to an roe of 16 7 remember that during the year we had an increase in provisions of clp31 billion in july as the new model for smes set out by our regulator came into effect as the social unrest continued from october onwards we also decided to take on an additional provision of clp16 billion for our consumer model when adjusted for these extraordinary provisions roe reached 17 7 for the year please turn to slide 19 the bank s total deposits increased 7 7 year over year and 2 7 quarter on quarter during the quarter the central bank lowered the monetary policy rate again by 25 to 1 75 this led to a decrease in the cost of funds to lower time deposit costs on the other hand demand deposits had a record year in terms of growth in 2019 increasing 18 8 8 quarter on quarter and 17 8 year over year as a reminder demand deposits are non interest bearing our liquidity ratios also remained healthy with the lcr ratio finishing the year at 143 and the nsfr at 108 on slide 20 we review loan growth total loans increased 8 1 in 2019 in line with guidance and 2 6 quarter on quarter loans to individuals was the fastest growing segment in 2019 led by an increase in lending to high income earners this was also driven in part by the incorporation of santander consumer in november following the final approval from our regulator this contributed clp451 billion of consumer loans as of december 2019 representing 8 of the consumer loan book going forward we expect loan growth of 5 for this year with more or less the same growth across all segments on slide 21 we show the evolution of nims the quarter on quarter increase in the net interest margin was mainly due to the higher uf inflation rate a decrease of 25 basis points in the short term interest rate and the improved funding mix these positive effects were partially offset by the negative impact of lower long term interest rates that drove a record level of refinancing of mortgages in the year with this in mind on slide 22 we wanted to show you the evolution of certain market factors that should help to sustain margins in 2020 as you can see on this slide the yield on the central bank s two year note fell steadily during 2019 but began recovering during the fourth quarter this should help loan spreads at the same time the central bank cut the monetary policy rate this should lower funding costs during 2020 in addition we have seen an increase in inflation which is positive for margins we also expect a positive push from santander consumer which should boost margins by 10 basis points as well on the other hand we do have headwinds coming from the regulatory changes as well as slower economic growth therefore we are leaving our guidance for nims with a stable outlook for the year at around 4 1 on slide 23 we can see that the asset quality had a slight deterioration during the quarter due to the social unrest in chile with npls and the impaired loan ratio increasing 10 basis points to 2 1 and 5 9 respectively by segment smes were the most affected within our loan book we have been proactive in trying to help our sme clients by either refinancing or giving grace periods for them to recover explaining the uptick in impaired commercial loans as well our coverage ratio increased in the consumer loan portfolio during the quarter as we set aside additional provisions for clp16 billion to cover possible higher risk levels and any greater provisions required by the bank regulator for this portfolio in 2020 in mortgages we have maintained a focus on originating mortgage loans among high income earners and with an average loan to value below 80 this has been a key factor in maintaining healthy asset quality in this product moving on to slide 24 we can see that the cost of credit ended the fourth quarter at 1 9 and 1 3 for the whole year when adjusted by the onetime charge previously mentioned the cost of credit was 1 7 in the quarter incorporation of santander consumer had an effect on the cost of credit of 10 basis points in the quarter going forward our cost of credit should remain stable at 1 3 to 1 4 in 2020 due to the expected increase in unemployment lower economic growth of 1 for the year and the incorporation of santander consumer this will be partially contained by the bank s minimal exposure to low income retail lending only less than 1 of the loan book today is to low income earners on slide 25 we show how non interest income was a positive contributor to our revenues this reflects that despite lower growth we successfully continued to generate greater business income with our new and existing clients financial transactions had an overall strong year especially in client treasury as demand for treasury products remained strong throughout 2019 fee income rebounded nicely in the second half of the year led by a rebound in card fees due to the migration of our cards to an interchange fee model and greater usage an increase in collections fees from santander consumer which we started to consolidate in the quarter and an increase in financial advisory among our corporate clients in total non interest income increased 25 in 2019 in 2020 fee income should continue to recover as many of our initiatives such as klare should begin contributing and new client and client loyalty growth remains high all in we expect non net interest income to rise above loan growth in 2020 on slide 26 we show our distribution network as of the end of the year we had 377 branches of which 53 were work cafes during the social unrest we had 70 branches which suffered damages with 15 inoperable most of the damage was covered by insurance which is reflected in other operating income in the quarter at the same time we recognized an impairment of clp2 8 billion due to destroyed assets and branches we do not expect any material additional charges due to social unrest in 2020 however our digital channels have been able to serve our clients efficiently during these times driving upward our productivity levels in 2020 employee headcount decreased compared to last year however when compared to the previous quarter there was uptick as we began consolidating santander consumer the incorporation of santander consumer added about 200 employees to the bank headcount going forward we do not believe headcount should increase further please turn to slide 27 operating expenses remained flat in the quarter with a year on year growth of 3 9 the bank consistently delivers world class levels of efficiency with a ratio of 38 3 in the quarter and 40 for the year the bank continues to spend on marketing communication cyber security and technology developments as well as improvements to our distribution network but the efficiency ratio should remain around 40 for 2020 as well please turn to slide 28 as of december 2019 we reached a core capital ratio of 10 1 and our bis ratio reached 12 9 the solid capital ratios at the end of the quarter gives the bank room to grow and to continue implementing our investment plan as we stated before the cmf has been publishing a series of regulations that map out the transition of banks to basel iii firstly the cmf published for discussion the definition of systemic banks the regulator then published for discussion the determination of the operational risk coefficient which are all very much in line with the recommendations made by the basel committee in basel iv we estimate that operational risk should add on around 7 to our risk weighted assets very much in line with our original estimates more recently this week the regulator published for discussion the credit risk weightings according to the regulator using information for december 2018 the regulations proposed should reduce credit risk assets by 23 compared to current regulations which will lead to a total savings for the industry of 4 5 billion however this will be compensated by the incorporation of operational and market risks we continue to believe that the transition to basel iii or iv will be neutral to positive for this bank in 2019 we distributed an annual dividend of 60 of the previous year s profits which led to a dividend yield of 3 7 for 2020 we expect a similar level of payout which places our current dividend yield at above 4 the final dividend proposal will be decided by the board in march to finalize we will now move on to our outlook for 2020 on slide 30 the social unrest in chile continues to create uncertainty in the local economy we expect investment to contract in 2020 it should be compensated by the export sector and higher fiscal spending from the reforms initiatives proposed to address the social issues however our ambitious investment plan which is focused on digitalization and technological improvements and new businesses such as acquiring will continue to progress in 2020 we expect loan growth in 2020 to reach 5 with higher growth coming from retail loans margin should benefit from higher inflation particularly in the first semester and the impact of santander consumer however this will be compensated may be compensated by regulatory changes such as the automatic payment of credit lines therefore nim should remain stable at around 4 1 our improving client service in digital channels has enhanced our ability to capture new clients and cross sell existing ones and this should continue driving non interest income slightly above loan growth considering the expectation that unemployment will increase this year and the onetime provisions already taken in 2019 we now expect cost of credit to remain stable at 1 3 to 1 4 of loans average loans the efficiency ratio should also remain around 40 even including our ambitious investment plan and the effective tax rate will remain on average around 21 to 22 with this outlook we believe a return on average equity of around 17 is attainable at this time we will gladly answer any questions you may have questions and answers operator and our first question comes from the line of ernesto gabilondo with bank of america ernesto gabilondo bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi good morning emiliano robert and claudio and thanks for the opportunity to my questions my first question is in the economic outlook as you mentioned the economic growth is expected to decelerate in 2020 so considering the potential increase in chile s debt from 27 to 40 in the next years the implementation of our progressive tax reform the implementation of the pension reform and the challenges of reaching a constitutional agreement do you see the possibility of a negative outlook for chile from credit rating agencies later this year i will this will be my last my first question and then i will ask a couple of questions robert moreno manager of investor relations okay first of all up to now rating agencies have been positive regarding chile s outlook they have been supportive of the strategy the government is pursuing the information regarding the evolution of the deficit has been made public already since a couple of weeks so the agencies already incorporated that information into their evaluation and up to now in general their evaluation is relatively positive now there are risks there is a risk on the activity on the one hand in general we see more downside risk than upside risk for activity and also of course the impact of the pension reform may not be completely incorporated in the forecast for the evolution of the public deficit into the future therefore we see some risk of a revision of the outlook for the economy in the future ernesto gabilondo bank of america merrill lynch analyst great thank you so much and then a couple of questions the first one is in terms of your expectations for loan growth so we know this loan growth of 8 in 2019 i think it was partially explained by the acquisition of the consumer portfolio but how do you see the organic and total loan growth in 2020 under this scenario you mentioned 5 but just want to know if this is considering an organic growth or it s excluding the consumer portfolio and especially i will appreciate your expectations in the sme segment we have seen several merchants that have not been able to reopen their businesses and we think that social unrest is expected to come back in march after being in holidays and then my last question is if it would be reasonable to expect low to mid single digit earnings growth in 2020 and with that we will reach your 17 roe for this year thank you robert moreno manager of investor relations okay so the 5 is the year end versus year end so it includes it s organic obviously in the first half of the year we re comparing it will be higher because we ll be including santander consumer compared to last year when we were not or when we reach the end of the year it should be around 5 so take that as organic and smes smes is a large segment for the bank it s around 15 of the loan book and there we have companies that sell up to around 3 million but there s more than 200 000 companies and the focus will be obviously in the larger smes the smes that also are more involved in the export business chile many sectors so there are sectors that are going to perform well this year as claudio said the export sectors should be have a strong year the prices of chile s exports have been relatively robust copper has been a little volatile but the other ones have been very very strong and we re obviously probably going to avoid some of them maybe the smaller smes until we have better economic figures and obviously in smes there s a lot of stores and commerce which suffered in october november we did see improvements in december and in january things have been really calm as you said we don t march is a big question mark everyone is kind of on vacation now but given that the government has taken a lot of steps to reform to do reforms they announced the constitutional reforms i m not saying that social unrest will disappear but we don t believe it will at the levels we saw in october november because a lot has been done and the democratic institutions are slowly churning out the reforms that everyone has been asking for so i would say smes are kind of the weak link in the loan book but we think things should slowly get better and not worse okay ernesto gabilondo bank of america merrill lynch analyst perfect thank you and then for my last question emiliano muratore chief financial officer about the net income growth robert moreno manager of investor relations net income growth yeah so exactly so basically we ve always said it comes true we should have a mid to high single digit eps growth right so basically i think the important thing here is that despite the lower loan growth our revenue growth last year revenues grew like 5 6 we re not expecting revenue growth to slow down because margins should be relatively stable non interest income should be high or good or strong or similar to loan growth and the big question mark and we did give some guidance is the cost of credit okay ernesto gabilondo bank of america merrill lynch analyst perfect very helpful thank you very much operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of jason mollin with scotiabank jason mollin scotiabank analyst hello everyone my first question is a follow up on loan growth do you consider this outlook conservative and you talk about the upside and downside risk to this 5 for total loans and my second question is about the new client data that you showed with santander chile achieving a 26 share of the net increase in clients can you talk about these clients do they come from other banks are these clients new to the system what kind of clients are they thank you very much emiliano muratore chief financial officer hello jason regarding the let s say the bias or the loan growth guidance i think that it s a bit biased to the downside as claudio was mentioning that our 5 is consistent with the 1 gdp growth that as of today we see maybe more downside risk than upside risk to that gdp and that would imply also the loan growth expectation to be a little bit more biased to the downside if we consider like risk scenarios although today our base case and maybe best estimate is that 1 for gdp 5 for loan growth but in terms of risk scenarios i would say that the downside is a bit higher than the upside robert moreno manager of investor relations and regarding the so we had as we said in the presentation growth of 26 and a net increase in checking accounts through october so this is mainly the middle high income portion of the clients and this is a mix of everything getting since these are checking accounts this is mainly people who are already in the system so i would say it s clients coming from other banks i think this has a lot to do with the fact that our client service has been steadily improving our digital services have always been very good the fact that the work cafe has really helped their image and so forth so checking accounts is really a reflection of all the efforts we ve done on many fronts and mainly is there a little bit of cross selling we ve been very successful in opening checking accounts not only in chilean pesos but in dollars and we re also obviously capturing market from other clients the new entrants are basically coming through santander life and superdigital especially santander life santander life they re opening debit card accounts so it s not included in the checking account and that has also been very strong santander life has been very well perceived by clients remember that there was social unrest but santander life s merit program is very much in line with what people are looking for they will be recognized for their efforts and the digital onboarding in santander life kept things going even when branches were closed okay jason mollin scotiabank analyst thank you very much operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of thiago batista with ubs thiago batista ubs analyst hi guys i have two questions the first one is a follow up on the macro overview or the macro outlook about the unemployment ratio how much you guys are expecting for unemployment ratio in chile in 2020 and also if this explains the potential increase in cost of risk when it s increased the 1 3 to 1 4 guidance for cost of risk if this should be caused by this increase in the unemployment ratio in chile my second question is about the medium term roe so i know that there s a lot of moving parts nowadays in chile but do you believe it s possible to work with the roe of 19 and 20 as used to be a couple of years ago or the 17 tend to be the new level robert moreno manager of investor relations on unemployment we expect unemployment to go up up to 8 to 8 5 this year we are starting at around 7 in november that 7 already accounts for part of the event of the social unrest and up to now the labor market a significant deterioration however because of the slow growth we re expecting for this year unemployment should go up now having said that our risks are more to the downside than there is a risk to the upside in terms of unemployment but in no case we are seeing unemployment reaching two digit levels emiliano muratore chief financial officer yes and relating that to cost of risk the increase in cost of risk during the last quarter had to do in part with let s say the employment situation worsening a bit not so far yet but not too much yet but yes the expectations are unemployment going up and regarding long term roe we honestly i think that it is still like too early to assess or let s say recalibrate long term roe expectations at this moment because although the situation in chile has been relatively let s say abrupt and big during these last few months i think it s too early to change or to let s say guide the long term roe after this situation and we will need to have to see the time passing and maybe during this year we got to have a clearer picture of let s say the new long term expectation for the economy and for the bank thiago batista ubs analyst okay thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of tito labarta with goldman sachs tito labarta goldman sachs analyst hi good morning thanks emiliano and robert for the call my question in terms of asset quality i guess and the cost of risk you saw a little bit of deterioration in the quarter do you think this will continue throughout the year i know you mentioned higher unemployment so it probably will but just wanted to get a sense how much do you think it could deteriorate from here and also with the cost of risk right it s a bit more elevated than in the past given the uncertainty which makes sense but do you think that you can if things go well you eventually get back to that 1 1 cost of risk that we saw in the past or do you think just given the uncertainty beyond this year it could likely remain more elevated at that 1 3 1 4 level or even higher just to get a sense on maybe some sensitivity on asset quality and cost of risk that you expect thank you emiliano muratore chief financial officer yeah i think it s important what you mentioned that before up to september before all this situation in chile we were with that underlying cost of risk of around 1 that is consistent with all the changes we have made in the composition of the loan book so when you look at the cost of risk of the last quarter and also the total for the year around 1 35 we think that assuming the underlying risk of the portfolio that it was consistent with that 1 the new environment in terms of employment and consumption and economic activity we think that it s going to be unlikely to go as low as we were before all this so that 1 1 1 looks too challenging but also we think that the situation from where we are in the last quarter especially after seeing the behavior of the portfolio in october november and december that it has been sequentially better month after month october was the one with the biggest noise and disruption but then november and december we saw a kind of good behavior of the delinquency in the portfolio so i would say that as low as we were before october it s unlikely that but we don t see the full year cost of risk going higher than we had last year tito labarta goldman sachs analyst okay thanks emiliano it s helpful operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of neha agarwala with hsbc neha agarwala hsbc analyst hi thank you for taking my question first on the regulatory side do you foresee any other regulatory changes that are not incorporated in your guidance maybe higher tax rate and the second question is on the asset quality i understand that you re being more cautious on the retail and construction sector any other sector or segment that you are trying to hold on and not grow as much this year thank you so much emiliano muratore chief financial officer helo neha regarding the regulation we don t see and actually there is not any other piece of regulation on the table under discussion apart from the ones we mentioned so we are not factoring in any other piece in our outlook for the year and in terms of asset quality and sectors actually i think that it s going to depend the growth on the demand of credit that it will also be different among other sectors we are still seeing i would say kind of normal decent demand coming from middle market corporates all the external sector exporters and all that so and we haven t seen any significant slowdown in loan growth in those segments then when you go to smes the demand is also nice now a bit lower because of the general situation but no there is no any specific sector that we think that we need to slow down or stop we do want to be let s say prudent in exploring like new clients and we want to work more with our client base clients that we know that we have been working with them in the past so maybe in terms of calibrating the growth strategy maybe the biggest tweak would be like not being extremely aggressive in capturing new clients especially in lending i mean going into lending to new client that is maybe the biggest change if you compare the current stance to what we had before neha agarwala hsbc analyst okay and if i can ask another question could you update us on the ifrs implementation emiliano muratore chief financial officer probably it s by january next year when all the disclosing regulation is implemented in chile i would say that by january 2021 we will be fully ifrs except for credit losses provisioning that is the part where we are not ifrs and we are not going to be in the near future and so in the long term our expectation is to convert fully to ifrs because remember that now all the issuers not just banks are under the same regulator the cmf and all the other issuers are under full ifrs so i think that in the long term i expect to see conversions to full ifrs but in the near future we expect to be as we are in full ifrs except for provisions that will stay with this more standardized expected loss model created by the regulator robert moreno manager of investor relations just as a clarification we are ifrs except for the credit provisions and the change that s coming now is the format how we publish all our financials that will change to more or less what you see in other parts of the world and that should be finished by the end of this year beginning of next year okay neha agarwala hsbc analyst okay great thank you so much operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of sebastian gallego with credicorp sebastian gallego credicorp analyst hi good morning thanks for the presentation i have several questions the first one on asset quality as well more follow up on asset quality i just want to get a sense if you can break down per segment on commercial consumer and mortgage where do you see the most deterioration in terms of asset quality delinquencies or npls second question is related to margins i just want to get a sense of under which scenario are you considering or what s your base case scenario for inflation or uf inflation on a quarterly basis just to reach stableness in your guidance and final question is regarding basel iii standards when you read the article that was published by the regulator they mentioned that even though the risk weighted assets or the credit risk weighted assets will decline this will be compensated by the other risk weighted assets market and operational the question is do you expect that to actually compensate or do you actually believe that the net effect will be a decline in risk weighted assets thank you robert moreno manager of investor relations okay so regarding your first question which is the asset quality break down basically obviously there s potential for consumer lending to deteriorate but we really have a really high coverage so remember we took clp16 billion in additional provisions we have very little loan growth in the low end of the market so i think that is a good you could say insurance policy so maybe npls could rise but i don t expect a huge deterioration of the cost of risk in consumer lending okay and mortgage is similar as well and remember all of this is using the current 1 percent gdp forecast and unemployment forecast we discussed and mortgage as well in mortgage we have decent loan to value ratios and we ve also focused growth more on the higher end so obviously there could be some deterioration but we feel like we ve it could be contained and the big question mark really comes from the sme sector where i think you saw it in the fourth quarter and you and we re probably there where we could see potential further deterioration and the need to increase the cost of risk so i would say that s the basic breakdown and that s why we are forecasting a cost of risk of 1 3 to 1 4 okay emiliano muratore chief financial officer regarding the inflation expectations for the full year today we are expecting a 2 7 uf5 variation on the quarterly profile i would say it s relatively stable i mean 0 7 0 8 for the different quarters starting in this quarter so that s why with that inflation assumption we are foreseeing still stable nims and regarding the impact of basel iii on the numbers one of the i would say one of the things we found is that the regulator is incorporating some kind of complexity in the standard method when to calculate the weighting so it s we don t have our fine print our numbers today but if you the regulator mentioned that there will be a 23 reduction in risk weighted assets coming from risk so if we do that if we take that 23 for us and we assume that credit risk will fall 23 and we take into account the operational regulation that is already under consultation so we know how it will be and if you then you have market risk of the x there in that equation and but if you take the scenario of keeping the same model that today we have under basel i which is a very let s say harsh and prudent model if you take those numbers we see our cet1 around 11 that is roughly like 100 basis point higher than what we have today but there are i would say in that calculation the two big questions are that 23 of reduction coming from credit risk how close we are to that average above or below we will know that in the weeks when we are able to do the all the simulations and calculations and then market risk how close it is the basel iii model the basel iv model compared to the basel i we have today but that s the kind of number we are seeing so far sebastian gallego credicorp analyst perfect very clear thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of jorg friedemann with citibank jorg friedemann citibank analyst thank you very much for taking my question i have also a couple of follow ups if possible just for me to understand you explained several times already regarding your cost of risk guidance and asset quality expectations but in this quarter you actually took a proactive stance and buildup coverage in advance before a more severe deterioration came in so is this the same rationale that you are going to follow going forward to come up with this 1 3 to 1 4 or are you going to be more reactive to npl deterioration from now on so the question is if we re going to continue building up coverage in the expectation of things to deteriorate or you are going to be only more reactive going forward so this is the first question and the second question if you could give us an update on the payout taking into consideration these regulations of basel iii that are coming in thank you robert moreno manager of investor relations okay so regarding your first question i think maybe one way to explain it is during 2019 we had a cost of risk of 1 3 but we had like one timer s right so we had clp16 billion in the fourth quarter and the clp31 billion in the third if you take that out our cost of risk was 1 1 so you can say with all the events last year we would have been at like 1 1 1 and with an increase at 1 3 is what i m saying so the actual impact of all of this is a 20 on a comparable basis is like a 20 basis increase so i would say there was in the fourth quarter some kind of proactive this year it s going to be more i would say a little more like reactive because of the proactiveness we already did ok so on a comparable basis we re going from like 1 cost of risk to 1 3 1 4 and that s how we view it and we feel comfortable with that considering that we ve already done last year okay and the second on the payout so as we said in the just a little while ago given the information we have now regarding our current capital ratios and what we ve seen and what we can infer from the new regulations we expect to pay out of 2019 earnings which would be paid in april to be around 60 similar payout which gives you a current dividend yield of around like 4 or so now the board still hasn t decided on its final resolution and what it will propose to the shareholders meeting and that will be informed at the end of march okay emiliano muratore chief financial officer and so maybe let s say well definitely we said loan growth expectations are not so high and are a bit biased to the downside so that the pressure on the capital shouldn t come from let s say faster loan growth there are a few pieces of the regulation for basel iii to be put under presentations market risk being one of them and some others so those are the maybe the risk on the payout having without having any relevant negative surprise coming from the basel iii regulation you should expect the payout to be stable compared to last year jorg friedemann citibank analyst that s very clear i appreciate it thank you very much operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of piedad alessandri with credicorp piedad alessandri credicorp analyst hi thank you for allowing some questions i know there are no new regulations under discussions but are you considering the possibility of an increase on bank taxes considering the increase in debt for the government or do you see the possibility of a specific tax for the banks emiliano muratore chief financial officer no actually we are not at this moment considering any of those taxes in the future there is nothing being discussed and so under the current tax reform nothing like that is under discussion so going to your question no we are not considering that piedad alessandri credicorp analyst thank you very much operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of yuri fernandes with j p morgan yuri fernandes j p morgan analyst hi emiliano hi robert i have a question regarding margins are you being conservative here looking to your inflation outlook you had like flattish inflation too like the cpi at 2 7 and santander chile you have like a benefit that maybe your peers and should not have you just consolidated a consumer finance company that helped margins and you also had a very good performance on demand deposits so if you are really right on the flattish margins for 2020 i think the outlook here is negative for the system right because it s maybe down for your peers and for the system so that s the first one regarding margins are you conservative here or not and i have a follow up on asset quality you had many many questions here but just checking about the renegotiated portfolio if you can provide some color on how big was the increase this quarter when are you renegotiating those loans you can provide any metric any color so we can track these and keep an eye on how the renegotiated book is behaving thank you emiliano muratore chief financial officer okay so first on nim i would say that it s not so conservative because you re right in the sense that we have many tailwinds for nims like the central bank cut rates recently the slope of the curve recovered and now we have let s say a decent slope between the shorter end and the longer end then inflation is going to be stable or maybe with some upside risk if the fx keeps high or and depreciating so i would say that in general the new origination all these factors are positive factors for nims maybe the thing that you are not factoring in is that all the big flow of mortgages refinancing that we had last year it was mainly during the second half of last year so we are still seeing that let s say snowball effect in the full year margin for this year so and maybe that s why without factoring in that more refinancing mortgage effect you can see it as conservative but this effect is going to hit harder during the full year in 2020 than it was in 2019 which was only part of the year robert moreno manager of investor relations asset quality yeah so the best way to go monitoring that is the impaired loan ratio that s why we include that because in very simple terms the impaired loan ratio on slide 23 if you can look at there that includes the npls plus mainly the renegotiated loans so if you look at the commercial loans the impaired loan ratio went from 6 7 to 7 that s the biggest impact we had there in asset quality and that s the renegotiation of these sme loans in tourism restaurants hotels small shops so the best way to go monitoring how that behaves is impaired loan ratio and obviously our provisioning models which aren t ifrs 9 but they are forward looking they have to take so when you renegotiate you just don t sweep problems under the table you have to take provisions anyway so that s why provisions were high apart from the because if you take out the clp16 billion you still get a relatively large amount of provisions because we were increasing provisions for these impaired loans so as the year progresses not only do you look at npls but keep a track of how the impaired loan ratio evolves because that s a good indicator of the overall in fact the impaired loan ratio is very similar to the stage 3 of ifrs 9 okay yuri fernandes j p morgan analyst no super clear robert thanks for the answers if i just may ask one thing on the cost of risk it s fair to assume that it should be much higher in the first half of the year especially in the first q and then gradually decrease right and the average should be the 1 3 1 4 you mentioned in the guidance right robert moreno manager of investor relations yeah i think that should be correct yes yuri fernandes j p morgan analyst thank you operator thank you and i m showing no further questions at this time so with that i ll turn the call back over to cfo emiliano

bsac earnings call for the period ending december 31 2019 banco santander chile bsac 0 40 q4 2019 earnings call 10 00 a m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks operator ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by and welcome to the q4 2019 banco santander chile earnings conference call i would now like to hand the conference over to cfo emiliano muratore please go ahead sir emiliano muratore chief financial officer good morning everyone welcome to banco santander chile s fourth quarter 2019 results webcast and conference call this is emiliano muratore cfo and i m joined today by robert moreno managing director of investor relations and our chief economist claudio soto thank you for attending today s conference call despite a challenging quarter we have made advances in our strategy and look forward to sharing with you our progress before we get into our results claudio will give us some insight into the macro environment and our expectations for the rest of the year claudio soto chief economist thank you emiliano activity contracted abruptly in the fourth quarter due to the social unrest that affected chile october s metrics fell more than 5 against september in november there was partially recover with a 1 gain we estimate activity continued improving in december as the social unrest receded all in all we estimate the economy fell by more than 2 year on year in the last quarter and the year as a whole expanded 1 1 going forward activity will depend to a large extent on the domestic political scenario confidence has declined and risk premiums have increased on top of that uncertainty regarding the constitutional process will affect new investment projects against that backdrop a substantial fiscal stimulus will help to support domestic demand on the other hand the real depreciation of the peso of about 10 will boost export all in all we see a 4 decline in gross capital formation for the year as a whole private consumption will expand at around 1 and export will speed up to 3 3 gdp in total will grow 1 this year until now official figures do not show a significant deterioration in the labor market however layoffs during the last days of december increased relevantly although we estimate that there won t be significant layoffs in the coming months job creation will slow down therefore unemployment will increase up to 8 to 8 5 during the year cpi inflation increased in the last month and closed 2019 just at the 3 target of the central bank which led to a uf inflation variation of 2 7 during the first quarter cpi inflation will increase about 3 5 driven by the currency depreciation however in the second part of the year it will slow down as the low growth of the economy creates slackness after an important cut in monetary policy rate in mid 2019 we do not expect further cuts this year the central bank made clear that while they are intervening in the fx market a rate cut will be incoherent moreover given the volatility seen in financial asset prices we estimate the board will be particularly careful in deciding its next move regarding fiscal policy we estimate that public deficit will reach between 4 5 and 5 of gdp thus public debt will rise fast while the government has room to expand its expenditure a credible commitment toward a fiscal consolidation in the future will be important to ensure that debt converges toward a reasonable the social conflict with during the weeks was spurred by several factors including a slower economic growth after the commodity boom a persistent although declining inequality lack of safety nets for the growing middle class and corruption scandals at different levels in response to these events almost all political parties agreed to launch a process for an eventual change in the constitution the process begins with a referendum that will take place on april 26 citizens will decide if they want a new constitution or not and if so which body will write it down in writing the new constitution each article in it will have to be approved by two third of the constituent body once written the new constitution will be put back to chileans in a second referendum that we estimate will take place in march 2022 in parallel the government is looking to speed up some of the reforms that were already in discussion the bill that modernizes the tax system should be approved this week in its new design there will be no full integration of the income tax as it is it was originally proposed and there will be a focus on helping the smaller enterprises and increased taxes to the wealthy with this reform the government seeks to collect an additional clp2 2 billion regarding pensions one of the most demanded reform by the population the amendment bill proposes increasing the mandatory contributions from 10 up to 16 with increased per year of the extra contribution 3 will finance a new solidarity fund this reform will be implemented over a 12 year transition period robert moreno manager of investor relations okay thank you claudio so if you move now on to slide 7 i wanted to also briefly discuss some of the reforms and regulations that may affect the bank both positively and maybe negatively just to note not all of these reforms are finalized and many are in the initial discussions firstly beginning in january 1 of this year there is already in place a new regulation whereby banks have to automatically use available checking account funds to pay off our clients associated credit line this will have an impact on nims of around 8 basis points this year another potential risk going forward is more consumer protection through fraud compensation there is ongoing discussion about limiting the responsibility of clients in case of loss threat or fraud of debit and credit cards in light of these developments we are trying to limit the exposure of our clients to credit card fraud through education marketing campaigns daily transfer amount limits better chip technology improved atm software and other technological improvements but we cannot assure this level will not increase the financial costs related to cyber crime credit card fraud and insurance coverage as many of you know our regulator has been publishing the regulations for the implementation of basel iii in chile just this week the regulator published the model for risk weighting of credit risk from our preliminary evaluation this is broadly in line with our expectations and we continue to believe that the effect on our bank should be neutral to positive in terms of our capital ratios according to the bank regulator credit risk weighted assets will decrease 20 for the system under this new method we are still estimating the impact for us by december of this year banks must publish the risk weighted assets under basel iii other possible developments which we view as positive are the creation of a consolidated positive credit bureau and what is called financial portability these two measures should improve bank penetration levels especially through the development of new digital banking services moving on to slide 8 we wanted to give a strategy update of the bank 2019 was a landmark year in innovations as we see on slide 9 superdigital was piloted and launched and now has over 18 000 clients during the first half of 2020 we will have the official launch of superdigital which was postponed in the fourth quarter we also made advances in our acquiring business which we will go into detail shortly in november we also received the final approval from a regulator to acquire 51 of santander consumer and began consolidating this company in that month this portfolio represents around 1 of our total loan book 8 of our consumer loans and has an roe greater than 18 during the quarter our life program continued to grow strongly despite the social turmoil reaching over 136 000 clients a new private banking model will also be launched during the first half of this year on slide 10 we show the most relevant advances we made in the fourth quarter at the end of december the president of the bank claudio melandri made the first transaction through our acquiring system which is currently being piloted in the work cafe we expect to roll this out in the first semester of 2020 the acquiring business will be branded as getnet as we help grupo santander build a global brand name in this business klare our digital insurance platform will also be launched during the first half of this year the subsidiary was officially created but we are still waiting for final regulatory approvals to start operations remember that this is a 100 digital platform where clients will be able to customize and compare different insurance products these two initiatives will help bolster our fee income in the coming years on slide 21 we can see that we had a strong client we also had a strong client growth in the last during the year during the fourth quarter despite the social unrest on average we opened more than 23 new accounts each month that means we managed to open 66 more accounts compared to the same quarter of 2018 we also had the highest market share in terms of net increase in current accounts in 2019 we opened 26 of all new checking accounts in the market this also has given way to an increase in client loyalty as well as digital clients as seen on slide 12 we measure loyalty as clients with at least four products who must also surpass a minimum usage and profitability standards throughout the year we had an increase in loyal high income individuals as well as smes digital clients also kept expanding increasing 13 and reaching over 1 2 million clients our work in digitalization as well as other initiatives has also helped us improve our client satisfaction as seen on slide 13 we have consistently improved both our net promoter score and net global satisfaction closing the gap with our top contender another important topic that santander pushed during the year was esg as can be seen on slide 14 during last year our mission put an emphasis on not only to be the best bank but to do so responsibly we have always been a market leader but this year but in 2009 we put more focus on communicating our esg initiatives and this in turn helped us to improve in many ranking and indices this year for example we were able to improve our esg score as measured by vigeo eiris from a limited score of 38 out of 100 to a robust score of 58 this put us well above our chilean and latin american peers and ranked us number 8 in the world and number 4 in emerging markets for best esg standards for retail banks one such initiative in line with the responsible banking is that now our clients can compensate their carbon footprint as can be seen on slide 15 we are the first bank in the country to give our clients the opportunity to become carbon neutral clients can compensate their footprint through either directly buying certified carbon credits or contributing to an environmental project here in chile clients only have to go into their account online and they can see how many kilos of carbon dioxide they have emitted how much it translates into monetary terms and the breakdown of where the co2 emissions are coming from this initiative was launched during the end of november and during the month of december 312 tons of co2 were compensated through carbon credits clients also contributed to the foundation for a project in a national park close to coquimbo and in one month already 20 of the total financing of this project was achieved on slide 16 we show how our strategy and continued pursuit has also gained us in recognition for the second year in a row we were recognized within the top 3 in the country for best in corporate governance by a survey carried out by ernst young ey we are also very proud of climbing the ranks in great place to work on fifth place overall last year to number 3 in companies with over 1 000 employees once again we were awarded bank of the year for 2019 by the renowned magazine the banker moving on to slide 17 we will now go into the results for the fourth quarter and the full year on slide 19 we show that net income attributable to our shareholders for 2019 was clp552 billion translating to an roe of 16 7 remember that during the year we had an increase in provisions of clp31 billion in july as the new model for smes set out by our regulator came into effect as the social unrest continued from october onwards we also decided to take on an additional provision of clp16 billion for our consumer model when adjusted for these extraordinary provisions roe reached 17 7 for the year please turn to slide 19 the bank s total deposits increased 7 7 year over year and 2 7 quarter on quarter during the quarter the central bank lowered the monetary policy rate again by 25 to 1 75 this led to a decrease in the cost of funds to lower time deposit costs on the other hand demand deposits had a record year in terms of growth in 2019 increasing 18 8 8 quarter on quarter and 17 8 year over year as a reminder demand deposits are non interest bearing our liquidity ratios also remained healthy with the lcr ratio finishing the year at 143 and the nsfr at 108 on slide 20 we review loan growth total loans increased 8 1 in 2019 in line with guidance and 2 6 quarter on quarter loans to individuals was the fastest growing segment in 2019 led by an increase in lending to high income earners this was also driven in part by the incorporation of santander consumer in november following the final approval from our regulator this contributed clp451 billion of consumer loans as of december 2019 representing 8 of the consumer loan book going forward we expect loan growth of 5 for this year with more or less the same growth across all segments on slide 21 we show the evolution of nims the quarter on quarter increase in the net interest margin was mainly due to the higher uf inflation rate a decrease of 25 basis points in the short term interest rate and the improved funding mix these positive effects were partially offset by the negative impact of lower long term interest rates that drove a record level of refinancing of mortgages in the year with this in mind on slide 22 we wanted to show you the evolution of certain market factors that should help to sustain margins in 2020 as you can see on this slide the yield on the central bank s two year note fell steadily during 2019 but began recovering during the fourth quarter this should help loan spreads at the same time the central bank cut the monetary policy rate this should lower funding costs during 2020 in addition we have seen an increase in inflation which is positive for margins we also expect a positive push from santander consumer which should boost margins by 10 basis points as well on the other hand we do have headwinds coming from the regulatory changes as well as slower economic growth therefore we are leaving our guidance for nims with a stable outlook for the year at around 4 1 on slide 23 we can see that the asset quality had a slight deterioration during the quarter due to the social unrest in chile with npls and the impaired loan ratio increasing 10 basis points to 2 1 and 5 9 respectively by segment smes were the most affected within our loan book we have been proactive in trying to help our sme clients by either refinancing or giving grace periods for them to recover explaining the uptick in impaired commercial loans as well our coverage ratio increased in the consumer loan portfolio during the quarter as we set aside additional provisions for clp16 billion to cover possible higher risk levels and any greater provisions required by the bank regulator for this portfolio in 2020 in mortgages we have maintained a focus on originating mortgage loans among high income earners and with an average loan to value below 80 this has been a key factor in maintaining healthy asset quality in this product moving on to slide 24 we can see that the cost of credit ended the fourth quarter at 1 9 and 1 3 for the whole year when adjusted by the onetime charge previously mentioned the cost of credit was 1 7 in the quarter incorporation of santander consumer had an effect on the cost of credit of 10 basis points in the quarter going forward our cost of credit should remain stable at 1 3 to 1 4 in 2020 due to the expected increase in unemployment lower economic growth of 1 for the year and the incorporation of santander consumer this will be partially contained by the bank s minimal exposure to low income retail lending only less than 1 of the loan book today is to low income earners on slide 25 we show how non interest income was a positive contributor to our revenues this reflects that despite lower growth we successfully continued to generate greater business income with our new and existing clients financial transactions had an overall strong year especially in client treasury as demand for treasury products remained strong throughout 2019 fee income rebounded nicely in the second half of the year led by a rebound in card fees due to the migration of our cards to an interchange fee model and greater usage an increase in collections fees from santander consumer which we started to consolidate in the quarter and an increase in financial advisory among our corporate clients in total non interest income increased 25 in 2019 in 2020 fee income should continue to recover as many of our initiatives such as klare should begin contributing and new client and client loyalty growth remains high all in we expect non net interest income to rise above loan growth in 2020 on slide 26 we show our distribution network as of the end of the year we had 377 branches of which 53 were work cafes during the social unrest we had 70 branches which suffered damages with 15 inoperable most of the damage was covered by insurance which is reflected in other operating income in the quarter at the same time we recognized an impairment of clp2 8 billion due to destroyed assets and branches we do not expect any material additional charges due to social unrest in 2020 however our digital channels have been able to serve our clients efficiently during these times driving upward our productivity levels in 2020 employee headcount decreased compared to last year however when compared to the previous quarter there was uptick as we began consolidating santander consumer the incorporation of santander consumer added about 200 employees to the bank headcount going forward we do not believe headcount should increase further please turn to slide 27 operating expenses remained flat in the quarter with a year on year growth of 3 9 the bank consistently delivers world class levels of efficiency with a ratio of 38 3 in the quarter and 40 for the year the bank continues to spend on marketing communication cyber security and technology developments as well as improvements to our distribution network but the efficiency ratio should remain around 40 for 2020 as well please turn to slide 28 as of december 2019 we reached a core capital ratio of 10 1 and our bis ratio reached 12 9 the solid capital ratios at the end of the quarter gives the bank room to grow and to continue implementing our investment plan as we stated before the cmf has been publishing a series of regulations that map out the transition of banks to basel iii firstly the cmf published for discussion the definition of systemic banks the regulator then published for discussion the determination of the operational risk coefficient which are all very much in line with the recommendations made by the basel committee in basel iv we estimate that operational risk should add on around 7 to our risk weighted assets very much in line with our original estimates more recently this week the regulator published for discussion the credit risk weightings according to the regulator using information for december 2018 the regulations proposed should reduce credit risk assets by 23 compared to current regulations which will lead to a total savings for the industry of 4 5 billion however this will be compensated by the incorporation of operational and market risks we continue to believe that the transition to basel iii or iv will be neutral to positive for this bank in 2019 we distributed an annual dividend of 60 of the previous year s profits which led to a dividend yield of 3 7 for 2020 we expect a similar level of payout which places our current dividend yield at above 4 the final dividend proposal will be decided by the board in march to finalize we will now move on to our outlook for 2020 on slide 30 the social unrest in chile continues to create uncertainty in the local economy we expect investment to contract in 2020 it should be compensated by the export sector and higher fiscal spending from the reforms initiatives proposed to address the social issues however our ambitious investment plan which is focused on digitalization and technological improvements and new businesses such as acquiring will continue to progress in 2020 we expect loan growth in 2020 to reach 5 with higher growth coming from retail loans margin should benefit from higher inflation particularly in the first semester and the impact of santander consumer however this will be compensated may be compensated by regulatory changes such as the automatic payment of credit lines therefore nim should remain stable at around 4 1 our improving client service in digital channels has enhanced our ability to capture new clients and cross sell existing ones and this should continue driving non interest income slightly above loan growth considering the expectation that unemployment will increase this year and the onetime provisions already taken in 2019 we now expect cost of credit to remain stable at 1 3 to 1 4 of loans average loans the efficiency ratio should also remain around 40 even including our ambitious investment plan and the effective tax rate will remain on average around 21 to 22 with this outlook we believe a return on average equity of around 17 is attainable at this time we will gladly answer any questions you may have questions and answers operator and our first question comes from the line of ernesto gabilondo with bank of america ernesto gabilondo bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi good morning emiliano robert and claudio and thanks for the opportunity to my questions my first question is in the economic outlook as you mentioned the economic growth is expected to decelerate in 2020 so considering the potential increase in chile s debt from 27 to 40 in the next years the implementation of our progressive tax reform the implementation of the pension reform and the challenges of reaching a constitutional agreement do you see the possibility of a negative outlook for chile from credit rating agencies later this year i will this will be my last my first question and then i will ask a couple of questions robert moreno manager of investor relations okay first of all up to now rating agencies have been positive regarding chile s outlook they have been supportive of the strategy the government is pursuing the information regarding the evolution of the deficit has been made public already since a couple of weeks so the agencies already incorporated that information into their evaluation and up to now in general their evaluation is relatively positive now there are risks there is a risk on the activity on the one hand in general we see more downside risk than upside risk for activity and also of course the impact of the pension reform may not be completely incorporated in the forecast for the evolution of the public deficit into the future therefore we see some risk of a revision of the outlook for the economy in the future ernesto gabilondo bank of america merrill lynch analyst great thank you so much and then a couple of questions the first one is in terms of your expectations for loan growth so we know this loan growth of 8 in 2019 i think it was partially explained by the acquisition of the consumer portfolio but how do you see the organic and total loan growth in 2020 under this scenario you mentioned 5 but just want to know if this is considering an organic growth or it s excluding the consumer portfolio and especially i will appreciate your expectations in the sme segment we have seen several merchants that have not been able to reopen their businesses and we think that social unrest is expected to come back in march after being in holidays and then my last question is if it would be reasonable to expect low to mid single digit earnings growth in 2020 and with that we will reach your 17 roe for this year thank you robert moreno manager of investor relations okay so the 5 is the year end versus year end so it includes it s organic obviously in the first half of the year we re comparing it will be higher because we ll be including santander consumer compared to last year when we were not or when we reach the end of the year it should be around 5 so take that as organic and smes smes is a large segment for the bank it s around 15 of the loan book and there we have companies that sell up to around 3 million but there s more than 200 000 companies and the focus will be obviously in the larger smes the smes that also are more involved in the export business chile many sectors so there are sectors that are going to perform well this year as claudio said the export sectors should be have a strong year the prices of chile s exports have been relatively robust copper has been a little volatile but the other ones have been very very strong and we re obviously probably going to avoid some of them maybe the smaller smes until we have better economic figures and obviously in smes there s a lot of stores and commerce which suffered in october november we did see improvements in december and in january things have been really calm as you said we don t march is a big question mark everyone is kind of on vacation now but given that the government has taken a lot of steps to reform to do reforms they announced the constitutional reforms i m not saying that social unrest will disappear but we don t believe it will at the levels we saw in october november because a lot has been done and the democratic institutions are slowly churning out the reforms that everyone has been asking for so i would say smes are kind of the weak link in the loan book but we think things should slowly get better and not worse okay ernesto gabilondo bank of america merrill lynch analyst perfect thank you and then for my last question emiliano muratore chief financial officer about the net income growth robert moreno manager of investor relations net income growth yeah so exactly so basically we ve always said it comes true we should have a mid to high single digit eps growth right so basically i think the important thing here is that despite the lower loan growth our revenue growth last year revenues grew like 5 6 we re not expecting revenue growth to slow down because margins should be relatively stable non interest income should be high or good or strong or similar to loan growth and the big question mark and we did give some guidance is the cost of credit okay ernesto gabilondo bank of america merrill lynch analyst perfect very helpful thank you very much operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of jason mollin with scotiabank jason mollin scotiabank analyst hello everyone my first question is a follow up on loan growth do you consider this outlook conservative and you talk about the upside and downside risk to this 5 for total loans and my second question is about the new client data that you showed with santander chile achieving a 26 share of the net increase in clients can you talk about these clients do they come from other banks are these clients new to the system what kind of clients are they thank you very much emiliano muratore chief financial officer hello jason regarding the let s say the bias or the loan growth guidance i think that it s a bit biased to the downside as claudio was mentioning that our 5 is consistent with the 1 gdp growth that as of today we see maybe more downside risk than upside risk to that gdp and that would imply also the loan growth expectation to be a little bit more biased to the downside if we consider like risk scenarios although today our base case and maybe best estimate is that 1 for gdp 5 for loan growth but in terms of risk scenarios i would say that the downside is a bit higher than the upside robert moreno manager of investor relations and regarding the so we had as we said in the presentation growth of 26 and a net increase in checking accounts through october so this is mainly the middle high income portion of the clients and this is a mix of everything getting since these are checking accounts this is mainly people who are already in the system so i would say it s clients coming from other banks i think this has a lot to do with the fact that our client service has been steadily improving our digital services have always been very good the fact that the work cafe has really helped their image and so forth so checking accounts is really a reflection of all the efforts we ve done on many fronts and mainly is there a little bit of cross selling we ve been very successful in opening checking accounts not only in chilean pesos but in dollars and we re also obviously capturing market from other clients the new entrants are basically coming through santander life and superdigital especially santander life santander life they re opening debit card accounts so it s not included in the checking account and that has also been very strong santander life has been very well perceived by clients remember that there was social unrest but santander life s merit program is very much in line with what people are looking for they will be recognized for their efforts and the digital onboarding in santander life kept things going even when branches were closed okay jason mollin scotiabank analyst thank you very much operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of thiago batista with ubs thiago batista ubs analyst hi guys i have two questions the first one is a follow up on the macro overview or the macro outlook about the unemployment ratio how much you guys are expecting for unemployment ratio in chile in 2020 and also if this explains the potential increase in cost of risk when it s increased the 1 3 to 1 4 guidance for cost of risk if this should be caused by this increase in the unemployment ratio in chile my second question is about the medium term roe so i know that there s a lot of moving parts nowadays in chile but do you believe it s possible to work with the roe of 19 and 20 as used to be a couple of years ago or the 17 tend to be the new level robert moreno manager of investor relations on unemployment we expect unemployment to go up up to 8 to 8 5 this year we are starting at around 7 in november that 7 already accounts for part of the event of the social unrest and up to now the labor market a significant deterioration however because of the slow growth we re expecting for this year unemployment should go up now having said that our risks are more to the downside than there is a risk to the upside in terms of unemployment but in no case we are seeing unemployment reaching two digit levels emiliano muratore chief financial officer yes and relating that to cost of risk the increase in cost of risk during the last quarter had to do in part with let s say the employment situation worsening a bit not so far yet but not too much yet but yes the expectations are unemployment going up and regarding long term roe we honestly i think that it is still like too early to assess or let s say recalibrate long term roe expectations at this moment because although the situation in chile has been relatively let s say abrupt and big during these last few months i think it s too early to change or to let s say guide the long term roe after this situation and we will need to have to see the time passing and maybe during this year we got to have a clearer picture of let s say the new long term expectation for the economy and for the bank thiago batista ubs analyst okay thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of tito labarta with goldman sachs tito labarta goldman sachs analyst hi good morning thanks emiliano and robert for the call my question in terms of asset quality i guess and the cost of risk you saw a little bit of deterioration in the quarter do you think this will continue throughout the year i know you mentioned higher unemployment so it probably will but just wanted to get a sense how much do you think it could deteriorate from here and also with the cost of risk right it s a bit more elevated than in the past given the uncertainty which makes sense but do you think that you can if things go well you eventually get back to that 1 1 cost of risk that we saw in the past or do you think just given the uncertainty beyond this year it could likely remain more elevated at that 1 3 1 4 level or even higher just to get a sense on maybe some sensitivity on asset quality and cost of risk that you expect thank you emiliano muratore chief financial officer yeah i think it s important what you mentioned that before up to september before all this situation in chile we were with that underlying cost of risk of around 1 that is consistent with all the changes we have made in the composition of the loan book so when you look at the cost of risk of the last quarter and also the total for the year around 1 35 we think that assuming the underlying risk of the portfolio that it was consistent with that 1 the new environment in terms of employment and consumption and economic activity we think that it s going to be unlikely to go as low as we were before all this so that 1 1 1 looks too challenging but also we think that the situation from where we are in the last quarter especially after seeing the behavior of the portfolio in october november and december that it has been sequentially better month after month october was the one with the biggest noise and disruption but then november and december we saw a kind of good behavior of the delinquency in the portfolio so i would say that as low as we were before october it s unlikely that but we don t see the full year cost of risk going higher than we had last year tito labarta goldman sachs analyst okay thanks emiliano it s helpful operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of neha agarwala with hsbc neha agarwala hsbc analyst hi thank you for taking my question first on the regulatory side do you foresee any other regulatory changes that are not incorporated in your guidance maybe higher tax rate and the second question is on the asset quality i understand that you re being more cautious on the retail and construction sector any other sector or segment that you are trying to hold on and not grow as much this year thank you so much emiliano muratore chief financial officer helo neha regarding the regulation we don t see and actually there is not any other piece of regulation on the table under discussion apart from the ones we mentioned so we are not factoring in any other piece in our outlook for the year and in terms of asset quality and sectors actually i think that it s going to depend the growth on the demand of credit that it will also be different among other sectors we are still seeing i would say kind of normal decent demand coming from middle market corporates all the external sector exporters and all that so and we haven t seen any significant slowdown in loan growth in those segments then when you go to smes the demand is also nice now a bit lower because of the general situation but no there is no any specific sector that we think that we need to slow down or stop we do want to be let s say prudent in exploring like new clients and we want to work more with our client base clients that we know that we have been working with them in the past so maybe in terms of calibrating the growth strategy maybe the biggest tweak would be like not being extremely aggressive in capturing new clients especially in lending i mean going into lending to new client that is maybe the biggest change if you compare the current stance to what we had before neha agarwala hsbc analyst okay and if i can ask another question could you update us on the ifrs implementation emiliano muratore chief financial officer probably it s by january next year when all the disclosing regulation is implemented in chile i would say that by january 2021 we will be fully ifrs except for credit losses provisioning that is the part where we are not ifrs and we are not going to be in the near future and so in the long term our expectation is to convert fully to ifrs because remember that now all the issuers not just banks are under the same regulator the cmf and all the other issuers are under full ifrs so i think that in the long term i expect to see conversions to full ifrs but in the near future we expect to be as we are in full ifrs except for provisions that will stay with this more standardized expected loss model created by the regulator robert moreno manager of investor relations just as a clarification we are ifrs except for the credit provisions and the change that s coming now is the format how we publish all our financials that will change to more or less what you see in other parts of the world and that should be finished by the end of this year beginning of next year okay neha agarwala hsbc analyst okay great thank you so much operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of sebastian gallego with credicorp sebastian gallego credicorp analyst hi good morning thanks for the presentation i have several questions the first one on asset quality as well more follow up on asset quality i just want to get a sense if you can break down per segment on commercial consumer and mortgage where do you see the most deterioration in terms of asset quality delinquencies or npls second question is related to margins i just want to get a sense of under which scenario are you considering or what s your base case scenario for inflation or uf inflation on a quarterly basis just to reach stableness in your guidance and final question is regarding basel iii standards when you read the article that was published by the regulator they mentioned that even though the risk weighted assets or the credit risk weighted assets will decline this will be compensated by the other risk weighted assets market and operational the question is do you expect that to actually compensate or do you actually believe that the net effect will be a decline in risk weighted assets thank you robert moreno manager of investor relations okay so regarding your first question which is the asset quality break down basically obviously there s potential for consumer lending to deteriorate but we really have a really high coverage so remember we took clp16 billion in additional provisions we have very little loan growth in the low end of the market so i think that is a good you could say insurance policy so maybe npls could rise but i don t expect a huge deterioration of the cost of risk in consumer lending okay and mortgage is similar as well and remember all of this is using the current 1 percent gdp forecast and unemployment forecast we discussed and mortgage as well in mortgage we have decent loan to value ratios and we ve also focused growth more on the higher end so obviously there could be some deterioration but we feel like we ve it could be contained and the big question mark really comes from the sme sector where i think you saw it in the fourth quarter and you and we re probably there where we could see potential further deterioration and the need to increase the cost of risk so i would say that s the basic breakdown and that s why we are forecasting a cost of risk of 1 3 to 1 4 okay emiliano muratore chief financial officer regarding the inflation expectations for the full year today we are expecting a 2 7 uf5 variation on the quarterly profile i would say it s relatively stable i mean 0 7 0 8 for the different quarters starting in this quarter so that s why with that inflation assumption we are foreseeing still stable nims and regarding the impact of basel iii on the numbers one of the i would say one of the things we found is that the regulator is incorporating some kind of complexity in the standard method when to calculate the weighting so it s we don t have our fine print our numbers today but if you the regulator mentioned that there will be a 23 reduction in risk weighted assets coming from risk so if we do that if we take that 23 for us and we assume that credit risk will fall 23 and we take into account the operational regulation that is already under consultation so we know how it will be and if you then you have market risk of the x there in that equation and but if you take the scenario of keeping the same model that today we have under basel i which is a very let s say harsh and prudent model if you take those numbers we see our cet1 around 11 that is roughly like 100 basis point higher than what we have today but there are i would say in that calculation the two big questions are that 23 of reduction coming from credit risk how close we are to that average above or below we will know that in the weeks when we are able to do the all the simulations and calculations and then market risk how close it is the basel iii model the basel iv model compared to the basel i we have today but that s the kind of number we are seeing so far sebastian gallego credicorp analyst perfect very clear thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of jorg friedemann with citibank jorg friedemann citibank analyst thank you very much for taking my question i have also a couple of follow ups if possible just for me to understand you explained several times already regarding your cost of risk guidance and asset quality expectations but in this quarter you actually took a proactive stance and buildup coverage in advance before a more severe deterioration came in so is this the same rationale that you are going to follow going forward to come up with this 1 3 to 1 4 or are you going to be more reactive to npl deterioration from now on so the question is if we re going to continue building up coverage in the expectation of things to deteriorate or you are going to be only more reactive going forward so this is the first question and the second question if you could give us an update on the payout taking into consideration these regulations of basel iii that are coming in thank you robert moreno manager of investor relations okay so regarding your first question i think maybe one way to explain it is during 2019 we had a cost of risk of 1 3 but we had like one timer s right so we had clp16 billion in the fourth quarter and the clp31 billion in the third if you take that out our cost of risk was 1 1 so you can say with all the events last year we would have been at like 1 1 1 and with an increase at 1 3 is what i m saying so the actual impact of all of this is a 20 on a comparable basis is like a 20 basis increase so i would say there was in the fourth quarter some kind of proactive this year it s going to be more i would say a little more like reactive because of the proactiveness we already did ok so on a comparable basis we re going from like 1 cost of risk to 1 3 1 4 and that s how we view it and we feel comfortable with that considering that we ve already done last year okay and the second on the payout so as we said in the just a little while ago given the information we have now regarding our current capital ratios and what we ve seen and what we can infer from the new regulations we expect to pay out of 2019 earnings which would be paid in april to be around 60 similar payout which gives you a current dividend yield of around like 4 or so now the board still hasn t decided on its final resolution and what it will propose to the shareholders meeting and that will be informed at the end of march okay emiliano muratore chief financial officer and so maybe let s say well definitely we said loan growth expectations are not so high and are a bit biased to the downside so that the pressure on the capital shouldn t come from let s say faster loan growth there are a few pieces of the regulation for basel iii to be put under presentations market risk being one of them and some others so those are the maybe the risk on the payout having without having any relevant negative surprise coming from the basel iii regulation you should expect the payout to be stable compared to last year jorg friedemann citibank analyst that s very clear i appreciate it thank you very much operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of piedad alessandri with credicorp piedad alessandri credicorp analyst hi thank you for allowing some questions i know there are no new regulations under discussions but are you considering the possibility of an increase on bank taxes considering the increase in debt for the government or do you see the possibility of a specific tax for the banks emiliano muratore chief financial officer no actually we are not at this moment considering any of those taxes in the future there is nothing being discussed and so under the current tax reform nothing like that is under discussion so going to your question no we are not considering that piedad alessandri credicorp analyst thank you very much operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of yuri fernandes with j p morgan yuri fernandes j p morgan analyst hi emiliano hi robert i have a question regarding margins are you being conservative here looking to your inflation outlook you had like flattish inflation too like the cpi at 2 7 and santander chile you have like a benefit that maybe your peers and should not have you just consolidated a consumer finance company that helped margins and you also had a very good performance on demand deposits so if you are really right on the flattish margins for 2020 i think the outlook here is negative for the system right because it s maybe down for your peers and for the system so that s the first one regarding margins are you conservative here or not and i have a follow up on asset quality you had many many questions here but just checking about the renegotiated portfolio if you can provide some color on how big was the increase this quarter when are you renegotiating those loans you can provide any metric any color so we can track these and keep an eye on how the renegotiated book is behaving thank you emiliano muratore chief financial officer okay so first on nim i would say that it s not so conservative because you re right in the sense that we have many tailwinds for nims like the central bank cut rates recently the slope of the curve recovered and now we have let s say a decent slope between the shorter end and the longer end then inflation is going to be stable or maybe with some upside risk if the fx keeps high or and depreciating so i would say that in general the new origination all these factors are positive factors for nims maybe the thing that you are not factoring in is that all the big flow of mortgages refinancing that we had last year it was mainly during the second half of last year so we are still seeing that let s say snowball effect in the full year margin for this year so and maybe that s why without factoring in that more refinancing mortgage effect you can see it as conservative but this effect is going to hit harder during the full year in 2020 than it was in 2019 which was only part of the year robert moreno manager of investor relations asset quality yeah so the best way to go monitoring that is the impaired loan ratio that s why we include that because in very simple terms the impaired loan ratio on slide 23 if you can look at there that includes the npls plus mainly the renegotiated loans so if you look at the commercial loans the impaired loan ratio went from 6 7 to 7 that s the biggest impact we had there in asset quality and that s the renegotiation of these sme loans in tourism restaurants hotels small shops so the best way to go monitoring how that behaves is impaired loan ratio and obviously our provisioning models which aren t ifrs 9 but they are forward looking they have to take so when you renegotiate you just don t sweep problems under the table you have to take provisions anyway so that s why provisions were high apart from the because if you take out the clp16 billion you still get a relatively large amount of provisions because we were increasing provisions for these impaired loans so as the year progresses not only do you look at npls but keep a track of how the impaired loan ratio evolves because that s a good indicator of the overall in fact the impaired loan ratio is very similar to the stage 3 of ifrs 9 okay yuri fernandes j p morgan analyst no super clear robert thanks for the answers if i just may ask one thing on the cost of risk it s fair to assume that it should be much higher in the first half of the year especially in the first q and then gradually decrease right and the average should be the 1 3 1 4 you mentioned in the guidance right robert moreno manager of investor relations yeah i think that should be correct yes yuri fernandes j p morgan analyst thank you operator thank you and i m showing no further questions at this time so with that i ll turn the call back over to cfo emiliano muratore for closing remarks emiliano muratore chief financial officer thank you all very much for taking the

mexican president andres manuel lopez obrador has overseen the weakest growth of any president since the tequila crisis photo by riau images barcroft media via getty images barcroft media via getty images mexico s president andres manuel lopez obrador aka amlo is facing the slowest economic growth of the first two years of his presidency than any president since the 1990s tequila crisis sure everyone is growing less this days even china is no longer growing its economy at double digits but consider this despite the proximity to the u s the hottest advanced economy for the past three years mexico s gdp likely contracted last year by 0 1 if all goes well thanks in large part to president trump signing the new nafta deal into law on wednesday then maybe mexico s gdp grows at 0 6 in 2020 in 2018 the year amlo started in office gdp was 2 1 it has been over 2 for the past five years amlo s tequila crisis mix is made like this add an ounce of uncertainty over the u s mexico canada agreement to two and a half ounces of amlo s unfriendly market rhetoric put in a half shot of drug cartel drama and a splash of mexico s new taste for central american immigrants and you got one of the nastiest most unsavory drinks in any bar south of the rio grande or the most boring economy in the usmca bar none amlo s popularity is still high but in decline it was an all time high of 81 in february 2018 and is now at 71 due in large part to the trade war and drug related violent crime the trade war is now over with mexico so amlo should have some wind in his sails a protest march on

have now shifted to internal elements economic uncertainty can no longer be blamed on trump in particular amlo s governance has shot to the top of mexico s biggest headwind to growth especially

up in exact line with the dollar brazil real and the msci brazil is weak just like the dollar peso bloomberg mexican business owners in other words are not investing and may still not invest even with the signing of the usmca because they re not confident in amlo amlo may be an easy target for mexico s wealthy but the president has not gone on a spending spree keeping with mexico s relatively conservative policies in managing government coffers wall street loves mexico especially bond and currency investors mexico has become the new brazil in terms of the carry trade where countries with low yield invest in countries with high yield brazil used to be on the receiving end of that now that flow is heading to mexico this year their currency is gaining against the dollar the brazilian real is weakening their stock market is up this year by nearly 5 brazil s is down by roughly the same amount it s an interesting contradiction we have with the brazilian real selling off in a stronger economy and the mexican peso doing well in a much weaker one says eric baurmeister co head of global emerging market debt for morgan stanley investment managment brazil s overnight lending rate is 4 25 mexico overnight is 7 25 brazil inflation is about 4 making real rates at lows no investor in brazil has ever seen before mexico is still a bond and currency speculator s best and safest bet in latin america baurmeister said that amlo has been a detriment to corporate investor sentiment on the ground but portfolio investors are happy holding mexican bonds bond investors see that amlo is not blowing up the budget as some feared he might we prefer mexican local debt he says i think banxico will cut rates this year but the peso will be stable it s a true carry trade mexico and brazil are our two favorites in latin america bnp expects moody s to downgrade mexico s sovereign credit rating and that of oil firm pemex at some point before the end of the third quarter both bonds will still be investment grade by then mexico s overall 2019 and first quarter 2020 gdp reports plus pemex earnings would have been released people will get a sense of where mexico is heading pemex is not a publicly traded stock but is watched closely because of its bonds once those numbers come in moody s could make a move there is room for positive surprise but a lot of it depends on amlo s ability to curb the violence and entice mexico s private sector to put real money to work and get it growing again

will progressives and moderates feud while the country burns or will these natural allies take advantage of a historic opportunity to strengthen american democracy defeat both trumpism and an increasingly radical form of conservatism and create a broad alliance for practical visionary government judging from the tone of the democratic primary on the eve of the iowa caucuses feuding seems to be winning some of this contention is inevitable each of these candidates wants to win the danger lies in fostering the idea that the divides between progressives and moderates are more important than their intense and shared opposition with president trump and a right wing version of republicanism that seeks to undo our nation s advances since the new deal the triumph of this view would be let s not mince words a social catastrophe the democratic campaign was destined to entail an argument about the party s direction for the next decade is this election about restoration after the madness of trump s time in office or should the accent be on transformation to grapple with the underlying problems that led to trump s election in the first place e j dionne jr writes about politics in a twice weekly column for the washington post this essay is adapted from his book code red how progressives and moderates can unite to save our country illustrations by ellen weinstein for the washington post thanks to his personality background and experience former vice president joe biden is the premier restorationist sens bernie sanders i vt and elizabeth warren d mass both represent what warren in her oft repeated promise has called big structural change former south bend ind mayor pete buttigieg and sen amy klobuchar d minn stand somewhere in between they are closer to biden philosophically but as new voices in the national conversation have a chance to argue that they represent a break with the past and looking past the early contests former new york mayor mike bloomberg clearly falls into the restorationist camp like so many of the binaries in politics the restoration transformation optic captures something important but is also a false choice the country can t simply pick up where it left off before trump took office the radicalized conservatism that dominates the republican party will not go away even if he is defeated the inequalities of class and race that helped fueled trump s rise have deepened during his presidency you might say restoring the norms that trump threatens requires transformation and the majority that opposes trump is clearly seeking a combination of restoration and transformation they want to bring back things they believe have been lost as a prelude to moving forward what they want most to restore is progress progressives and moderates need to realize that at this moment in history they share a commitment to what public life can achieve and the hope that government can be decent again they reject overt appeals to racism that have been trump s calling card and an approach to politics based on dividing the nation together they long for a politics focused on freedom fairness and the future what should bring moderates and progressives together is an idea put forward long ago by the late social thinker michael harrington visionary gradualism the phrase captures an insight from each side of their debate progressives are right that reforms unhinged from larger purposes are typically ephemeral but a vision disconnected from first steps and early successes can shrivel up and die vision and incremental change are not opposites in our nation s history the two have reinforced each other for example in protecting the environment achieving social security for the elderly and assistance to the unemployed protecting civil rights and expanding health insurance coverage this lesson will apply for any new democratic president no matter which wing of the party she or he represents lurking beneath the arguments about tomorrow are disagreements about yesterday specifically how to judge whether earlier democratic presidents were shrewd pragmatists or unprincipled sellouts it has been a long time since democrats were willing to revel unreservedly in the success of one of their own only franklin d roosevelt stands as a democratic icon in the manner that ronald reagan still serves as a republican idol and even fdr has come under sharp scrutiny in recent decades for largely turning a blind eye to racial injustice in the south for fear of disturbing his party s alliance with segregationists harry s truman is seen far more fondly by most democrats than he was in his own day although some on the party s left still reengage old battles over his cold war policies since truman lyndon b johnson jimmy carter and more recently bill clinton and barack obama have all been cast as failing the progressive cause in important ways in the face of such skepticism i would insist that it s important to recognize both the clinton and obama presidencies as successful doing so does not mean ignoring frustrations over the degree to which both men continued to operate within the reagan consensus failed to create durable electoral legacies beyond their own times in office and left behind deep economic inequalities that democrats ought to be in the business of reversing but it does require a balanced view of their times in office that would allow progressives moderates and reformers of all stripes to move forward ellen weinstein for the washington post affection for obama still runs deep in his party reflected in i miss obama bumper stickers they speak to how much more thoughtful ethical responsible eloquent and competent he was in office than donald trump after a round of debates in july 2019 democratic presidential candidates biden was the exception came under criticism from many quarters for spending more time criticizing obama s legacy than standing up for it they engaged in a strategic correction in a september debate competing over who could praise obama more lavishly as for clinton there were reasons he received such a rapturous reception at the 2012 democratic national convention in charlotte he was after all the man who ended 12 years of republican control of the white house and the 1990s really were years of exceptional economic growth and relative peace the positive assessments reflect the fact that both clinton and obama solved the immediate problems they inherited remnants of an economic downturn accompanied by rising deficits in clinton s case a wholesale economic catastrophe in obama s both left behind thriving economies both pushed against rising inequality in contrast to republican administrations since reagan that aggravated the inequities in our economy with large tax cuts tilted heavily toward the wealthy president george h w bush was an exception to this pattern moreover some of the failures of the clinton and obama years reflected the constraints both faced during six of their respective eight years in office when republicans controlled congress the gop resisted reforms that might have gone beyond what they were able to enact in their first two years at the same time neither tried to overturn the broad assumptions that had governed u s economic policy since the 1980s in clinton s case he pushed these assumptions further along with a broad deregulatory program for banks and the financial industry genuinely damaging limits on the entitlement for welfare and an enthusiastic embrace of free trade obama inherited an economic disaster created by the irresponsibility of wall street and the world of finance in cooperation with other national leaders he righted a global economy in free fall an achievement for which he still gets too little credit but he repaired the system without challenging the institutions and structures that led to the disaster in the first place at the end of the obama presidency the overall economy was humming again but the damage of the 2008 crash was still being felt in many parts of the country and many of those places produced substantial electoral swings from obama to trump in 2016 was the country better off because of what both clinton and obama did yes did they leave behind serious social and economic imbalances they should have done more to right also yes that is why their presidencies present such conundrums to progressives let s start with the obvious clinton s relationship with a white house intern that led to his impeachment came under renewed and even harsher scrutiny after the rise of the metoo movement this has affected overall assessments of his presidency more so as the years have gone by his legacy would be received differently if his time in office had been followed by a successful al gore presidency as it was george w bush s policies further aggravated inequalities and the economic crash on his watch was a disaster for the already vulnerable clinton and his advisers also had reason to argue that the social bargain they struck with the financial world eliminating the deficit and letting both wall street and the tech economy rip was a reasonable deal for everybody else economic growth in the late 1990s was exceptional disadvantaged groups enjoyed strong income gains and government through programs such as an expanded earned income tax credit sought to redistribute some of the largesse the economy was producing the country s strong fiscal position left room for further redistribution efforts it s also important to remember that clinton won reelection in 1996 in part because of his success in resisting republican cuts to medicare medicaid education and the environment his battle cry that helped stop newt gingrich s revolution in its tracks on the other hand beyond the role that financial deregulation played in opening the way for the calamities of 2008 clinton s trade policies not only the north american free trade agreement but perhaps more importantly china s accession to the world trade organization pushed by clinton and formally realized under george w bush sped along deindustrialization that had begun in the 1970s and 1980s the brunt of these policies hit hardest in the historically industrial states that moved to trump in 2016 trade was by no means the only driver here automation and technological change were as important but promises of relief for those hurt by foreign trade never materialized in a substantial way and confidence that an economically expansive china would move toward democracy proved entirely misplaced with these problems came the death of an idea summarized well by new york magazine writer ed kilgore who acknowledged that he had long been a loyal foot soldier in the new democratic movement the clinton era belief was that the best way to achieve progressive policy goals was by harnessing and redirecting the wealth that a less regulated and more innovative private sector alone could generate what kilgore called the create then redistribute model for democratic economic policy effectively passed away after the financial crisis in 2008 it shouldn t be hard to understand that obama was so fearful of a comprehensive economic collapse during his first months in office that he resisted putting pressure on the financial sector still he could have done more to hold it accountable once the emergency passed the dodd frank financial reform was certainly a major step forward important enough that the trump administration set to work dismantling large parts of it but it was less far reaching than it could have been the irony is that the most enduring and politically helpful obama policies were those that most risked accusations of radicalism the most socialist and at the time controversial of obama s policies the bailout of the auto industry involving massive government subsidy and large scale federal intervention was one of his most successful ventures substantively and politically the auto industry came back and none of the fears of the program s critics were realized and there is little doubt that obama s support for rescuing the industry and mitt romney s opposition to it were key to obama s 2012 victories in both michigan and ohio similarly obama s resistance during his first months in office to austerity policies they were very popular among conservatives in europe as well as the united states was undoubtedly the right call and his stimulus was decidedly progressive in moving money to americans with the lowest incomes and investing in clean energy his signature achievement the affordable care act reflected what might be seen as the classic obama synthesis it took ideas from conservatives the health care exchanges insurance subsidies the mandate to buy insurance to produce far reaching social change but there is again the paradox of centrism the plan might have been even more popular and obama s party might have been saved from its current divisive health care debate if the proposal had included a public option alongside private insurance that feature was killed in part because of opposition from moderate senate democrats to say nothing of republicans obama s fundamental caution also kicked in as washington s elite consensus egged on by the rising tea party conservatives pushed him to a rhetorical embrace of budget balancing far more quickly than the circumstances justified this made a second much needed stimulus package even more politically difficult than it already was as the economics writer noam scheiber noted in his book the escape artists obama spent much of his first term more taken with the case against deficits than with the case for jobs it was in the oldest sense of the term a conservative preoccupation obama s crack at balance brought him criticism from both right and left many among the wealthy condemned him as a socialist who did not appreciate the heroism of entrepreneurs whom he had in fact helped rescue progressives saw his administration as more interested in nursing wall street back to health than in curtailing its excesses the financial sector emerged as powerful as ever and in the trump years began the process of dismantling the reforms obama had signed into law and the regulations he had put in place obama was caught in the middle of all this middle being the appropriate word in many respects in sum both clinton and obama achieved a great deal but neither upended the reagan legacy pete buttigieg underscored the costs of this by noting that throughout his own lifetime reagan supply side conservatism created the terms for how democrats as well as republicans made policy this bottled up enormous pressure on the left it was bound eventually to explode in 2016 it did in the form of bernie sanders s campaign and the reappearance of democratic socialism as an energetic force in american politics even outside the ranks of sanders supporters the steady rise of inequality and the hollowing out of both inner city and old factory town economies were changing minds and revising assessments of the clinton and obama years jake sullivan hillary clinton s 2016 policy adviser and a defender of her husband s record argues that wherever one stands on the legacy of the clintonian new democrats the economy looks different today than it did in the 1990s he cites the developing views of bill clinton s treasury secretary lawrence h summers to argue that even apolitical economists looking at the widening inequality financial crisis zero interest rates rising gaps in life expectancy and opportunity over the past two decades would move to the left because their analysis would inevitably lead them there you might say that reality itself has moved left since 2008 not to mention 1993 this was brought home to me when i traveled to charleston s c for a june 2019 meeting organized by third way a group as its name suggests that is devoted to moderate democratic policies to put matters gently sanders and the third wayers don t like each other very much yet the group s president jonathan cowan the co author of a recent post op ed highly critical of sanders was emphatic last summer in insisting that his group was not offering a warmed over 1990s centrism cowan s critique of what were after all the years of clinton s presidency was not hedged back then he said we placed too much trust in the market s ability to provide a reliable and realistic path to prosperity for most americans in the last 30 years we have seen the impact of globalization and automation on our workers and it is clear that a rising tide will not lift all boats later matt bennett third way s executive vice president said flatly we have to own some of the mistakes of the new democrats among them he said was underestimating the effect of trade liberalization on a significant number of blue collar workers and the speed and ferocity with which technology would decimate certain sectors of the american workforce a particularly negative effect of this was the concentration of opportunity in certain regions as large parts of the country were left behind we need to be working to tame capitalism at this moment because it is not functioning well bennett told me we need to do in this century what the progressives and new dealers did in the last century none of this will make the current principled arguments between sanders supporters and third wayers disappear but the fact that even centrists have moved as far as they have points to the quest for a new synthesis based on a redefinition of how moderation should be understood the political center can no longer be a halfway point between democrats and republicans because the gop has veered so far to the right the new york times david leonhardt described the new terrain well most voters don t share the centrist preferences of washington s comfortable pundit class most voters want to raise taxes on the rich and corporations they favor generous medicare and social security expanded medicaid more financial aid for college a higher minimum wage and a bigger government role in job creation remember trump won the republican nomination as a populist a clear majority of americans wants the government to respond aggressively to our economic problems which means the next decade provides a dramatic opportunity at such a moment moderates should welcome not fear the left s boldness a vibrant left has always been a central component of any successful era of social reform by offering plans and proposals on what harrington called the left wing of the possible socialists social democrats and left liberals have redefined the political playing field consider that when warren proposed a wealth tax on fortunes of 50 million or more moderate voices responded by saying her idea was too radical or unworkable and then urged an increase in the capital gains tax or other approaches to taxing large fortunes instead she had redefined the intellectual playing field moderation now entailed ideas that were once seen as leftist as robert borosage noted in the nation warren s proposal underscored a fundamental unfairness in the american system that while the primary source of wealth for most middle class families their homes is taxed each year in the property tax the primary source of wealth of the very rich their investments is only taxed when sold or transferred if then this was a conversation few were having before warren put forward her initiative and she would use the proceeds from the tax she estimates it would raise 2 7 trillion over a decade to finance ambitious social initiatives this was a policy twofer warren simultaneously underscored just how much money is sitting at the top of the economy and then showed how much could be done to lift those at its lower rungs without resorting to broad based tax increases there were legitimate questions raised about how her wealth tax would work and whether it could be effective in a world in which capital can be moved around so easily she certainly generated a backlash among billionaires and former new york mayor mike bloomberg s bid for the democratic presidential nomination was a response both to warren s rise in the polls and biden s perceived weaknesses but warren had by then already altered the discussions of how government should raise money in the future similarly the popularization by sanders of medicare for all as a central demand on the left underscored the degree to which the affordable care act was a moderate initiative not some form of socialism as republicans had long charged warren s struggles over the details of a single payer plan showed how problematic this approach is as an immediate next step but it is testimony to the room the idea opened in the policy debate that post opinion writer paul waldman was able to say this of biden s health plan which includes a public option in 2009 when the aca was being a debated a plan like this one would have been considered almost radically leftist not anymore it took conservative policy innovation and even policy radicalism in the 1970s and early 1980s to push the political debate to the right the innovations on the left that are now part of the mainstream conversation are similarly transformative they are part of an effort to restore the idea that only public action represented in the past by bold programs such as the homestead and land grant college acts social security and the gi bill can solve persistent problems that have torn at our social fabric for a generation moderates who think of themselves as problem solvers should welcome the left s initiatives as part of a process of legitimizing the very act of public problem solving only when this happens can a real contest begin over how fast and how far we can move at any given moment history moves along crooked paths one telltale sign that a political debate is turning in a new direction is the adoption of the rising side s ideas by its adversaries democrats and liberals in the 1980s ratified the new reagan disposition by beginning to speak its language and offering policies consistent with its objectives that both clinton and to a lesser degree obama operated within this consensus is precisely why their legacies are complicated for the most part republicans have resisted altering their course only a decisive defeat will open the space needed for a larger gop reformation but quietly leading conservatives and libertarians are acknowledging contemporary capitalism s problems and adopting critiques that originated on the left thus did sen marco rubio r fla issue a remarkable report last year arguing that business was underinvesting in their own workers because of a shift in corporate behavior toward valuing the interests of shareholders over all other stakeholders this theory rubio argued tilts business decision making towards returning money quickly and predictably to investors rather than building long term corporate capabilities reduces investment in research and innovation and undervalues american workers contribution to production reproaching the idea of shareholder primacy is central to both progressive and center left critiques of contemporary capitalism and in the summer of 2019 business leaders themselves weighed in in a statement on the purpose of the corporation widely interpreted as a direct response to growing discontent with capitalism the business roundtable explicitly broke with this limited view of the modern corporation s obligations emphasizing that they extended to other stakeholders proper corporate goals the chief executives declared included investing in our employees supporting the communities in which we work and promoting a healthy environment in the meantime the most provocative new washington think tank on the center right is the niskanen center a haven for onetime libertarians who have had enough of hard right ideology and are championing a new moderation in politics the work of two of its leading figures jerry taylor and samuel hammond aroused great interest because it faced up to what has long been true and explicitly rejected what had long been conservative dogma many big government countries in scandinavia for example are also among the freest nations on earth it is time hammond argues to blow up the ideological axis that runs from small government libertarian to big government progressive this of course means blowing up the axis that conservative politics built even if the shifts by conservative politicians such as rubio are seen as largely cosmetic their felt need to adjust their rhetoric is a marker of a transition in the public conversation in the direction of progressives it makes little sense either substantively or politically for progressives and moderates to disown the legacies of clinton and obama they both chipped away at the reagan consensus even as they lived within it in particular each put the lie to supply side economics by raising taxes on the wealthy and in the process fostering two periods of exceptional growth the economic growth trump likes to brag about was set in motion by an obama who faced down an economic collapse and the affordable care act and the rescue of the auto industry are large achievements monuments to the good that creative government can do moreover obama s eloquent arguments for racial justice and interracial peace his 2015 speech on the 50th anniversary of bloody sunday in selma ala will long stand as the definitive argument for america s capacity to change are an antidote to the divisiveness of the trump era but recognizing the good these two presidents did does not mean being hamstrung by the assumptions they lived with or the compromises they felt forced to make fdr honored the tradition of the progressive era but moved well beyond it it is time for another historic leap and it is the task of both progressives and moderates to make sure we take it in 2020 note this essay is

currencies attempt to climb up on the rally tracks fomc and boe leave rates unchanged good day and a tub thumpin thursday to you did you miss me yesterday ha well i m just conditioning you for the week of march 2 thru march 6 when i will be out of the writing business and having a good time with my spring training buddies on my annual spring vacation i know i know it gets earlier every year but i think i ll draw the line in the sand here i had a better day yesterday after my wound center visit but i was still in pain just much more manageable i told the doctor that i would not allow them to put the pasty medicine on my wound again i put my foot down and it worked billy joel greets me this morning with his song stranger man did it storm here last night the thunder echoed through our building and sounded like it was a tank moving in downstairs that s one thing about florida that i ve figured out when it rains it rains but yesterday was sunny and 80 little wind a day that people come to florida for in the winter up north not that you clicked on the letter today to read a weather report the currencies haven t moved one way or the other for the past couple of days although the bias remains to buy dollars and that hangs over the currencies like the sword of damocles and it remains this morning as the currencies are still searching for a rainbow a white knight a lifesaver thrown to them this latest run of dollar strength in the face of weakening economic data and low interest rates reminds me of a star right before it burns out it burns the brightest the coronavirus remains a real problem in china the u s stopped all flights to china after stopping them from entering the country last week well unless all the other countries stop the flights from china who s to say that someone in china couldn t say fly to switzerland and then to the u s a couple of days later this virus is shutting down the world s number 1 or 2 depending on what data you use largest gdp nation so let s take the conservative path and say china is 2 that means they buy tons of commodities and gas from russia and so on that s going to get the brakes applied to them soon and those safe haven buys are back as gold gained some yesterday and is up about 4 in the early trading today to trade at 1 580 the coronavirus has the stock jockey running for exits in fear what it s going to do here in the u s and bonds treasuries on firmly on the rally tracks the 10 year s yield has dropped to 1 56 the price of oil slid again after an abundant oil supply number in the u s printed and gold well it s on the rally tracks too but it s not sitting on them firmly as the price manipulators are still around and working i m just saying gold which at the end of last week and the start of this week looked like it was heading to 1 600 just has not been able to add to those gains which took it as high as 1 584 and has slid back to the 1 576 not a large spread but when one looks like it will go to the stars but can t get out of the earth s atmosphere there s something going on and to me it s simply either the esf exchange stabilization fund or the ppt plunge protection team that s doing whatever they can do to keep gold out of the headlines and tv news so that it doesn t get mom and pop america wanting to buy gold it s that simple folks yes gold gained 19 last year but that was after a few years of not being able to mount a meaningful charge it was due i m just saying in reading ed steer s letter yesterday he highlighted that palladium had been taken down by the price manipulators of whom he calls da boyz i gave you the wrong website address for ed s daily letter last week so let s try this again www edsteergoldsilver com i had been wondering when that would happen given palladium s huge run up in price that was unencumbered one iota sanctions what sanctions the russians reported yesterday that their economic growth had hit a 6 year high and despite the slippage of the oil price the ruble had a decent day of rallying vs the dollar i simply find this news to be amazing what shepherding of the russian economy the central bank has done the bank of england boe met this morning and have already announced their intentions to keep rates unchanged outgoing boe gov mark carney will leave without fulfilling his goal of raising rates just like he left the bank of canada but don t worry about old mark he ll find a cushy job soon and then write memoirs about his time as a central bank gov and people will buy them ugh the antipodean currencies of a s and kiwi can t seem to find a bid these days as their very big trading partner china is seeing its economy go to hell in a hand basket which means that the two island nations exports to china will suffer one currency that baffles me on how it is able to rally is the hong kong dollar hkd aka the honker talk about a trading partner of china and then add in all the protests that take away from economic development and hong kong has the ingredients to slow its economy but the currency keeps ratcheting higher go figure the u s data cupboard will have a revision to the 4th qtr gdp which originally printed at 2 1 but i m as sure as i can be about this one it will be revised downward i m thinking 1 8 probably is where it will fall to tuesday the data cupboard had the december prints of durable and capital goods orders and while durable good orders were up in the positive territory there is something you ll find if you look under the hood at the 3 1 gain don t want to get your hands dirty ok i ll tell you if you take out the military spending durable goods orders would have been negative 2 5 capital good orders were negative 0 9 so both of these are in the negative as far as i m concerned tomorrow s data will have the personal income and spending for december the eci employment cost index which will probably remain at the same level as november s 7 this is where you would find wage increases folks which would drive inflation higher to recap the currencies tried to climb up on the rally tracks but were thrown back down by the dollar bugs a return to the safe havens was on the table on wednesday as gold bonds rallied nicely while stocks got trashed for the day the coronavirus is the reason for the fears growing all over the globe that the virus will spread the boe left rates unchanged this morning and we ll see the color of the 4th qtr gdp revision later this morning for what it s worth i totally skipped talking about the fomc meeting yesterday because i knew i had this in my back pocket it s zerohedge com s view on what the fomc announced yesterday or here s your snippet while the fed s january statement was a snoozer with the only difference from the december statement being the downgrade in the pace of household spending rising at a moderate vs strong pace there were far more notable changes in the latest monetary policy implementation note which as many expected saw the rate which the fed is paying on excess reserves ioer hiked by 5bps to 1 6 or 10 basis points above the bottom of the target range for the federal funds rate which currently is at 1 50 the other notable change from the december meeting is that the fed is now extending its duration of its repo operations which in december were supposed to conclude in january 2020 to at least april 2020 and while there was no comment or change to the fed s qe4 it was this extension to the deadline of repo that boosted stocks in kneejerk reaction as it means the fed continues to believe the crisis situation that emerged after the september repo crisis will continue through at least april even though repo rates have long ago stabilized the committee also directs the desk to continue conducting term and overnight repurchase agreement operations at least through april 2020 to ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample even during periods of sharp increases in non reserve liabilities and to mitigate the risk of money market pressures that could adversely affect policy implementation chuck again yes it looks like the meaning of temporary is being abused again the fed has greased the tracks to do more repos and bong buying through april that would mean that over 6 months of temporary had been done i get so riled up about these repos that i can t see straight so currencies today 1 30 20 american style a 6727 kiwi 6505 c 7565 euro 1 1025 sterling 1 3069 swiss 1 0369 european style rand 14 6789 krone 9 2193 sek 9 6424 forint 306 62 zloty 3 8856 koruna 22 8791

that s it for today well when we next talk it will be february the ground hog will have had its day as will the super bowl and next monday will point out that there a two weeks until pitchers and catchers report yahoo i take kathy to the airport today to go back home and leave me here alone for a week i foresee lots of quiet rest time ha that sure was sad news from sunday about the 9 passengers on the helicopter that crashed that included kobe bryant i just want to say that this brings about something that i feel everyone should embrace to make sure you don t leave unsaid words until it s too late if you love someone tell them if they are your best friend tell them and so on and with that toad the wet sprocket takes us to the finish line with their song walk on the water i hope you have a tub thumpin thursday and a fantastico friday and please be good to yourself
yves here another long form michael hudson discussion from germany of why ancient societies found it in their survival interest to wipe out debt periodically the resistance to this discovery and how modern europe illustrates the dangers of giving creditors the whip hand please enjoy this conversation rees jeannotte hello and welcome i m rees jeannotte and you are watching know your stuff joining me today is economist and anthropologist michael hudson he is a professor of economics at the university of missouri kansas city and an author of many books including killing the host j for junk economics and his most recent and forgive them their debts today we ll be talking with him about his latest book and forgive them their debts the eurozone crisis and the problem of ever increasing rental and home ownership costs around the world professor michael hudson thank you for joining us the link for this is onyoutube michael hudson it s good to be here rees jeannotte how did you come to be both an economist and an anthropologist and in fact combine the two the culmination of which is in large part at least is your latest book and forgive them their debts michael hudson i began as an economist on wall street dealing with third world debt for the chase manhattan bank in the 1960s and then by the 1970s for the united nations institute of training and research unitar writing about how the third world was unable to pay its foreign debts to the united states and other creditors that is unable to pay without submitting to the imf austerity programs without having to sell off its raw materials and its industry and impose a permanent debt crisis on itself at mexico city at a unitar meeting in 1979 78 i gave a speech to point out that the third world could not pay its debts this was four years before mexico s debt default there was a riot and i realized that the issue of debt cancelation and the basic idea that debts chronically could not be paid led me to want to write a history of debt cancellations and how society had handled the problem of debts growing beyond the ability to be paid the problem is that compound interest rises steadily compounding the debt much faster than an economy can grow it took about a year to write about greece rome and the biblical lands but then while i was studying israel i realized that there were hints of an earlier tradition of debt cancelation in babylonia and sumer in bronze age mesopotamia so i began to read the literature on sumer and babylonia the word debt almost never appeared in the index i had to read through the whole book in order to find out about debt and its context i soon realized that most histories of antiquity were based on assumptions about what would happen if a modern economist especially a thatcherite kindred right wing economist would get into a time machine and go back to 3000 bc how would they have created an economy of course it would have been an economy just like argentina or greece it would have gone bankrupt in a hurry and soon been conquered by the surrounding lands civilization wouldn t have been able to take off from such an economy so i got very interested and wrote a draft of a history of debt cancelation in sumer and babylonia by about 1984 a friend of mine at harvard introduced me to the head of the anthropology department there carl lamberg karlovsky anthropology included the archaeology department and i became a research fellow in babylonian archaeology by the 1990s we decided that because most assyriologists had never talked specifically about debt we would begin to have some conferences on it how did property and land ownership begin how did economic rent begin how did the economics of enterprise interest bearing debt and credit contracts began in mesopotamia we decided on a series of three volumes to culminate in the third volume which to review debt cancelations in mesopotamia well i submitted the first draft to a university press and they sent it out to readers as academic presses do the readers replied that a debt cancellation was inconceivable that this was a crazy book three decades ago it seemed inconceivable that any country any society could have canceled the debts because then the creditors wouldn t lend any more money just about everybody believed that in the 1980s and early 90s what they did not understand was number one that most debts were owed to the palace the palace had a choice when crops failed or debts mounted up it could insist on all debts being paid that would have reduced much of the population to bondage in which case the palace doesn t get any taxes or rent or labor services the creditors would get all the crop surplus and an oligarchy would take form in that case the local city was likely to be defeated by invaders or the palace could cancel debts so as to restore economic order we decided to invite archaeologists and assyriologists and ask them to provide everything they knew from their particular period of babylonia sumer the neo babylonian period and israel they explained how enterprise and economic techniques and profit seeking contracts began in the palatial sector of the economy money did not begin as barter as the free enterprise boys say money was created as a means of paying taxes and fees to the palace basically you had enterprise and private property beginning in the palatial sector often with a symbiotic connection to private entrepreneurs rees jeannotte the key here is that barter wasn t the key to money or credit that is barter didn t happen in the way that most people would imagine michael hudson right the german firm springer just published a handbook of money and credit in which i wrote the lead article on the origins of money showing that the barter theory was made up by right wing austrian economists who hated governments acting in the public interest almost all the mainstream monetary theories are by right wing anti socialists claiming that government can play no positive role at all their conclusion is that money is best without government and should be left to the private banks the idea is that they would plan society better so basically the libertarians the free enterprise boys advocate a highly centralized economy much more centralized than soviet russia much more centralized than china they want everything centralized in wall street or the city of london that is in the banks they want the banks to be in charge of everything they say that all this is all for the best so we find in antiquity through sumer babylonia greece and rome that whenever a financial oligarchy has taken power it has created a depression a disaster and an economic collapse almost all ancient historians have found this this is what livy and dionysius wrote about in their histories of rome and plutarch that s why the free enterprise boys today in the united states have stopped teaching economic history in the economic curriculum if you go to get an economics degree in the united states you no longer study history it s out of the curriculum you don t even study the history of economic thought it s as if economics began in 1980 with margaret thatcher milton friedman and other right wingers the result is a censorship about how civilization has been evolving for the last few thousand years and how it has dealt with debt issues i edited five big colloquia volumes for harvard on the origins of money privatization and land ownership labor and economic accounting after finishing five colloquia i decided to write the popular summary of it all that s my book and forgive them their debts rees jeannotte it would be interesting to know why you chose that title the image on the cover of the book is depicts jesus as a mercilessly whipping a moneylender or tossing him out of the temple i can imagine photoshopping someone like jamie diamond s head on top of moneylender you know many people would think that s why you chose those images why that image and that title michael hudson i don t think that i ever have chosen the title to any of my books i m not very good at choosing titles i had wanted to call the book bronze age finance but my publisher said that nobody knows what the bronze age means she said that what i ve really written about is jesus s first sermon he unrolled the scroll of isaiah and talked about the year of our lord meaning the jubilee year and said that he had come to proclaim that that is the revolutionary part of my book people think that the lord s prayer is all about forgiving sins but in the time jesus spoke there was a fight over the debt issue just as there was in rome there also were riots demanding debt cancelation in greece and indeed a long war with mithridates in the near east over debt cancelation that is what jesus s first sermon was about and that is what the lord s prayer was about that is what the original judaism had been about before the rabbinical class the pharisees basically from the wealthy creditor class took over and subverted the older jewish religion that jesus came to try to revive so my publisher thought that i should tie my book into the origins of christianity because we re living in a christian society and more people are familiar with the lord s prayer forgiving their debts than they are about bronze age finance rees jeannotte this is where the creditor class i guess around the time of christ won the battle against central power palaces and temples at least in the western roman empire there was a paradigm shift in how to treat debt exponential growth of debt at compound interest compared to the economy s slow s ccurve michael hudson that makes western civilization different from everything that went before earlier civilization in the near east had an idea that the economy always tends to get out of balance always polarizing between the rich and the poor and causing poverty and ultimately depopulation and military loss as a result of creditors enslaving their debtors reducing debtors to clientage or bondage in the near east was different they had a different economic model a much better economic model much more mathematically sophisticated than any model that i ve seen in modern academia their model said that you have interest bearing debt growing exponentially doubling every five years in mesopotamia but the overall economy grows in an s curve more slowly so again and again you have an inherent instability if you don t have a central authority to keep wiping out the arrears to keep restoring balance then you re going to have an unbalanced economy modern economic models are based on equilibrium theory its mathematics are based on circular reasoning it says that the business cycle is self correcting without needing any government intervention the guiding idea is that it is impossible that people become impoverished because there are automatic stabilizers if you just get the government out of the way and let wall street run everything everybody will be happy and prosperous look at the stock market well the problem is that in america 10 percent of the population owns 80 or 85 percent of the stocks and bonds the stock market has gone way up government debt has gone way up but the income for 90 percent of the people have gone down since 2008 the minimum wage has not gone up at all so you have the financial economy growing at the expense of the real economy of goods and services the population is being impoverished yet economists say that we re getting richer meaning that theirclass the financial class is getting richer that is the travesty of modern economies it s amazing that in the bronze age 3000 1200 bc they had better models we have the training manuals they taught the scribal students the mathematics they used were superior to the mathematics underlying today s mainstream right wing models which say debt can never be a structural problem rees jeannotte in those days they had an inverted concept of moral hazard right it s been completely flipped around so can you explain what moral hazard is and how democratic societies really should be thinking about debt we often think about just personal debts or maybe someone had murdered somebody america is a great example where you get life imprisonment there is no redemption it seems how do we deal with those concepts should we be moving away from them failure to cancel personal and other non business debts leads to chronic depression michael hudson well the right wing economic fashion in the united states is that of douglass north following the austrian school saying that civilization progresses if there is a sanctity of contracts a contract is a contract and you need enforcement even if the contract is unfair therefore you must notcancel debts because that would cheat the wealthy people who ve made the contract to get their money even if enforcing the debt contract means that the rest of the economy has to starve suicide rates go up the economy impoverishes itself but a contract is a contract and that s called progress as if it s darwinian economics in bronze age antiquity by contrast rulers put economic balance as being the key consideration they recognized that you have to have a palatial or civic authority come in to cancel the debt contracts if the price of making the debtors pay these contracts which they re forced to sign under your money or your life conditions is to cause economic collapse as it ultimately did in rome for five centuries you had economic revolts of the plebeians and the poor wanting debt cancelation in every case the right wing the creditors won not by argument but by assassinating populist political leaders they ended up killing caesar long before that there was century after century of assassination for instance the gracchi brothers and a long series of other reformers just like today the basis of chicago school economics is you cannot have a free market if you re not willing to assassinate your major critics they went to chile sent in their economists who named the labor union leaders that pinochet had to assassinate they named the land reformers he had to assassinate and the socialists this started a wave of thousands of assassinations from chile to argentina that huge assassination program was sponsored by the cia saying this was necessary to create a free market we re doing this for freedom we re doing this for democracy but even the wealthy elites in antiquity knew that was debt causing a problem and that the problem with society basically was caused by greed that is what socrates said that s what the solon of athens wrote in his poetry when he canceled the debts it s what livy and all the other major roman historians and the stoics wrote nowhere in antiquity do you ever find the idea that rich people should be able to enslave and impoverish society at large how do we deal with that problem a system of laws to prevent wealthy creditors from reducing the rest of the population to bondage that was their idea of economics in a social context rees jeannotte there s lots of light bulb moments when one reads your book but one thing that struck me is that revolutions really only started happening in earnest when these debt cancelations stopped happening right there are so many interesting things in the book i d like to ask you about what the modern equivalents of these ancient institutions would be the palace and the temple michael hudson what i found out looking at bronze age mesopotamia is how different it was from modern society i d been known as a futurist in the 70 s working at the hudson institute and the futures group it s easier to forecast the future than it is to understand the bronze age palaces and temples there were three groups a palace the temples basically controlled by the royal family and the landed communities at large with their own body of common law hammurabi s laws for instance weren t a code they applied to the palace sector in its relations with the rest of society their structure was narrower than that of common law i found in order to explain the origin of debt and commerce interest rates profits and land ownership i had to describe a society quite alien from ours i had to go beyond the debt issue itself and talk about the broad social context rees jeannotte do we have institutions that might be similar to something like a centralized institution i don t know like the central banks of today michael hudson no they only have exactly the opposite aim central banks work for the commercial banks and their creditors in 1913 in america the federal reserve was broken off from the treasury in order to shift monetary management away from the treasury in washington to the private banks of new york city and other commercial centers central banks are the antithesis of ancient palaces because they represent the creditor interests they act as the lobbyists for the banks you actually had a wall street lobbyist alan greenspan head the federal reserve their job is to bail out the banks and to make the banks solvent even when that impoverishes their customers even when the banks make fraudulent loans such as the junk mortgage crisis that burst in 2008 the banks were saved despite the fact that this was the largest bank fraud that been seen in american history they were saved andthe fake fraudulent debts were imposed on the hapless mortgaged homebuyers that resulted in a million families kicked out of their homes the result has been that rents are going up very rapidly here housing prices are going up rapidly and americans pay so much money to financial sector for debt service for mortgages student loans car loans and credit card loans that have less and less disposable income to spend on goods and services that s why the american economy has been shrinking now for 12 years since 2008 since the obama crisis the economy has gone down because the banks and bondholders were saved not the economy rees jeannotte this is what you call regulatory capture michael hudson yes and not only regulatory capture of the federal reserve but beyond that the intellectual capture of society i tried to write my book and its sequel the collapse of antiquity to provide a mind expansion exercise to understand that if you don t write down the debts there s going to be a chronic financial crisis and austerity you re going to end up looking like greece or argentina or latvia rees jeannotte this is what we re now seeing in greece this is an interesting example because the greek crisis is still on at the time it was all over the news you had the situation where they were demanding that greece pay its debts you often say that debts can t be paid won t be paid michael hudson the trick was to say that greece should pay its debts but these debts where the debts owed to pay for crooked tax evasion the greek debts to foreigners were about 50 billion euros christine lagarde of the imf had a list of all the swiss bank accounts that greek shipowners industrialists and financiers had illegally put their money outside of greece into switzerland all the money was there it was stolen from the tax authorities so it wasn t the greek people thatowed the debts these were debts that the wealthy people owed to the tax authority but were not paid they were tax evasion debts but the european community said that the greek people have to pay the debts that the wealthy class had crookedly avoided paying it stood up for the crooks the imf had the usual junk economics theory that greece would be much better off and would recover once it paid but of course it hasn t recovered if there s any institution that should be abolished it s the imf which seems basically to serve as a branch of the defense department to keep other countries subservient to the united states i discussed the greek crisis in killing the host which is published as der sektorin germany by klett cotta i outline the greek debt crisis the argentine crisis and others rees jeannotte what i was trying to get at was the disingenuousness from the eu that they would say constantly repeat that greece must pay its debts when they must have known they could not be paid back and as you pointed out who had to pay them back is also a question or who really owed the actual debts but they must know that so what is the real aim of doing this i remember seeing a website reporting that they re auctioning off greek islands this is the key i think it is what the oligarchs in ancient times did too asset grabbing michael hudson yes that s it it is an asset grab in economics you have something called revealed preference you assume that what happens is what is intended so you can say that what the central bankers of germany intended was to reduce greece s population to increase the suicide rate to shorten life spans to collapse its economy to the point where germans could come in and insist that greece buy expensive submarines and military hardware and that greece would have to sell to german investors its electric utilities and other assets germany made this a power grab that it had its eyes on for over 50 years ever since it backed the colonels and the assassinations of the greek communists after world war ii rees jeannotte to think about a more sensible way to deal with a debt crisis maybe you can use the most recent example of a national debt cancellation namely here in germany michael hudson that s right the german economic miracle was the allied debt reforms of 1947 48 they essentially wiped out all debts except for what employers owed their employees you know the workers wages and minimum working balances at the banks it was easy for the allies to cancel the debts owed to german creditors because the creditors were mainly nazis the whole idea was to wipe them out they didn t the want to leave the former nazis with financial power to take over the economy again they wanted a clean slate canceling the debts created the german economic miracle because the economy was able to operate without personal debt and without much public debt or corporate debt it was able to take off today essentially you re dealing with a criminalized banking class that i think we should treat in the same way that the allies treated the nazis if you don t cancel the debts owed to them the economy is going to shrink and shrink and polarize we re going to have essentially a neo feudalism controlled by the creditor class like you had in rome in the dark ages do you really want a new dark age rees jeannotte no not particularly this leads us into the financial crisis of 2008 where you were among the few people to predict it accurately it was largely based on a giant private debt bubble private debt is something that we don t hear much about i tried to look for the totals on private debt worldwide you find out the debt to gdp ratio for public debt for government debt but it s never about private debt michael hudson that is because the right wing politicians want to abolish government and the social services it provides apart from the money governments owe for military spending and nato they owe pensions and health care the right wing program in germany and europe is to get rid of pensions to lower them to financialize and privatize the pension system instead of germany s pay as you go system which is quite good they want to get rid of social spending also they look at government debt as the adversary of private debt for instance in the united states president clinton finally ran a budget surplus in the last year of his rule what happens when a government runs a surplus that means that it doesn t spend money intothe economy the economy has to rely on banks to get credit because every economy needs credit to function and grow bankers realize that if the government doesn t provide the economy with money by spending deficits into the economy to promote employment then people will have to borrow from the banks but if they keep borrowing from the banks to buy homes rising in price and just to maintain their living standards their families will end up looking like greece or argentina they re going to have to pay more of their income as interest bankers will end up with the houses and with private industry they will end up controlling everything including the government for thousands of years the leading tension of civilization has been over who is going to dominate and plan society s economy will it be democratic governments or wise rulers seeking stability and military security or will it be a financial oligarchy that wants to get rich by impoverishing the rest of society the problem is that one person s debt is another person s savings the situation you have today is that 10 percent of the population the savers are holding 90 percent of the population in debt 90 percent in americans are paying debt service to the top 10 percent that is the key to today s economic warfare it s not the kind of class warfare that the socialists talked about a century ago it s the old fashioned financial warfare between creditors and debtors that s been going on for thousands of years that s why i wrote the book to explain how this whole fight began rees jeannotte so austerity obviously plays a key role here as well it s intimately linked with the expansion of private debt can you explain how that is michael hudson suppose you re in germany and your real estate prices are going up while real estate prices going up a home or an office building is worth whatever a bank will lend against it banks now find the way to get rich is to do what american and british banks do eighty percent of american and british bank credit is mortgage credit they lend against houses and the result is a huge inflation of real estate prices if germans have to pay more and more of their monthly income either for rent or for mortgage interest or for debt service as in america then they re going to have less to spend on goods and services you re going to end up looking like new york where the stores are going out of business fifth avenue madison avenue broadway you go down the streets and block after block for rent signs in front of empty stores rees jeannotte the same thing happening in the street that i live in in this three block area it s sort of like a high street area and boutique street there are at least twelve shops closed people just can t afford the rents we have a mayoral race coming up one of the big topics is rental prices in munich it s just everywhere the same in major cities there s lots of talk about capping rents for six years and this kind of thing but rents are too high already you cap them at the rate they re at but that doesn t make it more affordable what should they be doing michael hudson there s a simple way to keep housing prices down you prevent land prices from going up by doing what adam smith john stuart mill and the whole 19th century of classical economics advocated land prices go up not because of enterprise not because of population growth but mostly because of bank credit if you tax the increase in the land value then the banks will not be able to lend against that now germany has the lowest real estate taxes of almost any country that s because it has a tradition of not having a real estate class dominating society not a donald trump type economy but if germany begins to follow the u s and english pattern and you let the banks lend more and more to inflate housing prices then you re going to continue to shrink germany s economy is beginning to shrink i ve seen bank reports that say that if german living standards can be lowered by 20 percent or 30 percent german technicians and workers will have to emigrate the german population would fall by 30 percent in 20 years your disposable personal incomes would have to fall by 50 percent in order to let the banks make the german real estate market look like the u s market rees jeannotte who was saying that michael hudson the bank models predict that germany s population must fall living standards must fall by 20 or 30 percent and your lifespans must shorten your suicide rates must go up and your skilled labor must emigrate in order for your real estate market to provide the revenue to the keep banking system solvent as private sector debt increases at today s rates that will make your banking system look like the american and british banking system where eighty percent of bank credit goes into real estate it s a circular flow pushing up the price of housing causing an umbrella for rents to go up germany will end up looking like greece that is the business as usual economic plan your economic leaders of all your parties except the linke want germany to end up looking like greece they say that that s progress but it s only progress for the banking class this is the implicit war which somehow is not being discussed in germany rees jeannotte you often have talked about europe as a dead zone i d like to know why you think it s a dead zone where are we heading what does the future look like for europe michael hudson the term dead zone was formulated by the u s defense secretary donald rumsfeld under bush he disparaged what he called old europe the reason the eurozone is a dead zone is that it cannot run budget deficits of more than 3 percent you believe that budget deficits should be avoided in order to make sure that all of the credit that the economy needs is created by banks at interest and how do banks create this credit they lend mainly for landlords to buy housing making germans pay more rent is the new growth area of its economy inflating asset prices so the eurozone has a plan of asset price inflation for real estate stocks and bonds their prices are being supported you ve created about four trillion euros just to support the stock and bond markets you could have spent this into the real economy you could have made europe into a utopia instead you just used that government money to push up stock and bond prices for the 10 percent whose economic model involves impoverishing you that is a crazy policy to follow because it imposes austerity rees jeannotte so what s the answer here i ve heard that in the united states there is some movement on public banking should we be looking toward something like that democratizing the central banks michael hudson you cannot democratize a central bank they are the lobbyists for the commercial banks you need to have the treasury take charge appointed by democratically elected representatives not unelected bankers central bankers are pretty much brainwashed they believe that the way to make an economy prosperous is to impoverish 90 percent of the population instead of re educating such people you have to create a new institution and the new institutions should be developed within the treasury but as long as you have the eurozone not permitting budget deficits of more than 3 percent and believing that a balanced budget is an ideal it really means letting the central banks and their clients the commercial banks take over and provide the economy s money commercial banks lend differently from what a public bank would do they lend for corporate takeovers for asset stripping and for raiding they lend against assets that inflates prices for real estate or for corporate raiders public banks can spend money into the economy to make it richer the german economy is shrinking it doesn t have to be this way but in order to have an alternative you have to have a different economic theory that s not taught in german universities your economic departments are very right wing they re looking at a parallel universe a kind of science fiction world in which private enterprise creditors and banks will make everybody rich not impoverishing them by imposing financial and fiscal austerity academic economics is an inside out world rees jeannotte you have released a german version of killing the host it s called der sektor i highly recommend people go and check it out i ve read it twice back to back i found it so interesting i would like to ask if there s going to be a german addition of and forgive them their debts michael hudson yes it s being translated now it s taken about a year to be translated in berlin i m hoping that klett cotta may publish it as they did my finance imperium which my super imperialismbook i wanted to have my own translation done by somebody who knew assyriology instead of just turning it over to a publisher or to someone who didn t know the assyrian legal terms so that should be finished in about a month or two then i ll be turning it over to the publisher and it will probably take them until next year to produce it rees jeannotte you also said that there will be a sequel you mentioned it today when can we expect that michael hudson i m just finishing it now in english the collapse of antiquity that will be published later this year i hope it shows that greece and rome collapsed because of debt it s part of a trilogy the final volume will be the tyranny of debt from the middle ages to the present if you look at england and countries in the 12th and 13th century you had the papacy treating the royal governments just like the imf treats countries today you had the protests by matthew paris and other english historians about how paying peters pence to rome was impoverishing the country what is happening today is part of an age old story that happens in every era so i want to have a whole history of debt leading up to the 20th century rees jeannotte professor michael hudson thank you so much

nitin is an associate at the analysis group in their washington d c office he graduated with an mba from cornell university s johnson school of management where he served as an emerging markets fellow with a master s in international affairs and prior work experience in economics he specializes in explaining complex economic and financial phenomena at the intersection of global politics shaping the world less more the great recession of 2008 left an indelible mark on global economics in america s modern history since world war i it was the second longest continuous period of contraction according to the national bureau of economic research an average american economic recession since 1854 has lasted for 11 months of contraction the 2008 recession dragged for 18 while the great depression of 1929 saw a much longer contraction for 43 straight months the recovery from the dip in 2008 has arguably been the longest in american history nonetheless so long as markets are made up of individuals and institutions that manifest emotions on a spectrum of alacrity to the gloom economic recessions will remain part of the human endeavour in the systemic flaws we leave behind in fact there s no record of an american expansion everlasting longer than a decade the next recession unlike the previous one may not however be spurred by a cataclysmic financial crisis in fact a paper published by the international monetary fund argues that global financial factors explain no more than a quarter of the capital movement across borders nevertheless an ever more financially integrated global world doesn t augur well when economic turbulence slithers through the cracks consider for instance the scale of the global integration in the world at the end of 2017 the outstanding cross border financial claims stood at 29 trillion compared to just 9 trillion in 1998 macroeconomic fundamentals are seemingly simple as they are at times complex and imprudent in their foresight put simply the us federal reserve could easily tip the us and by reference the global economy into recession either if it tightens the monetary policy too much particularly as the sugar rush from the trump tax cuts wears off or if it moves rather slowly and as a result the inflation starts rising in a world where national economies climb through stairs and tumble down through an elevator there are factors that left unto themselves might seem relatively insignificant to their aggregate sum in bringing down the global economy to the brink of recession it is important to note that the seemingly unanimous concerns amongst economists for a prospective slowdown and economic crash are premised in the ongoing us monetary contraction viz fed has raised interest rates eight times since december 2015 and financial distress in some of the major emerging economies however there is scant focus on two very important aspects for one economists pay little attention to cultural and social norms that have bound and in some cases underpinned the post war international economic order most notably the ongoing decay of international liberalism that upholds the global trade flows second and equally important is the need to recognize and come to terms with the severe limitations of the institutional policy arsenal we will inevitably possess when the next recession comes and the house burns down in front of us the quintessential tool in the fed s armoury prolifically used by central banks over decades is the swift manoeuvring of interest rates i e expanding the monetary policy by aggressively lowering interest rates during the times of economic distress and as the economy gains its strength back the interest rates rise up again however since the last recession the interest rates have not recovered to the level required to tackle a new downturn as a result of this depleted interest rate power of the fed the story for this decade is not about when the next recession is going to come but rather how shallow the recovery was during the previous one even before the crisis the fed fostered an environment of exceptionally low interest rates excess liquidity and aggressive risk taking as observed now from peak to peak real wage growth and quality of jobs in the united states have fallen us leads the oecd countries as the largest share of low paid jobs nearly 30 of the us population works at what other rich countries would consider poverty wages in lieu of interest rate manoeuvring other potential solutions to tackle a new recession could be in the form of quantitative easing hereinafter qe fiscal stimulus or in extremely desperate circumstances direct handouts of money qe would be a tough sell politically and economically federal reserve has a bloated balance sheet its assets with all the ordained qe in the recent past stood at 4 3 trillion in july 2018 roughly 20 of the us gdp in addition qe in the us has global ramifications fed s binge buying leads to depressed yields domestically which in turn causes capital flight to emerging markets as investors shop for higher returns elsewhere this leads to easy dollar denominated debt for the emerging markets two cases in point chinese corporations today hold dollar denominated debt of 450 billion compared to none in 2009 and since the financial crisis the corporate dollar denominated bond issued debt in the emerging markets has increased at an annual rate of more than 10 the high dollar denominated debt poses a serious risk towards bankrupting these countries especially where the assets are owned in local currencies as the us interest rates rise and the dollar strengthens in comparison as a caveat it is worth pointing that qe in the face of a severe economic recession is also limited by the law of the land in the us the fed as mandated by law can only buy debt securities backed by government guarantees not corporate bonds or equities the second solution fiscal stimulus would also be hotly contested politically across the rich world discretionary fiscal stimulus programs like the one passed by us congress and devised by president obama s administration in 2009 are politically mired due to their doubtful economic effectiveness the forecasted us fiscal deficit for 2018 despite a robust 4 quarterly growth is running at 4 of the gdp up by 114 billion from 2017 although the rest of the world is cutting down on its deficits the us is an exception thanks to the budget busting republican tax reform package the northern european countries are perennially sceptical of the fiscal stimulus and high non performing debts that may arise from defaulting neighbours in addition government debt across the world is at record levels the average debt for advanced economies stands at more than 100 of the gdp while in china it is through the roof at 300 of the gdp mostly because of its panicked borrowing during the 2008 financial crisis to support massive fiscal stimulus valued at roughly 12 5 of its gdp italy with an insurmountable government debt valued at roughly 130 of its gdp is a ticking time bomb in this interconnected world it only takes one weak link to radiate out an economic weakness that spreads globally however some eminent economists still believe that if prolonged unemployment threatens to reduce an economy s long term growth potential the fiscal stimulus at the zero lower bound might well pay for itself in the past the empirical analyses usually stipulated that fiscal stimulus during times of economic distress contributed to excessive government burden and therefore resulted in a prolonged drag on future economic growth contrary to that a number of credible economic research studies conducted post the 2008 financial crisis found that every dollar of fiscal stimulus during the recession had a disproportionately larger effect on the economic output jason furman former chair of the council of economic advisors under barack obama and now a professor at harvard suggests a more mechanical way of propping up the kindred animal spirit of the markets measures such as larger social safety nets unemployment payments and labour taxes rather than the more commonly ostensible forms of fiscal spending economic crises have always been hard to understand and predict to the majority they only reveal themselves when the asset prices are in free fall and the credit markets freeze up regardless these are interesting times to be a washington policy maker before it s too late technocrats at federal agencies now more than ever have a chance at constructing impactful policies without a hanging shadow of an imminent economic downturn it requires bold moves for the restoration of labour share productivity growth and income redistribution as well as an incentive system for the states and localities to ascertain progressive revenue streams as they try to preserve the global world order intellectuals can gain from some visceral insights in the face of spreading populism around the world the policymakers still need to keep their thumbs at restoring the conventional fundamentals that form the economic fabric of our society facebook twitter linkedin

american microsoft and apple are the other two they both have a market value well in excess of one trillion dollars a fourth monster u s corporation amazon will probably join this elite group sometime in 2020 to put the one trillion dollar figure into perspective consider that as of 2017 only 17 countries in the world had a gnp of a trillion us or more in july 2017 cnbc announced that amazon ceo jeff bezos the richest man in the world was the odds on favorite to become the first trillionaire wealth is power the concentration of wealth in america has reached epic proportions in a commercial republic rigged in favor of the superrich where the problems and predations of capitalism are routinely swept under the carpet and an empire of law protects and perpetuates great wealth free and fair elections are the only effective way to protect the public interest against special interests powerful pacs and corporate lobbies but something has again gone terribly wrong in america it happened once before between the end of the civil war and the world war one then it was teddy roosevelt and other trustbusters in both parties who led the fight against monopoly capitalism today a very different republic party is backing a very different kind of president and popular elections are no longer a counterweight to extreme wealth shallow roots deep convictions compared to other belief systems that have shaped the modern world the roots of capitalism in the history of western civilization are shallow i will say more about the problems of capitalism as a belief system later but for now suffice it say that what began as a theory in europe has acquired the status of a secular religion in america even if we accept max weber s thesis that capitalism is a natural outgrowth of the protestant work ethic especially the theology of john calvin it did not emerge as a unified theory much less a functioning economic system until sometime in the first half of the 19th century it s no accident that it happened first in the united kingdom a mercantile powerhouse that had by then established a cluster of colonies on the other side of the atlantic ocean it s also no accident that adam smith was british scottish to be precise or that the idea of the invisible hand originated in great britain or that it traveled to america with the puritans who landed at plymouth rock destructive creation economists drunk on capitalism love to talk about the wonders of creative destruction apart from the obvious that it is self contradictory on its face the concept even as defined by its apostles collapses under the weight of historical evidence critical analysis and moral philosophy it is so preposterous as to be comical but as the basis for a set of myths that has turned a theoretical construct into a secular religion it s no laughing matter according to alan greenspan and adrian wooldridge in capitalism in america a history penguin 2018 p 14 creative destruction is the principal driving force of economic progress the perennial gale that uproots businesses and lives but that in the process creates a more productive economy get it no okay let s try again creation and destruction are siamese twins still not think of the problem this way you can t make an omelet without breaking eggs creative destruction is the genius of american capitalism which is why america invented the omelet and edison invented electricity there is no better place to study this perennial gale than here in america where a throng of business titans once upon a time reorganized entire industries on a continental scale what s that you say america didn t invent the omelet who cares you have to break a lot of light bulbs to make electricity that s an alternative fact just ask edison the nutty idea of creative destruction can be traced to a dead economist named joseph schumpeter and his book capitalism socialism and democracy published in 1942 a banner year for destruction in a world no longer safe for democracy no other economic system in history had ever come close to delivering the kind of destructive creation capitalism did between 1939 and 1945 among the horrific fruits of capitalism s perennial gale the german v 2 rocket with a 2 200 pound payload the british and u s carpet bombing of german cities note not military targets but population centers and the mushroom clouds over the radioactive ruins of hiroshima and nagasaki to be fair greenspan and wooldridge do acknowledge that there is a downside to creative destruction but they do not appear to have a clue how destructive the downside is and they explain it away with exculpatory language like this partly because people are frightened of change and partly because change produces losers as well as winners creative destruction is usually greeted by what max weber called a flood of mistrust sometimes hatred above all of moral indignation that s ironic because these distinguished economic thinkers appear to be blind or indifferent to the moral consequences of unbridled capitalism in a chapter entitled the triumph of capitalism they note that it was the farmers willingness to turn capitalists that lay behind america s emergence as an agricultural superpower but sadly they engineered an ecological catastrophe bison were placid creatures that had grazed in massive herds on the american plains for millennia and coexisted with native americans who never killed enough to deplete the herds never mind that native americans like the bison were also driven to the brink of extinction clearly the indigenous folks were not good capitalists like the farmers who were far more adept at creative destruction to wit american farmers engineered an ecological transformation by turning the native grasslands of the midwest and california into a vast sea of grain and in the cruel logic of american capitalism the fate of millions of displaced indigenous peoples was incidental to the holy grail of economic growth and the magic the marketplace trickle down party trick theory strategy or conspiracy whatever you choose to call it trickle down economics is a political party trick it s a trick the grand old party gop has played on a big slice of the electorate only too willing to believe that liberals and socialists a k a democrats are the cause of chronic federal deficits and all the unfairness baked into american society but the facts tell a very different story what has been happening in america is the exact opposite instead of trickling down wealth has not only trickled up in the past decade but the trickle is looking more like a tidal wave all the time a recent article in the business insider shouts one stunning chart undercuts trump s favorite economic scorecard and shows why its misleading what the chart shows is that while the s p 500 has leaped ahead by over 40 during trump s first term wages have inched up at a mere 9 but half of all middle and working class americans own no stock the top 10 of american households own the lion s share of them at 84 extreme economic inequality is a fact of life in many countries and regions of the world globally america is not the most extreme example nor did not start when donald trump stepped into the oval office but in the last decade according to the calculations of a development economist at the brookings institution the united states was the top of the league table in terms of the rich s share of consumption growth fully 65 percent of the spending increase the rich started in 2010 with the bulk of household spending and the distribution over the last decade simply reinforced this inequality all the rest went to the middle class zero trickle down still not convinced these facts are accurate fair enough one recent statistical analysis found that income inequality in the united states is highest its been in more than 50 years while a another study found that income of the poorest americans actually fell by 7 percent over the past 15 years the biggest gop party trick of all of course is the systematic effort to deny distort and discredit facts not just facts about the economy but facts in general which is why we now have propaganda nonsense like trickle down economics aimed at serving private interests in place of fact based debates over taxes and public policy it s at the least a strategy at worst a conspiracy to conceal with real truth about the concentration of economic wealth in america and the political hijacking that has made it possible congress on the auction block fact the extreme concentration of wealth in the hands of a small number of rich americans is getting worse by the year fact the ultrarich collectively got more than 500 billion dollars richer in 2019 fact economic power a k a wealth in american translates into political influence so long as the supreme court continues to uphold the ruling in citizens united that in effect blocks any real campaign finance reform the u s congress will remain on the auction bloc and key votes on taxation and the federal budget who gets or pays what when and how will be sold to the highest bidder thus it was no surprise when congress passed a republican tax bill in 2017 that overwhelmingly benefited corporations and the rich and president trump gleefully signed it fact the u s has the highest concentration of billionaires in the world 705 individuals and was the only country to add more billionaires last year fact the 2017 tax law lowered the corporate rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and gives so called pass through businesses like the trump organization a 20 tax deduction it also repealed the 20 percent corporate alternative minimum tax designed to ensure that corporations paid at least some taxes companies are excused from paying corporate taxes on money they claim to earn abroad as well a reward for exporting jobs and an incentive to keep more income in foreign tax havens if and when corporate income is repatriated is now between 8 and 15 5 down from 35 sweet but not sweet enough the 2017 tax bill also doubled the inheritance tax exemption for married couples from 11 million to 22 million the coming crisis the coming crisis of capitalism is not only economic it s also a moral and political crisis a constitution in tatters is the death knell of democracy by the same token corporate monopolies are incompatible with a market economy capitalism thrives on vigorous and fair competition when the deck is heavily stacked in favor of a few massive conglomerates and billionaires the rest of society the many the middle class and low economic underclass lose faith in the system as economist stephanie kelton tweeted last year no one makes a billion dollars you take a billion dollars the strong economy of recent years is largely an illusion when it comes to capitalism and constitutional democracy republicans in congress are world class hypocrites fiscal conservatives and deficit hawks seem to have changed their tune all in the name of massive tax cuts that would primarily benefit the wealthy fact household credit card debt in america currently exceeds 1 trillion the average interest rate on this form of debt starts at 17 4 and goes up in february 2019 it was reported that total household debt has climbed to over 4 trillion fact the 2017 tax bill will cost 1 46 trillion over 10 years no wonder the federal deficit in 2019 jumped 26 in 2019 nearly hit the trillion dollar mark for the first time ever and will go over a 1 trillion in 2020 meanwhile the national debt climbed to over 23 trillion last year what a governments does and says influences how citizens behave and what they believe in the reagan era we learned that greed is good in the trump era we are being told that deficits don t matter and neither of course do the facts
the federal deficit is expected to pass 1 trillion this year and keep rising over the coming decade the congressional budget office projected this week by 2030 the debt held by the public is expected to grow to 98 percent of gross domestic product up from just under 80 percent today the culprit president donald trump s tax cuts and spending increases as well as growing entitlement spending is all this debt something to worry about as far as the economy goes no not really washington may be borrowing a great deal of money but we can probably handle it just fine the u s is not on the verge of a fiscal crisis and it s hard to imagine what circumstances would cause one in the foreseeable future advertisement but is it fair to be mad about the debt given the way republicans spent years calling for spending cuts when we were still fighting our way out of the recession given the way trump has added to the red ink in large part by slashing taxes for the wealthy given that the debt will inevitably be weaponized as an excuse to attack spending on important government programs the second a democrat is in office absolutely you should be furious about it here s an easy way to think about how much the white house s policies have widened the deficit around the time trump entered office the cbo projected that the budget gap was on pace to hit 775 billion by this year or 3 6 percent of the economy capitol hill s forecasters now think it will reach 1 015 trillion instead equal to about 4 6 percent of gdp that extra percentage point is what we should probably think of as the trump bump it s a result of both the gop s 2017 tax bill no it did not pay for itself and budget deals that have increased military as well as domestic expenditures going forward rising medicare and social security costs will add to the debt as well as we run trillion dollar deficits from now til eternity advertisement advertisement advertisement advertisement the cbo may even be underestimating the size of future deficits since its forecast assumes that many of the tax cuts republicans enacted will expire on schedule in 2025 when it s likely that at least some of them will survive there are many people in washington who believe that all of this borrowing is setting us all up for a reckoning that unless the u s changes course we re in for a fiscal catastrophe the cbo a bastion of conventional wisdom on these things puts it dryly to put debt on a sustainable path lawmakers will have to make significant changes to tax and spending policies i don t particularly share that concern the main reason economists have traditionally warned governments against borrowing too much is that doing so could slow down the economy by pushing up interest rates and crowding out private investment in theory a country could also end up trapped in a debt spiral where it can no longer meet its interest payments and is forced to default but for developed nations that print their own currencies sorry greece those aren t really serious concerns these days as olivier blanchard the former chief economist of the international monetary fund has explained at length we live in an era of rock bottom interest rates that have made it easier for governments to sustain even high levels of debt in the united states interest payments as a percentage of gdp are just over half of what they were in the mid 1990s the signs of crowd out are also all but nonexistent borrowing is cheaper for companies now than at any time since the 1950s there are also signs that advanced countries can carry vastly higher debt loads than we do and still be just fine japan s debt to gdp ratio is more than double ours and yet it s currently borrowing money at negative interest rates meaning investors are essentially paying japan to hold their money advertisement advertisement advertisement it s possible that all of this could change one day and interest rates could surge but i wouldn t bet on it as blanchard has pointed out low interest rates actually seem to be a historical norm so if the debt probably isn t an imminent threat why care at all about it first there s the matter of political hypocrisy after the great recession republicans spent years fearmongering about the deficit demanding that the government slam down austerity measures at a moment when the country badly needed more stimulus their successful efforts to eventually cut spending were one of the reasons our economic recovery was so slow the fact that the moment they were back in power they passed a massive deficit financed tax cut for the wealthy and leaned into deficit spending shows how much of their rhetoric about the dangers of debt was in utterly bad faith advertisement second debt doves like me could be wrong in the end all predictions about the economy are informed guesses and it s possible that down the line circumstances might change in unexpected ways as evercore isi economist ernie tedeschi put it to me the fact that rising deficits seem to be having almost no impact on the u s economy seems to be a perfect storm of several extraordinary factors we re the world s reserve currency there s massive demand to buy our debt from countries like china and japan other advanced countries like germany aren t borrowing enough to meet the world s appetite for safe assets and issues like demographics seem to be weighing on interest rates those factors aren t likely to all change overnight he said but some might gradually change given that there s always a chance no matter how small that debt could be a problem in the future you have to weigh that danger versus the value of what you re borrowing for and in the case of the trump tax cuts much of the result was pretty worthless if not outright harmful given that it handed even more power and resources to the very rich if passing a tax cut for real estate guys car dealership owners and walmart shareholders raised our chances of a fiscal disaster in 20 years by even 01 percent i d argue it was a bad deal advertisement advertisement advertisement advertisement finally there s the inevitability that as soon as a democrat becomes president again republicans will almost certainly rediscover their old time faith in fiscal prudence and start shrieking about how the u s is on the road to becoming argentina or zimbabwe given what we saw in the 2010s when you regularly saw headlines like is the u s like greece there s a good chance much of the media might just go along with them too this isn t to say there haven t been some advantages to trump s deficit binge it has helped the economy though he s undone much of the positive effects with his trade war by cutting taxes on corporations and the rich now he may have made it easier for a democrat to fund much of their next domestic program just by raising rates back up to where they were previously but the actions that got us here were also pointless hypocritical and counterproductive in other words classic trump

good afternoon everybody i will start off on slide four called delivering long term shareholder value creation 2019 was a great year for mondelez international it was the first full year under our new consumer centric growth strategy and we delivered strong results on the top and the bottom line while generating significant free cash flow our solid execution and targeted investments in both our global and local brands enabled us to meet or exceed all of our financial targets for the year these results give us increasing conviction that our strategy will create sustained momentum in our business allowing us to deliver on our long term financial targets in the years to come switching to slide five recapping the year here are a few highlights we delivered organic net revenue growth of 4 1 which was broad based across geographies and brands and was driven by both volume and pricing in terms of geographies emerging market growth was strong growing mid single digit ex argentina and driven primarily by key geographies like china russia and india but also by emerging high growth markets in southeast asia developed markets showed robust growth with both europe and north america performing well delivering share gains and driving category growth overall the results reflect the quality of our brand portfolio with our unique combination of both global and local brands benefiting from increased and targeted investments throughout the year our adjusted eps growth was more than 8 for the year and we are pleased with our full year free cash flow generation of about 3 billion which was well ahead of our outlook switching to slide six our strategy is now well embedded in the business in the past 12 months we ve made great strides in implementing it across the different business units the roll out of the new strategy was reinforced by our new way of incentivizing our teams assuring that everybody is clear on what is important at its core we are constantly trying to be more consumer centric using our new and unique understanding of consumers around the world to develop a more effective and a more consistent approach to marketing and as a consequence growth in our global brands has accelerated further while our local brand growth is now very close to overall category growth we ve also invested in further growth in non grocery channels like discounters e commerce and convenience as well as in expanding our distribution in fast growing developing markets like china india and russia as it relates to innovation we are becoming more agile and faster trying many new ideas and in fact rolling out fewer initiatives but with bigger success we are cleared to that strategy only succeeds with outstanding execution and while we still have a long way to go i credit a big part of our results to better execution in our commercial as well as our supply chain operations north america supply chain in 2019 definitely showed significant improvement our european teams executed against the seasonal opportunity like easter and christmas better than in recent years and our teams in india and china reached the highest level of execution in store as well as in the plans however the opportunity to constantly improve our execution remains significant as our recent struggles with our supply chain in brazil would indicate as it relates to our operating costs while we are in the first place trying to leverage volume growth to a lower delivered cost per ton we still see significant opportunity to optimize many other cost areas while more and better marketing as well as strongly improved execution have driven our 2019 results a shift in mindset around the company also has had an important impact the most important part of this shift was driven by our local first approach basically empowering local business units to make the right choices for their consumers and their clients this empowerment has led to clearer accountability and faster decision making and was reinforced by focused incentives i am proud of how the teams have embraced this new culture and really believe that this model has great potential for the future while we are talking about culture i d also like to mention a change in the leadership of our latin american region we are announcing today that gustavo valle will join us as region president latin america effective february 1 gustavo comes from danone where he s held numerous positions around the globe in his last role he was leading the global dairy and plant based division earlier in his career he managed the argentine and brazilian business and brings with him significant experience in the volatile economies of latin america i look forward to working with gustavo again switching to slide seven while we are excited about our financial results and prospects in today s world any consumer business needs to have a strong social and environmental agenda as a financial agenda our own employees as well as our consumers demand it and customers investors and other stakeholders expect it so i m happy to say that in 2019 we have made great progress in embedding our purpose to empower people to snack right we announced a new sustainable snacking strategy with new goals and stronger commitments in cocoa our biggest commodity we are committing to sourcing the equivalent of 100 of the cocoa we need for our chocolate brands through our cocoa life program by 2025 today i m proud to share that we ve achieved 63 by the end of 2019 an increase from 43 in 2018 and with a clear road map for the remainder earlier this year we joined other major companies in renewing our commitment to the paris climate accord and have set our path toward further reduction in carbon emissions looking toward the consumer we re focused on making the packaging for all our products 100 recyclable by 2025 and by the end of 2019 we are already at 92 with some interesting trials under way to unlock the remaining 8 of that journey finally as it relates to the mindful enjoyment of our products we are committed to increasing our mix of portion control packs to 20 of our total revenues we are well under way with 15 already sold in such formats we know that our future growth and success as a company depends on ensuring people and planet thrive and we are committed to tracking and reporting on our progress and impact transparently along the way i look forward to sharing more with you in 2020 and with that i will hand it over to luca luca zaramella executive vice president chief financial officer thank you dirk and good afternoon on slide nine is our financial performance for both quarter four and full year we ended 2019 strongly continuing the momentum we have created since the beginning of our new strategic plan this is the case as it relates to organic top line growth that translated into earnings growth and free cash flow we believe these outcomes to be high quality revenue growth was broad based by region global and local brands and in terms of developed and emerging markets as a matter of fact 12 out of the 13 business units delivered growth in 2019 importantly there was a good balance of volume and pricing both of which are important volume allowing us to leverage the great infrastructure we have created with much work over the last few years and pricing to drive value this balance results in top line drove attractive profit dollar growth while enabling reinvestment in our brands in q4 and throughout 2019 we also made significant investments in areas like europe and amea to further support our brands and broader growth initiatives as well as in the biscuits category in north america and certain markets in latin america these investments were in line with our original plan and a bit higher in certain areas and delivered on expected returns and share gains turning to slide 10 overall we grew 4 1 in both q4 and in 2019 we delivered strong volume and pricing led growth in virtually all key emerging markets like china india southeast asia russia mexico and africa in aggregate emerging markets grew approximately 8 for both the year and the quarter excluding inflation driven growth in argentina emerging markets grew 6 for the year these results support our conviction that our emerging market footprint is a competitive advantage and the investments we have been making in 19 and previous years are paying off developed markets also delivered solid results for the year and quarter with revenue growth of approximately 2 driven by improved results out of both europe and north america with share gains in both regions as we said in previous calls particularly in europe these results were aided by a longer easter season and the milder summer than 2018 now let s review our profitability performance on slide 11 we increased gross profit by 4 for the full year and 4 4 in q4 this gross profit dollar increase enabled a step up in growth investments focused on working media and route to market capabilities we also drove solid to high dollar improvement with volume leverage pricing and cost savings partially offset by growth investments moving to regional performance on slide 12 for the full year europe executed very well for the year with 3 7 revenue growth these results include strong volume driven growth in developed markets such as the u k and germany which grew mid single digit as well as russia which posted double digit growth for the full year behind strong volumes and share gains we delivered consistent execution in chocolate and seasonals throughout the year and the strong execution resulted both in share gains particularly in our chocolate business and good category growth adjusted oi dollars grew by almost 6 in spite of significant investments in areas like a c eu shows the full potential of our model as we drove solid volume driven market growth gain share and deliver strong gross profit progression that allowed for a c step up amea grew 5 3 showing continued strength across much of the region india grew double digits behind another year of strong execution and investment we continue to help drive the chocolate market while making progress against our plans of building a larger biscuit platform china grew high single digits for the year driven by strength in both biscuits and gum and great execution in both e commerce as well as the off line channels southeast asia grew mid single digits with solid results in biscuits and chocolate amea increased operating income dollars by more than 9 due to leverage from top line growth this growth comes despite some significant investments in a c and route to market the limited oi growth in q4 is entirely due to additional investments in a c and those were enabled by continued strong gross profit growth that we saw throughout the whole year again our algorithm is working quite well in this region latin america grew 7 8 due primarily to inflation driven growth in argentina revenue increased 1 7 excluding argentina mexico grew mid single digits driven by strong execution and share growth across most categories in brazil we saw a slight decline in revenue driven primarily by a reduction of trade stocks in powder beverages partially offset by lapping the general trucker strike in 18 we are beginning to take actions in this category including the launch of new marketing communications and product formulations adjusted oi dollars in latin america declined by approximately 6 primarily due to volume losses in powder beverages in brazil along with some remaining supply chain costs from our planned transition we do not expect material planned transition costs to continue in 2020 for the quarter the significant growth in oi is due to lapping some one timers related to forex contracts settling last year and some legal cases while we are reassured by the solidity of the business in mexico and the western andean region and dealing well with the volatility of argentina we recognize there is more work to do in brazil and the focus of gustavo and team will be mostly on that finally north america grew 2 2 for the full year and more than 3 in q4 driven by improved volumes we closed the year well and deliver strong share results in biscuit with growth in a number of key brands including oreo ritz and belvita we continue to make investments in a c and we are seeing our brands respond favorably mainly when coupled with our excellent dsd execution the north american region grew high by more than 6 for the year due to leverage effective pricing and waste reduction with additional a c mostly in our biscuits brands north america had strong gross profit delivery throughout the year and q4 was no exception to that but again levels of a c stepped up in q4 turning to category highlights our three snacking categories continue to demonstrate attractive growth with total category growth of 3 6 for the year we did see a more normalized growth in our categories for q4 at 2 8 as some of the tailwinds that helped q2 and q3 a longer easter in q2 and a milder summer in both q2 and q3 subsided in the last part of the year however we remain encouraged by the health of our categories and believe they can continue to sustain growth of around 3 over the long term and this is what our long term algorithm is predicated upon there are a number of very significant areas where we helped drive the category growth in 2019 among those u s biscuit where we continued to execute better on marketing and execution at point of sales and where we drove both value and volume growth through dsd u k india and russia chocolate where our renewed marketing bundles on both global and local brands coupled with sales excellence drove substantial value for the category overall we held or gained share in 75 of our business in 19 which reflects the progress on our broader strategy of volume and share improvement overall our share were up for the year in aggregate ending several years of share losses and we ended the year on an improved trajectory by category our biscuits business grew 4 4 approximately 75 of our revenue grew or held share in this category including our u s china russia and india businesses in chocolate our business grow 5 8 approximately 85 of our revenue grew or held share including the u k australia and russia gum and candy revenue grew slightly about 35 of our revenue in this business gained or held share including strength in china and france gum and russia candy now turning to eps on slide 18 full year eps grew more than 8 this growth primarily reflected operating gains driven by strong revenue results income from jv equity stakes despite some tax headwinds in q4 and lower than expected interest expense driven by accelerated cash flow focused balance sheet management and favorable rate environment i ll now move on to our free cash flow results on slide 19 we delivered full year free cash flow of 3 billion which was above our outlook and the nearly 200 million improvement over last year due to strong income continued progress in our cash conversion cycle as well as lower cash restructuring and capex on page 20 we returned 3 billion to our shareholders for the full year this brings us to more than 24 billion in capital return since mondelez was found now let me provide some details around our outlook for 2020 at a high level we expect our own algorithm here for 2020 in terms of our financial outlook we expect organic net revenue growth of 3 plus this is predicated on our view of category growth of approximately 3 some share gains and revenue growth driven by both volume and pricing we expect adjusted eps in the high single digit range this outlook implies continued growth of gross profit dollars and volume leverage it also reflects another step up in investment levels primarily in a c and sales capabilities to continue to support sustainable and high quality growth as well as some cost savings to fund incremental investments with respect to free cash flow we are expecting approximately 3 billion recall this outlook includes additional cash tax impact resulting from the u s tax reform in this outlook we also expect our 2020 adjusted effective tax rate to be in the low to mid 20s and interest expense of approximately 380 million although we do not provide a quarterly outlook on the key metrics it is important to note that the following items in terms of phasing will impact 2020 both easter and chinese new year fall earlier this year when compared to 2019 in terms of year over year comparisons our commodity pipeline is relatively more unfavorable in the first part of the year versus the second part of the year especially in the first quarter and we have covered most of the key commodities for 2020 we also feel good about overall levels of pricing in the plan with that let s open the line for questions questions and answers operator so we ll take our first question from the line of andrew lazar with barclays andrew lazar barclays analyst just two for me first i d say obviously mondelez had a much stronger than initially planned 2019 especially on organic sales growth the company is looking for 3 plus in 2020 which is the long term algorithm as you said there s obviously a deceleration from the 4 plus you showed in 2019 i was hoping you could talk a bit to this in terms of where or whether you re building in some conservatism there or if there s really something more specific behind it whether it s as you said lapping a longer easter and a hotter summer and things of that nature and then i ve got a follow up dirk van de put chairman and chief executive officer okay yes i think 19 was a good year for us we ve just went through the numbers not only because of the numbers but i think also that it was sort of the first confirmation that our strategy is working this was the first year full year with the new strategy for us we saw a number of signs that we think will continue next year like the volume growth like solid gross profit and oi dollar growth market share gains continued cost discipline it was as you alluded helped by a later easter season which gives us more time in store and also that we lapped the very hot summer of 2018 in europe in 19 so we can see now the markets in the last quarter or the categories were more at 2 8 not around the 4 that they were in the middle of the year i think the unlock that we have we will continue to work those put the consumer first keep on focusing on our execution and keep on increasing our investments and keep on improving our marketing activating our local brands so all that will continue next year and also what we have done as it relates to responsibilities and goals and better alignment of our incentives we re making a few more tweaks this year and we have a number of issues that we need to solve in the first place brazil supply chain which is going better but also we have to pay attention to china for instance so all that for us we are saying the markets or the categories we think will be around 3 we see ourselves increasing our market share and so we call it a 3 plus in line with our long term algorithm and in the beginning of the year we are always very thoughtful as we set our targets and we ll see how the first quarter goes but at this stage we feel that it s certainly not in our book a slowdown from this year we continue as we are but we do believe that the categories will be a little bit less than they were last year because of the reasons that i said i think apart from the two watchouts that i mentioned we see nothing at this stage that would particularly preoccupy us for the start of the year so overall i would say for us it s continue the strategy as we are yes the numbers are a little bit less than they were in 19 but that was largely driven by the structure of how things came about in 19 and 20 is a continuation of where we are operator our next question is from bryan spillane with boa bryan spillane boa analyst so i guess i wanted to pick up just on the expectation for incremental investment for 2020 so maybe just a couple of points around that first if you can kind of maybe size what the incremental investment in 20 would be relative to what it was in 2019 and then i guess as we re thinking about the sources of that would we would it sort of suggest that you d have gross profit dollar growth growing faster than operating profit growth because there s going to be some incremental investment in a c or am i not thinking about that correctly dirk van de put chairman and chief executive officer no i think you re well it s you re thinking about it correctly but let me start from the start so in 19 our extra investment was about 150 million largely focused on more a c route to market as r d and we are going to be in the same ballpark in 2020 as extra investment in 19 we had planned that that extra investment would have an impact on earnings i don t know if you remember we said we would be sort of around mid single digit earnings but then during the year our sales came in better as expected we generated more gross profit and in the end we were ending the year on an 8 eps increase however we had brazil that affected us in a way and in fact our gross profit could have grown more and we would have hoped to invest more in 19 so in 20 the extra gross profit that we are adding is slightly higher than we did in 19 in dollars and we re flowing let s say 40 of that roughly into a c and in the other investment areas so it s similar to what it was last year but we don t have the negative effect of brazil and that s why we can continue with that algorithm and deliver high single digit eps growth bryan spillane boa analyst that s helpful and then just in terms of where geographically the spend is going to be could you just maybe give us a little bit of color on kind of maybe where you emphasized the extra spend in 19 and kind of where the incremental piece is going in 20 and i ll leave it there dirk van de put chairman and chief executive officer yes it goes largely to first of all the two sources or the two destinations of the money is one in extra marketing media investment to be very specific it s all in media and the second part is in distribution expansion so the extra media investment is a little bit across the board in most countries it s different the level that we do that but the idea is to continue increasing our media pressure as it relates to the route to market that is more concentrated in the emerging markets the indias the chinas the russias where we still have a huge opportunity to increase our distribution i would also like to add that as it relates to those media investments not only are we increasing the overall spend on a c but within that a c we are shifting more into media so we re increasing our working media spend largely through digital and then also we constantly are trying to increase our roi which increased about 12 in 19 on our media spend so and on top of that we have restructured our agency so we also think that our nonmedia spend will have higher efficiency and higher quality so all that together we have the effect of the higher investment but also that reshifting which has a pretty big effect on our media pressure so that s a little bit how it all comes together operator we ll take our next question from dara mohsenian with morgan stanley dara mohsenian morgan stanley analyst obviously some pretty strong results in terms of organic sales growth in 2019 but within that we saw a really solid acceleration in volume growth so i d love to hear a bit of a state of the union now that the full year results are in on what drove that in your mind how sustainable that volume pickup is going forward you mentioned both volume mix and pricing will be up next year is one a bigger driver of that organic sales growth than the other and then secondly on brazil have the supply chain issues are those now been resolved and they re behind you and maybe just give us a little more of an update on how you re managing the powdered beverage business and if we should expect sequential improvement in the first half of the year versus the back half of last year if those strategies take longer to play out luca zaramella executive vice president chief financial officer okay i ll start and maybe dirk would cover a little bit brazil so as to volume clearly we like what we are seeing we like that the top line growth is coming mostly through a good balance of both volume and pricing we believe that balance is quite important because it allows us to create value in the marketplace but at the same time to have the leverage that we need for our algorithm to really fully work it is pretty much across the board maybe looking at the numbers you might say it is a little bit less in emerging markets but when you strip out argentina you really see a good balance of volume and pricing even in emerging markets we keep on investing on our franchises in route to market in quality of our brands and so we expect that to continue and we will always try to strike the right balance between pricing and volume so i don t think q4 was a material exception to the rest of the year i think the only one that came back in terms of volume growth in the second part of the year is north america that is executing quite well behind biscuits both in terms of marketing and i would say in terms of dsd execution so i think we will continue seeing that as we continue investing in our franchises in brazil quite frankly the supply chain issue is for the most part behind us but there is more work to be done and on pbs i don t know dirk if you want to comment a bit on specifically on what we re doing and how we see that progressing in 2020 dirk van de put chairman and chief executive officer yes yes so the pb market is starting to recuperate a little bit but still not that great and on top of that tang our brand which was the leading brand was having some share challenges so what and as a result of that we saw some destocking of pbs in the trade because there was less demand for it so what we re doing is we are launching a new bundle on tang going a little bit back to what tang was in the past we had probably drifted a little bit too much into new variety new flavor and so on and more bringing it back to how tang can really play a role in the daily beverage choice of kids in the family and how it contributes to that we re increasing our investments we re launching a new campaign we re launching of course a number of new flavors but overall it s a bit too early to say what s going to happen we re in the middle of the season of brazil at the moment but that s what we re doing on powdered beverages luca zaramella executive vice president chief financial officer in terms of comparison there the second part of the year will be easier in terms of top line because we started the destocking of pbs in the second part so i think that may be the way you have to think about how it will phase out throughout the year operator our next question is from john baumgartner with wells fargo john baumgartner wells fargo analyst dirk i wanted to dig a little bit into the local brands and i guess first off can you maybe ballpark what percentage of the revenue base there that s already been activated with the increased investments and of the brands that have not been activated how are you thinking about the phasing of the investment uptick between 2020 and to be 2021 at this point dirk van de put chairman and chief executive officer yes so the local brands i would roughly say about 45 of our portfolio is global brands about 45 is local brands that we want to activate and then about 10 is brands that we do not want to activate and largely run them for cash of those local brands those 45 most of them have been activated i wouldn t say yet with optimal media spend yet so that s where we want to increase it but the ones that we have been able to increase media and reposition them and give them sort of a new purpose that has worked really well for us so one of the most striking examples would be jubilee in russia which is a legacy biscuit brand which was kind of dormant we ve revamped it and it s now showing double digit growth and strong market share increase and we see that with a number of brands lu in europe we see that with a number of brands around the world so i wouldn t say that within that 45 that part was not activated and another part was activated no but overall the local brands are growing 3 2 versus the global brands but the local brands are now getting very close to category growth and we really want them to be in line with category growth and the global brands clearly need to be above that that s the way we think about it john baumgartner wells fargo analyst okay and then just a follow up on that where you had increased the investment in those local brands i m curious how your competitors are responding are you seeing them generally staying rational in terms of pricing and kind of following your lead doubling down on marketing and innovation of their own just what are the observations there so far in terms of the competitive dynamics dirk van de put chairman and chief executive officer well we try to avoid to run price promotions and so on on the local brands so the reaction there has been i mean i wouldn t say we are really in a price war as i think about it around the world yes as we move some of these local brands and sometimes we move them more into the sustainability direction and things like that yes there is a reaction of competition trying to do the same but i think overall that s very good for the category because that will help the consumer increase its interest in our category so we re not against it i think it s a good movement overall operator we ll take our next question from chris growe with stifel chris growe stifel analyst i just had a question if i could ask first and i don t think you ve addressed it yet but just i m curious what rate of inflation do you expect for this year and then related to that you talked about some pricing you have some cost savings coming through is it pricing that mostly offsets cost inflation for the year or will you need some maybe your simplified growth savings offsets some of that as well luca zaramella executive vice president chief financial officer so i think when you look at the last couple of years we have seen quite a bit of inflation pressure mostly around i would say transportation costs labor costs and i would add forex to that clearly with the dollar strengthening there was a big inflation component attached to that commodities were a little bit more favorable than the last five years over the last couple of years i would say as we move forward we see a little bit of more normal inflation pressure around labor and clearly there are differences around the world there are economies like india where labor inflation is quite high but overall for the company it is a little bit lower in that area but clearly we see a little bit more of a commodity driven inflation particularly around cocoa dairy is another one and packaging costs as well so all in all we expect commodities forex and inflation to be in 2020 in the ballpark of what we have seen in 19 and so we expect obviously to price that away in the short term i think we do as a company a good job in putting in place good coverage strategies and so we are never hand to mouth in terms of some of these commodities or even some packaging inflation can be covered well through various instruments and so in the short term we will always try to strike the best balance between our volume our pricing and our inflation in the long term or in the medium term we really want to price it away i can t give you the exact number in terms of pricing we don t guide to a breakdown between what we say in terms of revenue and volume and pricing but i think it is fair to say i don t see dynamics changing dramatically into 2020 what we do in terms of productivity and cost savings initiatives reality is what we would like to do is for that money to be half reinvested back into the business and fund a c and route to market investments and the rest to be dropped to the bottom line so that s the way we think we see productivity and cost saving initiatives to be the real upside to margin and steppeup investments chris growe stifel analyst okay i had just one other quick question which would be and i think this gets classified under the route to market investments but you ve had expansion of distribution in some of the faster growth channels you talked about the u s the club stores and discount stores i think that s also occurring in the emerging markets i m just curious is that an incremental investment level for you is that costing more is that part of your investment in 2020 as well and should we see that be a contributor to revenue growth dirk van de put chairman and chief executive officer yes we are if i would summarize what we did in 19 which we are largely repeating in 20 maybe even increasing a little bit in the developed markets that would be particularly around seasonals that we try to have better and stronger in store presence and then also going into the what we call the alternative growth channels in the u s that would be convenience for instance and put a bit more manpower a bit more investment in there in the emerging markets it largely has to see with physical distribution opening more distribution centers having more trucks on the road putting more coolers in the stores in india but also in china for instance it means going into third tier cities setting up sales teams there and starting to cover these cities so for instance in china we ve added about 140 000 new stores this year and we are planning to continue that into 2020 so it does help our revenue clearly i mean we re seeing well above category growth in china and we are seeing very strong double digit growth in india and we are counting that our distribution expansion is helping us and at the same time in the developed markets we want to continue that shift into more seasonals and more alternative growth channels which also will help our revenue growth operator we ll take our next question from steve strycula with ubs steve strycula ubs analyst so dirk a quick question for you to kick off as you think about the outlook for 2020 and your guidance for 3 plus growth how should we think about how you evaluated macro considerations whether it be what s kind of unfolding in front of us in china right now or even with some of the other multinational companies have cited with macro softness in select countries across south america i know that you called out discrete issues for the powdered beverage category but i d love to hear your view on those two macro situations and i have a quick follow up for luca dirk van de put chairman and chief executive officer okay so if i start with maybe the developed markets if we see a little bit of a pullback in developed markets which we don t see at the moment to be honest we see some very vibrant growth in europe and in the u s so it s clearly not visible for us but i would say our snacking categories are a little bit more resilient if there would be a pullback in the economy than other fmcg categories trade tensions between the u s and others are really not currently impacting us brexit i would say is a risk although i don t see it in 2020 but if there would be no deal near the end of the year that would be possibly a disruptor but i assume at this stage that they will find a deal and that it will be a relatively smooth transition in the emerging markets and i know that some of our colleagues are seeing different impacts there we are not feeling an impact in india or in china but we would probably be a bit more cautious around projections for latin america obviously we have high inflationary environment in argentina which we are largely managing to protect our scale and our absolute profit generation as well as our cash flow in the country and we do know and we see it of course that there is more volatility in emerging markets but we feel that the growth opportunities far outweigh the risks of that you have to also take into account that snacking behaviors and snacking demand is still growing very fast in these markets and there s still a lot of runway there and then i would overall say that our categories are showing an acceleration into 2019 we re forecasting them at 3 which is our long term expectation for our categories we don t see that at the moment as being a risk because we believe that there is still a lot of opportunity for consumers to keep on snacking more and for instance our study we recently did about the state of snacking clearly showed that the behavior is on the uptick so overall i would say we cannot confirm some of the other impressions that you ve heard from some of your colleagues we feel pretty good about what we re seeing around the world steve strycula ubs analyst very helpful and then a quick question for luca did i miss in your prepared remarks for fiscal 20 guidance what the ebit dollar outlook would be on a constant currency basis to kind of get to the algorithm you re on eps luca zaramella executive vice president chief financial officer look we purposely didn t go there necessarily we gave you enough elements i think we have commented a bit on what type of gross profit growth this is for the year obviously we expect gross profit to be the source of funding for a c and route to market the long term algorithm implies strong mid single digit or high growth and again i think in 2020 if you do the math we should be around about there we believe in the end the way we are running the business which is we want to have volume growth we want to have share gains amplifying a category growth that is projected and exiting the year last year it was 2 8 so around about 3 i think that gives us together with cost savings and investments in the business the ability for us by not even counting much on below the oi or the ebit line items gives us the ability to achieve the high single digit eps that is part of the guidance we gave for 2020 and importantly the 3 billion plus of free cash flow that is our long term guidance for cash dirk van de put chairman and chief executive officer steve just before we switch to the next question did your question also consider the coronavirus in china was that because i largely talked about the economies that we see around the world but maybe it s also good that i comment a little bit on china and the coronavirus situation for us so quickly china is about 1 billion net revenue country for us so about 4 5 we had a very strong 2019 and it contributed to our growth we do believe there will be an impact on our q1 revenue but it s really too early to quantify for us at this point we are monitoring the situation closely and we ll update you if in case there is something that we need to report the outbreak has come during chinese new year which is a time of high consumption our sell in was in line with expectations it was quite good we now have to see in the coming weeks what has happened with the sell out during chinese new year the other thing that is happening is that normally today our factories we have four factories in china two of our factories are in a region where we normally would have started up our factories again the government the local government has asked to keep our factories closed for another 10 year sorry 10 days in order to not have too much of a risk with the infection and we also have voluntarily put some travel restrictions to our own people to travel less within china and also for our global people to travel less to china but overall i would like to point out that we do believe that this could have a short term impact but long term we continue to be very convinced for the outlook of the chinese market for us operator our next question is from jason english with goldman sachs jason english goldman sachs analyst two things for me first congrats on a solid year it s great to see the momentum particularly on your core business biscuits and chocolate performing quite nicely the gum and confection side though continues to languish on market share side can you touch on what if any plans you have to resuscitate that business so that s question one and then second question in the context of overall the business doing pretty solid with the portfolio you have can you also then touch on your strategic ambitions as we think about m a and some of the investments that you have out there the potential to monetize and the potential to reallocate some of those to build your portfolio in new areas just update us on your broader thought process on strategic direction dirk van de put chairman and chief executive officer okay well what i do is maybe i ll talk about gum and candy and then luca can talk a little bit about our m a and strategic investments so there is a clear distinction this year in 19 between gum and candy on gum what has changed or not changed is the fact that we re doing very well in emerging markets where we are gaining share in our gum business we have year to date very good revenue growth we gained share particularly in china which is our second biggest gum market in the world and in brazil we are gaining share it is clearly not the strongest category in those markets but it is positive growth for the category and positive share for us in emerging markets we continue to be challenged in developed markets largely in the u s europe is in a we re clearly seeing a better situation but it s the u s that continues to be very difficult for us the category is displaying now low growth but it s growing but we are still losing some share and we have some fundamental category challenges and we have some brand challenges i would say that on our major brand trident things are quite ok it s in the smaller brands which we are gradually i would say flush out of the system that s what is causing this continued share loss for us as it relates to candy i would say the reason why candy was not as vibrant this year was largely due to the u s market where we had a capacity issue that capacity issue is now solved and we expect a much better 2020 for our candy business in the u s i would say that as we look at the future plans for gum it s a difficult situation for us because gum is very profitable and gives us scale in key markets so it s not something that we can just sort of shift aside we are working on a number of initiatives to address that share decline first of all as i said strengthening our core brands like stride in china or trident in the u s improving quality changing the positioning improving the positioning we re doing an expansion into mints that of course doesn t solve our gum problem but that does reinforce the brand and we have very good results with that in for instance france with hollywood and then we have started to launch a number of new experiences new reasons to chew particularly in brazil and we are also seeing some very good traction on that so we have the first sort of test and learns as it relates to renew the initiatives on gum and we have to see how those pan out in 2020 so maybe luca you can talk about m a luca zaramella executive vice president chief financial officer yes maybe let s start with coffee and i will start by saying that the jvs are performing well and are very attractive at this point in time in terms of what we have always described as a financial investment and so there will be a point in time where we will exit those investments they are good investments they continue to perform quite strongly we had a good earnings growth related to them in 2019 and we are expecting solid earning throughout into 2020 the category itself continues to be attractive i think in the past we commented a bit into how much we would welcome an ipo of jde i think that would establish a public mark for that investment we believe that that eventually will improve our value overall as mondelez as it is a good asset and i think it will allow you guys to do a proper sum of the parts analysis for mondelez by way of a segue way for that i would say also that jde is truly a great company still quite a bit of untapped potential it s a compelling growth story as a company and it is a little bit more than roasted ground i think it is a company that has a big presence in premium segments through what we call instant coffee and on demand as well as a professional presence in terms of away from home and servicing other occasions than in home consumption so we feel quite good about those having said that the timing of the exit as we always said will depend upon how much potential we still see in those companies and an appropriate use of funds which potentially is a better m a and assets that we like in the snacking landscape globally we will remain disciplined in terms of m a and we have discussed that our preference at this point in time is on bolt ons we are looking at premium well being areas adjacencies and trying to fill some of the portfolio gaps we have both geographically and category wise in some places around the world so we believe that by staying disciplined we have we will have the ability to fill some of these gaps and step up even more our growth rate on the top line and on earnings as well operator we ll take our final question from ken zaslow with bank of montreal ken zaslow bank of montreal analyst i just have two quick questions one is on the investment at what point do they become self funding i know they ve had good returns but how do you think about the years in which it will just kind of be a virtuous cycle and the second question i have is in europe what has the utilization rates been in the facilities and where are they now and where they look to be because it seems like that part of the opportunity that you guys continue to leverage over time as you get more volume through it is operating leverage and i ll leave it at those two dirk van de put chairman and chief executive officer okay maybe i ll talk about the investments and then luca can talk about the operating leverage luca zaramella executive vice president chief financial officer yes dirk van de put chairman and chief executive officer so when the investments become self funding i think it s still a little bit of way for us we feel that we have potential to drive the categories around the world and we see good reaction good return on investment still and so as we are trying to develop a long term algorithm that is repeatable year after year at this stage it feels that the algorithm allows us to keep on adding more investment every year and hopefully that translates into stronger numbers and so i would say at a certain stage extra investments will not generate more growth and then we have to start questioning it but at this stage it s working really well for us luca zaramella executive vice president chief financial officer so it is self funding i mean for the algorithm to work and for us to be able to deliver upon the premise of share growth high single digit eps and 3 billion of cash flow that algorithm itself includes a level of investment which is factored in and it is allowing us to hit on all those numbers i think in the end the measure of success for us is whether we will be able to deliver share gains consistently and the second one is if we increase our volume consistently all of that came to fruition in 2019 dirk van de put chairman and chief executive officer and then the second part of the question i there was a little bit of a disturbance in the line could you repeat it maybe luca zaramella executive vice president chief financial officer i think i got it it was about ken zaslow bank of montreal analyst yes it s on the european side it seems like you keep on getting margin expansion your utilization basically the assets have been put together through acquisitions as you keep on getting leverage and do some restructuring a little bit it sounds like the utilization rate should continue to increase where have they been where are they and where are they going i guess is kind of what i m thinking luca zaramella executive vice president chief financial officer yes look i think in general terms we don t comment on capacity utilization but this i think that will be a bit of too much of a comment i would say look we have invested quite a bit in terms of both creating a more nimble and a more flexible organization both in overheads and infrastructure it s not only legacy sites we invested in brand new sites in europe and europe i remind you is a little bit more than continental europe or u k it is also russia in our case so i would characterize the old status of the facilities in europe quite good it can be further optimized but we still have available capacity in terms of continuing growing the big blockbuster brands that we have milka is one example cadbury oreo but also the local brands and i think that s what we are working on dirk van de put chairman and chief executive officer thank you well in conclusion i would say that 2019 was a major step forward for the company and it was the first full year of executing our new strategy we ve successfully launched and driven this more consumer centric approach to get growth across our organization and as a result we are building an effective local first culture that is delivering we had a good finish to the year with broad based revenue growth and strong earnings and cash flow and the momentum we ve created across our brands and our geographies this past year reinforces our confidence that we have in our strategy our people and our ability to execute there is certainly more work to do and a long way of opportunities is ahead of us but we believe that the early success combined with the attractive category dynamics and further targeted investments provides us greater confidence that we can deliver sustained long term growth and attractive total returns with that i would like to

check the statistics pakistan s economy is the 41st largest in the world its total size is usd 313 billion andusd 0 3 trillion in terms of gdp the fiscal year 2018 was the worst in the economic history of pakistan increased oil prices trade protectionism and regional rivalries affected many developed as well as developing economies however in pakistan the situation worsened due to insufficient foreign exchange reserves increased import bills deteriorating trade balance and stagnant remittances that had put the already fragile economy on the ventilators sinceimran khan became the prime minister he has been facing some serious economic conundrums and as a result he has failed to make the nation take off economically pakistan foreign debt has reached usd 106 9 billion to pay the circular debt and thefiscal deficit has widened to 8 9 percent of the gdp the deficit is pkr 3 445 trillion the trade deficit had also touched the unusual height of usd 31 8 billion and the foreign exchange reserves have plummeted to a deadly level pakistan was at the verge of default and therefore khan was left with no other option but to knock at the doors of imf the uae the ksa and china for financial help the energy crisis water scarcity over population terrorism and non traditional security threats are the prominent reasons that have poured oil into the already devastated economy plunging the nation intoa pit of insecurity repercussions of abysmal economic conditions can easily be seen in the form of increase in the inflation rate repercussions of abysmal economic conditions can easily be seen in the form of increase in the inflation rate according to the pakistan bureau of statistics inflation has reached 10 5 percent measured in consumer price index clouds of unemployment loom over the youth that comprises 60 percent of the total population it is the need of the hour and a gigantic responsibility on the shoulders of khan to bring pakistan s obsolete economy from the era of distress tostabilisation at this critical juncture some valuable steps can help keep the economy afloat firstly a friendly business environment is the cornerstone in the development of any economy the world bank has given positive signs of doing business in pakistan in 2019 pakistan was at 136th and now it has jumped to the 108th position it has also secured a slot among the top 10 nations with the most improved business climate but policymakers have to ensure the continuity of this trend and remove impediments that facilitate the flow of fdi secondly security is pre requisite for providing a safe economic ambiance there is no denying the impression that terrorism affected the nation economically and wreaked havoc lamentably it became the major cause of capital flying out to other countries fortunately pakistan has overcome this menace to a great extent and the credit goes to our brave law enforcement security forces that fought gallantly toend terrorism in a report of the pakistan institute for peace studies terrorist attacks in 2019 decreased by around 11 percent as compared to 2018 and the number of people killed in terror attacks reduced to 40 percent the risk is however still present to make pakistan the peaceful destiny for foreign investment thirdly the fiscal deficit had reached a new height and created economic backwardness government deserves applause for starting an austerity campaign throughout the country it is a positive sign but policymakers should chalk out some bold reforms such as cutting down the vip protocol budget that is five percent of the total gdp it is an irony for a country that spends less than two percent of its gdp on health fourthly pakistan possesses the great potential to become a tourism destination including religious tourism the kartarpurcorridor is agreat example eye catching snow capped mountains of the northern areas can be a huge tourist attraction recently the un has listed pakistan among the top 10 tourist destinations of 2020 tourism can help harbinger an economic revolution in pakistan fifthly government must increase its tax collection base through a direct taxation system and strengthening of the fbr exports are the touchstone for today s modern economy government must design policies that facilitate exporters that will ultimately benefit the economy it is a well documented fact that pakistan s economy is on the ventilator and clouds of distress are hovering over it by taking into account however the above mentioned remedies the economy can be greatly reinvigorated the writer can be reached at jawadkamal076 gmail com

white house economic adviser larry kudlow shrugged off the economy s 2019 performance after the u s missed the trump administration s 3 growth target for a second straight year posting its slowest annual growth in three years in 2019 as the slump in business investment deepened amid damaging trade tensions the veteran financial guru and former ronald reagan adviser told fox business network it is a fundamentally healthy economy kudlow also expressed confidence that activity will accelerate this year a view not widely shared outside the administration the american economy is in a boom right now and with middle class wages rising blue collar wages rising income distribution is narrowing stock markets are roaring household net wealth is soaring the 2 3 expansion last year reported by the commerce department on thursday suggested the white house and republicans massive 1 5 trillion tax cut package which president donald trump had predicted would lift growth above 3 had provided the economy only a temporary boost moderate growth undercuts the argument by trump and his fellow republicans that strong growth would pay for the tax cuts which are expected to help push the federal budget deficit to 1 02 trillion this year growth last year was the slowest since 2016 and followed the 2 9 notched in 2018 while thursday s snapshot of gross domestic product showed the economy maintaining a moderate pace of growth in the fourth quarter that was in part because of a smaller import bill which has since swelled as the year ended consumer spending cooled considerably last quarter and scope for a rebound looks limited as wage growth appears to have stalled but the longest expansion in history now in its 11th year probably remains on track and a recession is unlikely as the federal reserve s three interest rate cuts in 2019 kick in the fed kept rates unchanged on wednesday fed chair jerome powell told reporters the u s central bank expected moderate economic growth to continue but also nodded to some risks including the recent coronavirus outbreak in china the trump administration s 18 month long trade war with china last year fueled fears of a recession though the economic outlook has improved with this month s signing of a phase 1 deal with beijing economists do not see a boost to the economy as u s tariffs remained in effect on 360 billion of chinese imports about two thirds of the total gross domestic product increased at a 2 1 annualized rate in the fourth quarter matching the third quarter pace also as lower borrowing costs encouraged purchases of houses the government announced growth was also supported by increased government spending on defense that helped to offset the drag from a slower pace of inventory accumulation last quarter s rise in gdp growth was in line with economist s expectations economists estimate the speed at which the economy can grow over a long period without igniting inflation at around 1 8 excluding trade inventories and government spending the economy grew at a 1 4 rate in the fourth quarter the slowest in four years this measure of domestic demand rose at a 2 3 pace in the third quarter the economy had very few engines left at year end to keep flying high in 2020 said chris rupkey chief economist at mufg in new york the economy is in a good place only because the trade war made imports so expensive that american businesses and consumers cut back their purchases economists have long disagreed that slashing the corporate tax rate to 21 from 35 as well as shrinking the trade deficit would boost annual gdp growth to 3 0 on an sustainable basis because of low productivity and population growth they also argue that historically there has not been a very strong relationship between corporate tax rates and business investment some companies including apple used their tax windfall for share buybacks the dollar weakened against a basket of currencies while u s treasury prices rose stocks on wall street fell as the coronavirus epidemic heightened concerns about china s economy business investment slumping business investment fell at a 1 5 rate in the fourth quarter it was the third straight quarterly decline and the longest such stretch since 2009 there were decreases last quarter in spending on nonresidential structures such as mining exploration shafts and wells and industrial equipment spending on nonresidential structures contracted in 2019 by the most since 2016 trade tensions have eroded business confidence and weighed on capital expenditure with confidence among chief executive officers remaining low in the fourth quarter after dropping to a 10 year low in the prior quarter a rebound is unlikely soon business investment is also seen pressured by boeing s suspension this month of the production of its troubled 737 max jetliner which was grounded last march following two fatal crashes boeing on wednesday reported its first annual loss since 1997 economists estimate boeing s biggest assembly line halt in more than 20 years could slice at least half a percentage point from first quarter gdp growth growth in consumer spending which accounts for more than two thirds of u s economic activity slowed to a 1 8 pace after rising at a brisk 3 2 rate in the third quarter there was a reduction in spending at restaurants and bars though a separate report from the labor department on thursday showed the number of americans filing claims for state unemployment benefits fell last week the tight labor market is not generating a faster pace of wage growth in the fourth quarter personal income at the disposal of households after adjusting for inflation rose at a 1 5 rate stepping down from a 2 9 pace in the third quarter the decrease in imports in the fourth quarter in part because of u s tariffs on chinese goods compressed the trade deficit that led to trade adding 1 48 percentage points to fourth quarter gdp growth the most since 2009 when trade adds more to growth than consumption you know things are out of whack said joel naroff chief economist at naroff economic advisors in holland pennsylvania last quarter s decline in imports resulted in businesses almost depleting inventories in warehouses a 40 day strike at general motors also weighed on motor vehicle inventories inventories rose at a 6 5 billion rate in the fourth quarter the smallest gain since the second quarter of 2018 after increasing at a 69 4 billion pace in the july september quarter inventory investment chopped 1 09 percentage points from gdp growth last quarter the most since 2018

alejandro werner is director of the western hemisphere department of the international monetary fund imf washington dc jan 30 2020 ips economic activity in latin america and the caribbean stagnated in 2019 continuing with the weak growth momentum of the previous five years and adding more urgency and new challenges to reignite growth indeed real gdp per capita in the region has declined by 0 6 percent per year on average during 2014 2019 a sharp contrast from the commodity boom s average increase of two percent per year during 2000 2013 this weak momentum reflects structural and cyclical factors on the structural side potential growth remains constrained by low investment slow productivity growth a weak business climate and the low quality of infrastructure and education on the cyclical side growth has been held back by low global growth and commodity prices elevated economic policy uncertainty economic rebalancing in some economies and social unrest in others regional challenges elevated policy uncertainty in several large latin american countries continues to weigh on growth for example uncertainty about the course of economic policy and reforms in brazil and mexico likely contributed to the slowdown in real gdp and investment growth in 2019 continued economic rebalancing in stressed economies that experienced sudden stops in capital flows in 2018 19 argentina ecuador while helping restore internal and external balances have also acted as a drag on economic growth more recently a few countries in the region experienced social unrest bolivia colombia chile and ecuador which in some cases disrupted economic activity economic policy uncertainty has also risen in these countries as governments consider alternative policies and reforms to make growth more inclusive and address social demands outlook and risks as noted in the recent world economic outlook update growth in the region is projected to rebound to 1 6 percent in 2020 and 2 3 percent in 2021 supported by a gradual pick up in global growth and commodity prices continued monetary support reduced economic policy uncertainty and a gradual recovery in stressed economies however there are also prominent downside risks while previous external downside risks have moderated following globally synchronized monetary policy easing and the signing of the u s china phase one trade deal some new risks have appeared including the potential global spread of the coronavirus which could significantly disrupt global economic activity trade and travel domestic and regional downside risks have also intensified social unrest could spike throughout the region while economic policy uncertainty could rise further due to both heightened social tensions and policy slippages policy priorities economic policies will need to strike a balance between rebuilding policy space and maintaining economic stability on the one hand and supporting economic activity and strengthening the social safety net on the other hand although the causes and triggers of social unrest have varied across countries they generally reflect discontent with some aspects of the economic and political

disproportionally tackling corruption and weak governance will help make political systems more representative although deeper political reforms may be needed fiscal policy will need to support to growth expand the social safety net and improve the quality of public goods and services however in many countries spending room in the budget remains constrained by high deficits and public debt these countries will need to improve spending efficiency reallocate spending from nonpriority areas to public investment and social transfers and increase revenues over the medium term to finance additional increases in these areas monetary policy can remain accommodative to support growth given the stable inflation outlook well anchored inflation expectations and declining neutral rates worldwide south america in brazil growth remained subdued at 1 2 percent in 2019 but is projected to accelerate to 2 2 percent in 2020 due to improving confidence following the approval of the pension

public debt sustainability and boost potential growth in chile the outlook is subject to uncertainty resulting from social unrest and the evolving policy responses to the social demands following a sharp decline in late 2019 economic activity is expected to recover gradually supported by a significant fiscal expansion and looser monetary policy with growth reaching about 1 percent in 2020 in

monetary policy within the united states is in an awkward position ever since late august 2019 the federal reserve has been aggressively expanding its balance sheet by buying t bills in a sudden pivot even though the economy is over a decade into the longest expansion in u s history equity valuations are near historic highs and the official unemployment rate is near historic lows additionally according to wednesdayâ s uneventful fomc release that left almost everything unchanged the fed expects to continue repo operations through april and to continue buying t bills at least into the second quarter of the year specifically the fed continues to let mortgage backed securities slide off their balance sheet for continued normalization red line below but suddenly began accumulating t bills blue line below ever since last autumn chart source st louis fed the fed didnâ t telegraph ahead of time that they would start doing this at this scale nor have they given very detailed explanations as to why they are doing this it sure looks like a fourth round of quantitative easing or â qe â and yet fed chairman jerome powell specifically stated early on â in no sense is this qe â the fedâ s kaplan however referred to it as a â derivative of qeâ that may have an effect on risk assets and noted that it was similar to qe but on the short end of the curve economic advisor larry kudlow recently referred to it as to use his word â basicallyâ qe for the record here is how the bank of england defines qe on their website in case we want to hear what the brits would call it â money is either physical like banknotes or digital like the money in your bank account quantitative easing involves us creating digital money we then use it to buy things like government debt in the form of bonds you may also hear it called â qeâ or â asset purchaseâ â these are the same thing â but hey this is america weâ ll call it what we want if it looks like qe and acts like qe itâ sâ large scale organic balance sheet expansion thank you very much itâ s not specifically for t bonds itâ s for t bills itâ s not specifically for economic stimulus itâ s for financing the federal deficit and thus indirectly providing stimulus this whole process has naturally caused quite a bit of persistent confusion and debate why is it happening what do we call it why does everyone seem to have a different opinion about it so this article attempts to shed more light on it the u s treasury supply demand problem there are two key variables to be familiar with here in my view one is the strong dollar and the other is u s federal deficits after the third round of qe by the federal reserve ended in late 2014 the fedâ s monetary policy consequently became the tightest among developed markets and the u s dollar became very strong chart source st louis fed this puts a lot of pressure on global markets because many governments and companies in foreign countries borrow in dollars but earn revenue in local currencies a stronger dollar makes it harder for them to service their debts while a weaker dollar is like a partial debt jubilee historically when the dollar is strong foreigners buy fewer treasuries specifically emerging market central banks build foreign exchange reserves filled with treasuries during weaker dollar periods so that they are prepared to defend their currencies and support their external dollar denominated liabilities in strong dollar periods like this separately the u s government currently has record federal deficits in most modern u s history the government has run larger deficits during periods of high unemployment roughly corresponding to recessions and their aftermath and lower deficits during periods of low unemployment and solid economic growth but has built up a larger and larger debt as a percentage of gdp throughout these cycles as many governments have however this pattern changed within the past few years as the federal u s deficit began expanding dramatically as a percentage of gdp even during a period of low official unemployment chart source goldman sachs retrieved from cnbc that change in the pattern is to use dangerous words what is â different this time â there are a few causes of this and itâ s not necessarily a partisan issue a primary cause is that demographic driven entitlement spending has become increasingly top heavy which was not well planned for in advance another cause is that the u s has one of the largest military expenditures as a percentage of gdp among developed countries which is not new but when combined with the demographics issue doesnâ t provide much spending flexibility compared to some other nations a third cause that acted as an accelerator is the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 which significantly cut federal tax revenue especially from corporations without a corresponding government spending cut so regardless of how we got here and whether itâ s good or bad this is where we are at fiscal conservatives might hate it advocates of modern monetary theory might like it but i just want to focus on the math the federal government is growing its debt by about 5 of gdp per year 1 2 trillion over the past four quarters during a market expansion even though foreigners havenâ t been buying much of that debt yes there is a yield differential for u s treasuries over other developed sovereign bonds but only daring investors that are willing to take on risk by buying without currency hedges can exploit that difference at todayâ s levels so private domestic balance sheets including mutual funds pensions insurance companies banks and corporations have had to absorb virtually all of this new debt this caused a huge build up of treasuries on these various balance sheets and drained dollar liquidity out of the system ever since the big spike in overnight lending rates in mid september the shortage of cash for short term lending between institutions has been acute and thatâ s when the fed stepped in to provide liquidity in fact after being stuffed full of cash at the end of qe3 in late 2014 large u s banks drew down their cash levels for years and hit the lowest post crisis cash levels as a percentage of total assets blue line below and record high treasury and agency securities as a percentage of total assets red line during the specific week of the overnight lending rate spike in mid september chart source st louis fed cash levels have since bounced back up off that roughly 7 lower bound once the fed stepped in to start taking the excess t bills in exchange for cash without the fed stepping into buy t bills banks were clearly having problems as the middlemen when it came to re selling them to the broader market itâ s not as though banks converted their cash into record levels of t bills for extra yield either way itâ s about the same yield for them chart source st louis fed as primary dealers they basically had to buy the supply of t bills but then there was no place to put all of them even as more came in the u s treasury compiles information on its creditors with a bit of a lag such as here and here we can walk through the sources of treasury demand foreigners didnâ t buy almost any u s treasuries on net from late 2014 through 2018 during the strong dollar period even though about 3 trillion in new u s debt was issued during that time then they started buying again in early mid 2019 during that big global bond bull run but their holdings peaked in august 2019 and dipped thereafter weeks prior to the spike in overnight lending rates so they seemingly havenâ t been significant t bill buyers since late summer 2019 u s corporations think the top 10 cash hoarding companies in the s p 500 in particular built up big cash and cash equivalent levels in 2018 during the post tax cut year of foreign cash repatriation and held a lot of it in t bills as a placeholder but quickly drained that excess cash throughout 2019 for ongoing stock buybacks so was another lost net t bill buyer insurance companies and pensions are slow growing or in drawdown mode in some cases so theyâ re not big buyers on net banks as previously shown hit post crisis regulatory lower limits on cash levels and had already bought as much treasuries as they could and couldnâ t fit any more onto their balance sheets so that was another buyer lost with all of this unrelenting supply of u s treasuries and lackluster demand for them the fed has become the primary buyer of treasuries since q4 2019 according to analysis by daniel amerman the fed has bought or financed about 90 of all new u s debt during this period both by buying them directly and by lending money to other institutions that are buying them when will it stop at first the overnight lending rate spike was publicized as a brief technical issue related to quarterly tax payments and the u s treasury re stocking its cash balance after the summer of 2019â s debt ceiling close call in other words â nothing to see here move along â then when it continued for months thereafter the media focus shifted to the year end of 2019 there is often a crash crunch during the year changeover so there was a lot of attention on whether there would be a â crashâ around year end due to a liquidity squeeze that never happened now as we continue to push forward into 2020 and the t bill buying continues at a rate that rivals previous rates of qe the question persists for how long will this occur will it really end in q2 by breaking the situation down into its constitution parts the math appears such that as long as u s fiscal deficits remain large and the dollar remains strong there is a high probability that the fed will continue to be a primary buyer of treasuries there may be a month or a quarter here and there where they donâ t have to buy due to a temporary resumption in foreign demand but under these conditions for the foreseeable future the fed will be buying more often than not if you add a u s recession into the mix at some point with lower tax revenues and increased stimulus spending itâ ll likely accelerate it if the dollar weakens significantly it could allow foreign buyers to pick up the pace of buying again which could alleviate the fed for a while risk off events such as the wuhan coronavirus or other examples can also cause temporary higher treasury demand that may relieve the fed for a time but as the market fully digests the math here about what u s deficits are going to look like for the next several years participants will likely realize that the fed will be a major buyer either continuously or off and on for quite a long time distracting variables related but not primary among the collection of different explanations for why this is version of qe is happening and where itâ s going there are two explanations in particular worth highlighting none of these are necessarily â wrongâ instead they address non causal exacerbating or symptomatic aspects of it rather than the core issue based on available evidence distraction 1 itâ s due to bank over regulation one of the arguments for why dollar liquidity is so tight in overnight lending markets leading to the september 2019 spike in overnight lending markets and causing the fed to have to step in is that banks have been over regulated ever since the aftermath of the financial crisis banks need to hold far more reserves liquidity than they used to which means they have less flexibility for lending when there is an acute liquidity issue while this is correct it isnâ t the root cause itâ s just the timing catalyst as previously mentioned ever since qe3 ended five years ago large banks as primary dealers have been buying treasuries and drawing down their extra cash levels when cash levels got down to 7 8 of total assets they couldnâ t keep drawing down cash anymore to continue buying treasuries think of that level as â financial bedrockâ as far as bank liquidity regulations are concerned roughly speaking here is that key chart again technically if bank regulations were loosened so that banks could go down to say 5 cash levels or 3 cash levels again is that really a good idea then sure they could buy some more treasuries however this would only be a temporary fix within several more months of continued treasury accumulation and cash drawdown we would be in the same predicament again with banks unable to continue buying into the unrelenting supply of treasuries therefore liquidity requirements are just the line in the sand for where this became an acute problem and suddenly required fed intervention itâ s not the cause of the problem itâ s just the reason why the overnight lending rate spiked high in september 2019 and required fed intervention since then rather than may 2020 or another arbitrary month down the line the primary causes are the gaping upward supply of treasuries the weak foreign buying of them due to a strong dollar and the fact that private domestic balance sheets including banks pensions insurance companies corporations and investors can only hold so much now some people have argued that the fed could do even more to ensure banks keep buying treasuries they could ban large bank dividends and buybacks forcing banks to hoard capital to buy treasuries and keep accumulating and accumulating and accumulating however these banks the primary dealers are not meant to be huge accumulators of treasuries they are meant to be middlemen making a liquid market for treasuries and passing them along to final sources of demand and holding a little bit themselves large banks already hold an all time record amount of treasuries as a percentage of their total assets theyâ ve done more than their fair share for this particular issue itâ s the excessive supply and lack of demand down the line that are the two main culprits rather than something the middlemen are doing wrong to phrase it differently there surely are plenty of things that big banks are doing wrong but this likely isnâ t one of them itâ s out of their hands distraction 2 itâ s a hedge fund or bank collapse somewhere another popular argument is that the fed is doing all of this to bail out a troubled hedge fund or foreign bank somewhere or possibly even that a large u s bank has solvency issues according to this line of thought banks are afraid to lend to each other again just like in 2008 and thatâ s why overnight lending rates have spiked higher once again i wouldnâ t say this is technically incorrect there certainly could be a troubled hedge fund or institution somewhere but even if that is the case it wouldnâ t be the root cause it would be a side effect of the fact that dollar liquidity has been drained out of the system and stuffed into excessive amounts of t bills a troubled hedge fund or bank in late 2019 would not have caused the cash levels of large u s banks to draw down over the past five years from 2014 to 2019 into regulatory lower limits and for banks to become over stuffed on treasuries during that time frame nor would it have caused china the biggest buyer of u s treasuries for years to stop increasing their treasury holdings five years ago one can walk through the logic if there is plenty of demand for treasuries as some argue there is why canâ t a potentially troubled fund or institution just sell any treasuries it may have on the open market and raise cash why does the fed need to be the persistent buyer of them the answer clearly seems to be that isnâ t sufficient demand for treasuries compared to the large supply especially of t bills which is why the fed is now the primary buyer if the fed were buying toxic assets in exchange for cash which they are not doing at least publicly based on available information then we could rightly conclude that this is all about an emergency bailout however the fed is buying t bills which are widely considered the safest asset in the financial system the only reason the fed is forced into a position of having to do that is because there are too many t bills on the market and not enough real private or foreign demand for them at current levels not many sources have the dollars to buy them that lack of liquidity would of course cause problems for hedge funds and or other institutions that are reliant on well functioning overnight lending markets however those hedge fund and or institutional problems would not be causal they would be symptomatic and if they are causal to any degree it would likely be about timing a contributing factor to â why now â rather than a few months down the line if a large and leveraged hedge fund holds a lot of treasuries for example and investors draw their cash out forcing the fund to unwind part of its position that would represent yet another source of demand destruction for treasuries summary evidence shows that the federal reserve started rapidly buying t bills primarily due to a t bill supply demand problem there is a very large and growing supply of treasuries especially t bills with no end in sight at the same time foreign demand has been lackluster for years in this strong dollar environment and private domestic balance sheets already absorbed as much as they could over the past five years there are too many t bills and too few dollars to buy them bank regulations are a timing catalyst and various funds or institutions would of course have issues if they couldnâ t tap into well functioning overnight lending markets but neither of these can be the root cause of the problem one thing to keep in mind is that u s dollars and u s treasuries are very different things there is insufficient demand for treasuries but plenty of demand for dollars in particular many foreign sources require dollars in order to service their large dollar denominated debts over the past several years the excessive supply of treasury issuance which has to be bought with dollars has soaked up a lot of the existing dollar liquidity from the domestic and global system like a sponge in water leaving everything dry and without enough dollar liquidity left this shortage became acute domestically in september leading to the spike in overnight lending rates causing the fed to step up and begin injecting tens of billions of dollars per month into the system by creating digital dollars roughly speaking and using them to buy treasuries for years there has been a growing supply of treasuries while dollars have been increasingly tight however now that cash levels have hit bedrock along with this fed pivot the next several years should see both an increase in treasuries as well as an increase in the dollars required to buy them

such as adjusted ebitda adjusted working capital and net debt may be discussed on this call i will now turn the call over to al carey al carey executive chairman thanks a j and thank you all for joining us today i m pleased to report that the final determinations for anti dumping and countervailing duties were finally reached in december and as expected associated duties are being assessed on imports of polyester textured yarn from both china and india and as you ve heard us discuss in the past subsidized imported yarns have flooded our domestic markets in recent years so we welcome these announcements as they are critical steps in advancing our efforts to compete on a leveled playing field we ve already seen a pickup in demand on these specific product line as we entered the third quarter and we are excited about the opportunities we have in our local markets to regain market share and to grow our top line especially as we enter fiscal 2021 during the second quarter we are able to achieve solid sales performance and profitability gains across most of our operations with the exception of the nylon segment and our parkdale joint venture q2 showed sequential improvement in our trends as we turn around our business at unifi however the recovery is a bit uneven and we still have work to do price realization and nylon business need work and we re taking actions to improve our overall performance we re pleased to see sg a costs decrease on a year over year basis and the team also maintains significant cash flow improvement this performance validates our strategy of focusing on our core competencies revitalizing the americas and also aligning our cost structure we re very encouraged with the trends on sales volume cash generation cost control and our asian business right now additionally there is broad momentum at the customer and also at the consumer level for environmental sustainability which bodes well for free we re disappointed in the nylon business and it was much lower than we had anticipated and tom is going to walk you through some more of those details but we remain committed to this segment as our customers continue to see unifi as a full service textile provider and nylon plays a critical role in our go forward innovation efforts we re going to continue to develop programs that leverage all of our assets and deliver the highest performance for our customers and we remain well positioned to drive further year over year growth in the second half and we re encouraged with the overall business momentum i m going to turn the call over to tom right now for a high level discussion of our company s performance during the second quarter tom tom caudle president and chief operating officer thank you al and good morning everyone our second quarter results came in mostly as expected with overall sales operating income and adjusted ebitda improving on a year over year basis we also had some meaningful accomplishments this quarter with the repreve products continuing to lead our sales growth additionally cash flow generation through that first half was meaningfully higher year over year continuing the positive momentum we had in the first quarter as our cost structure continues to improve as al also mentioned we finished the quarter with positive news from the u s international trade commission finalizing anti dumping and countervailing duty rates these duty rates are generally consistent with the preliminary rates whereas imports from china are assessed 97 on higher duties on top of the existing import duties and imports from india at rates of 18 and higher this represents the culmination of a significant time and resource commitment from unifi and it is important to note that we spent approximately 2 million in outside counsel fee over the 15 month process while costs were significant we believe this was necessary for unifi to be able to compete appropriately in the u s market for polyester textured yarn we have already begun to see an initial uptick in orders and believe that we have the ability to recapture a minimum of 20 million in sales on an annualized basis as we enter fiscal 2021 that said recapturing the lost business will take time to ramp up and thus for the second half of fiscal 2020 we ve factored in only 5 million with our continued focus on a fair competitive environment we are closely monitoring whether polyester textured yarn from china or india is being shipped through third party countries and then entering the u s market additionally on the regulation front i think that it s important to note that in mid january the phase 1 china deal was signed by the president at this point the white house has decided to maintain early section 301 tariffs at 25 including those on chinese fiber yarns and textile inputs textile machinery and parts are also included in this category for the time being we do not anticipate the phase 1 deal to generate changes that have any significant impact to unifi now turning to second quarter results while our results were very favorable on a year over year comparison global pricing pressures along with lower than anticipated demand in certain u s products caused results to come in just below our expectations for the quarter total sales volumes increased 18 on a year over year basis during the second quarter a result of strong sales from free branded products primarily in asia while the volume increase was meaningful we saw a less favorable sales mix and lower average selling prices especially due to lower nylon volumes and while the margin pressure we experienced in the international business was driven by our sales mix and pricing pressure amid raw material cost fluctuations our portfolio continues to drive momentum in asia a testament to the level of quality and desirability that our repreve platform offers as i said before the current business environment in the americas remains challenging and evolving but we are confident that we have the ability to recapture market share in the u s with the new duties in place and hope to build incremental volume as the year progresses on the commercial and innovation front the opportunity for evolving technology that bring behind the circular initiatives is critical for our customers and our planet our commitment to repreve and sustainability remains strong as we continue to innovate across our portfolio one example is how we are now working with ibm research and have entered into a memorandum of understanding regarding their chemical recycling technology ibm research novel technology volcap leverages volatile and recoverable catalysts that acts as a molecular sorter allowing for optimal filtration and separation of contaminant as well as our color removal we are energized to provide expertise and development insights regarding many aspects of this technology including feedstock recycling and melt extrusion to bring an emerging technology to scale to meet global demands next a few commercial examples of recent adoptions with emphasis on growth driven by our asian segment the original dockers alpha khaki pant is using our trutemp365 technology and their all seasons tech with stretch and continued to expand at retail free country is producing more sustainable products and has converted over 75 of their freecycle jackets to repreve based insulation ugg which is under the dockers umbrella adopted repreve and all scram behind the plush lining and multi styles including the classic slipper mini flop high low and kid s classic two shoes o neill is expanding repreve offering in snow and swim wear for 2020 the jackets and bibs in the o neill blue line and the hyperfree board shorts will be made with repreve patagonia s latest series of sustainable garments for the season feature repreve in the shale and linings of the new recycle high power fleece down jacket we are excited about the opportunity for repreve and our sustainability partners as momentum continues to build now i ll walk through our segment performance for the second quarter let s start with our largest segment polyester we are pleased with the progress this segment has been making with raw material costs moving in our favor this quarter optimizing our manufacturing base and capturing synergies from previously acquired companies we are able to double gross margin year over year the segment sales mix was partially offset by lower demand in our higher margin industrial automotive products as the overall automotive industry has seen some softer u s textile demand moving to our now second largest segment asia we again continue to see meaningful top line expansion and opportunity although we are currently seeing more growth in lower margin products in asia this region has flourished and has been a bright spot for us with an enormous market share available we have made progress to better position and optimize our supply chain including a new strategic partner in southeast asia which we expect will allow us to realize cost benefits for margin improvement current actions are expected to materialize in july 2020 brazil was impacted by difficult market conditions and pricing pressure which led to softness in sales and profitability fortunately the economic and political conditions in brazil seem to be moving in the right direction we anticipate this will serve as a catalyst for a second half of the year of which we will monitor the economic climate carefully as the year progresses the nylon industry in the u s has experienced a continued movement toward asian sourcing our nylon business experienced a difficult quarter as the segment saw lower sales volume and consistently lower fixed cost absorption two of our largest customers moved certain programs offshore and consequently we saw an impact to our nylon business during calendar 2019 the team s been working very hard to back fill some of these lost volume and because global consumer demand for nylon continues to grow at a modest rate the pipeline remains solid we continue to believe in our nylon business in those assets which remain a critical component of our innovation and development efforts while this business will remain challenging for another few quarters we continue to believe in the long term opportunities and we will build this business back to a leading position lastly during the quarter our parkdale joint venture saw a significant setback with weaker leverage and lower margin pull through parkdale continues to be an investment that we value and in the past has been a meaningful contributor to cash generation for example the 10 4 million distribution last quarter allowed us to meaningfully reduce our leverage and put us in a strong capital position to conclude the second quarter results reflect some strong improvements in our core business and continued cash flow momentum with just a few shortfalls in nylon and certain other pockets we remain optimistic on the road ahead and come away from the quarter feeling encouraged i will now pass the call to craig craig creaturo executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you tom and good morning everyone as tom noted our operational results were significantly improved over the prior year second quarter and we ve achieved another strong quarter of cash flow performance i will review the key drivers of our performance in my discussion today and i d like to begin with an overview of q2 as we experienced several positive financial changes over the prior year second quarter we will begin on slide 3 of the conference call presentation overall for q2 gross profit increased in connection with a more favorable raw material cost environment in the u s which was partially offset by the nine month shortfall and global competitive pricing pressures our cost reduction effort flow through as a comparable benefit to sg a but we experienced three notable headwinds in operating income first an unfavorable foreign currency transaction losses generated a comparable decline of 800 000 from q2 2019 to q2 2020 this resulted from comparably weaker exchange rates in both brazil and asia as a reminder a strong brazilian real is generally positive for our brazil business while a strong u s dollar is generally positive for our asian business but neither of those occurred this quarter next we commenced a wind down plan for our sri lanka sales and sourcing operation and recorded the associated severance and exit costs of approximately 400 000 and the last impact to operating income involved legal fees associated with the trade petitions we expected the finalization of those petitions to generate a 500 000 expense in our third quarter fiscal 2020 but the favorable resolution in december 2019 triggered that expense to be to apply to q2 2020 this does not impact our full year view of fiscal year 2020 over the course of the trade petition activity we have undertaken in fiscal 2019 and 2020 we ve spent a total of 2 million on these activities the performance shortfall from parkdale accounted for 1 6 million of the 1 8 million negative change in unconsolidated affiliate and q2 of fiscal year 2019 had 2 million of tax credits that did not repeat in the current quarter excluding the tax benefit in the prior year underlying net income improved by 1 2 million despite the parkdale shortfall and by more than 2 million when the parkdale shortfall is ignored our expectations for the fiscal year 2020 effective tax rate remained significantly improved over fiscal year 2019 and our latest forecast places the full year rate at 23 or less which is consistent with our rate in the first half of fiscal year 2020 55 effective tax rate applied in q2 fy 2020 is associated to a lower amount of taxable u s earnings net income and earnings per share of q2 of fiscal year 2020 were 409 000 and 0 02 respectively moving to slide 4 of the webcast presentation i will review sales highlights by segment consolidated net sales increased 1 1 with significant volume growth in asia that was partially offset by the volume decline we experienced in the nylon segment polyester segment sales decreased 3 5 pricing was impacted by the lower raw material cost environment in the second quarter but we are encouraged as we see the front edges of our trade initiatives materializing with returning textured yarn customers as we mentioned last quarter automotive and industrial products have been slow due to softer demand impacting polyester sales mix nylon sales decreased 24 6 as a result of a large customer transitioning certain programs overseas in brazil sales volumes increased 3 2 despite competitive and economic pressures while declining raw material costs and foreign currency exchange drove down pricing sales results for the asia segment continued their strong performance as volumes increased 53 6 despite uncertainty in global trade and international competition sales of repreve products led the way in asia as we continue to attract quality brand programs and maintain a leadership position in the recycled market the repreve platform remains a growth engine of our asia strategy as it continues to be validated moving on to gross profit on slide 5 consolidated gross profit increased from 14 2 million to 15 7 million while the associated margin increased from 8 4 to 9 2 we are pleased with this improvement and with aid from the raw material cost environment in the u s we were able to overcome shortfalls in nylon looking at this from a segment perspective polyester primarily benefited from a more favorable raw material cost environment with a doubling of gross profit in terms of dollars and as a percentage of sales nylon primarily experienced weaker fixed cost absorption due to lower revenues and its margin rate declined from 9 to 0 3 brazil faced competitive pressures during a declining cost environment generating a gross margin decrease from 18 2 to 16 4 lastly asia s sales mix included significant shift in staple fiber sales which currently carry a lower margin profile as these products are used to seize new programs and initiate further customer development as a result asia gross margin declined from 12 7 to 11 5 however as tom mentioned earlier we are constantly evaluating more efficient and effective supply chain solutions for our operations we re making progress on one of multiple improvements to the sourcing of recycled raw materials for our asian operations moving on to slide 6 we present equity affiliates pre tax earnings from equity affiliates decreased by approximately 1 8 million from q2 2019 to q2 2020 parkdale s results primarily reflect lower operating leverage during a period of elevated costs there were no equity affiliate distributions in the second quarter but we did receive a 10 4 million distribution from parkdale in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 slide 7 covers debt and cash highlights we ended the december 2019 period at 129 3 million in debt while net debt was 92 1 million a 13 improvement or reduction from june 2019 at december 29 2019 our weighted average interest rate was 3 2 as for the rest of the balance sheet our working capital position reflects the typically elevated levels that are consistent with a routine december shutdown period additionally our cash position indicates continued solid cash generation by our foreign operations before opening up for questions slide 8 details our guidance that was contained in today s press release i ll take a moment to provide some context as we ve decided to adjust our expectations to reflect a few things that occurred during the quarter we continue to expect significant growth in asia to fuel the 10 to 13 growth in sales volume but translation into net sales growth is now expected to be offset by additional headwinds we have experienced in the nylon segment lower demand for automotive and industrial products and the current foreign currency environment while we are expecting anti dumping results to have a moderate positive impact in the short term this will take some time to take hold and we expect to see a more substantial tailwind in fiscal year 2021 thus we ve slightly reduced our fiscal 2020 sales expectations to come in closer to fiscal year 2019 levels between 700 million and 715 million our outlook for sales does anticipate some moderate market share restoration on our polyester business from the completed trade initiatives but the majority of that benefit ramps up in fiscal year 202 and while gross profit will likely continue to be pressured by the short term issues we ve noted in nylon in brazil our recovery efforts in polyester growth in asia and meaningfully better sg a cost structure will still provide significant growth over the fiscal year 2019 for operating income net income and adjusted ebitda lastly we have lowered our capital expenditures estimates from 25 million to 23 million based on the timing of certain projects we have reduced our expectations for our effective tax rate to now be 23 or lower again we are pleased with the significant improvements over fiscal year 2019 and we look forward to fiscal 2020 providing a platform to grow in market share expand our innovative portfolio and leverage our unmatched supply chain for further global growth we will now open up the line for questions questions answers operator thank you and our first question comes from chris mcginnis with sidoti and company your line is open chris mcginnis sidoti and company analyst hi good morning thank you for taking my questions maybe if we could thank you maybe if we could start just with china and kind of the current situation there could you maybe just walk through any kind of current issues may be that could be a positive for you you know how do you see it playing out maybe impacting your business positively or negatively tom caudle president and chief operating officer chris this is tom i mean we continue to be really encouraged by our business in asia it continues to grow and expand you know we ve talked many times about the product mix and how it affects the overall margin but you know we re growing the chip and flake are in staple fiber our chip and staple fiber at a much accelerated rate over what we are the higher value film products so the margins are a little depressed but as we ve said before we are cultivating a malaysian source of raw materials that s going to help us improve the margins on a longer term basis you know we probably won t see the effect of that until we are early in 2021 so we continue to be encouraged many opportunities to expand our business and it s a sort of very good growth platform for repreve so that s kind of where we are chris mcginnis sidoti and company analyst sure and just in relation to kind of a coronavirus and impact on businesses in the region though do you think that that could be a positive for you off hand are you seeing anything that input coming your way is that kind of start to impact businesses tom caudle president and chief operating officer chris we really don t know we re asset light so we don t think we ll be substantially impacted by the situation you know that there have been some announced extended downtime but at this point in time we don t think it s going to be positive or negative to our business situation over there that changes you know we ll kind of monitor and let people know as we go forward al carey executive chairman chris we have no assets on the ground in china so we won t have any factory shutdowns or any kind of lost shipping days but i don t know we re going to dig through that in the next day or two and we ll get a little better handle on it if i were to bet slightly positive but nothing significant but probably no negative chris mcginnis sidoti and company analyst ok and then just one last one just around the anti dumping i think you mentioned i mean in annual sales is what you think you lost out and you should be able to recapture that overtime tom caudle president and chief operating officer yes the end of the year brought the final decision by the international trade commission so china is at 97 plus percent india is at 18 plus percent on a anti dumping rate we ve seen very significant decline in imports from china and a meaningful decline in the imports from india so we re very encouraged by what we see we re continuing to monitoring other countries to see if some of those imports have moved around a bit but we saw increases in our demand or recycle product at the end of our second quarter and we re encouraged by what we see going into the third and fourth quarter so we think we don t get to where we thought we would be al carey executive chairman i wouldn t want to project off of five weeks but we very definitely have seen a pickup in our u s sales or shipments in the last five weeks chris mcginnis sidoti and company analyst great thanks i ll jump back in queue thanks for taking my questions al carey executive chairman thanks chris operator thank you our next question comes from daniel moore with cjs securities your line is open daniel moore cjs securities analyst al tom craig good morning thanks for taking the question al carey executive chairman hi dan tom caudle president and chief operating officer good morning dan daniel moore cjs securities analyst wanted to talk a little bit about the mix you just alluded to it in detail tom so i appreciate it pva continues to grow now up over 50 of revenue as you look out over the next four to eight quarters do you expect chip and flake and staple fiber to continue to outpace higher margin you know yarn sales and sort of pva products with more benefits if you will when do we expect that mix to maybe turn a little bit more favorable over the longer term tom caudle president and chief operating officer dan the opportunity for chip and staple fiber are so much greater than what the filament is in asia we think it s going to continue so our focus is going to be on improving the supply chain for those products to improve margin but you know there s a lot of demand for filament as well and we re going to continue to grow higher value really it s a situation and the demand for the particular type of products and chip and staple fiber is just outweighing the filament growth so we re going to remain vigilant and focusing on our supply chain to improve the margins on the lower end of those products daniel moore cjs securities analyst is it right to say that the focus will be on continued gross profit dollar growth at least in asia for the next couple of years tom caudle president and chief operating officer i think that s fair to say daniel moore cjs securities analyst ok and then shifting gears to nylon maybe elaborate on plans or steps you might take to backfill some of that lost revenue do you see the trend to offshoring continuing beyond the current customer too and you know if it does are there steps you could take in terms of capacity reduction cost reduction rationalization you know more detail there would be great tom caudle president and chief operating officer you know dan nylon has been a very important sector for us for many years it has been declining year over year we had a couple of customers shut some facilities during the last quarter but we it s a very important product line for us we still have repreve nylon which we can expand and grow with we re expanding with other customers and other opportunities that we re talking about and some of them will come to fruition over the course of the third and fourth quarter we remain committed to growing and getting that business back on track and we think that possibility exist with the through our innovation pipeline and so our customer base that we re working with today daniel moore cjs securities analyst ok and lastly for me maybe just talk about expand on the guide posts that you are seeing that give you confidence that as it relates to the anti dumping tariffs and polyester in north america specifically you know it sounds like fiscal 21 you expect to see a larger benefit you know just the conversations or anecdotes or data points that you are seeing that give you that confidence tom caudle president and chief operating officer i think we feel comfortable in the 5 million mark that we ve publicly stated and i think we are also comfortable with recapturing over time getting to 20 million of sales that we ve said as well so i think we re on track to be exactly where we publicly stated we want to be in there over time al carey executive chairman and in the u s when it first was announced back in july we were waiting to see what would happen in the business we thought we d see a positive improvement in the u s sales and nothing really happened then it got to be the fourth calendar quarter of last year fall we saw a little tick up in the business and then toward the end of the quarter we saw a little better tick up in the business but once the december 12th announcement was made and i think some of these low priced inventories have probably work themselves through the market we ve seen let s say the last week of december and all of january strong sales improvement a significant improvement over what we re doing so we are in the negative column before now we re in the positive and i would expect that to continue but i don t know how big but if i look at back over the anti dumping on things like staple fiber several years ago it was a slow build and then it finally took off i m hoping that we see that same thing daniel moore cjs securities analyst and i ll sneak one more in if i may you know parkdale obviously a little bit of a decline year over year in terms of the impact on the income statement are those assets still generating significant positive free cash flow at least through the first half of the year fiscal 20 and any changes in your view or thoughts regarding potential strategic alternatives for that investment craig creaturo executive vice president and chief financial officer dan this is craig i mean parkdale definitely has come into a period where they ve had some elevated costs they ve had some challenges i think with the cotton crop you know they continue to operate that business in a really good manner but they ve come up with some obstacles that definitely are different than last year and you re definitely seeing that as you re pointing out in our portion of their earnings you know we feel like still a very good investment for us very good strategic partner for us and really we re continuing to believe in them to continue to make improvements to the business so no changes anticipated there daniel moore cjs securities analyst thank you for the color craig creaturo executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks dan operator thank you our next question comes from marco rodriguez with stonegate capital your line is open marco rodriguez stonegate capital markets analyst good morning thank you for taking my questions al carey executive chairman good morning marco craig creaturo executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning marco rodriguez stonegate capital markets analyst i was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about some of the pressures you guys have been seeing this last quarter you specifically brought out international pricing pressures and i believe you used some verbature in your prepared remarks about the competitive levels being kind of described as aggressive could you maybe go into a little bit more color as far as what are the dynamics you are kind of seeing out there the drivers if this is specific to maybe a region or a particular competitor any sort of color around those would be very helpful tom caudle president and chief operating officer marco this is tom you know we knew when we file the anti dumping suite on the international front that there would be some movement around the region and southeast asia you know certainly we ve seen an uptick in volume and some lower prices come into the north america region from vietnam from malaysia from thailand and we are monitoring those volumes you know we think because of capacity they will flatten out over time and everything will normalize and we ll get the benefit out of the anti dumping which we anticipated but if not we always have the option of initiating more action against countries for anti dumping as well al carey executive chairman i d also marco throw in on central america it s gotten very competitive in that market and we ve decided to protect our market share and our sales are up 26 volume sales and you know i think there s an opportunity to not be quite as aggressive but i think you know we re working on getting the right pricing in that market marco rodriguez stonegate capital markets analyst got it and then talking about your guidance here looking at what sort of is implied on the numbers if i m doing my math right looks like for fiscal 20 it s about a 10 5 gross profit margin give or take a few basis points can you maybe talk a little bit about how you see that progressing into the second half of your fiscal 20 craig creaturo executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i think you re right on marco i think we re expecting the full year gross margin to be probably just a little bit higher than 10 in total we do think we ll see some benefit here in q3 to some of the actions that we ve talked about including the anti dumping but then we really feel like and seasonally it usually is our strongest quarter that q4 probably will show quite a bit more growth and we re expecting to be noticeably above that 10 average for the full year in q4 marco rodriguez stonegate capital markets analyst that s helpful and then maybe if you could talk a little bit more about the capital allocation priorities you guys have i know you talked about a slight reduction in your capex just based on some timing aspects but if you could maybe talk about the priorities you see in the next 12 months that would be helpful craig creaturo executive vice president and chief financial officer sure i think for us we re continuing to be thoughtful on the capital expenditures we ve talked about the larger projects the evo coolers detection machines that we have that are coming in our current forecast anticipates that we will start to spend some dollars in fy 20 for those the first wave of those machines and then the bulk of that cloying out in fy 21 we feel like we re investing in the right areas the right strategic areas the right maintenance areas so we feel that 23 million forecast for the year is a very comfortable level for us we re also anticipating being able to continue to reduce debt or specifically net debt we ve seen a nice reduction in that 13 reduction in the last six months you know we feel like we ll be continuing to invest a bit in our working capital especially as we build in q3 and then onto that strong q4 that we re anticipating however we think that continuing the capital investments capital expenditure investments plus paying down the debt really that s the main prioritizations right now marco rodriguez stonegate capital markets analyst got it and last quick question if i might you called out again second quarter in a row here the industrial and automotive market in terms of their kind of weakness there maybe if you could just talk a little bit about anecdotally what you re hearing from those clients what their sort of expectations are for the remainder of calendar year 20 tom caudle president and chief operating officer i think that in general the automotive industry saw a slowdown during our first and second quarter of our fiscal year you know gm withstood a strike during that period some others announced reduction of models and what have you so so i think the industry as a whole saw a slowdown during the period and you know we are watching what s going to happen in the third and fourth quarters but we may see a little bit of an uptick but we don t expect total recovery from where we were before that all that took place in our third and fourth quarters al carey executive chairman yes i thought before i turn over to a j to close it up i just thought i would make a little bit broad comment on so how i see the business moving forward and why we have optimism so if you think back about this time last year we were in a tough spot on many fronts and i really think the best way i would describe the business in the last two quarters is sequential improvement and i d say that the sequential improvement will continue in quarters three and quarter four you know continuously moving forward a little bit but the recovery has been uneven with a few surprises so i don t want to diminish those but here s what i would say as far as positives the sales volume is very positive on many fronts and i m particularly encouraged with the overall u s business let s call it the last five or six weeks so it looks like the anti dumping is finally starting to hit i don t want to project so much positive on five weeks but it appears that that s a trend that we can definitely see improving and if you look at our revenue which was weak at 1 1 if you took out the nylon it was actually up 6 so i m feeling a little better about our overall trends there the other thing that our board puts a big focus on is cash generation and cost controls and i ll tell you both of those are in a very good spot and i expect it to continue our asia business is very fast growing and over the last several let s call it two months i think as asg becomes such an important part of the economy and so much discussion about it in the news in the press i think it s beginning to have a positive impact on repreve and i hear more and more positive discussions with our customers about repreve and their interest on our innovation on repreve such as in nylon and ocean plastic opportunities definitely price realization and i d look at it in two different ways there price realization in asia price realization in central americas where we need to put some efforts and there are two different plans but those plans are in place and i expect some improvement and then nylon and i would expect we have several ideas on nylon i think they ll really materialize toward the end of this fiscal year and i think we ll start anniversary ing the departure of the plants that shut down but we intend to keep nylon as part of our overall portfolio because our customers see us as a full textile company not you know a partial and so we re compelled to work on this nylon thing but that s it overall i mean that s the way i m looking at the business we ve been working hard i think we re making a lot of progress we still have a lot of work to do though so that you know i feel very all of us sitting here feel very positive about where we re heading for the second half of the year so with that let me turn it over to a j for the close a j eaker vice president of finance thank you everyone for participating today our next

gaap financial measures both in its reconciliation to the u s gaap financial measures and its consolidated financial statements all of which should be considered when evaluating the company s results the company uses these non gaap financial measures to supplement the information provided in its consolidated financial statements which are presented in accordance with u s gaap the presentation of non gaap financial measures are not meant to be a substitute for financial measures presented in accordance with u s gaap but rather should be evaluated in conjunction with and as a supplement to such u s gaap measures opentext strongly encourages investors to review its financial information in its entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure the company therefore believes that despite these limitations it is appropriate to supplement the disclosure of the u s gaap measures with certain non gaap measures defined below non gaap based net income and non gaap based eps attributable to opentext are consistently calculated as gaap based net income or earnings per share attributable to opentext on a diluted basis excluding the effects of the amortization of acquired intangible assets other income expense share based compensation and special charges recoveries all net of tax and any tax benefits expense items unrelated to current period income as further described in the tables below non gaap based gross profit is the arithmetical sum of gaap based gross profit and the amortization of acquired technology based intangible assets and share based compensation within cost of sales non gaap based gross margin is calculated as non gaap based gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue non gaap based income from operations is calculated as income from operations excluding the amortization of acquired intangible assets special charges recoveries and share based compensation expense adjusted earnings loss before interest taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda is consistently calculated as gaap based net income attributable to opentext excluding interest income expense provision for income taxes depreciation and amortization of acquired intangible assets other income expense share based compensation and special charges recoveries the company s management believes that the presentation of the above defined non gaap financial measures provides useful information to investors because they portray the financial results of the company before the impact of certain non operational charges the use of the term non operational charge is defined for this purpose as an expense that does not impact the ongoing operating decisions taken by the company s management these items are excluded based upon the way the company s management evaluates the performance of the company s business for use in the company s internal reports and are not excluded in the sense that they may be used under u s gaap the company does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle and therefore believes that the presentation of non gaap measures which in certain cases adjust for the impact of amortization of intangible assets and the related tax effects that are primarily related to acquisitions will provide readers of financial statements with a more consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and be more useful in helping readers understand the company s operating results and underlying operational trends additionally the company has engaged in various restructuring activities over the past several years primarily due to acquisitions that have resulted in costs associated with reductions in headcount consolidation of leased facilities and related costs all which are recorded under the company s special charges recoveries caption on the consolidated statements of income each restructuring activity is a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives or circumstances and each differs in terms of its operational implementation business impact and scope and the size of each restructuring plan can vary significantly from period to period therefore the company believes that the exclusion of these special charges recoveries will also better aid readers of financial statements in the understanding and comparability of the company s operating results and underlying operational trends in summary the company believes the provision of supplemental non gaap measures allow investors to evaluate the operational and financial performance of the company s core business using the same evaluation measures that management uses and is therefore a useful indication of opentext s performance or expected performance of future operations and facilitates period to period comparison of operating performance although prior performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance as a result the company considers it appropriate and reasonable to provide in addition to u s gaap measures supplementary non gaap financial measures that exclude certain items from the presentation of its financial results the following charts provide unaudited reconciliations of u s gaap based financial measures to non u s gaap based financial measures for the following periods presented reconciliation of selected gaap based measures to non gaap based measures for the three months ended december 31

persistently above that threshold the economy grew 2 3 last year the commerce department said on thursday that was the slowest since 2016 and followed the 2 9 growth notched in 2018 story continues below advertisement remove ad while the department s snapshot of gross domestic product showed the economy maintaining a moderate pace of growth in the fourth quarter that was in part because of a smaller import bill which is unsustainable consumer spending slowed considerably last quarter and that could persist with wage growth appearing to have stalled but the longest expansion in history now in its 11th year probably remains on track and a downturn is unlikely as the federal reserve s three interest rate cuts in 2019 kick in the fed kept rates unchanged on wednesday fed chair jerome powell told reporters the us central bank expected moderate economic growth to continue but also nodded to some risks including the recent coronavirus outbreak in china the new decade will bring about sub potential gdp growth around 1 7 as numerous headwinds keep businesses sidelined while households reduce their outlays in line with gently cooling income said gregory daco chief us economist at oxford economics in new york story continues below advertisement remove ad the trump administration s 18 month long trade war with china last year fueled fears of a recession though the economic outlook has improved with this month s signing of a phase 1 deal with beijing economists do not see a boost to the economy as us tariffs remained in effect on 360 billion of chinese imports about two thirds of the total gross domestic product increased at a 2 1 annualized rate in the fourth quarter matching the third quarter pace also as lower borrowing costs encouraged purchases of houses growth was also supported by increased government spending on defense that helped to offset the drag from a slower pace of inventory accumulation economists polled by reuters had forecast gdp rising at a 2 1 rate in the fourth quarter story continues below advertisement remove ad excluding trade inventories and government spending the economy grew at a 1 4 rate in the fourth quarter the slowest in four years this measure of domestic demand rose at a 2 3 pace in the third quarter economists estimate the speed at which the economy can grow over a long period without igniting inflation at around 1 8 the white house claimed that slashing the corporate tax rate to 21 from 35 as well as shrinking the trade deficit would boost annual gdp growth to 3 0 on an sustainable basis and pay for the tax cuts economists have long disagreed pointing to structural issues like low productivity and population growth some also argued that there was historically not a very strong relationship between corporate tax rates and business investment some companies including apple used their tax windfall for share buybacks a report from the nonpartisan congressional budget office on tuesday forecast the federal budget deficit will hit 1 02 trillion this year the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies us treasury prices were trading higher us stock index futures briefly extended losses after the data business investment slumping business investment fell at a 1 5 rate in the fourth quarter it was the third straight quarterly decline and the longest such stretch since 2009 there were decreases last quarter in spending on nonresidential structures such as mining exploration shafts and well and industrial business equipment spending on nonresidential structures contracted in 2019 by the most since 2016 trade tensions have eroded business confidence and weighed on capital expenditure with confidence among chief executive officers remaining low in the fourth quarter after dropping to a 10 year low in the prior quarter a rebound is unlikely soon business investment is also seen pressured by boeing s suspension this month of the production of its troubled 737 max jetliner which was grounded last march following two fatal crashes boeing on wednesday reported its first annual loss since 1997 growth in consumer spending which accounts for more than two thirds of us economic activity slowed to a 1 8 pace after rising at a brisk 3 2 rate in the third quarter though a separate report from the labor department on thursday showed the number of americans filing claims for state unemployment benefits fell last week the tight labor market is not generating a faster pace of wage growth in the fourth quarter personal income at the disposal of households after adjusting for inflation rose at a 1 5 rate stepping down from a 2 9 pace in the third quarter the decrease in imports in the fourth quarter in part because of us tariffs on chinese goods compressed the trade deficit that led to trade adding 1 48 percentage points to fourth quarter gdp growth imports have however since rebounded last quarter s decline in imports resulted in businesses almost depleting inventories in warehouses a 40 day strike at general motors also weighed on motor vehicle inventories inventories rose at a 6 5 billion rate in the fourth quarter the smallest gain since the second quarter of 2018 after increasing at a 69 4 billion pace in the july september quarter inventory investment chopped 1 09 percentage points from gdp growth last quarter

why is washington making a song and dance about the china pakistan economic corridor cpec are their reservations with regard to the multi billion programme rooted in deep concerns for pakistan s long term wellbeing do like caring parents who believe their naive child should give a wide berth to bad company they want islamabad to keep the chinese at an arm s length or do the americans look upon the corridor as a strategic ploy by beijing to put its stamp on the region at their expense from the american perspective as outlined by a senior state department official alice wells twice during the past three months the substantial capital inflows under cpec are a greek gift for pakistan which is already heavily indebted to foreigners governments as well as multilateral institutions the more the programme grows in size the more funds will islamabad have to borrow from the government and banks in china as a result the debt repayment obligations of the country will continue to inflate forcing it to shore up its borrowing to work off the credit that will be a classic case of debt trap from which as a rule the borrower finds difficult to get out the argument seems valid but like any other valid argument it may comprise questionable premises in order to appreciate cpec and its implications for pakistan we need to look at the bigger picture from both china s and pakistan s standpoints not to speak of the us perspective cpec is part of china s flagship belt and road initiative bri as china sets its sights on becoming an economic superpower it s putting high premium on four things in the main seamless and efficient trade flows food and energy security moving up the value chain in manufacturing and development of its relatively backward regions china s impressive economic growth over the past four decades has been export driven the share of foreign trade in the country s total economic output is 40 percent which is exceedingly high considering that as a rule large economies tend to depend less on foreign sales and purchases the asian giant has been among the biggest beneficiaries of trade liberalization and opening up of markets worldwide and is keen that the phenomenon should continue the trade competitiveness of a country in significant measures hinges on curtailing the cost of both domestic and overseas transactions by putting in place an efficient infrastructure according to a 2017 asian development bank study the current infrastructure deficit is a serious obstacle to trade expansion and economic openness and that the asian continent alone needs 26 trillion infrastructure related investment till 2030 that is why bridging the infrastructure gap forms the key component of the bri putting in place the right infrastructure and building trade corridors also played a capital role in china s development saga since china is a gigantic country both raw materials and final goods have to be shifted from one part of the country to another over an enormous distance that necessitated huge investments in overcoming transportation bottlenecks china wants to replicate a similar model in the bri which would cut back significantly on the time and cost of the country s foreign trade on account of the size and growth of its economy as well as the 1 4 billion population china s energy needs are ever growing already it s the globe s largest energy consumer and importer of petroleum products ensuring timely and uninterrupted energy supplies is thus a priority for beijing another priority is food security due to rapid industrialization the share of agriculture in china s gdp has been shrinking at present it accounts for less than eight percent of the overall economic product making it increasingly dependent on food import compared with europe and north america china is known as a manufacturer and seller of low technology low quality products the country is keen to erase this impression by graduating to a manufacturer and exporter of high technology smart goods and services this entails on the one hand import of technology related intermediate goods such as semi conductors from developed countries and on the other relocation of the heavy and labour intensive industries to less developed economies china s development has been heavily biased towards coastal regions or the eastern part of the country the western part including the xinxiang administrative region bordering pakistan and tibet was largely neglected which stoked social and political discontent as per the development philosophy of the current leadership encapsulated in socialism with chinese characteristics for the new era beijing is according high importance to the development of the hitherto neglected regions through industrial relocation and trade the bri is a seen as a significant contributor to this end the bri which seeks to revive the ancient silk road through which asian nations traded with europe involves 60 plus countries with china as their pivot a network of roads bridges and ports running through the participating countries would ensure that china s international trade which includes secure energy and food supplies is conducted at low real cost the immediate benefit for these by and large capital deficient countries is infrastructure development the initiative is remarkably ambitious and china is supposed to inject close to one trillion dollars by 2030 into the various projects in both investment and credit modes the bri includes six corridors through which china will be connected to europe and africa through south asia the middle east and eurasia one of these corridors is cpec cpec links china s restive south west to energy rich west asia and further to europe through the gwadar port as in the case of other bri corridors communication and energy related infrastructure development to the tune of 49 billion the figure is subject to cost escalation lies at the heart of cpec of this the 34 billion energy projects are in the ipp mode these projects have contributed significantly to easing power outages in pakistan however the mode of financing for the 15 billion transport projects is almost entirely chinese credit so far pakistan has borrowed close to 5 billion for these projects which the government claims to be on concessionary terms pakistan is seeking another 9 billion chinese loan for the mega ml i project which will upgrade the main karachi peshawar railway track all over the world trains are the preferred means of cargo transport in pakistan however the share of the railways in merchandise transport is only two percent cpec will no doubt add to the public external debt but an economy faced with low level of domestic savings has to rely on foreign capital to shore up the level of investment besides if used to raise the productive capacity of the economy debt is not something to be frowned upon as the economy grows its capacity to service the debt also racks up in addition china will help pakistan overcome its supply side constraints through development of special economic zones sezs and modernization of agriculture despite being an agro based economy pakistan is a net food importer to the tune of 1 5 billion a year mainly because of productivity glitches pakistan is also eyeing relocation of some of china s heavy or labour intensive industry to the sezs to give a significant boost to its exports due to cpec china has become the largest source of fdi into pakistan during last five years the cumulative fdi from china crossed 5 billion which accounts for 46 percent of the total investment into pakistan in contrast only 530 million worth of fdi was received from the us during this period china is also pakistan s largest trading partner it goes without saying that increased commercial engagement between the two countries consolidates their overall bilateral relations for china the benefits of the bri go beyond mere connectivity and trade to ratcheting up its regional and global clout capital whether it takes the form of equity or credit is a principal source of extending leverage over other nations no other country knows this better than the us which since the close of the second world war has been the capital user of military and economic assistance as a tool of advancing foreign policy objectives not only that as washington is presently in a protectionist cum austere mode beijing sees it as a good opportunity to draw upon its massive foreign exchange reserves for building alliances centred on it that s the reason the bri provides a springboard for the sino us face off the writer is an islamabad basedcolumnist email hussainhzaidi gmail com twitter hussainhzaidi

recently a new coronavirus has been causing many illnesses and deaths the virus first became active in wuhan china but it has already spread to the rest of china scattered cases have been identified around the rest of the world as well there are two important questions that are already being encountered how much of an attempt should be made to limit the spread of the new virus for example should businesses close to prevent the spread of the virus should this disease be publicized as being far worse than flu viruses that circulate each year and cause many deaths among the elderly and people in poor health the median age of those dying from the new coronavirus seems to be about 75 unfortunately there aren t easy answers we can easily see the likely outcome of under reaction more people might die of the disease more people might find themselves out of work for a couple of weeks or more with the illness we tend to be especially concerned about ourselves and our own relatives the thing that is harder to see is that reacting too vigorously can have a hugely detrimental impact on the world economy the world economy depends on international trade and tourism china plays a key role in the world economy quarantines of whole regions that last for weeks and months can have a very detrimental impact on the wages of people in the area and profits of local companies problems with debt can be expected to spike the greater the reaction to the coronavirus the more likely the world economy will be pushed toward recession and job loss the following are a few of my thoughts regarding possible overreaction the chinese coronavirus seems to be extremely contagious even before a person who has been exposed shows any symptoms the only way we can be certain to contain the virus seems to be through quarantines lasting up to 14 days china s national health minister ma xiaowei has provided information that seems quite alarming with the new virus a person may become communicable shortly after he she has been infected but symptoms may not appear for up to 14 days this allows the infected person to infect many others without realizing that he she is a carrier for the disease today the united states and many other countries screen for the virus by checking passengers arriving on planes from affected areas for fevers given the information provided by china s national health minister this approach seems unlikely to be sufficient to catch all of the people who may eventually come down with the disease if a country really wants to identify all the potential carriers of the disease it appears that a 14 day quarantine for all travelers from infected areas may be needed such a quarantine becomes administratively difficult to handle for the huge number of people who are likely to travel from china such a quarantine would make it impossible for pilots and other airline workers to make a living for example they would be spending too much of their time in quarantine to do the work needed to support themselves and their families a related concern is that person to person transmission is very easy with the chinese coronavirus we don t know for certain how many people each infected individual infects but one estimate is that each infected person transmits the disease to an average of 2 5 other people with this transmission rate the number of people having the disease can be expected to grow exponentially perhaps for several months based on these concerns it seems to me that funds spent on trying to contain the coronavirus are likely to be largely wasted the new chinese virus will spread widely regardless of attempts to contain it at most quarantines will slightly slow the transmission of the disease at the same time quarantines will be quite disruptive of commerce they will tend to reduce both total wages and total output of goods and services of the area deaths from pathogens are part of the natural cycle they help prune back the population of the old and weak we know that in ecosystems one of the functions of naturally occurring fires is to clear out deadwood to allow healthy new growth to occur in fact some types of seeds seem to require smoke for germination when inadequate natural burning takes place bushfires as seen in australia and forest fires as seen in california become an increasing problem deaths from pathogens seem to play a similar role in human economies this is especially the case with pathogens that especially target the weak and old most flu viruses have this characteristic early reports of deaths from the coronavirus suggest that this same pattern of targeting the old and weak is occurring with this virus as well as noted above the median age of those dying from the new coronavirus seems to be about 75 years since the 1940s modern medicine has been able to develop antibiotics and vaccines to counteract the impact of many pathogens this of course makes citizens happy but it has the disadvantage of changing the population in a way that leaves the economy with a much higher percentage of elderly people and others in poor health this higher level of elderly and medically needy people makes it easy for viruses and other pathogens to make their rounds just as leaving deadwood on the forest floor makes it easier for fires to spread with this rising population of people who cannot support themselves tax rates for the remaining citizens tend to become very high young workers may become discouraged because they do not have enough income remaining after paying taxes to raise their own families in effect they cannot support both their young families and the many old people viewed from this unusual perspective the operation of the chinese coronavirus might even be considered a benefit to society as a whole the world has overcome the impact of measles typhoid polio and many other diseases in some sense it needs a new disease added to its portfolio to replace the ones that have been mostly taken care of by modern medicine in this way pensions and other payments targeting the old and weak don t become too great a burden on the young if the chinese coronavirus were simply allowed to run its course without publicity that it was in any way unusual somewhat less than 1 of the world s population might be expected to die to see what would happen if the chinese coronavirus were to run its course we might look at what happened with the spanish flu back in 1918 at that time doctors did not have a way of treating the virus and authorities downplayed concern for the disease the us center for disease control reports that 500 million people or one third of the world s population became infected at least 50 million people about 10 of those infected died we don t yet know with accuracy how many of those infected will die from the current virus a recent estimate is that about 2 3 of those who are infected will die of the disease based on 107 dying out of 4 600 infected if we assume that the percentage of the population that will ultimately catch the new virus is 30 then the share of the world s population that would be expected to die would be about the un estimates that the world s population can be expected to grow by about 1 05 in 2020 if this is the case the effect of the chinese virus would be to sharply dampen the population increase for the year instead of population rising by 1 05 it would rise by only 0 29 1 05 0 76 assuming all of the deaths associated with the chinese coronavirus take place within a year while this would be a change it would be fairly small temporary change all of these deaths would be tragic for the families involved but in a way they would be less of a problem than the deaths that took place back in 1918 at that time mortality was high for healthy 20 to 40 year olds making the flu particularly disruptive for families the total percentage of the population that died was also much higher about 3 instead of 0 76 a major danger of the virus seems to be one of overreaction today s world economy is fragile china like other countries has a large amount of debt debt defaults related to poor profits of companies closing their operations for a time and workers losing income could easily skyrocket closing down transportation from china would risk pushing the world economy into a very bad recession in fact simply having a very large number of people out sick from work would be expected to have an adverse impact on the economy spending a large amount of money on hospitalizations and face masks cannot compensate for the loss of productivity of the rest of the economy thus the tendency would be toward recession in china even if no action toward cutting off travel were taken china is a huge supplier of goods to the rest of the world in fact in 2016 it used more energy in producing industrial output than the united states india russia and japan combined china s economy has been growing very rapidly since 1990 figure 2 shows this one way in gdp comparisons using inflation adjusted us dollars figure 3 is similar to figure 2 except the growth comparison is made in 2011 purchasing power parity international dollars this adjustment is made because typically the currencies of less developed nations float far below the dollar in terms of what the local currency will buy the inflation adjusted ppp comparison compares output on a basis that is expected to be more consistent with what the local currency will really purchase on this ppp basis china s gdp surpassed the us s gdp in 2014 figure 3 also shows that the united states has slipped from about 20 of the world s gdp to about 15 on this basis we cannot simply cut off trade with china regardless of how bad the situation is china is too big and too important now the rest of the world desperately needs goods and services produced in china in spite of what is going wrong from an illness perspective china plays too key a role in supply chains of many kinds for the country to be left out even cutting off tourism becomes a problem the share of china s revenue from tourism amounted to 11 in 2018 while not all of this would drop off even a dip would lead to lower employment in this part of its economy jet fuel use would drop as well a particular problem today is low prices for many commodities including oil and other fossil fuels these prices are likely to fall further if china s economy falters further we used to hear that the world would run out of oil and that oil prices would rise very high in fact if the people who were concerned about the issue had studied history they would have figured out that a far more likely outcome would be collapse in such a situation prices of many commodities might fall too low revelation 18 11 13 provides a list of a number of commodities including humans sold as slaves for which prices dropped very low at the time of the collapse of ancient babylon the problem is a different squeeze than a high price squeeze it is more of a growing wage disparity problem with fewer and fewer of the world s workers being able to afford the goods and services made by the world economy this problem feeds back to commodity prices that fall too low for producers of many types the problem is an affordability issue rather than one of running out i have written about this issue many times prices of fossil fuels have been low for a very long time essentially since late 2014 opec has cut back its oil production because of low oil prices several us natural gas producers have taken big write offs on natural gas investments china s coal production has remained below its 2013 level because of low prices if china finds it necessary to cut back on production of goods and services for any reason excessive sickness within china visitors aren t traveling to china tariffs customers around the world aren t buying cars this reduction in output would be likely to further lower the prices of commodities more producers would go bankrupt countries exporting products as diverse as oil iron ore copper and lithium might have economic difficulties lower fossil fuel prices may lead to a cutback in their output but it is doubtful that this cutback would be offset by an increase in the production of renewables falling fossil fuel prices would make the price comparison of renewables to fossil fuels look even worse than it does today china has cut back on its subsidies for solar panels and this has led to decreasing chinese solar installations in both 2018 and 2019 the best approach might just be to let the chinese coronavirus run its course authorities might also discourage stories about how awful the illness is today we seem to think that we can fix all problems unfortunately this medical problem doesn t seem to be fixable in the near term we should probably do as governments through the ages have done which is not very much we should not publicize the disease as being a whole lot worse than flu viruses in general for example we should certainly look for inexpensive treatments for the disease for example there seems to be an effort to examine the possibility of using existing antiviral drugs as a treatment it seems like an effort could be made to look into ways of treating the disease at home perhaps using supplemental oxygen for a period in time perhaps a vaccine can be developed individuals around the world should be encouraged to get themselves in as good health as possible so that their own immune systems can fight off pathogens of all types not just this particular virus common sense should be used in washing hands and in avoiding being with sick people i doubt that it makes sense to encourage the use of masks goggles and other protective devices we as individuals cannot live forever on this earth we also cannot spend an unlimited percentage of gdp on health care it becomes too high cost for most citizens at some point we need to call a halt to the expectation that we can fix all problems we live in a world with limited resources we need to start lowering our expectations if we don t want to make our problems worse

presentation of this additional information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with u s gaap a reconciliation of these non gaap measures to the most comparable gaap measure can be found in our earnings release at this point i ll turn the call over to alan alan lane chief executive officer thank you shannon and good morning everyone before i get started i d like to take a moment to thank the many people who helped us through our initial public offering which culminated in our first day of trading on the new york stock exchange on november 7th 2019 the hard work of our employees and advisors and the loyal support of our customers and partners contributed to the success of our offering as many of you are aware silvergate s global payments platform known around the world as the silvergate exchange network or sen provides a significant opportunity for growth and is a real differentiator for silvergate the completion of our public offering has delivered not only growth capital but also an additional public forum to market and further publicize our offerings and initiatives in the digital currency market turning to today s call i would like to provide a brief overview of silvergate and our growth strategy for those investors who are unable to hear our story during our ipo roadshow i will then briefly review the highlights of our fourth quarter performance before handing the call over to tony for a more detailed discussion of our results from there we will open the call for questions to begin silvergate capital corporation is the leading provider of innovative financial infrastructure solutions and services to the growing digital currency industry silvergate was founded in 1988 as an industrial loan company and when i joined in december of 2008 silvergate was a small clean california chartered fdic insured financial institution it had just under 300 million in total assets consisting of commercial real estate and single family residential real estate loans funded primarily by cds and money market deposit accounts in 2013 and we began exploring the digital currency industry as a way to gather deposits to support our lending strategies we opened our first u s dollar deposit account for a company in this new and unfamiliar industry in january of 2014 creating a significant first mover advantage which continues to benefit silvergate today what began six years ago as a fairly straightforward deposit account offering has evolved into a global payments platform known worldwide as the fin we believe that silvergate is the first bank in the world to bring the legacy financial system which historically only operates during normal business hours five days a week into the 24 7 365 digital currency market which never sleeps as the first mover in this still nascent industry the sen provides us with four key competitive advantages first it creates a network effect so that every time silvergate onboard a new customer we provide incremental value to customers already participating in the network this drives long standing relationships and creates a further competitive advantage second our network provides for a low cost customer acquisition strategy prior to 2019 our website didn t mention digital currency related business but we grew rapidly by solving problems for our customers which led to word of mouth referrals the third benefit is access to an underserved customer base that is looking for products related to digital asset settlement and asset backed credit facilities finally silvergate has the ability to grow fee income which i will discuss in more detail in a moment our focus is on the institutional market as we connect 80 exchanges and otc trading desks to almost 500 institutional investors allowing them to transact in near real time around the clock around the world many of our customers are using trading strategies very similar to what they might be using in the equities or commodities markets importantly if you are a hedge fund and you are on the sen you have a competitive advantage over other hedge funds that aren t on sen because you can move money at times that they can t and ultimately your capital is more efficient these are no cost book transfers between silvergate customers and because you have to be a silvergate customer to use the sen the deposits don t leave silvergate when they are transferred from customer to customer conversely exchanges and investors that are not silvergate customers are at a distinct disadvantage this drives significant new customer potential which can be seen in our customer growth we ended the year with 804 customers a 48 increase over year end 2018 our new customer pipeline also remains robust with more than 200 institutions in our review and approval process which we believe bodes well for future growth turning to slide 4 as our customers have grown so too has their utilization of the sen for the full year 2019 the sen handled 32 7 billion of u s dollar transfers representing 296 growth year over year we also experienced significant growth in the number of sen transactions rising by 485 in 2019 as compared to 2018 while net interest income represents a significant portion of our total revenue we are evolving our business to a fee based model as customers rapidly adopt our global payments platform fee income is comprised primarily of three different categories including fx transactions cash management solutions such as wires and ach and lastly sen fees for the full year 2019 digital currency customer related fee income was 4 9 million representing an increase of 148 as compared to 2018 our fourth quarter digital currency related fee income was 1 4 million representing an increase of 102 as compared to the 2018 fourth quarter i would note that the price of bitcoin was volatile in the fourth quarter which modestly impacted our digital currency customer related fee income and u s dollar volumes as compared to the 2019 third quarter that said the underlying growth on the sen remained robust as fourth quarter 2019 transactions grew 17 sequentially from the 2019 third quarter looking forward we believe that we are in the very early stages of monetizing the sen and see multiple opportunities to introduce new products and expand our fee income we continue to strike a balance between maximizing the network effect with the desire to increase fee income in the short term over the long term we will continue to build out the fee income components with our new and existing customers through new product development one example is sen leverage which is a new product offering that we announced earlier in january sen leverage will allow bank customers to obtain u s dollar loans collateralized by bitcoin held at select digital currency exchanges that are also customers of silvergate the product uses the sen to fund loans and process repayments in real time 24 hours a day seven days per week with this product we plan to provide credit to existing silvergate customers leveraging the network effect of the sen we will apply the same rigorous underwriting standards that have served us well over the years to this new lending initiative i would highlight that we are currently in a pilot with expectations of more fully rolling out the product in the second half of 2020 importantly this further demonstrates silvergate s innovation and focus on our customers needs over time we see sen leverage as a strong growth driver for silvergate silvergate will continue to invest in new product development a priority for future growth as we work to enhance both the value of the sen and its unique competitive advantage which will further strengthen its network effect with that i would now like to turn the call over to tony for a more detailed review of our financial results tony martino chief financial officer thank you alan as was already covered by alan slide 4 provides the key trends around the expansion of our digital currency platform as consistently strong customer growth continues to strengthen our network effect resulting in significant increases in both sen related transfers and fee income from digital currency customers turning to slide 5 in the fourth quarter deposits decreased 33 4 million or 1 8 to 1 8 billion as compared to the third quarter of 2019 at december 31 2019 74 of our total deposits were non interest bearing totaling 1 3 billion the december 31 2019 deposit balance includes 325 million at face value of callable brokered certificates of deposit used for hedging these cds were initially issued between march and july of 2019 and were used to purchase 350 million in fixed rate commercial mortgage backed securities along with 400 million in notional amount of interest rate floors as part of a hedging strategy to mitigate the impact from a decrease in interest rates the callable brokered cds had an all in cost of 2 77 as of september 30th 2019 and during the fourth quarter the company called 237 5 million of these cds and we issued new callable brokered cds at lower rates the company incurred a 1 6 million premium expense during the fourth quarter to call and replace these cds in order to realize the benefit of lower rates as the all in cost of the 325 million in callable brokered cds was 2 29 at december 31 2019 our weighted average cost of deposits for the quarter was 84 basis points with a total of 78 basis points related to the callable brokered cds out of the total 78 basis points 35 basis points is related to the 1 6 million premium expense for calling the cds with the remaining 43 basis points resulting from the underlying all in cost of carrying the cds throughout the quarter this compares to a weighted cost of deposits of 50 basis points in the third quarter of 2019 and 28 basis points in the second quarter of 2019 of which 44 basis points and 22 basis points respectively were related to the interest and premium expense related to the callable brokered cds the prior year weighted average cost of deposits of 8 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2018 reflects the fact that we did not have any callable brokered cds at that time turning to slide 6 our net interest margin was 2 97 for the fourth quarter compared to 3 39 in the third quarter and 3 59 for the fourth quarter of 2018 the fourth quarter decrease was driven in part by the impact of the brokered cds as reflected in our cost of deposits in addition you can see how the yields on loans securities and cash were impacted by the reduction in rates in the third and fourth quarters of 2019 now on to non interest income on slide 7 non interest income for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 3 1 million an increase of 500 000 compared to 2 6 million in the third quarter of 2019 and a 1 1 million increase compared to 2 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 non interest income for the full year was 15 8 million compared to 7 6 million in 2018 a full year increase was primarily due to the 102 increase in fee income from our digital currency customers and a 5 5 million gain on the sale of our san marcos branch that closed in the first quarter of 2019 turning to slide 8 non interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 13 7 million which compares to 12 6 million in the third quarter of 2019 and 14 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 the linked quarter increase of 1 million was primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits professional services and other general and administrative fees largely related to our organic growth and the expansion of our operational infrastructure on to slide 9 total loans at december 31 2019 were 1 04 billion a 3 7 increase compared to the linked quarter and a 10 3 increase compared to year end 2018 driven by an increase in our mortgage warehouse division during the year the capital ratios on slide 10 represents the ratios at our subsidiary silvergate bank at december 31 2019 each of the bank s capital ratios exceeded the well capitalized levels established by federal banking regulations our total risk based capital ratio at 25 24 reflects the fact that a large proportion of our deposits are held in cash and high grade securities thank you again for your time today we look forward to updating everyone on our first quarter results in april with that i d like to ask the operator to open up the line for any questions operator questions answers operator our first question comes from the line of michael perito with kbw please proceed with your question michael perito kbw analyst hey guys good morning alan lane chief executive officer good morning mike michael perito kbw analyst i had a few questions i wanted to start alan on sen leverage i think it seems like an interesting product but obviously there s when thinking about the underwriting and using what seems to be a pretty underlying a volatile underlying asset as collateral i was curious if you could maybe expand a little bit on how you plan to kind of price this product and also what the underwriting kind of processes and what makes you comfortable that the risk adjusted returns will be attractive in the longer term alan lane chief executive officer sure mike this is alan so on sen leverage i ll start out and then i ll hand it over to ben to provide a little additional color so the way we re approaching the underwriting for the pilot is we are first working with what i would consider our strongest customers from a financial strength perspective looking to make sure that they have the ability to service the debt regardless of what happens to the bitcoin collateral having said that we believe that the bitcoin collateral provides a very very unique and potentially as you said a very an opportunity for a very strong risk adjusted return because of the fact that bitcoin is a liquid market that trades 24 hours a day seven days a week and given the way we intend to underwrite the credit in terms of the type of margin requirements that we would require the collateral coverage if you will for the product we certainly believe that we will have an opportunity should the underlying collateral experience volatility that would require a borrower to cover a collateral shortfall if you will either by selling the collateral or by adding additional u s dollars paying down the loan or adding additional dollars on the platform the fact that the silvergate exchange network operates 24 7 365 we believe that we re probably one of the only banks in the world that can offer this type of functionality with the ability for our customers to be monitoring their collateral position and to be able to cover collateral shortfalls or pay down the line 24 hours a day seven days a week ben would you like to add anything to that ben reynolds executive vice president and director of corporate development yeah so i think it s important to note that this product is targeted toward the highly sophisticated institutional investors that we have as clients so we have close to 500 clients in that category as alan mentioned earlier these are folks that are used to trading the equities and commodities markets so they re very highly sophisticated and that s really the target group for this and then also as alan mentioned today is a pilot we ll walk into this and we ll demonstrate the success in the concept before we expand it alan lane chief executive officer and then mike one other point that you had asked a question on the type of yield that we might be able to get on this and again this is a pilot and working with very strong borrowers so the way we ve thought about this initially is this would likely be a high single digit type of cost to the borrower and there will be many factors that will go into that just like any other loan that we price given the strength of the borrower the level of collateral coverage et cetera and so we intend to as ben mentioned start slowly work through all of the all of the different features during the pilot here over the next 90 to 180 days and we ll see how it works and we ll be reporting back to you on a quarterly basis michael perito kbw analyst great thank you that s helpful rundown i appreciate it and i had a couple just outlook related questions i also want to hit quickly just one alan i think there were some deposit in terms of the deposit growth in 2019 there were i think a couple of elevated balances that might have normalized and that might have impacted the ability to show kind of growth in the back half of the year but i was curious if you had any updated thoughts on deposit growth on a net basis for 2020 that you re willing to share today alan lane chief executive officer sure so again i ll start and then i might ask tony to weigh in here a little bit as well as we look at the different deposit categories so one of the things as i think everyone on the call is aware is the bitcoin market itself is fairly volatile and therefore the deposit levels that we enjoy at different times can also experience some volatility having said that we enjoy a fairly stable deposit base because of the fact that our customers in order to participate in the sen they have to have deposits on the platform in order to be able to transfer money among themselves across our platform 24 hours a day seven day week so we are focused on the things that we can control which is adding new customers and encouraging adoption on the sen and driving the number of transactions across the sen and the deposit balances we believe will somewhat take care of themselves over time and so tony i don t know if you want to comment at all on the different categories of deposits tony martino chief financial officer sure so mike it s tony here just to give you a little bit more color on the breakdown as alan discussed we continued to focus on building the customer distribution of that deposit base right so every quarter we re adding customers more customers means less concentration among the deposits and so that s a key element as we move forward we strategically want to focus on generating more fee income opportunities and become less reliant on necessarily just deposit funding just to give you a little bit of color or breakdown on the deposit makeup and a little bit of insight on nim for the quarter as we reported we reported a nim of 2 97 part of that as you know part of our deposit makeup includes this 325 million of callable brokered cds which obviously were used for hedging and are not part of the fintech business but we took advantage of the decrease in rates we called a subset of them we took a 1 6 million premium expense that equated to a 30 basis point impact on nim so if you can normalize for that and you can see as we re moving into the first quarter we make adjustments in the non fintech area just to make sure we continue to lower our funding cost but strategically our approach to the broader business doesn t change we re going to continue to add customers continue to distribute that deposit base as we pointed out the digital currency deposits are at no cost michael perito kbw analyst appreciate that and then just that kind of leads to just my last question just to stick with you tony for a second so i mean if all else equal if we have no more action from the fed i mean does the margin stabilize in that 330 million range plus or minus for most of 2020 or are there any other major significant implications that we should be thinking about that could impact that figure as we move forward tony martino chief financial officer no you re exactly spot on mike that s given no further moves in rates that s where we expected them to normalize michael perito kbw analyst and that happens as soon as the first quarter just to clarify tony martino chief financial officer yeah the entry point right now that s where i see the nim michael perito kbw analyst ok great guys appreciate you taking my questions thank you alan lane chief executive officer thanks mike operator thank you our next question comes from the line of eugene koysman with barclays please proceed with your question eugene koysman barclays analyst good morning thanks for taking my question alan lane chief executive officer good morning eugene eugene koysman barclays analyst thanks i wanted to follow up on the deposit discussion it looked like both the exchange and investor count for the visual related deposits were up but the actual deposits were down how should we think about your ability to drive deposit growth from new client relationship going forward and is it fair to assume that more clients use sen or the more your clients use sen the fewer deposits they need to keep with silvergate because of the increased deficiency that alan referenced earlier alan lane chief executive officer sure eugene this is alan again i ll start off so you re absolutely right when we look at the different categories as we reported in the press release while the number of exchange customers and the number of institutional investors went up the deposit levels at that point at the period end we re down a bit and candidly they were down a bit across the quarter in the institutional investor category primarily and what that relates to is as the price of bitcoin is falling and there s not a lot of volatility in the daily movement that would drive potential investor interest in trading on a daily basis they will look they will potentially look for yield in other ways to earn yield on their funds and as you are aware we do not pay interest on these deposits and so we have in fact experienced some outflows during periods of time when the opportunity to make outsized returns on trading the assets are have declined a little bit again that s why we focus on just continuing to add customers knowing that when they when the market comes back and they want to trade the assets their best way to do that is by putting deposits at silvergate so that they can access the different exchanges 24 hours a day seven days a week and so to your point our focus is on adding customers which will then in turn over time drive deposits and ben did you want to add to that ben reynolds executive vice president and director of corporate development yeah so if you look at the average daily price of bitcoin in q3 versus the average daily price of bitcoin in q4 in q4 it was down about 23 and obviously our deposits weren t down that significantly and so it s really as alan mentioned a combination of looking at a number of factors the number of customers that we have on the platform what s happening to the underlying price of the asset as well as the utilization of the sen and so what we re really optimistic about is the fact that we had more sen transfers in the fourth quarter than we ve ever had before at 14 400 at a time that the price was moving down and so when you really kind of peel back the onion and you look at the institutional investor category it s really more than the sen transfers making them more efficient it s really that they just need less cash on deposit in order to execute the same trading strategies so as the price increases they have more need to have more capital in order to execute the same trading strategies and so it s a little bit while we d love to see the deposit growth i think we understand the drivers of that and we re very pleased with the growth of the utilization of the sen and as alan mentioned as the asset class as a whole grows we expect us to see the growth in deposits as well eugene koysman barclays analyst that s fair so help me understand if it s at all possible to try and isolate the impact from the bitcoin volatility and bitcoin price on the deposit levels that we saw in the last two quarters the drop off in deposits so and also the impact of the this increased efficiency so those two factors if we can say that let s say x percent of deposit drop is because of one or the other tony martino chief financial officer yeah i ll start so i think one of the challenging things in trying to do the correlation the way that you re looking at it eugene is that there s there has been other news out there so other banks have been have mentioned their intention to come into the space and are offering customers some yield and so we there s another element to it it s a question that we ve got when we were on the road show what happens as people come in and start paying yield that has actually been going on for an 18 month period so it s not a new condition but it s another variable that makes it very difficult to do the type of correlation that you were suggesting alan lane chief executive officer yeah and the other thing this is alan eugene the other thing is the asset class and the platform both are still in their nascent stages if you will so as long as we re continuing to add customers and connect both on the sen and then oftentimes there s a little bit of a lag between when we get the account open versus when they fund the account and then when they connect to the sen and start trading so over time we believe we ll be able to build stronger correlations but at this point it s really difficult eugene koysman barclays analyst got it got it thank you and then the last question is can you give us any specifics on your efforts to date to monetize sen through fee income in fx and sen usage fees and also on your sen leverage pilot how much demand do you anticipate for this product longer term alan lane chief executive officer sure so this is alan again i ll start on the fee income side we the so breaking it down fx we ll start there expanding our fx platform is a fairly new initiative for us over the last year or so and that the activity or the opportunity in fx to a certain extent will follow the trading volumes and so we will likely see a little bit of volatility in the underlying fx fee income having said that as we continue to expand our capabilities there we believe that that will continue to grow up and to the right as far as other types of fees the transactional fees there again the number of transactions and our ability to monetize those transactions have a little bit of volatility but we do believe that all categories will continue to grow up into the right but i want to say that the growth will not be linear this is it s a new industry it s a new space we are offering a very unique service that clearly is well received by the market and you can see that through the customer adoption and the adoption of the sen but it is going to play out over quarters and as far as sen leverage did you want to comment on sen leverage ben ben reynolds executive vice president and director of corporate development yeah yeah so i mean so if you take a step back and you say how do we maximize shareholder value as it relates to the sen right that s our objective maximizing shareholder value and maximizing the value of the sen send to our customers over the longer term as alan mentioned so you then say ok well how do you do that exactly and so you take a product like sen leverage and one of the strengths of sen leverage is really on the customer acquisition or on the business development side so if you think about it we have this captive group of customers and exchanges that make up the two sides of our network and we can go out to these existing customers and say hey would you like to have a more capital efficient balance sheet and because most of these folks are institutional investors of course the answer is yes and so so some of the ways that we monetize that is not is by being able to grow our loan portfolio and generate those what we believe are very attractive risk adjusted returns with the existing customers that we have with the existing sales folks that we have and so what so that s one example of what we believe the sen to be which is ultimately a very scalable platform as we offer additional services to those customers and we re continuing work in the r d space if you will around digital asset services and really our product pipeline as we explained through the rodo process so i would say that s kind of how we think about it much more longer term than in terms of how can we maximize what we charge these customers this quarter eugene koysman barclays analyst thank you that makes a lot of sense really appreciate it operator thank you there are no further questions at this time i d like to turn the call back over to mr alan lee for any closing remarks alan lane chief executive officer all right thank you very much operator and thank you mike and eugene for your questions and for everybody else s participation just in closing to piggyback on what ben was just saying our entire focus here is on adding value to our customers which we think will in turn then continue to drive value for shareholders and so this concludes our fourth quarter and full year results and call and we believe that our results demonstrate the success that we have achieved growing our global payments network the sen has experienced both substantial customer growth and customer adoption which we believe bodes well for fee income growth as we look to 2020 as ben was just alluding to we see multiple opportunities to expand our product offerings for our digital currency customers utilizing the sen and we re super excited with our recent launch of sen leverage thank you very much for your participation and we look forward to speaking to you all very soon duration 39 minutes call participants shannon devine investor

it is easy to overreact to the chinese coronavirus recently a new coronavirus has been causing many illnesses and deaths the virus first became active in wuhan china but it has already spread to the rest of china scattered cases have been identified around the rest of the world as well there are two important questions that are already being encountered how much of an attempt should be made to limit the spread of the new virus for example should businesses close to prevent the spread of the virus should this disease be publicized as being far worse than flu viruses that circulate each year and cause many deaths among the elderly and people in poor health the median age of those dying from the new coronavirus seems to be about 75 unfortunately there aren t easy answers we can easily see the likely outcome of under reaction more people might die of the disease more people might find themselves out of work for a couple of weeks or more with the illness we tend to be especially concerned about ourselves and our own relatives the thing that is harder to see is that reacting too vigorously can have a hugely detrimental impact on the world economy the world economy depends on international trade and tourism china plays a key role in the world economy quarantines of whole regions that last for weeks and months can have a very detrimental impact on the wages of people in the area and profits of local companies problems with debt can be expected to spike the greater the reaction to the coronavirus the more likely the world economy will be pushed toward recession and job loss the following are a few of my thoughts regarding possible overreaction the chinese coronavirus seems to be extremely contagious even before a person who has been exposed shows any symptoms the only way we can be certain to contain the virus seems to be through quarantines lasting up to 14 days china s national health minister ma xiaowei has provided information that seems quite alarming with the new virus a person may become communicable shortly after he she has been infected but symptoms may not appear for up to 14 days this allows the infected person to infect many others without realizing that he she is a carrier for the disease today the united states and many other countries screen for the virus by checking passengers arriving on planes from affected areas for fevers given the information provided by china s national health minister this approach seems unlikely to be sufficient to catch all of the people who may eventually come down with the disease if a country really wants to identify all the potential carriers of the disease it appears that a 14 day quarantine for all travelers from infected areas may be needed such a quarantine becomes administratively difficult to handle for the huge number of people who are likely to travel from china such a quarantine would make it impossible for pilots and other airline workers to make a living for example they would be spending too much of their time in quarantine to do the work needed to support themselves and their families a related concern is that person to person transmission is very easy with the chinese coronavirus we don t know for certain how many people each infected individual infects but one estimate is that each infected person transmits the disease to an average of 2 5 other people with this transmission rate the number of people having the disease can be expected to grow exponentially perhaps for several months based on these concerns it seems to me that funds spent on trying to contain the coronavirus are likely to be largely wasted the new chinese virus will spread widely regardless of attempts to contain it at most quarantines will slightly slow the transmission of the disease at the same time quarantines will be quite disruptive of commerce they will tend to reduce both total wages and total output of goods and services of the area deaths from pathogens are part of the natural cycle they help prune back the population of the old and weak we know that in ecosystems one of the functions of naturally occurring fires is to clear out deadwood to allow healthy new growth to occur in fact some types of seeds seem to require smoke for germination when inadequate natural burning takes place bushfires as seen in australia and forest fires as seen in california become an increasing problem deaths from pathogens seem to play a similar role in human economies this is especially the case with pathogens that especially target the weak and old most flu viruses have this characteristic early reports of deaths from the coronavirus suggest that this same pattern of targeting the old and weak is occurring with this virus as well as noted above the median age of those dying from the new coronavirus seems to be about 75 years since the 1940s modern medicine has been able to develop antibiotics and vaccines to counteract the impact of many pathogens this of course makes citizens happy but it has the disadvantage of changing the population in a way that leaves the economy with a much higher percentage of elderly people and others in poor health this higher level of elderly and medically needy people makes it easy for viruses and other pathogens to make their rounds just as leaving deadwood on the forest floor makes it easier for fires to spread with this rising population of people who cannot support themselves tax rates for the remaining citizens tend to become very high young workers may become discouraged because they do not have enough income remaining after paying taxes to raise their own families in effect they cannot support both their young families and the many old people viewed from this unusual perspective the operation of the chinese coronavirus might even be considered a benefit to society as a whole the world has overcome the impact of measles typhoid polio and many other diseases in some sense it needs a new disease added to its portfolio to replace the ones that have been mostly taken care of by modern medicine in this way pensions and other payments targeting the old and weak don t become too great a burden on the young if the chinese coronavirus were simply allowed to run its course without publicity that it was in any way unusual somewhat less than 1 of the world s population might be expected to die to see what would happen if the chinese coronavirus were to run its course we might look at what happened with the spanish flu back in 1918 at that time doctors did not have a way of treating the virus and authorities downplayed concern for the disease the us center for disease control reports that 500 million people or one third of the world s population became infected at least 50 million people about 10 of those infected died we don t yet know with accuracy how many of those infected will die from the current virus a recent estimate is that about 2 3 of those who are infected will die of the disease based on 107 dying out of 4 600 infected if we assume that the percentage of the population that will ultimately catch the new virus is 30 then the share of the world s population that would be expected to die would be about the un estimates that the world s population can be expected to grow by about 1 05 in 2020 if this is the case the effect of the chinese virus would be to sharply dampen the population increase for the year instead of population rising by 1 05 it would rise by only 0 29 1 05 0 76 assuming all of the deaths associated with the chinese coronavirus take place within a year while this would be a change it would be fairly small temporary change all of these deaths would be tragic for the families involved but in a way they would be less of a problem than the deaths that took place back in 1918 at that time mortality was high for healthy 20 to 40 year olds making the flu particularly disruptive for families the total percentage of the population that died was also much higher about 3 instead of 0 76 a major danger of the virus seems to be one of overreaction today s world economy is fragile china like other countries has a large amount of debt debt defaults related to poor profits of companies closing their operations for a time and workers losing income could easily skyrocket closing down transportation from china would risk pushing the world economy into a very bad recession in fact simply having a very large number of people out sick from work would be expected to have an adverse impact on the economy spending a large amount of money on hospitalizations and face masks cannot compensate for the loss of productivity of the rest of the economy thus the tendency would be toward recession in china even if no action toward cutting off travel were taken china is a huge supplier of goods to the rest of the world in fact in 2016 it used more energy in producing industrial output than the united states india russia and japan combined china s economy has been growing very rapidly since 1990 figure 2 shows this one way in gdp comparisons using inflation adjusted us dollars figure 3 is similar to figure 2 except the growth comparison is made in 2011 purchasing power parity international dollars this adjustment is made because typically the currencies of less developed nations float far below the dollar in terms of what the local currency will buy the inflation adjusted ppp comparison compares output on a basis that is expected to be more consistent with what the local currency will really purchase on this ppp basis china s gdp surpassed the us s gdp in 2014 figure 3 also shows that the united states has slipped from about 20 of the world s gdp to about 15 on this basis we cannot simply cut off trade with china regardless of how bad the situation is china is too big and too important now the rest of the world desperately needs goods and services produced in china in spite of what is going wrong from an illness perspective china plays too key a role in supply chains of many kinds for the country to be left out even cutting off tourism becomes a problem the share of china s revenue from tourism amounted to 11 in 2018 while not all of this would drop off even a dip would lead to lower employment in this part of its economy jet fuel use would drop as well a particular problem today is low prices for many commodities including oil and other fossil fuels these prices are likely to fall further if china s economy falters further we used to hear that the world would run out of oil and that oil prices would rise very high in fact if the people who were concerned about the issue had studied history they would have figured out that a far more likely outcome would be collapse in such a situation prices of many commodities might fall too low revelation 18 11 13 provides a list of a number of commodities including humans sold as slaves for which prices dropped very low at the time of the collapse of ancient babylon the problem is a different squeeze than a high price squeeze it is more of a growing wage disparity problem with fewer and fewer of the world s workers being able to afford the goods and services made by the world economy this problem feeds back to commodity prices that fall too low for producers of many types the problem is an affordability issue rather than one of running out i have written about this issue many times prices of fossil fuels have been low for a very long time essentially since late 2014 opec has cut back its oil production because of low oil prices several us natural gas producers have taken big write offs on natural gas investments china s coal production has remained below its 2013 level because of low prices if china finds it necessary to cut back on production of goods and services for any reason excessive sickness within china visitors aren t traveling to china tariffs customers around the world aren t buying cars this reduction in output would be likely to further lower the prices of commodities more producers would go bankrupt countries exporting products as diverse as oil iron ore copper and lithium might have economic difficulties lower fossil fuel prices may lead to a cutback in their output but it is doubtful that this cutback would be offset by an increase in the production of renewables falling fossil fuel prices would make the price comparison of renewables to fossil fuels look even worse than it does today china has cut back on its subsidies for solar panels and this has led to decreasing chinese solar installations in both 2018 and 2019 the best approach might just be to let the chinese coronavirus run its course authorities might also discourage stories about how awful the illness is today we seem to think that we can fix all problems unfortunately this medical problem doesn t seem to be fixable in the near term we should probably do as governments through the ages have done which is not very much we should not publicize the disease as being a whole lot worse than flu viruses in general for example we should certainly look for inexpensive treatments for the disease for example there seems to be an effort to examine the possibility of using existing antiviral drugs as a treatment it seems like an effort could be made to look into ways of treating the disease at home perhaps using supplemental oxygen for a period in time perhaps a vaccine can be developed individuals around the world should be encouraged to get themselves in as good health as possible so that their own immune systems can fight off pathogens of all types not just this particular virus common sense should be used in washing hands and in avoiding being with sick people i doubt that it makes sense to encourage the use of masks goggles and other protective devices we as individuals cannot live forever on this earth we also cannot spend an unlimited percentage of gdp on health care it becomes too high cost for most citizens at some point we need to call a halt to the expectation that we can fix all problems we live in a world with limited resources we need to start lowering our expectations if we don t want to make our problems worse our finite world

by alejandro werner director of the western hemisphere department of the international monetary fund economic activity in latin america and the caribbean stagnated in 2019 continuing with the weak growth momentum of the previous five years and adding more urgency and new challenges to reignite growth indeed real gdp per capita in the region has declined by 0 6 percent per year on average during 2014 2019 a sharp contrast from the commodity boom s average increase of two percent per year during 2000 2013 this weak momentum reflects structural and cyclical factors on the structural side potential growth remains constrained by low investment slow productivity growth a weak business climate and the low quality of infrastructure and education on the cyclical side growth has been held back by low global growth and commodity prices elevated economic policy uncertainty economic rebalancing in some economies and social unrest in others regional challenges elevated policy uncertainty in several large latin american countries continues to weigh on growth for example uncertainty about the course of economic policy and reforms in brazil and mexico likely contributed to the slowdown in real gdp and investment growth in 2019 continued economic rebalancing in stressed economies that experienced sudden stops in capital flows in 2018 19 argentina ecuador while helping restore internal and external balances have also acted as a drag on economic growth more recently a few countries in the region experienced social unrest bolivia colombia chile and ecuador which in some cases disrupted economic activity economic policy uncertainty has also risen in these countries as governments consider alternative policies and reforms to make growth more inclusive and address social demands outlook and risks as noted in the recent world economic outlook update growth in the region is projected to rebound to 1 6 percent in 2020 and 2 3 percent in 2021 supported by a gradual pick up in global growth and commodity prices continued monetary support reduced economic policy uncertainty and a gradual recovery in stressed economies however there are also prominent downside risks while previous external downside risks have moderated following globally synchronized monetary policy easing and the signing of the u s china phase one trade deal some new risks have appeared including the potential global spread of the coronavirus which could significantly disrupt global economic activity trade and travel domestic and regional downside risks have also intensified social unrest could spike throughout the region while economic policy uncertainty could rise further due to both heightened social tensions and policy slippages policy priorities economic policies will need to strike a balance between rebuilding policy space and maintaining economic stability on the one hand and supporting economic activity and strengthening the social safety net on the other hand although the causes and triggers of social unrest have varied across countries they generally reflect discontent with some aspects of the economic and political systems a key priority going forward is to reignite growth while making it more inclusive promoting competition will be important to avoid monopolistic practices that may hurt the poor disproportionally tackling corruption and weak governance will help make political systems more representative although deeper political reforms may be needed fiscal policy will need to support to growth expand the social safety net and improve the quality of public goods and services however in many countries spending room in the budget remains constrained by high deficits and public debt these countries will need to improve spending efficiency reallocate spending from nonpriority areas to public investment and social transfers and increase revenues over the medium term to finance additional increases in these areas monetary policy can remain accommodative to support growth given the stable inflation outlook well anchored inflation expectations and declining neutral rates worldwide south america in brazil growth remained subdued at 1 2 percent in 2019 but is projected to accelerate to 2 2 percent in 2020 due to improving confidence following the approval of the pension reform and lower monetary policy interest rates in the context of low inflation steady implementation of the government s broad fiscal and structural reform agenda will be essential to safeguard public debt sustainability and boost potential growth in chile the outlook is subject to uncertainty resulting from social unrest and the evolving policy responses to the social demands following a sharp decline in late 2019 economic activity is expected to recover gradually supported by a significant fiscal expansion and looser monetary policy with growth reaching about 1 percent in 2020 in colombia strong domestic demand led to a pickup in growth to 3 3 percent in 2019 and a widening of the current account deficit to 4â½ percent of gdp growth is projected to accelerate to around 3â½ percent in 2020 due to continued monetary support migration from venezuela remittances civil works and higher investment due to recent tax policy changes in peru growth is estimated to have slowed to 2 4 percent in 2019 hampered by lower global trade and under execution of government spending with these factors dissipating in the coming years growth is projected to recover to 3 2 percent in 2020 and 3 7 percent in 2021 with inflation remaining well anchored within the central bank s target range venezuela remains immersed in a deep economic and humanitarian crisis since the end of 2013 real gdp has contracted by 65 percent driven by declining oil production hyperinflation collapsing public services and plummeting purchasing power a continuation of these trends is projected for 2020 although at a slower pace the acute humanitarian crisis has led to one of the largest migratory crises in history with migration to neighboring countries expected to surpass 6 million 20 percent of the population by 2020 mexico central america and the caribbean in mexico economic activity stagnated in 2019 due to policy uncertainty and slower global and u s manufacturing production growth is expected to recover to 1 percent in 2020 as conditions normalize including with the ratification of the trade agreement between the united states mexico and canada usmca and the recent easing of monetary policy which should continue as along as inflation expectations are well anchored fiscal policy should be geared at putting the public debt to gdp ratio on a downward trajectory with priority on increasing revenues improving the efficiency of spending and enhancing the fiscal framework in central america panama and the dominican republic growth is projected to rebound to 3 9 percent in 2020 from 3 2 percent in 2019 supported by the beginning of operations of a large copper mine in panama and accommodative monetary policy in costa rica and the dominican republic in costa rica continued implementation of all measures in the fiscal reform bill will be key to rebuild market confidence and fiscal space in honduras the economic plan includes important efforts to improve institutional governance and anti corruption frameworks supporting business confidence while guatemala is expected to continue benefitting from a fiscal impulse and economic reform plans of the new administration el salvador is already reaping the effects of the pro growth agenda of the new administration inaugurated in june while unfavorable political tensions in nicaragua are creating a significant headwind to economic recovery in the caribbean economic prospects are improving but with substantial variation across countries growth in tourism dependent economies is expected to strengthen in 2020 with commodity prices remaining broadly stable commodity exporters are expected to see modest recovery in growth while large oil discoveries and the start of their production in 2020 is expected to boost growth in guyana the region s exposure to climate risks continues to require strong policies potential growth continues to be impeded by lingering structural problems including high public debt weaker financial systems high unemployment and vulnerability to commodity and climate related shocks some countries have started to strengthen their fiscal positions but further tightening is needed in others to ensure debt sustainability original

acknowledged that there s a risk the outbreak could slow the global economy turning to interest rates the central bank said it would hold short term rates in a range of 1 5 to 1 75 far below levels that were typical during previous expansions powell and other fed officials have indicated that they see that range as low enough to support faster growth and hiring last year the fed cut its benchmark interest rate three times after having raised it four times in 2018 powell credits those rate cuts with revitalizing the housing market which had stumbled early last year and offsetting some

approximately 5 and generate over 200 million in organic fcf when coupled with regular ongoing asset sales however we currently expect total fcf close to 250 million for both 2020 and 2021 which will be used for debt reduction and or go towards d c investments this would allow us to reduce our absolute debt and leverage ratio in both 2020 and 2021 without major asset sales this is a unique

principles management believes that they are useful to an investor in evaluating cnx resources because they are widely used to evaluate a company s operating performance we exclude stock based compensation from adjusted ebitdax because we do not believe it accurately reflects the actual operating expense incurred during the relevant period and may vary widely from period to period irrespective of operating results investors should not view these metrics as a substitute for measures of performance that are calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in addition because all companies do not calculate ebit ebitdax stand alone ebitdax or adjusted ebitdax consolidated identically the presentation here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures

uncertainties relate to among other matters the following prices for natural gas and natural gas liquids are volatile and can fluctuate widely based upon a number of factors beyond our control including oversupply relative to the demand for our products weather and the price and availability of alternative fuels an extended decline in the prices we receive for our natural gas and natural gas liquids affecting our operating results and cash flows our dependence on gathering processing and transportation facilities and other midstream facilities owned by cnxm and others disruption of capacity constraints in or proximity to pipeline systems that could limit sales of our natural gas and natural gas liquids and decreases in availability of third party pipelines or other midstream facilities interconnected to cnxm s gathering systems uncertainties in estimating our economically recoverable natural gas reserves and inaccuracies in our estimates the high risk nature of drilling natural gas wells our identified drilling locations are scheduled out over multiple years making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling the impact of potential as well as any adopted environmental regulations including any relating to greenhouse gas emissions on our operating costs as well as on the market for natural gas and for our securities environmental regulations introduce uncertainty that could adversely impact the market for natural gas with potential short and long term liabilities the risks inherent in natural gas operations including our reliance upon third party contractors being subject to unexpected disruptions including geological conditions equipment failure timing of completion of significant construction or repair of equipment fires explosions accidents and weather conditions that could impact financial results decreases in the availability of or increases in the price of required

chairman jerome powell acknowledged that there s a risk the outbreak could slow the global economy turning to interest rates the central bank said it would hold short term rates in a range of 1 5 to 1 75 far below levels that were typical during previous expansions powell and other fed officials have indicated that they see that range as low enough to support faster growth and hiring last year the fed cut its benchmark interest rate three times after having raised it four times in 2018 powell credits those rate cuts with revitalizing the housing market which had stumbled early last year and

the us s 2 3 expansion last year reported by the commerce department on thursday suggested the white house and republicans massive 1 5 trillion tax cut package which president donald trump had predicted would lift growth above 3 had provided the economy only a temporary boost moderate growth undercuts the argument by trump and his fellow republicans that strong growth would pay for the tax cuts which are expected to help push the federal budget deficit to 1 02 trillion this year growth last year was the slowest since 2016 and followed the 2 9 notched in 2018 white house economic adviser larry kudlow shrugged off the 2019 performance telling fox business network it is a fundamentally healthy economy and expressed confidence that activity will accelerate this year a view not widely shared outside the administration while thursday s snapshot of gross domestic product showed the economy maintaining a moderate pace of growth in the fourth quarter that was in part because of a smaller import bill which has since swelled as the year ended consumer spending cooled considerably last quarter and scope for a rebound looks limited as wage growth appears to have stalled but the longest expansion in history now in its 11th year probably remains on track and a recession is unlikely as the federal reserve s three interest rate cuts in 2019 kick in the fed kept rates unchanged on wednesday fed chair jerome powell told reporters the u s central bank expected moderate economic growth to continue but also nodded to some risks including the recent coronavirus outbreak in china the trump administration s 18 month long trade war with china last year fueled fears of a recession though the economic outlook has improved with this month s signing of a phase 1 deal with beijing economists do not see a boost to the economy as u s tariffs remained in effect on 360 billion of chinese imports about two thirds of the total gross domestic product increased at a 2 1 annualized rate in the fourth quarter matching the third quarter pace also as lower borrowing costs encouraged purchases of houses growth was also supported by increased government spending on defense that helped to offset the drag from a slower pace of inventory accumulation last quarter s rise in gdp growth was in line with economist s expectations economists estimate the speed at which the economy can grow over a long period without igniting inflation at around 1 8 excluding trade inventories and government spending the economy grew at a 1 4 rate in the fourth quarter the slowest in four years this measure of domestic demand rose at a 2 3 pace in the third quarter the economy had very few engines left at year end to keep flying high in 2020 said chris rupkey chief economist at mufg in new york the economy is in a good place only because the trade war made imports so expensive that american businesses and consumers cut back their purchases economists have long disagreed that slashing the corporate tax rate to 21 from 35 as well as shrinking the trade deficit would boost annual gdp growth to 3 0 on an sustainable basis because of low productivity and population growth they also argue that historically there has not been a very strong relationship between corporate tax rates and business investment some companies including apple used their tax windfall for share buybacks the dollar weakened against a basket of currencies while u s treasury prices rose stocks on wall street fell as the coronavirus epidemic heightened concerns about china s economy business investment slumping business investment fell at a 1 5 rate in the fourth quarter it was the third straight quarterly decline and the longest such stretch since 2009 there were decreases last quarter in spending on nonresidential structures such as mining exploration shafts and wells and industrial equipment spending on nonresidential structures contracted in 2019 by the most since 2016 trade tensions have eroded business confidence and weighed on capital expenditure with confidence among chief executive officers remaining low in the fourth quarter after dropping to a 10 year low in the prior quarter a rebound is unlikely soon business investment is also seen pressured by boeing s suspension this month of the production of its troubled 737 max jetliner which was grounded last march following two fatal crashes boeing on wednesday reported its first annual loss since 1997 economists estimate boeing s biggest assembly line halt in more than 20 years could slice at least half a percentage point from first quarter gdp growth growth in consumer spending which accounts for more than two thirds of u s economic activity slowed to a 1 8 pace after rising at a brisk 3 2 rate in the third quarter there was a reduction in spending at restaurants and bars though a separate report from the labor department on thursday showed the number of americans filing claims for state unemployment benefits fell last week the tight labor market is not generating a faster pace of wage growth in the fourth quarter personal income at the disposal of households after adjusting for inflation rose at a 1 5 rate stepping down from a 2 9 pace in the third quarter the decrease in imports in the fourth quarter in part because of u s tariffs on chinese goods compressed the trade deficit that led to trade adding 1 48 percentage points to fourth quarter gdp growth the most since 2009 when trade adds more to growth than consumption you know things are out of whack said joel naroff chief economist at naroff economic advisors in holland pennsylvania last quarter s decline in imports resulted in businesses almost depleting inventories in warehouses a 40 day strike at general motors also weighed on motor vehicle inventories inventories rose at a 6 5 billion rate in the fourth quarter the smallest gain since the second quarter of 2018 after increasing at a 69 4 billion pace in the july september quarter inventory investment chopped 1 09 percentage points from gdp growth last quarter the most since 2018

stated though low natural gas prices weighed on national fuel s first quarter earnings the company saw strong operational results across our integrated diversified business that position us well for future success at the utility our ongoing system modernization program continues to enhance the safety and reliability of our distribution system while at the same time modestly growing rate base and earnings our pipeline and storage business is focused on the execution of our significant expansion opportunities including the line n project placed into service in november and the empire north project which is on schedule for a late summer in service date lastly our exploration and production business continues to successfully develop its assets in pennsylvania and california at a steady pace while navigating the headwinds in the commodity markets fiscal 2020 guidance and business update national fuel is revising its fiscal 2020 earnings guidance to reflect the results of the first quarter and updated forecast assumptions and projections the company is now projecting that earnings will be within the range of 2 95 to 3 15 per share or 3 05 per share at the midpoint of the range substantially all of the decrease in expected earnings is due to the decline in natural gas prices that has occurred since the company s guidance was updated in november 2019 which is expected to lower the price realizations on seneca s appalachian production the company s other earnings guidance assumptions including production remain largely unchanged from the previous guidance the revised earnings guidance now assumes that nymex natural gas prices will average 2 05 per mmbtu for the remaining nine months of fiscal 2020 a decrease of 0 35 per mmbtu from the 2 40 per mmbtu assumed in the previous guidance the company is also lowering its appalachian spot price forecast to 1 70 per mmbtu for the remainder of the fiscal year these price assumptions are intended to reflect the current nymex forward markets for natural gas and oil and consider the impact of local sales point differentials the company currently has financial hedges and fixed price physical firm sales contracts in place on approximately 60 of seneca s remaining expected fiscal 2020 natural gas production that on average lock in a price realization after the cost of transportation of 2 28 per mcf as planned the company dropped a rig in january after completing its latest development pad in tioga county pa in response to the sustained decline in nymex pricing and regional pricing basis the company plans to further reduce its development activity level in appalachia by dropping down to a single drilling rig during the summer of 2020 and deferring some completion activity in the eastern development area to fiscal 2021 coupled with lower service costs seneca s reduced activity level is expected to result in lower capital expenditures in fiscal 2020 and going forward the company now expects exploration and production capital expenditures in fiscal 2020 to be in the range of 375 to 410 million at the midpoint a reduction of 42 5 million from the previous guidance the reduction in activity level is not expected to have a material impact on seneca s production in fiscal 2020 mr bauer added facing the continued deterioration of natural gas prices we are slowing down our development pace in appalachia and intend to move to a single rig drilling program this summer this lower activity level will allow us to reduce our capital expenditures at seneca by approximately 100 million from fiscal 2019 levels maintaining our focus on the balance sheet overall we remain steadfast in our commitment to the responsible development of our integrated appalachian asset base with responsible capital allocation at the heart of our financial decisions additional details on the company s updated forecast assumptions and business segment guidance for fiscal 2020 are outlined in the table on page 7 discussion of first quarter results by segment the following earnings discussion of each operating segment for the quarter ended december 31 2019 is summarized in a tabular form on pages 8 and 9 of this report it may be helpful to refer to those tables while reviewing this discussion as of the quarter ended september 30 2019 the company is no longer reporting the energy marketing operations as a

year relating to hedge ineffectiveness and the impact of a remeasurement in seneca s deferred income taxes under 2017 tax reform that lowered income tax expense and benefited earnings in the prior year see table above excluding these items seneca s first quarter earnings decreased 8 1 million as the positive impacts of higher production and better realized crude oil prices were more than offset by the negative impacts of lower realized natural gas prices higher operating expenses higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate seneca produced 58 4 bcfe during the first quarter an increase of 9 1 bcfe or 19 from the prior year natural gas production increased 9 0 bcf or 20 due primarily to production from new marcellus and utica wells completed and connected to sales in appalachia net production increased 3 8 bcf to 24 9 bcf in seneca s western development area and increased 5 2 bcf to 29 3 bcf in the eastern development area during the first quarter oil production

california seneca s average realized natural gas price after the impact of hedging and transportation costs was 2 32 per mcf a decrease of 0 29 per mcf from the prior year this decline was largely due to lower nymex prices and lower spot pricing at local sales points in pennsylvania seneca s average realized oil price after the impact of hedging was 62 92 per bbl an increase of 1 22 per bbl over the prior year the improvement in oil price realizations was due primarily to stronger hedge prices on brent oil swaps that settled during the quarter when compared to the prior year the 16 8 million increase in seneca s total operating expenses was largely due to the higher production during the quarter lease operating and transportation loe expense which increased 8 2 million includes the fees paid to the company s gathering segment for gathering and compression services used to connect seneca s marcellus and utica production to sales points along interstate pipelines in addition to higher production the 9 4 million increase in depreciation depletion and amortization dd a expense was also due to a higher dd a rate which was driven by an increase in capitalized costs in seneca s full cost pool other taxes decreased 1 7 million in large part due to lower impact fees in pennsylvania the pennsylvania impact fee which is assessed on a per well basis increases and decreases along with the changes in historical nymex natural gas prices additionally seneca s general and administrative g a costs have remained relatively flat as it has increased production on a unit of production basis g a expenses during the quarter decreased 0 05 per mcfe to 0 26 per mcfe the increase in seneca s effective tax rate excluding the impact of the prior year remeasurement of deferred income taxes

earnings decreased 7 0 million versus the prior year as lower operating revenues higher property taxes and the impact of a higher effective income tax rate were only partially offset by lower operation and maintenance o m expenses the 4 8 million decrease in operating revenues was due largely to the expiration of a significant firm transportation contract on the empire system in december 2018 property franchise and other taxes increased 1 0 million due primarily to the scheduled phase out of tax incentives in certain jurisdictions along the empire system the increase in the effective income tax rate which lowered first quarter earnings by 2 5 million was largely due to differences in the book and tax treatment of stock compensation o m expense decreased 0 7 million due primarily to lower personnel expenses and lower compressor and facility maintenance costs gathering segment the gathering segment s operations are carried out by national fuel gas midstream company llc s

year which includes the impact of a remeasurement in the gathering segment s deferred income taxes under 2017 tax reform that lowered income tax expense and benefited earnings in the prior year see table above excluding this item the gathering segment s earnings increased 2 3 million the increase was driven primarily by higher operating revenues which were partially offset by higher o m expense and a modest increase in dd a expense operating revenues increased 5 1 million or 17 due primarily to a 9 7 bcf increase in gathered volumes from seneca s appalachian natural gas production the 1 6 million increase in o m expense was due to an increase in compressor station operating and preventative maintenance activity during the quarter the 0 5 million increase in dd a expense was due primarily to higher average plant assets in service versus the prior year downstream businesses utility segment the utility segment operations are carried out by national fuel gas distribution

warmer weather in the utility segment s service territories was not a significant driver of customer margin or earnings for the quarter in new york which represented 73 of the utility segment s residential and commercial customer throughput during the quarter the impact of weather variations on customer margin and earnings is largely mitigated by that jurisdiction s weather normalization

partially offset by a decrease of 72 000 in the federal deposit insurance premium the increase in the pennsylvania shares tax was primarily due to the imposition of the pennsylvania shares tax related to the bank s new standing as a national association during the second fiscal quarter of 2019 the increase in salaries and employee benefits reflect normal increases to salary and benefits the reduction in the federal deposit insurance premium resulted from the deposit insurance fund reserve ratio exceeding the official required reserve ratio which in turn generates credits to qualified

u s dollars unless otherwise indicated 2 use of non gaap financial measures in addition to reporting financial results in accordance with u s gaap the company provides certain financial measures that are not in accordance with u s gaap non gaap these non gaap financial measures have certain limitations in that they do not have a standardized meaning and thus the company s definition may be different from similar non gaap financial measures used by other companies and or analysts and may differ from period to period thus it may be more difficult to compare the company s financial performance to that of other companies however the company s management compensates for these limitations by providing the relevant disclosure of the items excluded in the calculation of these non gaap financial measures both in its reconciliation to the u s gaap financial measures and its consolidated financial statements all of which should be considered when evaluating the company s results the company uses these non gaap financial measures to supplement the information provided in its consolidated financial statements which are presented in accordance with u s gaap the presentation of non gaap financial measures are not meant to be a substitute for financial measures presented in accordance with u s gaap but rather should be evaluated in conjunction with and as a supplement to such u s gaap measures opentext strongly encourages investors to review its financial information in its entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure the company therefore believes that despite these limitations it is appropriate to supplement the disclosure of the u s gaap measures with certain non gaap measures defined below non gaap based net income and non gaap based eps attributable to opentext are consistently calculated as gaap based net income or earnings per share attributable to opentext on a diluted basis excluding the effects of the amortization of acquired intangible assets other income expense share based compensation and special charges recoveries all net of tax and any tax benefits expense items unrelated to current period income as further described in the tables below non gaap based gross profit is the arithmetical sum of gaap based gross profit and the amortization of acquired technology based intangible assets and share based compensation within cost of sales non gaap based gross margin is calculated as non gaap based gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue non gaap based income from operations is calculated as income from operations excluding the amortization of acquired intangible assets special charges recoveries and share based compensation expense adjusted earnings loss before interest taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda is consistently calculated as gaap based net income attributable to opentext excluding interest income expense provision for income taxes depreciation and amortization of acquired intangible assets other income expense share based compensation and special charges recoveries the company s management believes that the presentation of the above defined non gaap financial measures provides useful information to investors because they portray the financial results of the company before the impact of certain non operational charges the use of the term non operational charge is defined for this purpose as an expense that does not impact the ongoing operating decisions taken by the company s management these items are excluded based upon the way the company s management evaluates the performance of the company s business for use in the company s internal reports and are not excluded in the sense that they may be used under u s gaap the company does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle and therefore believes that the presentation of non gaap measures which in certain cases adjust for the impact of amortization of intangible assets and the related tax effects that are primarily related to acquisitions will provide readers of financial statements with a more consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and be more useful in helping readers understand the company s operating results and underlying operational trends additionally the company has engaged in various restructuring activities over the past several years primarily due to acquisitions that have resulted in costs associated with reductions in headcount consolidation of leased facilities and related costs all which are recorded under the company s special charges recoveries caption on the consolidated statements of income each restructuring activity is a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives or circumstances and each differs in terms of its operational implementation business impact and scope and the size of each restructuring plan can vary significantly from period to period therefore the company believes that the exclusion of these special charges recoveries will also better aid readers of financial statements in the understanding and comparability of the company s operating results and underlying operational trends in summary the company believes the provision of supplemental non gaap measures allow investors to evaluate the operational and financial performance of the company s core business using the same evaluation measures that management uses and is therefore a useful indication of opentext s performance or expected performance of future operations and facilitates period to period comparison of operating performance although prior performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance as a result the company considers it appropriate and reasonable to provide in addition to u s gaap measures supplementary non gaap financial measures that exclude certain items from the presentation of its financial results the following charts provide unaudited reconciliations of u s gaap based financial measures to non u s gaap based financial measures for the following periods presented reconciliation of selected gaap based measures to non gaap based measures for the three months ended december 31

provision rate of approximately 30 and a non gaap based tax rate of approximately 14 these rate differences are due to the income tax effects of items that are excluded for the purpose of calculating

slow steady growth for u s economy published friday january 31 2020 the following is from william a strauss and kelley sarussi with the federal reserve bank of chicago the federal reserve bank of chicago held its 33rd annual economic outlook symposium on dec 13 more than 140 economists and analysts from business academia and government attended the conference this chicago fed letter reviews participants forecasts for 2019 from the previous symposium and then analyzes their forecasts for 2020 in the third quarter of 2019 the u s economy entered the 11th year of its expansion making this the longest expansion in u s history while the nation s real gross domestic product gdp is at its highest level ever the rate of economic growth since the end of the great recession in mid 2009 has been quite restrained during the 41 quarters following the second quarter of 2009 the annualized rate of real gdp growth was 2 3 percent somewhat above what is considered the long term rate of growth for the u s economy the economy expanded by 2 5 percent in 2018 a bit higher than the current expansion s average however the economy was challenged by a significant drop in the stock market as the year came to a close the standard poor s 500 stock market index fell dramatically between sept 21 and dec 24 2018 losing 19 8 percent of its value this led to concerns by some about a potential recession in 2019 yet back in 1966 nobel prize winning economist paul samuelson wrote that wall street indexes predicted nine out of the last five recessions indicating that declines in the stock market are not necessarily reliable signals for imminent economic downturns the negative signals of late 2018 also turned out to be incorrect and the market began rising again in late december by the end of april 2019 the s p 500 had recovered the entire drop in its value the annualized rate of real gdp growth was 3 1 percent in the first quarter of 2019 and then in part challenged by increased tariffs and threats of additional tariffs it decelerated to 2 percent in the second quarter and 2 1 percent in the third quarter the moderation in economic growth in 2019 was largely due to slowing business investment likely resulting from heightened uncertainty surrounding trade policy real business fixed investment which had expanded at a strong 5 9 percent pace in 2018 grew at a very weak annualized rate of 3 percent over the first three quarters of 2019 after registering a growth rate of 4 4 percent in 2018 real residential investment grew at an annualized rate of just 2 percent during the first three quarters of 2019 moreover the annualized rate of housing starts was 1 27 million units for the first 11 months of 2019 up 6 percent compared with the same period in 2018 in contrast consumer spending expanded at a solid pace in 2019 real personal consumption expenditures grew at an annualized rate of 2 9 percent during the first three quarters of 2019 above the 2 6 percent rate recorded in 2018 the pace of light vehicle sales car and light truck sales was 16 9 million units in 2019 1 6 percent lower than the selling rate in 2018 after averaging 67 19 during the first 10 months of 2018 west texas intermediate oil prices moved down sharply in the final two months of that year the average price of oil fell from 70 60 per barrel in october 2018 to 49 14 per barrel in december 2018 in 2019 oil prices did move above 50 per barrel averaging 56 99 per barrel for the year with relatively lower oil prices more consumers continued to purchase larger less fuel efficient vehicles than in the year before sales of light trucks including sport utility vehicles were up 2 7 percent in 2019 compared with the previous year while sales of passenger cars were down 10 8 percent this shift in consumer demand which continued a trend from the past couple of years led to a record setting share for light trucks of 72 4 percent of overall light vehicle sales in 2019 industrial production had an annualized growth rate of 9 percent over the first 11 months of 2019 in stark contrast with its growth rate of 4 percent in 2018 the deterioration in industrial production was largely due to weakening business investment on an annualized basis growth in real government spending was 3 1 percent over the first three quarters of 2019 well above its average annual rate of 1 2 percent over the past 20 years against this backdrop the u s economy continued to increase employment in 2019 2 11 million jobs were added last year moreover in the final quarter of 2019 the unemployment rate stood at 3 5 percent below most economists estimates of the natural rate of unemployment i e the rate that would prevail in an economy making full use of its productive resources inflation as measured by the consumer price index cpi decreased from a 2 2 percent reading in 2018 to a year over year rate of 2 percent in november 2019 the consensus forecast for 2020 is for the pace of economic growth to be close to the long term average in 2020 the growth rate of real gdp is forecasted to be 1 7 percent lower than the projected 2 2 percent rate for 2019 the quarterly outlook reveals a fairly steady expected performance throughout 2020 close to the annual pace for real gdp growth the unemployment rate is predicted to remain relatively steady at or near a very low 3 7 percent for each quarter through the end of 2020 inflation as measured by the cpi is predicted to tick up from an estimated 1 9 percent in 2019 to 2 percent in 2020 according to the eos consensus forecast oil prices are projected to edge higher throughout 2020 real personal consumption expenditures are forecasted to expand at a pace of 2 percent in 2020 somewhat slower than in 2019 light vehicle sales are expected to fall to 16 6 million units this year the pace of real business fixed investment growth which has averaged 3 percent over the past 20 years is anticipated to improve to a still modest 1 8 percent in 2020 industrial production is forecasted to grow by 9 percent this year below its long run average rate of growth the housing sector is predicted to improve modestly and continue its extremely slow march toward normalization in 2020 the growth rate of real residential investment is forecasted to move up to 1 percent in 2020 from 7 percent in 2019 and housing starts are anticipated to edge up to 1 28 million units in 2020 nearly in line with the 20 year annual average of roughly 1 27 million starts the one year treasury rate is expected to edge up to 1 69 percent in 2020 and the 10 year treasury rate is forecasted to increase to 1 95 percent the trade weighted u s dollar is predicted to rise 2 7 percent in 2020 and the nation s trade deficit i e net exports of goods and services is anticipated to increase to a little over 1 trillion by the final quarter of 2020 diane swonk chief economist grant thornton llp presented a generally positive outlook for u s consumers in 2020 according to her projection growth in real consumer spending is expected to be slightly above 2 percent this year she indicated that this forecast is supported by a strong labor market overall employment levels were high last year even with the average monthly jobs gain 20 percent lower in 2019 than in 2018 swonk attributed some of this slowdown to increased uncertainty surrounding trade policy in addition she noted that employment growth had been held back in part by a shortage of workers in some sectors such as trucking and by reduced demand for labor in others such as retail as they did in 2019 the monthly jobs gains are predicted to slow somewhat but remain solid in 2020 according to swonk relatedly real wage growth is anticipated to be flat in 2020 she said workers in entry level positions have seen their wage growth picking up in recent years she observed yet those in managerial jobs have experienced slowing wage growth moreover last summer there were upticks in unemployment and underemployment among new college graduates more of the same is predicted for 2020 indicated swonk in addition to the overall healthy labor market the low interest rate environment is helping to keep consumer spending growing swonk suggested historically low mortgage rates are expected to lead to more home sales in 2020 and low mortgage rates should continue to encourage current homeowners to refinance their mortgages freeing up funds to be spent on other goods swonk did discuss a few downside risks to her outlook for u s consumers in 2020 credit market conditions tightened in 2019 as evidenced by the drop in credit card application approvals last summer swonk also pointed out that credit card and auto loan defaults increased last year if more such tightening and defaults are seen in 2020 consumer spending could be more muted than anticipated heavy machinery jim meil principal industry analysis americas commercial transportation research co llc shared his outlook for the heavy machinery industry in 2020 according to meil u s heavy machinery shipments are projected to be flat to slightly lower this year given the headwinds facing the nation s manufacturing industry as well as its agricultural construction and energy sectors manufacturing output in the u s expanded by nearly 3 percent in 2018 said meil but manufacturing production shrank in 2019 through october 2019 its year to date growth rate was 1 5 percent he noted moreover in august 2019 the institute for supply management s manufacturing pmi purchasing managers index fell below 50 percent which is suggestive of a contraction in the manufacturing sector and stayed there the rest of the year given that manufacturing activity declined in 2019 meil said he projects u s industrial machinery shipments to be flat in 2020 after rising by 3 percent last year next meil turned his attention to the farm construction and energy sectors all of which rely on heavy machinery for their output he said that corn soybean and wheat prices had all fallen in recent years in large part because of the trade war between the u s and china and a surplus of crops until crop exports rise again farm machinery demand is anticipated to continue slipping building activity was fairly flat in 2019 and it is expected to be steady yet again in 2020 meil indicated so little is driving up construction equipment demand meil also noted that volatile movements of crude oil prices over the past few years had stalled the recovery in u s mining and energy equipment sales from their 2016 nadir he contended that until there is some assurance that oil prices will stay above 50 per barrel longer term demand for such equipment is likely to continue to slide meil said he predicts declines ranging from 5 percent to 8 percent for shipments of u s farm construction and mining and oil field equipment in 2020 with regard to heavy machinery exports meil commented that a stronger u s dollar weaker growth in industrial output in the european union and india and higher trade barriers are all hurting heavy machinery sales to foreign customers conclusion in 2019 the u s economy expanded at a pace just above the long term average the economy is forecasted to grow at a slower pace in 2020 than in 2019 though still near its long run trend according to eos participants business investment and the housing sector are projected to improve in 2020 the unemployment rate is expected to stay low at around 3 7 percent through the end of 2020 and inflation is predicted to move up slightly to 2 percent return to top of page

limited optimism in the performance of global financial markets especially stocks contributed to the decline in gold prices to the 1563 level after the announcement of monetary policy decisions from the u s federal reserve bank the price of the us dollar declined so gold found the opportunity to rise again to the 1578 level in the beginning of thursday s trading all eyes of the world are on the results of the emergency meeting of the world health organization in which the implications of the corona virus and its global spread are discussed the us central bank kept the interest rate at 1 75 unchanged as was strongly expected from the markets and the bank stressed its adherence to its policy as long as the country s economic performance is constantly improving bank governor jerome powell indicated in his press conference to monitor the repercussions of the corona virus on the global economy and consequently on the us economy to take action if things worsened despite the bank s decision investors seem to increasingly believe that the fed will feel compelled to cut interest rates again later this year the odds of a cut in the fed meeting in september have risen to about 56 according to fedwatch which is up from 37 just a month ago many economists and investors had hoped that u s and global growth would rise this year especially after the united states and china signed a preliminary trade agreement that removed some tariffs of chinese goods in the same context the international monetary fund said last week that lower interest rates and easing trade tensions are likely to boost the global economy over the next two years and help boost steady growth even if it was a modest one but the coronavirus outbreak in china has raised new doubts and more negative consequences of the virus will slow the chinese economy the second largest in the world which has already started to slow down the virus has now infected more people in china sars ddi in 2002 2003 according to the technical analysis of gold on the daily chart gold prices are still moving inside an ascending channel and the persistence of global tensions from the corona virus may support more gains for the yellow metal and bulls are still aiming to push prices to the 1611 psychological resistance the highest level for seven years and even breaking through it on the downside the closest support levels for gold prices are now 1568 1555 and 1540 respectively as for the economic calendar data today gold prices will interact with the bank of england s announcement of its monetary policy and then the us economic growth rate for the last quarter of 2019
workers at ford trucks assembly line at a ford kentucky truck plant in louisville associated press the us economy missed the trump administration s 3 growth target for a second straight year posting its slowest annual growth in three years in 2019 as the slump in business investment deepened amid damaging trade tensions the lofty growth goal has remained elusive despite the white house and republicans 1 5 trillion tax cut package which president donald trump had predicted would lift growth persistently above that threshold the economy grew 2 3 last year the commerce department said on thursday that was the slowest since 2016 and followed the 2 9 growth notched in 2018 while the department s snapshot of gross domestic product showed the economy maintaining a moderate pace of growth in the fourth quarter that was in part because of a smaller import bill which is unsustainable consumer spending slowed considerably last quarter and that could persist with wage growth appearing to have stalled but the longest expansion in history now in its 11th year probably remains on track and a downturn is unlikely as the federal reserve s three interest rate cuts in 2019 kick in the fed kept rates unchanged on wednesday fed chair jerome powell told reporters the us central bank expected moderate economic growth to continue but also nodded to some risks including the recent coronavirus outbreak in china the new decade will bring about sub potential gdp growth around 1 7 as numerous headwinds keep businesses sidelined while households reduce their outlays in line with gently cooling income said gregory daco chief us economist at oxford economics in new york the trump administration s 18 month long trade war with china last year fueled fears of a recession though the economic outlook has improved with this month s signing of a phase 1 deal with beijing economists do not see a boost to the economy as us tariffs remained in effect on 360 billion of chinese imports about two thirds of the total gross domestic product increased at a 2 1 annualized rate in the fourth quarter matching the third quarter pace also as lower borrowing costs encouraged purchases of houses growth was also supported by increased government spending on defense that helped to offset the drag from a slower pace of inventory accumulation economists polled by reuters had forecast gdp rising at a 2 1 rate in the fourth quarter excluding trade inventories and government spending the economy grew at a 1 4 rate in the fourth quarter the slowest in four years this measure of domestic demand rose at a 2 3 pace in the third quarter economists estimate the speed at which the economy can grow over a long period without igniting inflation at around 1 8 the white house claimed that slashing the corporate tax rate to 21 from 35 as well as shrinking the trade deficit would boost annual gdp growth to 3 0 on an sustainable basis and pay for the tax cuts economists have long

the central bank said it would hold short term rates in a range of 1 5 to 1 75 far below levels that were typical during previous expansions powell and other fed officials have indicated that they see that range as low enough to support faster growth and hiring last year the fed cut its benchmark interest rate three times after having raised it four times in 2018 powell credits those rate cuts with

results are not an appropriate base from which to project annual results non gaap financial measures the following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap as well as certain non gaap financial measures such as ongoing return on equity roe electric margin natural gas margin ongoing earnings and ongoing diluted eps generally a non gaap financial measure is a measure of a company s financial performance financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are adjusted from measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap xcel energy s management uses non gaap measures for financial planning and analysis for reporting of results to the board of directors in determining performance based compensation and communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors non gaap financial measures are intended to supplement investors understanding of our performance and should not be considered alternatives for financial measures presented in accordance with gaap these measures are discussed in more detail below and may not be comparable to other companies similarly titled non gaap financial measures ongoing roe ongoing roe is calculated by dividing the net income or loss of xcel energy or each subsidiary adjusted for certain nonrecurring items by each entity s average stockholder s equity we use these non gaap financial measures to evaluate and provide details of earnings results electric and natural gas margins electric margin is presented as electric revenues less electric fuel and purchased power expenses natural gas margin is presented as natural gas revenues less the cost of natural gas sold and transported expenses incurred for electric fuel and purchased power and the cost of natural gas are generally recovered through various regulatory recovery mechanisms as a result changes in these expenses are generally offset in operating revenues management believes electric and natural gas margins provide the most meaningful basis for evaluating our operations because they exclude the revenue impact of fluctuations in these expenses these margins can be reconciled to operating income a gaap measure by including other operating revenues cost of sales other operating and maintenance o m expenses conservation and demand side management dsm expenses depreciation and amortization and taxes other than income taxes earnings adjusted for certain items ongoing earnings and ongoing diluted eps gaap diluted eps reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other agreements to issue common stock i e common stock equivalents were settled the weighted average number of potentially dilutive shares outstanding used to calculate xcel energy inc s diluted eps is calculated using the treasury stock method ongoing earnings reflect adjustments to gaap earnings net income for certain items ongoing diluted eps is calculated by dividing the net income or loss of each subsidiary adjusted for certain items by the weighted average fully diluted xcel energy inc common shares outstanding for the period ongoing diluted eps for each subsidiary is calculated by dividing the net income or loss of such subsidiary adjusted for certain items by the weighted average fully diluted xcel energy inc common shares outstanding for the period we use these non gaap financial measures to evaluate and provide details of xcel energy s core earnings and underlying performance we believe these measurements are useful to investors to evaluate the actual and projected financial performance and contribution of our subsidiaries for the three and twelve months ended dec 31 2019 and 2018 there were no such adjustments to gaap earnings and therefore gaap earnings equal ongoing earnings for these periods note 1 earnings per share summary the following summarizes diluted eps for xcel energy three months ended december

by chris turner global head of strategy and head of emea and latam research ing team parallels to sars ever since 7 january when chinese authorities confirmed that they had identified a new virus global financial markets have increasingly taken notice of the coronavirus this follows the us iran conflict and further threatens to undermine what was expected to be a gradual rebound of the global economy in 2020 of course we do not know for sure but any potential spreading of the virus across the globe â currently the virus has already been reported in 18 countries from asia to north america â could last until march april and mark a new downside risk to the global economy in the first half of 2020 the fact that the world health organization has said that the coronavirus comes from the same family of viruses as sars and mers have prompted comparisons with the sars outbreak in 2003 at the time the news of the sars outbreak only hit financial headlines in march 2003 and then dominated the headlines for an eight week period we can only hope that containment measures prevent an acceleration in the number of cases identified and that the mortality rate does not rise above current reported levels of 4 in economic terms however the global economy has become more integrated and intertwined since 2003 global air traffic for example is currently more than twice as big as in 2003 also contrary to 2003 when chinese tourism was mainly inbound oriented chinese tourists have become a significant driver of global tourism consequently the speed of the virus spreading could be faster than in 2003 while at the same time the negative impact on global growth could also be higher than in 2003 fig 1 coronavirus hits the headlines bloomberg ing what weaker chinese growth means for trading partners as iris pang notes the largest impact on chinese consumption will come through retail sales travel tourism and clearly the ability of chinese residents to return to work sars is believed to have knocked 1 0 off chinese gdp back in 2003 but the huge uncertainty around the spread of the coronavirus makes the macro impact very difficult to forecast a study by jong wha lee and warwick j mckibbin from the korea university and the australian national university found that the full impact of sars on the global economy came close to usd 40 bn in 2003 taking second round effects between sectors into account accurate forecasting of that impact will take time but clearly slowing chinese domestic demand will impact the global economy â just as it is trying to recover from the effects of the 2018 19 trade war just think of the fact that for some global hotel chains or companies of luxury goods china and greater asia account already for 10 to 20 percent of their annual sales the precise extent to which a weaker chinese economy impacts its global trading partners will also be uncertain but a 2016 imf study may offer some insights here even though the study focused on the spill over effects of chinaâ s maturing economy one of the simulations included a chinese cyclical slowdown prompted by financial stress â that stress triggered by â a credit event a re assessment of growth prospects or another shock â the impact of a 1 cyclical slowdown in china is largely felt in the apac region where trade linkages are the highest and also in the commodity producing countries notably the fall out on the us economy was seen as limited possibly resurrecting the narrative of wider us rest of world growth differentials â a dollar bullish story fig 2 who would suffer the most from a chinese slowdown imf ing commodities china is the kingpin china is the kingpin of the global commodities market the longer factories remain closed travel restricted and construction stalled the larger the ramification for commodities demand this asset class has seen a massive sell off since the outbreak of coronavirus in china at the time of writing copper prices have fallen by 8 5 from their mid january peak singapore iron ore has collapsed more than 6 and ice brent plunged by nearly 10 it is very hard to say how quickly this virus will spread but suffice to say we see mounting pressure on commodities however the level of damage to their market price will also depend on their exposure to china and their own fundamental story fig 3 chinaâ s share in oil and iron ore demand eia world steel association ing copper and iron ore vulnerable opec may support crude looking first at the metals the key question is how long will travel restrictions last and when construction and industrial activities resume a prolonged delay would have an impact on supply chains this would likely feed through to major sectors where metals demand has significant relevance including infrastructure property construction automotive and other manufacturing industries copper has relatively healthier fundamentals than the rest as a result of tightened supply in global mine production last year and production growth is expected to be largely muted this year the market had expected to see demand recover from china in 2020 supporting a constructive fundamental picture copper is regarded as the economic barometer and china accounts for 50 of global copper usage however with the absence of china demand short term downbeat sentiment may be exacerbated since some investors tend to short copper to express bearishness on the global macro view for iron ore china accounts for 70 of the global seaborne market should the coronavirus prompt a long delay in construction activities any demand pick up in iron ore may be postponed on the oil side wider travel restrictions are apparently hitting oil demand through jet fuels gasoil and other middle distillates within china along with any spillover across the region overall the global transportation industry accounts for around half of the demand for global crude imports â and has been rising rapidly concerns are unsurprisingly reflected in refinery margins which continue to trade at depressed levels in fact the spot gasoil crack in nw europe is trading under us 10 bbl now levels last seen in early 2017 the weakness in gasoil cracks has surprised many given the broadly constructive view held due to imo 2020 shipping regulations however as oil sink lowers there is increasing pressure for opec to extend cuts through until at least mid year and that may provide some psychological support however the opec members will be watching developments in libya closely any extended outage there would mean less need to curtail supply amongst the rest of opec fig 4 copper and brent suffer as they did during sars in 2003 bloomberg ing fx commodity currency rally postponed events in china impact the global currency markets via two channels 1 the risk channel as global growth concerns hit equity markets and b the commodity channel given the importance of china in global commodity demand in the chart below we blend the two channels unsurprisingly in the g10 space it is aud nzd and nok as well as cad that stand out given their high beta to risk and the commodity nature of the currencies we continue to see aud nzd and nok as the most exposed if market sentiment remains weak with our commodities team seeing larger downside to metals than oil prices where opec may extend cuts versus a softer floor under metal prices aud looks the most vulnerable among these currencies supporting this view is also the prospect of rba easing over the next months we expect a cut in 1q and the ongoing bushfire emergency which may have a sizeable impact on the australian economy all this underlines our preference for lower aud nzd in the relative value space where we look for a decline to aud nzd 1 02 among scandies this means lower nok sek as sek exposure to commodity prices is limited among the majors jpy and usd should continue their out performance given their safe haven characteristics we look for a lower eur usd as the dollar continues to benefit from its safe haven appeal while the open eurozone economy is more vulnerable to any impact on the global economy the story of us exceptionalism growth outperformance may return as well as long as the situation will be seen as unresolved the skew to both risk appetite and commodity prices remains on the downside with g10 commodity currencies largely reversing all their december gains at the time caused by anticipation of the phase one deal this currency segment is now as undervalued as it was prior to the december rally still unless both risk sentiment and commodity prices stabilize a sustainable rebound is unlikely at this point as for em fx we have observed a similar pattern to g10 deteriorating risk sentiment is weighing on the generally higher beta em fx where the currencies with a commodity exposure are leading the losses clp rub or zar while asian fx remains vulnerable due to its direct trade links to china it is the higher beta commodity exposed em fx leading the losses partly because the managed decline in cny is limiting the spillover into regional em asia currencies should the situation deteriorate we would expect the same pattern to continue with commodity em fx leading the losses typically latam fx and its big metals exposure perform poorly in this environment fig 5 commodity currencies appear the most vulnerable unctad bloomberg ing rates low or lower rates with flatter curves market psychology is an important starting point as we progressed towards the end of 2019 there were numerous good reasons for the 10yr us yield to attempt a break back above 2 but despite elevated us consumer confidence tight labour market and an improved trade war narrative that break higher never really materialised we saw this from the structure of the curve too as the 5yr remained very rich to 2â s and 10â s which is a classic sign that a preference was there to test the downside rather than the upside this is why backed by weak pmis our projections pitched a lower rates bias fast forward to january 2020 and it has just taken a flu from china to cause a significant move down to 1 6 that is not to underplay the event as one thing we do know is we are at the beginning of an event that could easily stretch for months the sars virus is a go to template as there are more similarities than differences and it stretched from november 2002 to june 2003 remarkably back then the fed funds rate was very similar to where it is today 1 75 it had been cut from 6 5 on the dot com crash and ultimately got down to 1 after the flu had faded it is not easy to break out precise market reactions but before the flu had receded the 10yr yield had fallen from around 4 down to a little under 3 25 part of this was the virus but a large part was also the other background noise the curve was already steep c 200bp and only steepened further on the final fed cut to 1 away from the virus itself it is interesting to note the difference in the shape of the 2 10yr curve 200bp and the level of the 10yr yield back then 4 compared to now where we have a 20bp sub 2 combo â a good illustration of the excess of demand oversupply that is driving yields today so there are numerous nuances to consider as we examine the current circumstances first and foremost rates were already in a stressed mode before the flu virus narrative hit and the subsequent move has confirmed the path of least resistance â lower rates second risk assets have been worried about a catalyst that could take back the outsized gains made in 2019 and this virus event is as good a catalyst as any that vulnerability can become circular and push core rates even lower however letâ s not get carried away here it does not mean we need to push our 1 5 target for the 10yr lower though for that to happen weâ d need to see a more definitive turn for the worse from a eurozone perspective this is the last thing the ecb needs europe is already down with germany and italy at the bottom of the spectrum of contemporaneous growth observations as the ecb practically is out of bullets the german 10yr yield has shot down to almost 40bp that said the treasury bund spread has tightened which means that the move in us treasuries has been more significant there is already a deep negative discount in the price for eurozone bonds but with the likely ecb standing pat at 50bp there is a limit to how bad things can get for that to change again weâ d need to see a clear turn for the worse on the virus impact bottom line market rates are likely to remain low at about current levels or lower in the coming weeks and likely months curves will maintain a flattening bias as central bank action is unlikely given what we know so far reversion to higher rates would need evidence that there has been a positive turn of the tide in the meantime an information vacuum perception sustains vulnerability credit rollercoaster european credit spreads widened significantly earlier in the week on the back of the virus news however it seems spreads have simmered now this all comes after we have seen some substantial performance in january with spreads tightening down to the lower levels seen in 2019 this was in line with our mildly bullish view on credit for 2020 driven by a swing in technicals lower net supply and of course cspp we stand by our long term call of tighter spreads and flatter curves but of course the coronavirus is a potential threat as for the underperformance autos were hit worst as well as the longer end of the curve causing some steepening the chinese car market the largest in the world is very important for european car producers 2019 had been a dismal year for chinese car sales and further spreading of the virus could dampen any hope of a recovery this year pressuring spreads further in addition wuhan accounts for a sizeable portion of the chinese car production energy and some consumer names were also amongst the worst performers on monday it is clear that if things are set to get worse it will be these higher beta names that will underperform most significantly for instance the consumer sector is looking tighter compared to the industrials particularly because they have traded very in line in the past we may see consumers pull back up to this level we therefore stand by our call for being overweight non cyclical of course if the news turns more positive we will likely see euro spreads return down to the tight spreads we saw last week in em credit space the fallout has been limited on balance credit spreads widened by 17bp based on bloomberg barclays em usd aggregate index over the last week but this has been matched by a decrease in underlying core rates with us 10yr treasuries also rallying 15bp meaning that all in

after experiencing a whole year with a far right president as head of state in brazil namely jair bolsonaro we have to try and understand the steps that led to this situation i arrived in sao paulo the financial and economic capital of brazil on the night of 14 november 2019 the city has over 12 million inhabitants in all the districts i visited poverty is flagrant you see homeless people living on the street with no access to sanitation of any kind and prey to the most extreme poverty a significant number of people are undernourished reliable sources mention about 100 000 people who live on the streets of sao paulo 25 000 of them permanently and 75 000 on a temporary basis i first came to sao paulo in december 1991 to participate in the first congress of the workers party partido dos trabalhadores or pt led by the former metal worker lula at that time lula and the pt stood for the struggle against odious and illegitimate debt he said among other things â any third world government that decides to further repay the external debt chooses to lead his people into the abyss lula had led workers strikes against the dictatorship in the 1980s and in 1988 a â democratic regime replaced the dictatorship after a transitional stage the bases of the main trade union federation cut central ãšnica de trabalhadores or unified workers central and of the new party the pt had been brought together during the valiant struggle against the dictatorship the pt had been built from the bottom by activists in social movements and small very active politically radical organizations the cut and the pt were against repaying debt and wanted a citizens audit part of the debt had been accumulated during the military dictatorship which lasted more than 20 years and afterwards it increased steeply during the debt crisis in the 1980s a crisis that resulted from commodity prices plummeting while washington had decided on a sharp increase in interest rates more generally the pt clearly stated that radical anti capitalist policies had to be implemented which were to lead to the construction of a democratic socialist self managed and anti bureaucratic society this outcome stirred genuine enthusiasm in brazil and beyond i went to sao paulo in 1991 in order to prepare lula s and another pt leader marco aurelio garcia s visit to belgium at the invitation of the cadtm the talks were to take place some ten days before christmas 1991 eventually for health reasons lula couldn t come over and was replaced by marco aurelio garcia who became president of the pt in 2006 and was lula s main adviser on foreign policy while lula was president from 2003 to 2011 i met lula four or five times from 1991 to 2003 i can remember a long discussion we had in havana in 1993 it followed upon a meeting lula had had with fidel castro and daniel ortega lula explained that in order to become president of brazil he had to neutralize us imperialism the army and the brazilian bourgeoisie i understood that he meant not to thwart us strategic interests and to promise the army leadership and big capital that he would implement no measures that went against their interests lula told me that he would be the president of all brazilians as was all too often said what i understood was that he would use his experience as a trade unionist to seal a pact between those at the bottom and those at the top asking those at the top to concede some improvements in purchasing power i e allowing the state to increase social aid with public money while those at the bottom would accept that nothing would really change at the structural level this is indeed what he attempted to do when he was president ten years later during the 1990s the position of the pt and the cut was gradually watered down i saw him for the last time in june 2003 and stated how much i disapproved of the neoliberal reform he had introduced into the civil service pension system the meeting occurred on the occasion of the g8 annual summit united states canada japan germany united kingdom france italy russia in evian on 1 and 2 june 2003 several heads of states that did not belong to the g8 had been invited by the french president jacques chirac who wished to show that the g8 and france in particular were open to dialogue with the rest of the world among those who had responded positively were president lula of brazil and the heads of states or governments of china india nigeria senegal south africa egypt and mexico chirac was trying to give legitimacy to the g8 an informal club of major global powers at a time when its credibility was in question particularly after the brutal repression of the counter g8 protest in genoa in 2001 president chirac s guests met in evian before the actual g8 summit meeting while over 100 000 marched through the streets of geneva switzerland and annemasse france shouting â g8 is illegal luis inacio lula da silva wanted to meet leaders of the european anti globalization movements there were four delegates the president of attac france a woman representative of the italian social forum a swedish woman representative of the campaign against the wto and myself for the cadtm the meeting occurred in geneva in the residence of the brazilian ambassador and it highlighted the gap between lula and the international anti globalization movements changes in the pt and the cut to qualify this highly critical assessment it should be mentioned that the lula government developed a policy of public aid to the poorest through the distribution of social benefits under the programme entitled bolsa familia it should be pointed out that during the 1990s the position of the pt and the cut was gradually watered down the pt won many elected officials in large cities as well as in small and medium sized towns in particular the pt had mayors elected in sao paulo and porto alegre where it gradually adopted a managerial orientation and lost its role as a spur to radical anti capitalist changes i followed this process of adaptation to the institutions of the capitalist state with great disappointment when lula was elected president of brazil at the end of 2002 with a landslide 65 of the votes he and the pt had fundamentally changed they no longer really questioned the capitalist system and lula signed a letter of submission to the imf in the middle of the election campaign in august 2002 in this letter he solemnly declared that if elected president he would abide strictly by the previous government s agreements with the imf only a couple of months after his election he introduced a neoliberal reform of retirement pensions lula also appointed as president of the central bank one of the big bosses henrique meirelles former president of one of the major us banks in brazil the fleet boston the message was clear a representative of the capitalist class was at the head of the central bank lula did not interfere with the army and did not suspend the amnesty extended to those officers of the dictatorship responsible for crimes against humanity this is a major difference with argentina where the 1986 amnesty was cancelled in 2005 which made it possible to condemn and incarcerate several military leaders including the major figures of the military dictatorship enforced in 1976 under the lula presidency the brazilian army participated in the occupation of haiti which was denounced by haitian social movements the top brazilian military leader during the occupation of haiti became a member of bolsonaro s government in 2019 under lula s presidency not a single private corporation was brought back into the public sector on the contrary he supported the interests of private corporations that did not hesitate to bribe civil servants in order to secure procurements as was the case for the emblematic construction company odebrecht the lula government scrupulously repaid its debts without carrying out the audit he had called for when he was in the opposition to qualify this highly critical assessment it should be mentioned that the lula government developed a policy of public aid to the poorest through the distribution of social benefits under the programme entitled bolsa familia family grant this programme improved the income of more than 12 million families i e about 20 of brazil s poorest families please note that the amount of aid was limited at the time of the pt government a family of three could receive a maximum of 50 euros it should be noted that bolsonaro has not stopped this programme which in 2019 benefited 13 5 million families i e one fifth of brazilian families in 2019 a poor family could receive a maximum of 200 reales per month at the exchange rate of november 2019 that is around 40 euros to be entitled to this grant the family must show that its monthly income is below 89 reales that is 20 euros or less than one euro a day per family why did the lula government not combat illegitimate public debt the lula government did not combat illegitimate public debt because they did not want to antagonize brazilian big capital questioning debt repayment would also involve conflict with major private banks and foreign investment funds as well as with the imf the lula government did not combat illegitimate public debt because they did not want to antagonize brazilian big capital questioning debt repayment as a government would have meant conflict with brazilian big capital which benefits largely from the debt buying brazil s internal and external public debt securities these insure a high return since interest rates are very high questioning debt repayment would also involve conflict with major private banks and foreign investment funds as well as with the imf lula and the pt leadership wanted to avoid such conflicts as they gave legitimacy to the debt continued paying it and went even further calling on big capital to contract new public loans the lula government was tolerated or even appreciated by the bourgeoisie all the more so as social measures that benefited people with the lowest income increased the purchasing power of the poor which was good for capitalists business lula s neoliberal policies resulted in a split within the pt with a new party emerging to its left in 2004 that party is the psol party for socialism and freedom since 2001 i have often been back to brazil for the large gatherings of the world social forums around 100 000 people participated each time for meetings of the wsf s international council of which i had been a member from the start and for meetings of social movements there were meetings organized by the brazilian citizens debt audit a member of the cadtm s international network the cadtm s international network repeatedly sent significant delegations to brazil for wsf activities particularly in porto alegre in 2005 and in belem in 2009 when one of the cadtm s world assemblies was held the political situation has changed a lot as pointed out above from 2003 onward the pt clearly turned away from its revolutionary past to become a manager of the system this eventually resulted in deep disappointment not to say distrust especially since several of its leaders were actively involved in major corruption cases including lula himself eventually when the bourgeoisie felt it could manage the country without the pt s collaboration it exposed the party as corrupt this while all other traditional parties are just as deeply corrupt or much more dilma rousseff the pt leader who won the 2010 presidential elections and became president of brazil in 2011 was impeached by the senate in 2016 in what was actually an institutional coup d etat but disappointment towards the pt was so deep that the brazilian people hardly mobilized to defend the pt and its leaders in 2016 and the right wing vice president michel temer appointed by the pt in 2011 replaced dilma rousseff pt as president after masterminding the institutional coup later the antisocial policies implemented by president temer a corrupt right wing leader eventually stirred some popular support for lula as a credible candidate to be reelected president in 2018 so the judiciary system largely controlled by big capital was relentless in its efforts to prevent lula from running for president despite his imprisonment lula was the most likely to win and his supporters hoped that he would be able to participate in the elections this is why the judiciary prohibited him from running and jair bolsonaro was elected president end of 2018 and started his mandate in early 2019 bolsonaro is a far right politician yearning for dictatorship a racist sexist homophobic climate change negationist he is similar to trump while possibly even further to the right his deeply reactionary and antipopular nature is beyond doubt on 21 october 2018 at the end of the election campaign he stated that if he was elected president he would conduct a purge such as brazil has never known he affirmed that the leaders of the workers party must all rot in prison and said of the leftist movements they will have to submit to the law like everyone else either they leave or they go to jail shortly after starting his mandate he promised to remove civil servants with communist ideas his election is a real tragedy for the brazilian people and for the international left we should not expect lula to go back to the sources of the pt his orientation remains the one that prevailed from 2003 to 2016 after bolsonaro s victory a large part of the left fortunately formed a united front and demanded lula s liberation they got it in early november 2019 and lula immediately started a political campaign to win the presidential elections in 2022 this being said we should not expect lula to go back to the sources of the pt his orientation remains the one that prevailed from 2003 to 2016 but he might get elected in 2022 since it is clear that bolsonaro if he completes his mandate will have implemented antisocial policies that increase poverty and deepen the gap between a handful of very rich and the overwhelming majority of brazil s population obviously we need to mobilize widely against the bolsonaro government and in spite of disagreements with the pt we need a broad left wing front within which the pt will play an active part auditing brazil s debt from 2000 and ecuador s in 2007 2008 the brazilian citizens debt audit is an organization founded in the early 2000s in 2000 a referendum was organized on popular initiative by the mst landless workers movement the cut brazil s jubilee south campaign the national conference of bishops which has been positioned on the left since the years 1980 1990 with the support of the pt and more than 90 of the 6 million brazilians who voted were in favour of suspending debt payments for the time it took to carry out an audit to determine how much of it was illegitimate there was acute awareness of the illegitimate character of brazil s debt in a large part of the left and the brazilian population although the audit was provided for in the 1988 constitution the government had never carried it through after the popular referendum of september 2000 parliamentary representatives from the pt brought a draft bill to get it done it was in the aftermath of the referendum that the brazilian citizens debt audit was set up it subsequently joined the cadtm in 2005 during the 5th wsf the brazilian citizens debt audit the cadtm and jubilee south with the support of the mst organized a three day long tribunal against debt in porto alegre which brought together 1000 participants from every continent as pointed out above as soon as lula became president of brazil in 2003 he forgot his commitment to set up an audit of the debt in 2005 during the 5th world social forum the brazilian citizens debt audit the cadtm and jubilee south with the support of the mst landless workers movement organized a three day long tribunal against debt in porto alegre which brought together 1000 participants from every continent next in brazil support for the struggle against illegitimate debt faded mainly because the mst considered that they should rack up their critical support of president lula s government as for the leadership of the cut they had deserted the fight against debt as soon as lula came to office as president nevertheless that did not prevent the brazilian citizens debt audit from battling on through thick and thin to denounce repayment of mainly illegitimate debt the cadtm international gave its constant support to this fight in 2007 at the behest of militants combating illegitimate debt in ecuador maria lucia fattorelli the coordinator of the brazilian citizens debt audit and myself for the cadtm became members of the committee for integral debt audit caic established by the new president of ecuador rafael correa the caic s task was to identify illegitimate debts contracted during the period of 1976 2006 our work reported to the government in september 2008 and made public in november of the same year resulted in the suspension of payments on a significant part of debt demanded from ecuador in the form of sovereign bonds mainly held by banks of the usa the unilateral suspension of payment brought about a resounding victory ecuador imposed on its creditors a reduction of 70 of the debts concerned this enabled a significant increase in social spending from 2009 2010 it is important to note that president lula did not help ecuador with its debt auditing initiative he demanded that rafael correa cease applying pressure on odebrecht and persuaded him to take it to arbitration in a paris court it is important to note that president lula did not help ecuador with its debt auditing initiative this is proved by what happened in the case of the brazilian firm odebrecht which i mentioned earlier the firm built a hydro electric power plant of very poor quality in ecuador odebrecht had overcharged for the work and had not complied with the technical specifications the plant was so badly built that it broke down the audit committee had identified the debt brazil was demanding of ecuador for the plant s construction as illegal and illegitimate despite the fact that it was obviously in the wrong the firm of odebrecht refused to indemnify the state of ecuador in september 2008 to force odebrecht to fulfil its obligations towards the government of ecuador president rafael correa sent the army to occupy the installations of the hydroelectric plant instead of backing up the progressive government of ecuador in face of odebrecht lula protested against ecuador s intervention and recalled his ambassador he demanded that rafael correa cease applying pressure on odebrecht and persuaded him to take it to arbitration in a paris court correa accepted though knowing only too well that the arbitration would favour odebrecht indeed ecuador lost partially the government of brazil and odebrecht came out on top president lula s intervention in 2009 to prevent the launch of a committee to audit odious debt called for by brazilian companies in paraguay now let us look at the case of paraguay an enclave country surrounded by brazil argentina and bolivia in december 2008 the progressive president fernando lugo who had been in office for six months invited me to help him create an audit committee of paraguayan debt i went to asunción for a personal interview with the president followed by a meeting with the paraguayan government most of paraguay s debt could be qualified as odious as it resulted as is still the case from a major agreement made in the 1970s between two military dictatorships it was clear that most of paraguay s debt could be qualified as odious as it resulted as is still the case from a major agreement made in the 1970s between two military dictatorships the brazilian military junta and the paraguayan dictatorship of general stroessner the offending treaty dealt with the construction running and maintenance of what was at the time the biggest dam in the world the itaipu dam i had studied the matter in depth using the excellent documentation elaborated by paraguyan experts moreover a former member of staff of the cadtm in belgium the paraguayan jurist hugo ruiz diaz balbuena had become an adviser to president lugo which made contacts easier the international audit initiative with citizen participation had withered under pressure from the brazilian government during lula s presidency note that big brazilian companies are the main creditors of paraguay which they exploit although he had intended to sign a presidential decree creating the debt audit committee fernando lugo finally gave in to pressure from lula and his government who were protecting the interests of the brazilian firms who were creditors to persuade the paraguayan government to drop the idea of an international audit and of questioning the debt claimed by brazilian firms lula made a few marginal concessions and increased the amount brazil paid paraguay every year for electricity provided by the itaipu dam that said despite the pressure from brazil an audit was carried out by the court of auditors in 2010 and 2011 at the time i went back to paraguay at president fernando lugo s invitation in june 2012 he was eventually overthrown by a â parliamentary coup to use a phrase that had been used in honduras in 2009 and was applied in brazil when dilma rousseff who had succeeded lula as president of brazil from 2011 was overthrown the fact that the right was able to use this form of institutional coup d etat whether in brazil or in paraguay is partly due to the inability of those two left wing governments to affront creditors forcefully and carry out structural reform at the beginning of their mandates they enjoyed enormous popular support but this was deeply eroded by the disappointment engendered by conciliatory policies towards big capital both local and international by the time the right decided to take action people on the left were too disillusioned and disorientated to mobilize in defence of those in power the brazilian citizens debt audit from 2009 to 2019 in 2009 the brazilian citizens debt audit managed to set up a parliamentary committee thanks particularly to active support from the psol socialism and freedom party yet pt mps joined conservative mps to prevent the committee from questioning the legitimacy of brazil s debt then president dilma rousseff 2011 2016 vetoed the organization of such an audit the brazilian citizens debt audit conducted a tireless campaign of consciousness raising in brazil the group trained numerous local sections in brazil and organized correspondence courses to train activists who wanted to audit debt they organized several international rallies the coordinator maria lucia fattorelli also participated in the greek public debt truth committee in greece in 2015 before that she had coordinated the publication of a debt auditing handbook that was translated into french spanish and english in 2018 during the electoral campaign the brazilian citizens debt audit was bitterly disappointed by the presidential campaign of the psol candidate guilherme bolos he considered that continuing debt repayments was not really a problem in 2018 during the electoral campaign the brazilian citizens debt audit was bitterly disappointed by the presidential campaign of the psol candidate guilherme boulos with the agreement of the majority of the psol leadership boulos set aside the issue of questioning debt payment he considered that continuing debt repayments was not really a problem this caused a profound malaise within the psol to put it mildly indeed g boulos s electoral score as the psol candidate for the presidency fell far below the one the party had obtained in the previous presidential campaign in 2014 in 2014 the psol candidate luciana genro had vigorously defended the debt audit and the idea of suspending payments on debt identified as illegitimate g boulos only won a third of the votes luciana genro had won even though for the first time the psol had benefited from a considerable government subsidy for the electoral campaign it only goes to show that by watering down his positions the psol candidate lost part of the radical electorate that had previously supported the psol will this be a lasting development of the ten psol representatives in the brazilian parliament at present several maintain a clear position on debt but what is the true position of the party s leadership at the next psol congress to be held in may 2020 we shall see whether its militants will push for a return to policies more in line with the party s origins within the pt workers party which has 53 members of parliament acceptance of the debt system is deeply anchored in the party s official line and unfortunately we must not nourish any illusions to the contrary despite the criticisms aired above it is obvious that to counter bolsonaro left wing parties and social movements must unite in the broadest possible front only the future will tell whether the huge social mobilizations that have taken or are taking place in countries such as chile ecuador columbia haiti puerto rico and bolivia will find an echo in brazil translated by vicki briault manus and christine pagnoulle cadtm
the us federal reserve held interest rates steady at its first policy meeting of the year with officials pointing to continued moderate us economic growth and a strong job market job gains have been solid and the unemployment rate has remained low the fed s policy setting committee said in a statement announcing its unanimous decision to maintain the key overnight lending rate in a range of between 1 50 and 1 75 the fed s statement was little changed from the one issued after its december meeting saying that the current federal funds rate was appropriate to support sustained expansion of economic activity including ongoing job growth and a rise in inflation to the central bank s 2 target it did not specifically mention economic risks arising from the recent coronavirus outbreak in china which has led to fears of a further slowdown in the world s second largest economy the absence was notable to some economists the one thing i was surprised by was that there was no specific mention of the coronavirus which could be a problem for the global economy said peter cardillo chief market economist at spartan capital securities in new york the fed did not give new guidance about its current practice of buying 60 billion monthly of u s treasury bills to ensure adequate short term liquidity in bank funding markets that program will remain in place at least into april while a related offering of repurchase agreements will continue at least through april fed policymakers have been discussing how and when to end the temporary treasury bill purchases which have been underway since october and what sort of permanent replacement it could use to ensure the central bank keeps control of the federal funds rate yields on u s treasury securities were little changed after the fed s statement while benchmark u s stock market indexes ticked up to the day s highs the dollar held on to its gains against the euro and yen in a related decision the fed raised the interest it pays banks for excess reserves by five basis points to 1 60 a technical adjustment officials say was needed to keep the federal funds rate around the middle of the target range the interest rate decision was widely expected with recent economic data showing the economy on track for continued growth and no sign inflation is rising so fast that it poses a risk the fed might need to counter with higher borrowing costs to slow the economy the vote was unanimous that implies that the fed is going to stay on hold here cardillo said of course they always leave the door open the fed cut rates three times last year to bolster an economy buffeted by trade wars and has set a high bar for any further rate changes fed chair jerome powell has said a material reassessment of the economic outlook would be required for any shift the fed s assessment of household spending was marked down slightly from a strong pace in its december statement to a moderate pace the fed also noted that business fixed investment and exports remain weak
former us president bill clinton s campaign strategist james carville famously remarked that when it came to winning elections it was the economy stupid this dictum has led many observers to surmise that the strong us economy makes president donald trump s re election in 2020 nearly certain however between now and november there can be many an economic slip this would seem to be especially the case at a time when the international monetary fund estimates that 90 of the world s economies are experiencing slowdowns this was the lesson that republican hopeful john mccain learned as the us and global economies collapsed on the eve of the november 2008 presidential election after having started the year on a seemingly sound footing to be sure if the election were held today the strong us economy would make trump a formidable candidate for re election unemployment is at a 50 year low the economy is growing at a satisfactory rate wages are rising and the us stock market is beating record levels on almost a daily basis these achievements come at the cost of incurring a large budget deficit and a ballooning public debt that might have mortgaged the country s economic future but such matters are unlikely to be of concern to the electorate unfortunately for trump today s us economy will not be the determining factor in the 2020 presidential election rather what will matter is how the us economy and financial markets perform in the months immediately running up to november 2020 in six months the us economy could be looking decidedly less rosy today much like in early 2008 serious risks hang over the us and global economies these include a global credit and asset price bubble of epic proportions spawned by a decade of ultra easy money by the world s main central banks global debt to gdp levels today are significantly higher than they were at the start of 2008 us and global equity valuations are stretched housing bubbles have re appeared in a number of important economies and an alarming amount of credit has been extended to non creditworthy borrowers around the globe at historically low interest rates no one can know when the global credit and asset market bubble will burst or what event will cause it to do so however with the abrupt change in the global economy over the past year it would be rash to dismiss the possibility that the global credit bubble could burst well before the election the chinese economy shows clear signs of losing momentum the german italian and uk economies all appear to be on the cusp of recessions and the indian economic growth rate has halved amid increased domestic political strife trump has a fragile truce in his trade war with china and is threatening to impose additional import tariffs on an already weak european economy the global political landscape is deteriorating geopolitical risks in north korea and iran have increased and the middle east is in turmoil once again social protests are gaining momentum in countries as disparate as chile colombia france hong kong india iran and venezuela past experience including that in 2008 should be informing us that when credit and asset price bubbles burst the economic and financial market fallout can be disruptively large it should also be reminding us as to how interconnected the world s economic and financial system has become in the same way as in 2008 the lehman bankruptcy spilled over from the us to the rest of the global economy a systemic crisis abroad could very well spill back to american shores trump could be lucky in november the global credit bubble may burst after his re election however this is far from a certainty it is equally possible that this time next year we will look back and ask ourselves how we could have missed so many early warning signs about real trouble ahead in the global economy these include the recent sovereign debt default in argentina the rising private credit defaults in china and turkey the wework financial fiasco and the abrupt economic slowdown in china and germany the world s second and third largest economies respectively desmond lachman is a resident fellow at the american enterprise institute he was formerly a deputy director in the international monetary fund s policy development and review department and the chief emerging market economic strategist at salomon smith barney

the battle sir is not to the strong alone it is to the vigilant the active the brave patrick henry 1775 in today s digest if the president does something that he thinks will help him get elected in the public interest that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment harvard law professor alan dershowitz a member of president donald trump s defense team told the senate wednesday predictably his statement which outlines his consistent defense of trump was mischaracterized by democrats and the leftmedia in service to the impeachment agenda dershowitz certainly could have been clearer but the trump team s argument is this a lawful quid pro quo in service to u s interests is not illegal or impeachable regardless of whether it benefits the president politically thus even if democrats allegations are true trump s offense doesn t rise to an impeachable one of course there s also an inconvenient truth there was no actual quid pro quo though one was attempted ukraine got its military aid and volodymyr zelensky got his presidential meeting all without opening the investigations trump requested in any case trump s request regarding the corruption of a previous and potentially future american administration is absolutely in u s interests though trump was unwise to ask this of one of europe s most corrupt countries sen kirsten gillibrand exemplified the hyperventilating on the left arguing that dershowitz essentially said that if president trump believes his election is for the good of the american people that he could do whatever he wants that s a false representation of what dershowitz actually argued and leftists know it patrick philbin one of the president s lawyers bolstered dershowitz s point if there is something that shows a possible public interest in what trump said that destroys case adam schiff one of the leading and most dishonest of the democrat impeachment managers disagreed if any part of the president s motivation was a corrupt motive he insisted it would be enough to convict under criminal law to illustrate his preposterous contention schiff engaged in another bit of absurd b movie theater mockingly saying let s see how you feel about this scenario president obama on an open mic says to medvedev hey medvedev i know you don t want me to send this military money to ukraine because they are fighting and killing your people i want you to do me a favor though i want you to do an investigation of mitt romney and i want you to announce you found dirt on mitt romney if you re willing to do that quid pro quo i won t give ukraine the money they need to fight you on the front line do any of us have any question that barack obama would be impeached for that kind of misconduct are we really ready to say that that would be okay if barack obama asked medvedev to investigate his opponent and withhold money from an ally that needed to defend itself to get an investigation of mitt romney that s the parallel here the especially brazen aspect of schiff s latest attempt to win an oscar is that he comes fairly close to what obama actually did unknowingly on a hot mic obama told medvedev in 2012 that he would have more flexibility after his reelection to make changes to u s defense policy sought by our russian geopolitical foes and detrimental to our european allies obama was not impeached of course though democrats four years too late eventually realized that russia is in fact a threat to u s interests no romney was not mentioned in the real conversation but obama had to defeat romney before he could give medvedev s puppet master vladimir putin what he wanted american capitulation on missile defense nothing trump said is even remotely close to being that bad for u s interests meanwhile as john bolton and his leaked book allegations have dominated the news this week there s more misinformation and distortion coming out of even libertarian and conservative news outlets without getting lost in the weeds any book written by a top administration official like bolton must be reviewed by the national security council nsc to determine if any classified information is revealed in a letter to bolton s publisher the nsc contended that there was indeed classified information some of it top secret in bolton s manuscript that would need to be removed before the book could be published this was not a ham handed attempt at muzzling bolton and it wasn t a threat to block his book entirely either the nsc review is standard procedure that bolton rightly submitted to in order to honor his own nondisclosure agreements the nsc letter is dated january 23 three days before the new york times blockbuster revealing that bolton says there was a quid pro quo with ukraine the times depended on a well timed leak of bolton s manuscript leaving us to wonder whether the leaker one of the vindman twins violated federal law by disclosing classified information democrats still want bolton to testify before the senate though that is increasingly unlikely but we thought it would be enlightening to highlight schiff s long history of denigrating bolton in 2005 schiff complained of bolton s lack of credibility and all the way back in 2018 he groused about bolton s love of conspiracy theories now we have to hear from bolton what changed mr schiff and finally chief justice john roberts who is presiding over the president s trial refused to read a question submitted by sen rand paul because paul named the whistleblower the worst kept secret in the swamp is that eric ciaramella is likely the whistleblower federal law protects whistleblowers only from retribution not from being named so the continued charade of keeping his name a secret is absurd not only should ciaramella s name be spoken he should have testified before the house even in the midst of the ongoing senate impeachment trial president donald trump hasn t taken his eyes off the ball as he continues to press forward in implementing his make america great again agenda on wednesday trump signed his biggest trade deal to date a deal that significantly revamps updates and improves the north american free trade agreement nafta and will now be called the u s mexico canada agreement or usmca in a ceremony on the south lawn trump surrounded by lawmakers and members of his administration observed everybody said that this was a deal that could not be done too complicated too big couldn t be done we got it done indeed it s an achievement made all the more impressive given the democrats hyper partisan anti trump resistance typified by their partisan impeachment charade touting his outsider status trump added two decades of politicians ran for office vowing to replace the nafta yet once elected they never even tried they never even gave it a shot they sold out but i m not like those other politicians i keep my promises and i m fighting for the american worker the only remaining hurdle to usmca being fully realized is canada s house of commons which will need to ratify the agreement however there is little concern that it won t be approved for the american worker and the u s economy this deal couldn t come at a more opportune moment in helping to maintain the nation s robust economic outlook as the white house 1600 daily highlights the usmca provides broad economic benefits usmca is estimated to create nearly 600 000 american jobs and generate up to 235 billion in economic activity better protection for workers it has the strongest most advanced and most comprehensive labor protections of any american trade agreement in history support for our farmers the agreement is a massive win for american farmers and ranchers vastly improving access to canadian and mexican markets u s agricultural exports are expected to increase by 2 2 billion under the deal a boost for american manufacturers the u s auto industry alone expects to create up to 76 000 new jobs and spur 34 billion in new investments modernized terms unlike nafta usmca has protections for american intellectual property a first of its kind chapter on digital trade and provisions to crack down on unfair currency practices in spite of all the daily drama coming out of washington over who said what to whom and when it s good to see at least the government can still get some positively impactful things done for the american worker as trump explained it s probably the number one reason that i decided to lead this crazy life that i m leading now instead of that beautiful simple life of luxury that i led before this happened but i love doing it a recent study found that contrary to popular perception leftist dominated cities across the country are actually faring much worse than conservative cities at closing the gap between white and minority students in educational achievement the study entitled the secret shame how america s most progressive cities betray their commitment to educational opportunity for all observes progressive cities on average have achievement gaps in math and reading that are 15 and 13 percentage points higher than in conservative cities respectively moreover three of the 12 most conservative cities virginia beach anaheim and fort worth have effectively closed or even erased the gap in at least one of the academic categories we examined meanwhile says civil rights attorney nekima levy armstrong in the minneapolis star tribune in our own progressive city of minneapolis the report showed that the shameful gap in math achievement between black and white students in k 12 is 53 percentage points while the gap in math between brown and white students is 45 points armstrong continues similarly in reading the gap between black and white minneapolis students is 53 while the gap between brown and white students is 47 compare that with conservative jacksonville fla where the reading gap between black and white students is 30 and the math gap is 27 this educational gap cannot be blamed on a lack of resources as leftist cities on average spend more per student than do conservative cities so what conclusion do the study s authors come to well being committed leftists they refuse to lay the blame for the gap on progressive ideology though they also can t deny the data they write we did not consider any policy or practice as a cause for the larger achievement gaps between racial subgroups but our results demonstrate that there is a negative difference between our most progressive and most conservative cities and it can t be explained away by factors such as city size racial demographics spending poverty or income inequality in cities where most of the residents identify as political progressives educational outcomes for marginalized children lag at a greater rate than other cities try examining the worldview behind the competing ideologies and recognizing that the valuing and promotion of individual responsibility and personal development rather than group identity and social justice just might have something to do with closing the education gap just a thought by now millions of americans have seen the exchange between democrat presidential candidate elizabeth warren and the angry father who confronted her at a campaign stop in iowa regarding her promise to cancel outstanding student loan debt unfortunately there are also millions of other americans who either don t understand or aren t particularly concerned with why this exchange was taken to heart by so many of their fellow citizens it s because moral obligation has for almost all intents and purposes been tossed on the ash heap of history i just wanted to ask one question the father began my daughter is getting out of school i ve saved all my money she doesn t have any student loans am i going to get my money back of course not warren answered so you re going to pay for people who didn t save any money and those of us who did the right thing get screwed my buddy had fun bought a car and went on all the vacations i saved my money he makes more than i did i worked a double shift so you re laughing at me he continued as warren shook her head in denial yeah that s exactly what you re doing we did the right thing and we get screwed i appreciate your time warren responded before the man briskly walked away sen warren might appreciate many things but the extra time and effort that millions of americans put in to do the right thing rather than taking the easy way out isn t one of them yet based on the current ethos of the nation why should she if there s one thing warren and her fellow democrats know it s that there s a cohort of americans who have been carefully nurtured to believe they are above all else victims victims of a nation characterized by democrats depending on which group of constituents they are addressing as racist sexist homophobic transphobic nativist or just plain bigoted one where irredeemably evil rich people made their fortunes solely by screwing over wholly virtuous lower and middle class americans lower and middle class americans who deserve redress because fairness demands it thus warren s plan estimated to cost 640 billion would be underwritten by a 2 wealth tax on individuals earning greater than 50 million which warren claims would raise enough money to fund the cancellation of student loan debts and universal pre k it would forgive 50 000 of student loan debt for individuals in households earning less than 100 000 per year while individuals in households earning more than 100 000 would receive a reduced amount of loan forgiveness based on a sliding scale bernie sanders also has a plan he would eliminate all education related debt underwritten guaranteed or insured by the federal government regardless of the borrowers current income fox news columnist justin haskins points out some inconvenient truths about the issue noting that only about 10 of students default on their loans and that the federal government already has several programs for canceling student debt there are also income based repayment plans tying monthly student loan payments to household income rather than their total debt amount and a program that provides loan forgiveness after 10 years of on time income based repayments to those who work for a nonprofit organization or for the government haskins also explains that the status quo fuels the crisis because the federal government ultimately guarantees student loans allowing colleges to raise their costs with impunity while various programs of debt reduction or forgiveness incentivize unwise borrowing decisions by parents and students thus he suggests reforms that would mitigate both until we fix the foundational problems at the root of the student debt crisis this important issue will never be resolved he concludes in reality there is only one foundational problem here one that has plagued this nation for decades the virtual elimination of moral obligation that begets personal responsibility columnist katherine timpf gets to the heart of the issue even if warren had offered to pay back the iowa father this man s own suggestion for how to make things fair would still leave him in his words getting screwed she writes when he references the sacrifices that he and his family had to make to pay for his daughter s college what he s implicitly saying is that his choice to be financially responsible has cost him things that money cannot replace in timpf s case it meant a series of life decisions that included withdrawing from columbia university s graduate school of journalism after she had been accepted because she realized i d never be able to repay the 80 000 loan i d have to take out out to attend my dream school instead she chose to pursue unpaid internships to advance her career she also made other choices with which millions of her fellow americans are intimately familiar they included going months without a single day off waking up at 4 a m and not getting home until after 11 at night and living in an apartment building that was so dilapidated that you could effortlessly break into the front door with a credit card so poorly run that i d have no water without warning and so downright filthy that i once had scabies and fleas in the same week thus ms timpf who currently writes for national review and appears on fox news has little patience for the democrats siren song i don t think that i should have to pay for someone else making an irresponsible decision when they could have made a responsible one she writes what s more talking about this issue only in terms of money truly minimizes the fact that really it s about so much more it most certainly is if freely undertaken contractual commitments with regard to student loans can be tossed aside what other commitments or promises can be dispensed with when one finds them problematic mortgages car loans in a nation where one third of marriages end in divorce the out of wedlock birthrate is now 40 more adults ages 18 to 34 are living at home with their parents than with a spouse and 15 of american men between the ages of 25 and 54 still aren t working despite a good economy it should surprise no one that shirking obligations and or avoiding commitments altogether resonates especially when politicians deliberately obscure the reality of cost transfers or insist those transfers to americans with greater wherewithal constitute social justice once concepts like fairness social justice or free anything are conflated with genuine morality and personal responsibility all vote buying schemes become viable add the aforementioned embrace of victimhood to the mix and such concepts are construed as noble does the american electorate wish to continue expanding a safety net one that s precipitated the lion s share of our 23 trillion national debt already covering a large number of able bodied people who can rationalize anything and whose entire journey through life is traveled on the path of least resistance and with regard to college loan forgiveness relatively well off americans who don t wish to abide by their freely made obligations president trump once said a nation without borders is no nation at all neither is one where free riding is promoted as justice and compassion grassroots perspective by willie richardson slavery abortion and education all mixed into one conversation what a mixture of highly toxic politically correctness in one setting political kryptonite for the left secretary of education betsy devos spoke recently at colorado christian university s annual president s dinner at the museum of the bible she pulled no punches devos was drawing comparisons between the debate of abortion rights and the abolition of slavery i see the comparisons slave masters of the south wanted their choice to extend slavery into the western regions they wanted the choice to prevent slaves from reading they wanted the choice to use free labor to build their empires devos exclaimed too contended with the pro choice arguments of his day they suggested that a state s choice to be slave or to be free had no moral question in it she added well president lincoln reminded those pro choicers that a vast portion of the american people that do not look upon that matter as being this very little thing they look upon it as a vast moral evil leftists use the word choice to benefit their own agenda to minimize the extortion of a woman having an abortion they proclaim pro choice however when considering the real power of giving a woman a choice for the education of her child they oppose school choice devos called out the irony of supporting a woman s choice to have an abortion but opposing mothers who want to enroll their children in nontraditional public schools charters or religious private schools low income families do not mean low iq families if anything low income families should be the main ones trying to prepare their children to go down a different road educationally parents aren t stupid if a mother attended a low performing school and realizes the potential for her child shouldn t she be given a choice leftists have made women believe their choice to have abortions is more significant than any other choice read that again choosing a high performing school for the education of your child should be what pro choice is about instead leftists say choice involves ending a child s life legacy and opportunity to be educated devos added lincoln was right about the slavery choice then and he would be right about the life choice today because as it s been said freedom is not about doing what we want freedom is about having the right to do what we ought let s end the slavery of children being forced to go to low performing schools because of their zip codes let s end the slavery of children being forced from the wombs of their mothers because of convenience let s choose what is right for our children the right to life and education don t miss alexander s column read topping my impeachment witness

good morning and thanks for joining us ameriprise delivered an excellent fourth quarter completing a very good year as many of you know we held our investor day in november to give you an even deeper understanding of our go to market strategies and long term growth plans i want to thank everyone who attended we enjoyed our conversation with you regarding our growth strategy as we discussed there are four key areas driving our momentum first we have a significant opportunity to build on our strong position and further grow as a wealth management leader with deep client relationships second we re transforming our global asset management business to meet the important needs for active management third we re managing well developed insurance and annuity books of business that generate significant consistent free cash flow and finally ameriprise is delivering profitable growth has a sound balance sheet and is generating a high return for shareholders on our call today i ll discuss our results the operating environment and our progress executing the growth drivers we ve outlined at investor day turning to the markets us equities reached yet another record high and our average weighted equity index that reflects the mix of assets we manage finished up strongly for the year as you know the fed interest rate cuts in 2019 are a headwind and yesterday the fed said that interest rates remain unchanged as january comes to a close equity markets remain strong but with a pick up in volatility we cannot predict the year or market cycles but with deep client relationships good cash flows and a strong balance sheet ameriprise is built to manage these cycles and emerge stronger now let s discuss the quarter on a consolidated level fourth quarter results were quite good compared to a year ago on an adjusted operating basis we delivered revenue growth of 6 excluding auto and home revenue in the year ago period solid eps growth up 11 even after absorbing some additional expenses in corporate a return on equity of 38 6 ex aoci and unlocking which remains well above many peers and with the sale of the auto and home business we generated 161 million in net benefit on a full year gaap pre tax basis our assets under management and administration reached a new high up 18 to 973 billion we also achieved new records in wealth management for retail client assets and advisor productivity that i ll discuss further with that let s now turn to our growth engine advice wealth management we delivered solid revenue and earnings growth in the fourth quarter even with significant decline in short term interest rates margin in awm was nearly 23 and continues to be among the best in wealth management i am pleased with how we re executing our priorities we re growing our client base serving more affluent investors and deepening client relationships it all starts with the large and compelling market that we re concentrating on responsible investors with 500 000 to 5 million in investable assets they are looking for a comprehensive advice and strong digital capabilities from an advisor and a firm that they trust ameriprise is uniquely positioned to serve this market and it s translating into terrific results we had an excellent year in advice wealth management including some nice fourth quarter highlights client assets were up 19 while fee based advisory business continues to stand out with more than 4 billion of inflows into advisory in the quarter this brings total wrap assets to 318 billion a 26 increase importantly we had strong client acquisition results in the quarter particularly in our affluent target market and we saw a good pick up in transactional activity as more clients engaged with us in financial planning relationships and in the quarter advisor productivity increased 6 as advisors leveraged the extensive support we offer to help them grow in recruiting we had another good year we continue to attract experienced advisors from across the industry in addition another 63 advisors joined us and it s one of the best quarters for recruiting large production practices what s behind our continued success the deep long lasting relationships we work diligently and earn with clients and we re using our goal based advice expertise and our enhanced client experience to deepen these relationships even further we re also leveraging our recent investments to drive future growth here are some updates we continue to increase uptake of our digitally enabled advice experience to even more clients we completed the roll out of our custom advisory relationship program we finished the conversion of our new customer relationship management platform and we re growing the ameriprise bank we brought more than 1 billion of cash sweep balances on the balance sheet in the fourth quarter bringing our full year total to close to 4 billion and we will continue to bring sweep deposits on the balance sheet this year we will be adding additional capabilities including a mortgage program pledged loans and a savings deposit product i also like to point out that outside of the bank ameriprise wealth management expenses will come back to more normalized levels in 2020 we also continue to receive important recognition in the industry ameriprise was recently certified by jd power for providing an outstanding customer service experience our teams work hard to deliver industry leading service so this means a lot i ll leave you with this takeaway with our advice value proposition and the investments we ve made we have a great opportunity to continue to grow in the wealth management business i m energized by the opportunity we have in front of us now i will turn to our i a businesses these are strong books that provide earnings diversification and stability we re focused on delivering insurance and annuity solutions that satisfy client needs while continuing to evolve our solution mix in the quarter we generated 185 million in adjusted operating earnings for the protection annuity businesses in line with our expectations and we continue to generate strong free cash flow in terms of annuity sales total variable annuity cash sales were up when compared to a slower quarter last year and for the year sales were in our typical range of about 4 billion this month we launched our structured solutions annuity product designed exclusively to meet the needs of ameriprise clients we expect this will help shift even more of our books away from products with guarantees fixed annuity sales were down year over year in line with our plan in protection we focused on continuing to shift from iul to vul where we had a very strong growth in vul sales compared to last year overall life insurance in force remained stable at 195 billion as always we re focused on managing risk appropriately and ensuring we have the right product designs for our clients and the environment we will also continue to evaluate further action regarding reinsuring the remaining fixed annuity block this year moving to asset management earnings was strong and flows continued to improve we remain focused on serving client needs and pursuing long term growth opportunities in key areas columbia threadneedle ended the quarter with 494 billion in assets under management up 15 on improving flows and positive markets and the earnings contribution to ameriprise remain good we re making good progress executing our strategy and you can see that in our flow picture we generated 3 3 billion in net inflows in the quarter which was up 8 billion from last year this is our third consecutive quarter of improved flows investment performance was excellent in 2019 across equities fixed income and asset allocation portfolios on an asset weighted basis for our columbia funds over 75 are above medium for one year three year and five year time frames for threadneedle funds over 80 of beating their benchmarks for those same time periods and we re seeing improved results across strategies and regions with global retail leading the way in us retail we have been increasing our market share at six of our top eight broker dealer partner firms and gross sales in our key strategies are good our equity flow rate in the quarter was strong in fact of the 17 active firms we benchmark we were in the top five and one of the few that were a net positive for the quarter and in fixed income we continue to garner good flows and we feel that we can improve even further we re seeing a particular strength in our income franchise for example our dividend income strategic income and mortgage opportunity funds generated more than 2 2 billion in combined net inflows in the quarter in emea retail with brexit now moving forward and reduced uncertainty in the uk sentiment in europe has improved net flows improved by more than 2 billion from last year we re making good progress in fact we were in net inflows in nearly all of our key markets in europe now that we have built out our sicav product range and in global institutional net inflows improved by more than 2 billion ex parent to a net outflow of 1 billion we re gaining traction in a number of areas that we talked to you about in november it was another good quarter in asset management we have a strong product line up excellent performance and global reach and we re focused on executing well to maintain our momentum now let me turn to our final key area of focus our capital strength which is outstanding last quarter i highlighted our strong excess capital position and the benefits of the successful sale of the auto and home business in terms of freeing up capital and focusing our efforts on our core businesses ultimately we ended the year at 2 2 billion of excess capital in the fourth quarter as a continuation of our strong return of capital we returned 125 of operating earnings through the pick up and the pace of our buyback and for the year we reduced our overall share count by 8 to summarize it was an excellent quarter and year for ameriprise we are in a strong position later this year we ll mark our 15th anniversary as an independent publicly traded company we re incredibly proud of what we ve accomplished importantly we re proud of how we re recognized for our client service our records of outperformance and how we consistently deliver for shareholders we re poised and energized to build on our record of performance and growth now walter will discuss the financials in detail and then we ll take your questions walter walter berman executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you jim ameriprise delivered another strong quarter of financial results and business metrics with adjusted operating eps up 11 to 4 20 this was supported by a strong 6 revenue growth excluding the auto and home business that we sold in the quarter the quality of earnings across our businesses was quite strong however within the corporate segment there were a few timing related expense items that i d like to explain first we incurred higher than normal impairments in our low income housing portfolio totaling 25 million the portfolio continues to perform well and we do not anticipate any impact to our going forward expected tax benefits second as part of our reengineering process and evaluation of our overall expense base going into 2020 we took an elevated level of severance charges in the quarter of 11 million this action positions us well moving into 2020 finally we had significant share price appreciation in the quarter which required us to mark to market some of the previously issued share based compensation awards this was a 6 million absolute impact in the quarter but an 18 million variance year over year going forward we expect our corporate segment losses to return to the 70 million range on october 1st we closed the sale of auto and home to american family the transaction generated a net benefit of 161 million over the course of the year but is not recognized within our operating results we returned 125 of earnings to shareholders in the quarter and 110 for the year based upon the sale of auto and home and the changes in our risk profile we enter 2020 with strong balance sheet fundamentals with 2 2 billion in excess capital and a lower risk profile with long term care continuing to perform well which you can see in the appendix in 2020 we will evaluate reducing leverage while remaining committed to return capital at a pace of 100 plus let s turn to page six as i mentioned adjusted operating net revenue was up 6 to 3 billion after excluding auto and home from the prior year period revenue growth was driven by advice wealth management and asset management in advice wealth management we had a substantial increase in wrap assets and improved transactional activity driving an 8 increase in revenue in asset management revenues grew 9 including strong performance fees annuities and protection revenue was essentially flat in summary we delivered strong eps growth of 11 and a return on equity of nearly 39 turning to slide seven you can see that our business mix continues to evolve with advice wealth management generating over half of the company s earnings up from 33 five years ago this profitability improvement has been driven by fundamental organic growth and well managed expenses while still investing for future growth we ve seen a consistent shift in our business mix over the past few years and expect this to continue as we investments in areas of opportunity within wealth management business advice wealth management continues to perform well across leading and lagging indicators as you can see on slide eight advice wealth management adjusted operating net revenues grew 8 wrap assets were up 26 to 318 billion with net inflows of 4 4 billion in the quarter transactional activity also increased 5 year over year we had a good quarter for experienced advisor recruiting with 63 advisors joining us from other firms in the quarter with much higher trailing 12 month productivity and market levels improved nicely pretax adjusted operating earnings were up 5 or 19 million in the face of a 22 million headwind related to recent fed rate cuts a strong increase in revenue allowed us to continue to drive profitable growth despite short term interest rates g a increased 6 excluding the bank consistent with expectations we are continuing to make substantial investments for growth and seeing elevated volume related expenses given strong activity levels our expectation is that g a growth excluding the bank will be in the range of 3 to 4 finally our margin was solid at 22 6 and we expect we can maintain it in this range let s turn to asset management on page nine in the quarter we saw a substantial 8 billion improvement with net inflows of 3 3 billion excluding former parent related flows net inflows were 4 2 billion benefiting from continued improvement in retail in north america and europe as well as from reinvested dividends from a financial perspective the business is demonstrating an improved trajectory asset management continues to generate substantial revenue and pre tax adjusted operating earnings for ameriprise pretax adjusted operating revenue was up 9 to 770 million driven by strong performance fees and market appreciation with lower pressure from the cumulative impact of flows underlying expenses remain well managed within the quarter expenses were impacted by elevated performance fee and year end timing related compensation adjustments as well as a higher distribution expense associated with revenue growth margins in the quarter were 36 remaining in our target range of 35 to 39 turning to page 10 results in annuities and protection are solid annuities continue to perform in line with expectations with very consistent profitability we saw good improvement in variable annuity sales of 9 in the quarter though still down for the full year we have launched a new structured variable annuity product in the first quarter that will further diversify our offering away from living benefit features and our variable annuity net amount of risk still remains one of the lowest in the industry protection earnings were down slightly to 65 million claims remain in line with expectations now let s move to balance sheet on slide 11 we accelerated the pace of capital return to shareholders in 2019 with 2 4 billion returned via buybacks and dividends this is a continuation of our long standing track record of capital return in fact over the past 10 years we have returned over 18 billion to shareholders and reduced our diluted share count by approximately 50 we continue to generate substantial free cash flow which along with excellent balance sheet fundamentals will support continued capital return we enter 2020 from a position of strength with 2 2 billion of excess capital we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders assessing potential changes to our capital structure to best support our current business mix and evaluating additional reinsurance opportunities with that we will take your questions questions and answers operator thank you and our first question comes from andrew kligerman from credit suisse andrew kligerman credit suisse analyst hey good morning so i m looking at the advisor count and here at 98 71 it s roughly flattish with the last year s number could you talk a little bit about your ability to grow that count going into 2020 and the productivity of those advisors i know revenue per advisor was up 6 year over year a lot of moving parts there so how do you see that evolving in 2020 as well james cracchiolo chairman and chief executive officer yes so we think that the advisor count would probably pick up a bit as we go forward we actually netted out a number of advisors in the ipi area and others as we reform then restructured that channel as well as in some of the central sites as we shifted things around but we actually feel good about the recruitment we re actually focused a bit more on higher productivity and so the average productivity of the people who are leaving us was still much lower so we focus mainly on the growth of that productivity and the type of people we re bringing in but i think the advisor count should probably pick up a bit more like we were doing more at the beginning part of the year and i feel good about the type of productivity we re bringing in and the recruitment then and the ramping up of the people who are here andrew kligerman credit suisse analyst got it and staying on advice wealth fee rates they were around 108 basis points by our calculation in the quarter and that s kind of versus the recent 109 basis point to 111 basis point range over the last two years or so and so i don t know is that a function of moving up market and how do you why is that and where do you see the fees kind of shaking out in 2020 and 2021 james cracchiolo chairman and chief executive officer yes so i think it s part of the idea of us continuing now to bring in more clients at a little higher levels where then the rates get a bit lower as the asset levels managing are a bit higher and so that s actually it s a good positive thing for us i mean our net inflow of client activity is pretty strong continues to be good and consistent and we are bringing in more clients and the more affluent and we re probably going to embark on something this year to even focus a bit more even on the higher net worth channels so i think that s a favorable for us andrew kligerman credit suisse analyst got it and then one last quick one 110 payout ratio 110 in 2019 2 2 billion of excess capital could you get that ratio even higher in 2020 walter berman executive vice president and chief financial officer we could but the issue is i think as jim said at the investor day we re targeting at this stage 100 plus but we are certainly monitoring that and evaluating it andrew as we do but certainly we have the generation capacity and we will be evaluating that as we move forward andrew kligerman credit suisse analyst thanks a lot operator our next question comes from humphrey lee from dowling partners humphrey lee dowling partners analyst good morning and thank you for taking my questions a question with regard to the g a expenses i think in jim and walter s prepared remarks you talked about expenses should normalize in 2020 and i think specifically in a wm the g a expenses excluding the bank would be kind of 3 to 5 growth but i guess when we look at the overall enterprise how should we think about the expenses in general and then also how much of a banking related expense do you anticipate for a wm james cracchiolo chairman and chief executive officer okay so i think as we indicated yes i think what you said for awm the expense range after normalizing for the bank is it will be in the 3 to 5 range as it relates to amp it is lower than that and normally will be in the range of 2 that range so we anticipate that will continue as we look but as we evaluate it but that is what is a reasonably good expectation humphrey lee dowling partners analyst okay so including the bank or overall amp g a expenses would be in the 2 range is that what you re suggesting james cracchiolo chairman and chief executive officer no the bank will be above that because we normalize for it at the awm level it s about 200 basis points if you add for the bank so i think it s ought to be a little less for amp because the amp size of the expense base will be neutralized but it gives a little less impact but that is basically from that standpoint of normalized number humphrey lee dowling partners analyst okay got it and then in again in your prepared remarks you talked about the fixed annuity block it doesn t look like the lower interest rate right now affects how you think about the block in terms of potential transactions is that a fair statement and then also can you remind us how much statutory capital that you have right now backing that business walter berman executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so listen the interest rates do affect it but we do believe there is a we are evaluating that there is potential viability and certainly pursuing a fixed annuity reinsurance and we are in discussions and we evaluate that this is a general range it s probably around an area of 750 million to 800 million that we can free up humphrey lee dowling partners analyst okay great thank you operator our following question comes from kenneth lee from rbc capital markets kenneth lee rbc capital markets analyst hi thanks for taking my question just one within the asset management business a follow up on the prepared remarks you touched upon seeing improving investor sentiment within the uk emea region due to the brexit clarity i m wondering whether you would expect to see further improvement in net fund flows of this year due to the increase in clarity and perhaps you could just tell us which products investment products you could see potentially gaining from this improving sentiment thanks james cracchiolo chairman and chief executive officer okay so i think you re more explicitly asking about uk and europe our emea business yes we saw a nice improvement bounce back occurring in the fourth quarter moving from some negative in the first month of the quarter to actually inflows in the second and third month of the quarter and we see that continuing europe was actually positive for us good uk was still coming back but it was still a bit weaker but we feel like that will start to change in remedy now that they have gone through the elections at the end of the year so we re reasonably optimistic that there will be a little less uncertainty i mean there is still uncertainty to the extent of what is that trade agreement and things at the end of the year but the people in london are feeling better and feel like the business can come back there and the appetite would increase and we have a good line up i mean we have excellent performance in our funds our uk equity type products are really good we ve gained even in a negative year flows there and we now have a full line of products in the sicav range in europe and that bodes well for us as there is a pick up and we re seeing that pick up in things like european equities and various things like that so we are positive on that to be an improvement this year kenneth lee rbc capital markets analyst great and just one follow up if i may looking at the former parent company related outflows looking back over the past year or so net outflows related to that have been declining just wondering whether we would expect a similar kind of trajectory going forward or just wanted to get your thoughts there thanks james cracchiolo chairman and chief executive officer yes so i think we ve seen some improvement in the domestic part of that and the outflow from our relationship here the zurich activity has been pretty consistent once in a while they ll have a pension that closes and there is some lumpiness but it s pretty much been running like what we ve seen from quarter to quarter just based on the drawdown of these closed books and assets but as i said the assets that remain there due to a combination of appreciation and even some difference in some of the products that we replace that have a bit higher fee the revenue gets offset even though that flow negative in that that book is there so but i would probably say i it s been running that way consistently for a while so i don t see much change there from a flow but the revenue has been pretty stable kenneth lee rbc capital markets analyst very helpful thank you very much operator our following question comes from john barnidge from piper sandler john barnidge piper sandler analyst thanks deposit volume in 4q 2019 for va s was the highest since 2q 2018 thought it was somewhat surprising given the decline in rates during the year and associated repricing activity can you talk about your positioning in the distribution environment there thank you james cracchiolo chairman and chief executive officer yes we did see a bit more of a pick up i mean a year ago this quarter it was a slower period for us but we saw a bit more activity towards the end of the year we actually just in the end of this month we just launched our structured annuity product and we actually think that would pick up some traction as well in the current year and shift some of the business from the guarantee product i mean we still sell a reasonable portion of annuities without living benefits as well which is good so we re not looking for a substantial growth but we re looking for probably a bit more growth but also a shift to now some of the structured product as well which is good for us so we want to keep that book growing or stable with slight growth which is good and the mix improving so that s what we re probably seeing right now john barnidge piper sandler analyst great and my follow up does brexit clarity change your view around m a for asset management as i believe the fee rate for retail is a bit higher in emea than in the us james cracchiolo chairman and chief executive officer well we want to continue to grow in emea and europe to the point you referenced based on fee rates and the use of actives as well so we keep our eye out for opportunities but we actually feel like some of the investments we re making and the expansion of resources that we re putting on the continent gives us some opportunity for further growth there as well john barnidge piper sandler analyst thanks for the answer operator our following question comes from tom gallagher from evercore thomas gallagher evercore analyst good morning just a question on the awm growth just looking at page 13 of the supplement it looks like total client aum versus the wrap accounts is growing a bit slower just curious if are you seeing outflows in the non wrap business and overall how is that impacting your growth in that business and just overall economics james cracchiolo chairman and chief executive officer well looking at the client flows they re still pretty very good so they re in excess of the 4 billion i don t know exactly with the ins and outs there is some ins and outs but a shift between the non wrap to wrap has slowed a lot i mean it s sort of leveled out i can t tell you like from period to period it might be slight but the net of the effect of what those flows are our gross client net client inflows in total so it s within that realm i would probably say with the fourth quarter which is the markets being where they were i d probably think activity would slow it a little more for investment purposes just because people were waiting for the next shoe to drop but i think it s been pretty stable thomas gallagher evercore analyst so jim just following up on that would you say overall flows into the complex from a total client assets would be close to the 4 billion mark james cracchiolo chairman and chief executive officer it s north of 4 billion but in that range in the fourth quarter thomas gallagher evercore analyst okay that s helpful and then how should we think about total capital return i mean i know you ve returned more than the 90 certainly last year you re sitting on substantial excess as we stand today how are you thinking about utilization of the excess are you thinking more strategic m a or are there opportunities out there and then maybe doing more buybacks if nothing if you don t find anything like where are you leaning now more toward with deployment of that excess particularly after the p c capital freed significant amount up james cracchiolo chairman and chief executive officer so as you saw we did pick up the buyback as we said walter just mentioned that we re probably looking to continue we usually say 90 to 100 we re saying probably 100 plus at this point in time not knowing the world and the etc but if things present good opportunities for additional we do that but we constantly monitor the cash flow continues to be quite good and strong as walter also said we re probably looking to reinsure some more as we go through the year so i think buyback still would be probably the main return mechanism we will look presenting to the board about a dividend increase again this year consistent with all the years that we ve done that and you know we always look at some m a strategically to fit in but that depends on opportunities that may come along or not but we have enough capital flexibility that that should not affect our buyback trajectory thomas gallagher evercore analyst okay thanks operator our following question comes from suneet kamath from citi suneet kamath citi analyst thanks good morning i just wanted to start with the a wm margin so if the fed is on hold now is the impact of the what they did last year in terms of rate cut sort of fully baked into the 22 6 margin walter berman executive vice president and chief financial officer yes basically it is a small deviation but basically it is suneet kamath citi analyst and then at investor day i mean i don t want to nitpick here but you talked about a 20 plus margin in a wm on this call you re saying you can maintain at 22 6 is there sort of a change in how you re thinking about that margin relative to what you told us at investor day walter berman executive vice president and chief financial officer no not at all suneet kamath citi analyst and then the last one i had is on the bank i think we have a good sense of what the expenses are but can you give us a sense of what the bank revenues are and how you expect that to progress as we move through 2020 walter berman executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so as we indicated we had a small profit in 2019 and we do expect with the launches of different products and adding more of transfer sweep money over the revenues will grow obviously this is a challenging market for investment but on that base we do see the revenues growing and also increasing our profitability in 2020 suneet kamath citi analyst do you have a sense of the revenue base though right now from the bank walter berman executive vice president and chief financial officer let me i don t want to guess that so let us get back to you on it i ll get it too suneet kamath citi analyst all right thanks walter operator our following question comes from erik bass from autonomous research erik bass autonomous research analyst hi thank you a couple of follow ups on advice wealth sort of along the same line as suneet s questions i guess first would you expect cash yields to be pretty stable going forward if the fed remains on hold or are there any competitive dynamics that could create some noise there james cracchiolo chairman and chief executive officer no i don t believe that we see any i mean obviously we are constantly monitoring and measuring but no we don t see any of this at this time erik bass autonomous research analyst got it and then morgan stanley recently provided a target of getting its wealth management business margins to the 28 to 30 range over the next two years and i realize there are differences between its business and yours but do you see getting to kind of a mid 20 margin is something that may be achievable over the intermediate term as the bank reaches scale and if you continue to improve advisor productivity levels james cracchiolo chairman and chief executive officer yeah i would say this i mean one of the things very clearly as you have sort of compressed rates out there with what the fed recently did versus some of the banks that might have been started previously were based on their investments and other things like the wirehouses with their banking entities and the use of that but i would actually say if you get a bit better in some of the yield curve or some pick up a little better on some of the longer rates not substantially i think you can see what we re shifting into the bank with the development going through the bank that that could be adding to margins even if the fed maintained rates right now so to speak depending on what happens in the larger climate but we re ramping up the bank in a period when those things are pretty compressed but we feel good about it because it gives us the opportunity if things normalize a little better again erik bass autonomous research analyst okay thank you and is there a correlation between productivity and margin or does productivity just help drive revenues but kind of your payout stay the same and it s sort of margin neutral james cracchiolo chairman and chief executive officer the productivity over the years have definitely i mean you can see our margins have grown up pretty pretty tremendously we do still have sort of an independent and an employee base the employee margins have increased nicely our independents are quite good and so we have added to margin based upon the productivity increase and the business growth and i don t see that changing substantially i think what we re just managing is you had spurts in markets and other things so we re just averaging that out right now but as walter said our expense growth should come down a bit outside of the bank back to more normalized levels so we feel good about maintaining and improving that margin over time but again things are with the environment you can t always predict that and what the impact may be in the short term erik bass autonomous research analyst certainly and thank you for the comments operator and the last question comes from alex blostein from goldman sachs alex blostein goldman sachs analyst hey guys thanks for taking a couple of questions here i have a few on awm mostly so i guess first walter is it possible for you to give us a sense how much in net interest income you expect to generate at the bank in 2020 and sort of what that contemplates in other words are there more deposits you re going to move from sweep or whatever you move that s enough to kind of just put it into loans or other things you guys are doing at the bank that s my first question walter berman executive vice president and chief financial officer i guess let me first since we started the bank midyear obviously we ll get the calendarization effect so that we will get the net interest margin increasing on that basis we will be increasing certainly as i indicated the sweep flows into the bank so that well but again as jim has in this market the rates are fairly constricted and we are certainly looking at launching and having a more emphasis on our privilege loan program and certainly on and getting into a deposit program alex blostein goldman sachs analyst okay but no rough sense of in terms of the revenue dollars that you expect to get out of the bank this year walter berman executive vice president and chief financial officer no not exactly that again as suneet asked we d have to we re not forecasting but certainly there will be an increase and again we are assuming an increase in profitability but i don t have the exact correlation james cracchiolo chairman and chief executive officer and alex we re forming as we ve started to ramp up the bank the shift in the sweep looking at the current environment and regarding both our lending and our investment strategy the roll out of some of the products this year we will be forming that and as that gets more informed we will be chatting with you and informing you as well so we re just at the early stages of that but all the groundwork all the foundational elements even the initial shift in the launch of the credit card the initial sweeps etc have taken place so we re right on track to our plans but the second level of that will be forming as we go in through this year alex blostein goldman sachs analyst got it thanks and then in terms of the asset growth so at a high level everything you guys are talking about sounds great in terms of recruiting higher productivity etc when we look at the wrap flows this year they ve decelerated versus last year despite the fact that what feels like has been a very robust environment for the industry as well as some of your peers so what s been driving the decline in wrap accounts this year what do you think is a reasonable either dollar amount of organic growth do you expect to get out of that over the next kind of 12 months to 24 months and then when you look i guess at the fee rate on wrap accounts that s also been coming down for the last couple of years so kind of help us reconcile all those three maybe thanks james cracchiolo chairman and chief executive officer yeah we don t really see that what you re saying per se i know that the wrap account in previous year or two were a bit higher but remember that was part of an industry shift we were part of that moving with the dol and activities and accelerating some of that transfer but from an organic level as i said a 4 4 billion is still pretty nicely organically growth and we see that continuing we feel like our fee rates are pretty good as you said as we continue to move up market some of the fees will be lower naturally based upon pricing but no i don t see it could move slightly from what we said but i don t see a slowdown per se our client activity is good but we do a lot more business than wrap and so importantly it s not just a wrap business per se we try to do more comprehensive business but i feel that that s not necessarily i see a slowing i see things go period to period but i think over the longer term we feel pretty good about it and we think that that will continue and you know our wrap balances were up 26 year over year so i m not sure we re out of line in anything in the industry there may be some further shift for some people where they were behind on it and accelerating it but we have always had a good strong wrap business alex blostein goldman sachs analyst got it great thanks very much operator duration 48 minutes call participants alicia charity senior vice president

after experiencing a whole year with a far right president as head of state in brazil namely jair bolsonaro we have to try and understand the steps that led to this situation i arrived in sao paulo the financial and economic capital of brazil on the night of 14 november 2019 the city has over 12 million inhabitants in all the districts i visited poverty is flagrant you see homeless people living on the street with no access to sanitation of any kind and prey to the most extreme poverty a significant number of people are undernourished reliable sources mention about 100 000 people who live on the streets of sao paulo 25 000 of them permanently and 75 000 on a temporary basis i first came to sao paulo in december 1991 to participate in the first congress of the workers party partido dos trabalhadores or pt led by the former metal worker lula at that time lula and the pt stood for the struggle against odious and illegitimate debt he said among other things â any third world government that decides to further repay the external debt chooses to lead his people into the abyss lula had led workers strikes against the dictatorship in the 1980s and in 1988 a â democratic regime replaced the dictatorship after a transitional stage the bases of the main trade union federation cut central ãšnica de trabalhadores or unified workers central and of the new party the pt had been brought together during the valiant struggle against the dictatorship the pt had been built from the bottom by activists in social movements and small very active politically radical organizations the cut and the pt were against repaying debt and wanted a citizens audit part of the debt had been accumulated during the military dictatorship which lasted more than 20 years and afterwards it increased steeply during the debt crisis in the 1980s a crisis that resulted from commodity prices plummeting while washington had decided on a sharp increase in interest rates more generally the pt clearly stated that radical anti capitalist policies had to be implemented which were to lead to the construction of a democratic socialist self managed and anti bureaucratic society this outcome stirred genuine enthusiasm in brazil and beyond i went to sao paulo in 1991 in order to prepare lula s and another pt leader marco aurelio garcia s visit to belgium at the invitation of the cadtm the talks were to take place some ten days before christmas 1991 eventually for health reasons lula couldn t come over and was replaced by marco aurelio garcia who became president of the pt in 2006 and was lula s main adviser on foreign policy while lula was president from 2003 to 2011 i met lula four or five times from 1991 to 2003 i can remember a long discussion we had in havana in 1993 it followed upon a meeting lula had had with fidel castro and daniel ortega lula explained that in order to become president of brazil he had to neutralize us imperialism the army and the brazilian bourgeoisie i understood that he meant not to thwart us strategic interests and to promise the army leadership and big capital that he would implement no measures that went against their interests lula told me that he would be the president of all brazilians as was all too often said what i understood was that he would use his experience as a trade unionist to seal a pact between those at the bottom and those at the top asking those at the top to concede some improvements in purchasing power i e allowing the state to increase social aid with public money while those at the bottom would accept that nothing would really change at the structural level this is indeed what he attempted to do when he was president ten years later during the 1990s the position of the pt and the cut was gradually watered down i saw him for the last time in june 2003 and stated how much i disapproved of the neoliberal reform he had introduced into the civil service pension system the meeting occurred on the occasion of the g8 annual summit united states canada japan germany united kingdom france italy russia in evian on 1 and 2 june 2003 several heads of states that did not belong to the g8 had been invited by the french president jacques chirac who wished to show that the g8 and france in particular were open to dialogue with the rest of the world among those who had responded positively were president lula of brazil and the heads of states or governments of china india nigeria senegal south africa egypt and mexico chirac was trying to give legitimacy to the g8 an informal club of major global powers at a time when its credibility was in question particularly after the brutal repression of the counter g8 protest in genoa in 2001 president chirac s guests met in evian before the actual g8 summit meeting while over 100 000 marched through the streets of geneva switzerland and annemasse france shouting â g8 is illegal luis inacio lula da silva wanted to meet leaders of the european anti globalization movements there were four delegates the president of attac france a woman representative of the italian social forum a swedish woman representative of the campaign against the wto and myself for the cadtm the meeting occurred in geneva in the residence of the brazilian ambassador and it highlighted the gap between lula and the international anti globalization movements changes in the pt and the cut to qualify this highly critical assessment it should be mentioned that the lula government developed a policy of public aid to the poorest through the distribution of social benefits under the programme entitled bolsa familia it should be pointed out that during the 1990s the position of the pt and the cut was gradually watered down the pt won many elected officials in large cities as well as in small and medium sized towns in particular the pt had mayors elected in sao paulo and porto alegre where it gradually adopted a managerial orientation and lost its role as a spur to radical anti capitalist changes i followed this process of adaptation to the institutions of the capitalist state with great disappointment when lula was elected president of brazil at the end of 2002 with a landslide 65 of the votes he and the pt had fundamentally changed they no longer really questioned the capitalist system and lula signed a letter of submission to the imf in the middle of the election campaign in august 2002 in this letter he solemnly declared that if elected president he would abide strictly by the previous government s agreements with the imf only a couple of months after his election he introduced a neoliberal reform of retirement pensions lula also appointed as president of the central bank one of the big bosses henrique meirelles former president of one of the major us banks in brazil the fleet boston the message was clear a representative of the capitalist class was at the head of the central bank lula did not interfere with the army and did not suspend the amnesty extended to those officers of the dictatorship responsible for crimes against humanity this is a major difference with argentina where the 1986 amnesty was cancelled in 2005 which made it possible to condemn and incarcerate several military leaders including the major figures of the military dictatorship enforced in 1976 under the lula presidency the brazilian army participated in the occupation of haiti which was denounced by haitian social movements the top brazilian military leader during the occupation of haiti became a member of bolsonaro s government in 2019 under lula s presidency not a single private corporation was brought back into the public sector on the contrary he supported the interests of private corporations that did not hesitate to bribe civil servants in order to secure procurements as was the case for the emblematic construction company odebrecht the lula government scrupulously repaid its debts without carrying out the audit he had called for when he was in the opposition to qualify this highly critical assessment it should be mentioned that the lula government developed a policy of public aid to the poorest through the distribution of social benefits under the programme entitled bolsa familia family grant this programme improved the income of more than 12 million families i e about 20 of brazil s poorest families please note that the amount of aid was limited at the time of the pt government a family of three could receive a maximum of 50 euros it should be noted that bolsonaro has not stopped this programme which in 2019 benefited 13 5 million families i e one fifth of brazilian families in 2019 a poor family could receive a maximum of 200 reales per month at the exchange rate of november 2019 that is around 40 euros to be entitled to this grant the family must show that its monthly income is below 89 reales that is 20 euros or less than one euro a day per family why did the lula government not combat illegitimate public debt the lula government did not combat illegitimate public debt because they did not want to antagonize brazilian big capital questioning debt repayment would also involve conflict with major private banks and foreign investment funds as well as with the imf the lula government did not combat illegitimate public debt because they did not want to antagonize brazilian big capital questioning debt repayment as a government would have meant conflict with brazilian big capital which benefits largely from the debt buying brazil s internal and external public debt securities these insure a high return since interest rates are very high questioning debt repayment would also involve conflict with major private banks and foreign investment funds as well as with the imf lula and the pt leadership wanted to avoid such conflicts as they gave legitimacy to the debt continued paying it and went even further calling on big capital to contract new public loans the lula government was tolerated or even appreciated by the bourgeoisie all the more so as social measures that benefited people with the lowest income increased the purchasing power of the poor which was good for capitalists business lula s neoliberal policies resulted in a split within the pt with a new party emerging to its left in 2004 that party is the psol party for socialism and freedom since 2001 i have often been back to brazil for the large gatherings of the world social forums around 100 000 people participated each time for meetings of the wsf s international council of which i had been a member from the start and for meetings of social movements there were meetings organized by the brazilian citizens debt audit a member of the cadtm s international network the cadtm s international network repeatedly sent significant delegations to brazil for wsf activities particularly in porto alegre in 2005 and in belem in 2009 when one of the cadtm s world assemblies was held the political situation has changed a lot as pointed out above from 2003 onward the pt clearly turned away from its revolutionary past to become a manager of the system this eventually resulted in deep disappointment not to say distrust especially since several of its leaders were actively involved in major corruption cases including lula himself eventually when the bourgeoisie felt it could manage the country without the pt s collaboration it exposed the party as corrupt this while all other traditional parties are just as deeply corrupt or much more dilma rousseff the pt leader who won the 2010 presidential elections and became president of brazil in 2011 was impeached by the senate in 2016 in what was actually an institutional coup d etat but disappointment towards the pt was so deep that the brazilian people hardly mobilized to defend the pt and its leaders in 2016 and the right wing vice president michel temer appointed by the pt in 2011 replaced dilma rousseff pt as president after masterminding the institutional coup later the antisocial policies implemented by president temer a corrupt right wing leader eventually stirred some popular support for lula as a credible candidate to be reelected president in 2018 so the judiciary system largely controlled by big capital was relentless in its efforts to prevent lula from running for president despite his imprisonment lula was the most likely to win and his supporters hoped that he would be able to participate in the elections this is why the judiciary prohibited him from running and jair bolsonaro was elected president end of 2018 and started his mandate in early 2019 bolsonaro is a far right politician yearning for dictatorship a racist sexist homophobic climate change negationist he is similar to trump while possibly even further to the right his deeply reactionary and antipopular nature is beyond doubt on 21 october 2018 at the end of the election campaign he stated that if he was elected president he would conduct a purge such as brazil has never known he affirmed that the leaders of the workers party must all rot in prison and said of the leftist movements they will have to submit to the law like everyone else either they leave or they go to jail shortly after starting his mandate he promised to remove civil servants with communist ideas his election is a real tragedy for the brazilian people and for the international left we should not expect lula to go back to the sources of the pt his orientation remains the one that prevailed from 2003 to 2016 after bolsonaro s victory a large part of the left fortunately formed a united front and demanded lula s liberation they got it in early november 2019 and lula immediately started a political campaign to win the presidential elections in 2022 this being said we should not expect lula to go back to the sources of the pt his orientation remains the one that prevailed from 2003 to 2016 but he might get elected in 2022 since it is clear that bolsonaro if he completes his mandate will have implemented antisocial policies that increase poverty and deepen the gap between a handful of very rich and the overwhelming majority of brazil s population obviously we need to mobilize widely against the bolsonaro government and in spite of disagreements with the pt we need a broad left wing front within which the pt will play an active part auditing brazil s debt from 2000 and ecuador s in 2007 2008 the brazilian citizens debt audit is an organization founded in the early 2000s in 2000 a referendum was organized on popular initiative by the mst landless workers movement the cut brazil s jubilee south campaign the national conference of bishops which has been positioned on the left since the years 1980 1990 with the support of the pt and more than 90 of the 6 million brazilians who voted were in favour of suspending debt payments for the time it took to carry out an audit to determine how much of it was illegitimate there was acute awareness of the illegitimate character of brazil s debt in a large part of the left and the brazilian population although the audit was provided for in the 1988 constitution the government had never carried it through after the popular referendum of september 2000 parliamentary representatives from the pt brought a draft bill to get it done it was in the aftermath of the referendum that the brazilian citizens debt audit was set up it subsequently joined the cadtm in 2005 during the 5th wsf the brazilian citizens debt audit the cadtm and jubilee south with the support of the mst organized a three day long tribunal against debt in porto alegre which brought together 1000 participants from every continent as pointed out above as soon as lula became president of brazil in 2003 he forgot his commitment to set up an audit of the debt in 2005 during the 5th world social forum the brazilian citizens debt audit the cadtm and jubilee south with the support of the mst landless workers movement organized a three day long tribunal against debt in porto alegre which brought together 1000 participants from every continent next in brazil support for the struggle against illegitimate debt faded mainly because the mst considered that they should rack up their critical support of president lula s government as for the leadership of the cut they had deserted the fight against debt as soon as lula came to office as president nevertheless that did not prevent the brazilian citizens debt audit from battling on through thick and thin to denounce repayment of mainly illegitimate debt the cadtm international gave its constant support to this fight in 2007 at the behest of militants combating illegitimate debt in ecuador maria lucia fattorelli the coordinator of the brazilian citizens debt audit and myself for the cadtm became members of the committee for integral debt audit caic established by the new president of ecuador rafael correa the caic s task was to identify illegitimate debts contracted during the period of 1976 2006 our work reported to the government in september 2008 and made public in november of the same year resulted in the suspension of payments on a significant part of debt demanded from ecuador in the form of sovereign bonds mainly held by banks of the usa the unilateral suspension of payment brought about a resounding victory ecuador imposed on its creditors a reduction of 70 of the debts concerned this enabled a significant increase in social spending from 2009 2010 it is important to note that president lula did not help ecuador with its debt auditing initiative he demanded that rafael correa cease applying pressure on odebrecht and persuaded him to take it to arbitration in a paris court it is important to note that president lula did not help ecuador with its debt auditing initiative this is proved by what happened in the case of the brazilian firm odebrecht which i mentioned earlier the firm built a hydro electric power plant of very poor quality in ecuador odebrecht had overcharged for the work and had not complied with the technical specifications the plant was so badly built that it broke down the audit committee had identified the debt brazil was demanding of ecuador for the plant s construction as illegal and illegitimate despite the fact that it was obviously in the wrong the firm of odebrecht refused to indemnify the state of ecuador in september 2008 to force odebrecht to fulfil its obligations towards the government of ecuador president rafael correa sent the army to occupy the installations of the hydroelectric plant instead of backing up the progressive government of ecuador in face of odebrecht lula protested against ecuador s intervention and recalled his ambassador he demanded that rafael correa cease applying pressure on odebrecht and persuaded him to take it to arbitration in a paris court correa accepted though knowing only too well that the arbitration would favour odebrecht indeed ecuador lost partially the government of brazil and odebrecht came out on top president lula s intervention in 2009 to prevent the launch of a committee to audit odious debt called for by brazilian companies in paraguay now let us look at the case of paraguay an enclave country surrounded by brazil argentina and bolivia in december 2008 the progressive president fernando lugo who had been in office for six months invited me to help him create an audit committee of paraguayan debt i went to asunción for a personal interview with the president followed by a meeting with the paraguayan government most of paraguay s debt could be qualified as odious as it resulted as is still the case from a major agreement made in the 1970s between two military dictatorships it was clear that most of paraguay s debt could be qualified as odious as it resulted as is still the case from a major agreement made in the 1970s between two military dictatorships the brazilian military junta and the paraguayan dictatorship of general stroessner the offending treaty dealt with the construction running and maintenance of what was at the time the biggest dam in the world the itaipu dam i had studied the matter in depth using the excellent documentation elaborated by paraguyan experts moreover a former member of staff of the cadtm in belgium the paraguayan jurist hugo ruiz diaz balbuena had become an adviser to president lugo which made contacts easier the international audit initiative with citizen participation had withered under pressure from the brazilian government during lula s presidency note that big brazilian companies are the main creditors of paraguay which they exploit although he had intended to sign a presidential decree creating the debt audit committee fernando lugo finally gave in to pressure from lula and his government who were protecting the interests of the brazilian firms who were creditors to persuade the paraguayan government to drop the idea of an international audit and of questioning the debt claimed by brazilian firms lula made a few marginal concessions and increased the amount brazil paid paraguay every year for electricity provided by the itaipu dam that said despite the pressure from brazil an audit was carried out by the court of auditors in 2010 and 2011 at the time i went back to paraguay at president fernando lugo s invitation in june 2012 he was eventually overthrown by a â parliamentary coup to use a phrase that had been used in honduras in 2009 and was applied in brazil when dilma rousseff who had succeeded lula as president of brazil from 2011 was overthrown the fact that the right was able to use this form of institutional coup d etat whether in brazil or in paraguay is partly due to the inability of those two left wing governments to affront creditors forcefully and carry out structural reform at the beginning of their mandates they enjoyed enormous popular support but this was deeply eroded by the disappointment engendered by conciliatory policies towards big capital both local and international by the time the right decided to take action people on the left were too disillusioned and disorientated to mobilize in defence of those in power the brazilian citizens debt audit from 2009 to 2019 in 2009 the brazilian citizens debt audit managed to set up a parliamentary committee thanks particularly to active support from the psol socialism and freedom party yet pt mps joined conservative mps to prevent the committee from questioning the legitimacy of brazil s debt then president dilma rousseff 2011 2016 vetoed the organization of such an audit the brazilian citizens debt audit conducted a tireless campaign of consciousness raising in brazil the group trained numerous local sections in brazil and organized correspondence courses to train activists who wanted to audit debt they organized several international rallies the coordinator maria lucia fattorelli also participated in the greek public debt truth committee in greece in 2015 before that she had coordinated the publication of a debt auditing handbook that was translated into french spanish and english in 2018 during the electoral campaign the brazilian citizens debt audit was bitterly disappointed by the presidential campaign of the psol candidate guilherme bolos he considered that continuing debt repayments was not really a problem in 2018 during the electoral campaign the brazilian citizens debt audit was bitterly disappointed by the presidential campaign of the psol candidate guilherme boulos with the agreement of the majority of the psol leadership boulos set aside the issue of questioning debt payment he considered that continuing debt repayments was not really a problem this caused a profound malaise within the psol to put it mildly indeed g boulos s electoral score as the psol candidate for the presidency fell far below the one the party had obtained in the previous presidential campaign in 2014 in 2014 the psol candidate luciana genro had vigorously defended the debt audit and the idea of suspending payments on debt identified as illegitimate g boulos only won a third of the votes luciana genro had won even though for the first time the psol had benefited from a considerable government subsidy for the electoral campaign it only goes to show that by watering down his positions the psol candidate lost part of the radical electorate that had previously supported the psol will this be a lasting development of the ten psol representatives in the brazilian parliament at present several maintain a clear position on debt but what is the true position of the party s leadership at the next psol congress to be held in may 2020 we shall see whether its militants will push for a return to policies more in line with the party s origins within the pt workers party which has 53 members of parliament acceptance of the debt system is deeply anchored in the party s official line and unfortunately we must not nourish any illusions to the contrary despite the criticisms aired above it is obvious that to counter bolsonaro left wing parties and social movements must unite in the broadest possible front only the future will tell whether the huge social mobilizations that have taken or are taking place in countries such as chile ecuador columbia haiti puerto rico and bolivia will find an echo in brazil translated by vicki briault manus and christine pagnoulle cadtm

received for our environmental social and governance efforts this past year in 2020 we re going to further advance our esg initiatives while we are proud of our progress so far we are committed to continually raising the esg bar our latest esg report is available on our website during my remarks today first i will discuss our view of the u s home products market second i will provide my thoughts on our fourth quarter and full year performance and lastly i will speak to it live in the year ahead then i will turn the call to pat and he will speak to our financial performance as well as our 2020 outlook starting with our updated view of the u s home products market as we mentioned last quarter the home products market began to pick up in september and october that activity continued into november and december and the environment remains encouraging into this early portion of 2020 for the fourth quarter we estimate that the global market for our products grew roughly 4 with construction returning to high single digit growth key indicators are pointing to a strengthening backdrop for this year and we continue to have a healthy consumer environment low unemployment and low interest rates trends that we expect to continue throughout 2020 though the sentiment is strong and we are ready to execute as builder activity translates from orders to starts and into our order books as our products go into homes toward the end of the construction project repair and remodel activity remains stable while we may be seeing signs of an improvement in r r we are assuming only a modest acceleration in our 2020 plan we will have a better feel for 2020 r r by late winter or early spring while pat will provide specific details in his comments we are expecting the 2020 market to be at least 200 basis points higher than the 2 to 3 market that we experienced during full year 2019 with expected housing market improvement and solid momentum in our key growth areas between plumbing value priced cabinets and outdoor living we are confident that our 2020 efforts will produce market leading sales growth and solid margin expansion now turning to our performance during the most recent quarter our solid results in the fourth quarter were driven by strong execution from our teams across our businesses producing sales growth and margin performance in each segment in the quarter total company sales increased 4 and operating margin was up 140 basis points to 14 1 our performance in the quarter was also helped by rigorous expense controls across the businesses while we continue to make prioritized investments in key areas to support our growth opportunities turning to our businesses starting with plumbing in the fourth quarter the global plumbing group continued to outperform the global market with sales growth of 12 and operating margin of 21 7 annual operating margin was 21 5 and this marks the fourth consecutive year of market leading growth at 21n plus margins for gpg a clear sign that our strategy is working our plumbing business is firing on all cylinders it is driven by above market growth in both china and the u s we continue to expand our product offering with partnerships and adjacencies which is resulting in accelerated share gains continues to strengthen across all metrics in total and across targeted demographics consistent with our strategy to reenergize our core plumbing business the growth in brand awareness purchase intent and loyalty throughout 2019 was especially good in our targeted entry level demographic which are millennial age dependents they re the largest segment of the population and will drive household formations in new construction for years to come we continue to be the preferred choice for builders and have gained share during the recent quarter and throughout this year adding to our powerful installed base in 2020 for the fifth year in a row moen was named america s most trusted faucet brand by life story research as i mentioned we continue to reenergize the core of the flagship moen brand through brand building and consumer relevant innovation by moen is a great example of this we recently extended our successful digital water platform with the addition of our voice activated kitchen faucet which received a great deal of acclaim at ces and won the kitchen and bath best of 2020 in the smart home category this month along with our flow by moen smart leak detection system in 2019 this marks two years in a row we ve won best of in the smart home technology category at the influential show through strategic partnerships we are creating additional growth engines and increasing the opportunities to leverage our powerful brand and move to market assets recent examples in partnership wins for the brand include moen s spa shower system a advanced showering system that delivers a spotlight experience while using up to 45 less water than the standard channel and along that the aromatherapy shower which uses proprietary aromatherapy pots to enhance the showering experience both were unveiled this month at the 2020 kitchen and bath show in these products are part of innovative partnerships that help drive moen as the leader in consumer driven thoughtful water solutions our strategy is fueling share gains improving brand health and is creating adjacent product opportunities across our route to market our moen china business continues to grow profitably at a double digit growth rate our focus has been to target the largest tier 1 and tier 2 metro markets and to expand our presence with adjacent product categories all channels are working for us and we continue to take share we re closely monitoring the coronavirus outbreak we do not anticipate a material impact on our business at this time finally we are improving our showroom footprint for both moen and the house of roll with enhanced displays and a broader suite of on trend product offerings overall we expect tpg to continue to outperform the global market with category leading margins through best in class brand building and exciting consumer and approach driven innovation that will further differentiate us as an industry leader in addition to reenergize core with multiple growth engines including digital water china m a and strategic partnerships moving on to our doors and security division in the quarter doors and security sales increased 8 and operating margin improved significantly to 14 9 as our doors and security business returned to its previous strong operating performance levels operating performance in doors was solid while managing through a retail inventory rebalancing we believe that inventory rebalancing indoors has concluded and the strong retail pos and recent new construction strength should prove as tailwinds as we enter 2020 in security we saw improved operational performance and margin expansion as last year s platform transition is behind us and pricing is now in place to address inflation and tariffs we saw a strong growth in decking throughout the season including further acceleration as we begin to roll out new fiber on distribution capacity expansions and investment in our bicoastal facilities are under way to support planned growth over the next three years and finally turning to cabinets for cabinets fourth quarter sales were roughly flat versus a year ago excluding the comparison to a 53rd week in 2018 operating margin was 10 1 we continue to see store sales growth in value priced products which were offset by lower sales and higher priced products during the quarter in fact our in stock value price orders were up 18 in the month of december additionally new construction orders are accelerating growth in our builder channel as well under new cabinet s president dave banyard cost out and capacity rebalancing initiatives are accelerating for semi custom and custom products initially we re ramping up our value price capacity and leveraging our mexico and other low cost country supply chain to meet demand that s exceeding our initial expectations anti dumping duties and tariffs are meaningfully reducing chinese imports we re continuing to add capacity and extend the further rollout of our mantra eve and orvana lines across our 4 500 kitchen and bath dealers as well as leverage our strong aristokraft brand all of which are targeted at the heart of this opportunity our mantra line which we ve already rolled out in the northeast is having tremendous success selling demand from value price point products in our key dealer channel we are aggressively moving to add capacity to expand this line in other markets we re also seeing high interest through our retail home center channel given our innovative lines of new products and ability to serve the channel with consistency and quality i expect us to capture share throughout this year and beyond and increasing margin levels to sum up the quarter as a whole we continued to outperform a more modestly growing market and offset tariffs by expanding and growing categories and channels launching innovation and integrating key partnerships transforming our supply chain taking price and staying in front of the ever changing landscape i am proud of our team s ability to deliver in this environment our performance in the quarter and in 2019 as a whole speaks to our team s ability to manage the business tightly during slower periods and to capture share and position us to generate even higher growth during accelerated cycles now looking ahead to 2020 we entered 2020 encouraged by the strengthening marketplace as well as consumer and builder confidence there is significant demand for u s housing and the rate of growth will be dependent on the availability of supply factors such as labor we have built a plan to outperform on a reasonable set of assumptions and see upside should the market be even better against that backdrop we have multiple avenues of growth and our teams are focused on capturing the most profitable of these opportunities by focusing on growth opportunities and cost optimization we will continue to achieve share gains and margin expansion accelerating value creation for investors our 2020 plan assumes a more stable trading tariff environment and we expect to offset all tariff expense by proactive supply chain actions and if necessary for us in 2020 i ve challenged our associates to pursue the next phase of growth with increased focus to drive further value for our shareholders as pat will describe in more detail we have a 2020 plan in place that reflects u s market growth improving on the back of new construction marketing leading performance in the u s and abroad especially in china potential upside to our plan would also occur if the market improves more than we expect and or we achieve greater than expected gains in cabinets at the anti dumping countervailing duty situation plays out we expect to drive margin expansion by cabinets and doors and security improvement initiatives while maintaining industry leading margins in plumbing we also expect to deliver mid single digit sales growth and high single to double digit eps growth our objectives for 2020 remain to deliver market leading sales growth and margin improvement approaching 50 basis points i will now turn the call over to pat pat hallinan chief financial officer thanks nick as a reminder the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains in order to best reflect ongoing business performance let me start with our fourth quarter results sales were 1 47 billion up 4 from a year ago consolidated operating income for the quarter was 207 million up 15 or 26 million compared to the same quarter last year total company operating margin was 14 1 up 140 basis points over the same quarter last year eps was 1 for the quarter up 16 and versus 0 86 the same quarter last year we remain pleased by our team s continued ability to grow sales and earnings during a period of softer market growth but persistence of a challenging trade environment and while navigating significant supply chain transitions in a number of our businesses now let me provide more color on our segment results beginning with plumbing sales for the fourth quarter were 548 million up 60 million or 12 continued strong double digit growth driven by results in china and the u s which powered through the continued market weakness in canada and mexico tolling operating income increased 9 to 119 million for the current quarter operating income for the full year was 436 million an increase of 10 over 2018 operating margin for the quarter was 21 7 and excellent results driven by cost discipline and sales growth leverage for the full year plumbing operating margins came in at 21 5 full year 2019 sales crossed 2 billion for the first time up 8 versus 2018 up 9 adjusting for fx we concluded our fourth straight year of strong growth and over 21 margins our strategies are clearly working and we expect another strong year for plumbing in 2020 doors and security sales for the fourth quarter were 331 million up 24 million or 8 driven by fiber on and operational improvement in our security business door sales were flat as retail inventory rebalancing continued through the fourth quarter we believe this retail inventory rebalancing is complete and we expect solid sales growth in 2020 as retail pos remains solid and new construction is strengthening decking sales were up double digits in the quarter in part aided by new distribution load ins security sales were up in the quarter due to strength in retail locks and commercial products and favorable comps for last years service issues operating income was 50 million during the quarter up 85 over the same quarter last year driven by operating improvement in doors and security and by 2018 security costs operating income for the full year was 177 million an increase of 14 versus 2018 segment operating margin for doors and security increased 620 basis points for the quarter over last year to 14 9 and was 13 2 for the full year up slightly versus 2018 as the segment invested in fiber on for full year 2019 sales were 1 4 billion an increase of 14 over the prior year turning to cabinets sales for the fourth quarter were 591 million which was roughly flat if adjusted for the 53rd week in 2018 we continue to experience strong growth of value priced products while sales of higher priced products contracted during the quarter operating income for the fourth quarter was 60 million down 2 million versus the prior year and for the full year was 231 million roughly flat to a year ago operating margin for the quarter was 10 1 and 9 7 for the full year both up 10 basis points versus the respective 2018 period this net of our full year operating margin target of 10 was due to temporary inefficiencies experienced during the fourth quarter which resulted from expanding and optimizing our mexican manufacturing footprint this has been rectified and early first quarter production rates and efficiency are already at the levels we had expected to achieve during the fourth quarter we expect cabinets operating margin improvement in 2020 as cabinets president dave banyard accelerates our efforts to cut costs and rightsized capacity in higher priced product segment while aggressively growing our value price point business in an efficient manner full year 2019 sales were 2 4 billion down 1 or roughly flat adjusted for the 53rd week in 2018 for the total company to sum up our full year consolidated 2019 performance sales increased 5 to nearly 5 8 billion 6 adjusting for fx eps grew 8 to 3 60 demonstrating our ability to deliver growth and margin improvement a slower tariff challenge market our total company operating margin was 50 basis points to 13 3 in line with our full year 2019 plan free cash flow was 527 million reflecting a conversion rate of 104 2020 should benefit from the expense control executed in 2019 and from an improving u s housing market before turning to the balance sheet i want to take a moment to provide a perspective on our tariff recovery efforts and the impact on our business we continue to mitigate the impact of current tariffs through an extensive supply chain effort and then when necessary the pricing through this combination of actions we were able to offset roughly 20 million of gross tariff exposure in the quarter and offset roughly 50 million for the full year for full year 2020 we expect gross tariff exposure in the range of roughly 55 million plus or minus 5 million which we expect to offset fully with supply chain actions and if necessary price turning to the balance sheet our balance sheet remained strong with cash of 388 million net debt of 1 8 billion and our net debt to ebitda leverage is now two times we continue to have the capacity and flexibility to fund potential acquisitions and share repurchases turning to the details of our outlook for 2020 based on the global market for our products growing 3 to 5 with the u s housing market growing 4 to 6 and canada and mexico being flat to slightly negative within this market forecast we expect u s new construction growth of 5 to 8 and u s r r growth up 3 to 4 based on these assumptions we expect 2020 full year sales growth of 5 to 6 we expect full year eps within the range of 3 83 and to 4 03 for 2020 we expect growth to be driven by a u s housing market fueled by strong new construction growth and by continued share gain success via our plumbing category expansion in china decking distribution gains and value price point opportunities in cabinet specifically our outlook for each business as it relates to our overall plan plumbing net sales growth of 5 to 7 with operating margins of 21 plus percent doors and security net sales growth of 4 to 7 and with operating margins of 13 and a half to 14 cabinets net sales growth of 4 to 6 with operating margins of 10 5 plus percent as stated earlier tariff exposure will be roughly 55 million plus or minus 5 million we expect to offset this exposure fully within 2020 we expect 2020 free cash flow of approximately 565 million to 585 million which includes the accelerated investments in capacity and inventory to support value price point products and cabinets and new composite decking customers we expect a cash conversion rate at or above 95 the annual eps outlook includes the following assumptions corporate expenses of about 85 million interest expense of approximately 85 to 90 million a tax rate between 25 and 26 and average fully diluted shares of approximately 141 million to summarize we have put together a 2020 plan that provides solid sales and eps growth potential exists for upside to our plans and guidance as some combination of the following occurs labor is available to address fully the u s new construction demand that appears to be high single to double digit in nature if u s r r growth improved beyond the 3 to 4 assumed in our plan if the impact of anti dumping and countervailing duties on cabinets from china accelerates meaningfully beyond that experience during the latter portion of the fourth quarter of 2019 better insight to these upside opportunities will unfold during the first half as this occurs and as merited we would adjust our guidance accordingly our teams remain committed to driving market being sales performance and to continued operating margin improvement i will now pass the call back to brian for some closing remarks brian lantz senior vice president of communications and corporate administration thanks pat that concludes our prepared remarks on the fourth quarter and full year of 2019 we will now begin taking a limited number of questions since there may be a number of you who would like to ask a question i d ask that you limit your initial questions to two and then reenter the queue to ask additional questions i will now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question and answer session operator questions answers operator thank you your first question comes from justin speer with zelman and associates your line is open justin speer zelman and associates analyst thanks guys appreciate it i wanted to start with cabinets just looking at that growth there i know it was muddled by the 53rd week last year but with what you re seeing with anti dumping duties curious what you re seeing on the ground real time and how you think your book of business will grow relative to the market in light of what you re seeing with the antidumping duties and the impact on chinese imports pat hallinan chief financial officer justin i ll start with if you take a step back from that start there s no question there is a ton of demand for value price point cemetery we saw that come through frankly throughout the whole year particularly strong in the fourth quarter and in december i mean plus 18 for orders for that part of the marketplace so you take that as a backdrop we have the product suite that s well set against that we re putting in capacity to serve that and then as you look to the anti dumping countervailing duties to the extent that materializes or materializes even quicker than we would anticipate i think that s an additional demand tailwind so as you think about it i mean it s been a healthy very very healthy part of the business even prior to these antidumping duties coming into effect and now as we see them come into effect there s a potential tailwind as we said before there was a very big inventory hangover that needs to work its way through the system our estimation is that s probably coming out around now as we head into q1 and beyond but if you look if you step back and you look at our overall plan we re projecting 4 to 6 growth for the segment that s a pretty significant departure away from what s been call it flat to down over the last couple of years and even as a category inclusive of subsidizing ports we would ve estimated that we re in the 2 to 3 range and so we are seeing it come through we ve got a significant amount i d say baked into the year but beyond that it s going to take a couple of years for the kind of capacity to be built in to service that part of the market with the quality and service that our customers expect of us if we were to size that now we would guess that s probably 200 to 300 million incremental opportunity that for our business at the part of the business that we want to go after with the margin structure we want to go after and we fully intend as we continue to roll out these products and put in the capacity to go get that business justin speer zelman and associates analyst excellent and then just one follow up question for plumbing the growth there has been really special and i wanted to maybe get some context if you can unpack that growth for us by your regions or core markets and really help us understand what s going on in china it s been a really good growth there but what you re doing there and how much runway you have in that growth initiative brian lantz senior vice president of communications and corporate administration ok well i ll give you some high level views and then i ll turn it over to pat can give you some specifics i d say first if you step back you look at a quarter like q4 lights out performance you look at a year like 2019 in a 9 ex fx in what was a slow market so i d say thank you for the compliment really solid performance and to put up that kind of performance it really has to come across the whole portfolio so you do have a business that has really been firing on all cylinders the way they re going about that i d say is two fold one has been a really strong focus on reenergizing the business so that is the nonbrand in the u s market and really powering that through the twin engines of brand building and innovation now on the brand building front we rolled out about a year now our hero for beautiful water campaign and we re seeing market improvement across all spectrums of brand health awareness loyalty purchase intent and it s driving share gains and as we mentioned in the remarks particularly with our targeted demographic which is the entry level homebuyer particularly really no age to adults and so that is a really important part and we didn t start but we brand to begin with we started with a strong brand and so and i really commend the team s willingness to kind of disrupt themselves and drive performance there you take that brand building and then you couple it with some of the innovation that you might have seen at biz and the consumer relevant innovation that we re bringing which is not only helping to our share gains is helping drive reappraisal of the brand and so those are two really powerful pillars that are helping drive the business and then we layer on against that reenergized core what we call our growth engines so china is one of them some of the partnerships that we brought to bear digital waters and other if you look at china specifically the growth has been excellent the team is performing really really well we really do emphasize that it needs to be sustainable profitable growth and so we want to see really nice leverage coming through that p l and creating their fuel to reinvest in the business they did a great job of that in 2019 and what they ve been particularly strong at is taking our core assets of moen brand and our route to market and great key customer relationships and using it to leverage category expansion beyond just faucets and showering and so for example we entered sanitary wear where we re i d say we probably have about one point of market share today starting to put up some really significant growth there and so we feel that the path ahead of us is really really got a long runway as we continue to expand beyond the core into areas in which you know there s plenty of room to still grow pat do you have any other color around pat hallinan chief financial officer no i would build on the comments around sustainable profitable growth i think justin our expectation on the market in china so the overall market is 5 or less so we re expecting the economy inclusive of the housing economy to slow down in china but a lot of the strength of our growth has been through category expansion by getting into product lines that we re not into in nafta things like sanitary wear and our market share of sanitary wear in china is less than 1 and so while we would fully expect the chinese market to moderate there s two things that we feel still remain in our favor there is one the chinese government does rely on housing for its overall gdp growth so we think it s going to moderate but not greater in the near term and then second we have a lot of growth from category expansion to go and so we re managing our business in china just like we do here in the u s in the broader nafta region which is sustainable profitable growth and we expect that of the team on the ground in china and they ve delivered very well against that justin speer zelman and associates analyst thank you operator your next question comes from phil with jefferies your line is open phil ng jefferies analyst hey guys your 4 to 6 sales guidance for cabinets that s pretty impressive sharp reacceleration just curious if you could unpack for us if you ve layered any pricing and help us understand how many points of growth you ve layered in for the tariff dynamic we re taking share in and remind us like how much of your business in cabinets is tied in new construction pat hallinan chief financial officer yeah i would say first i ll reference 2019 so you look at full year 2019 which adjusting for the 53rd week is a roughly flat year you were seeing in any we have multiple value price point product offerings you re seeing mid single digit to high single digit growth for pre existing brands obviously things that are new like mantra are growing off of you know a new base so growing rapidly but off of a new base we would expect next year that all of our entry price point brands which are you know quickly becoming over 50 of our business they finished 2019 at you know in the high 40 of our business will probably be in the 50 to 55 of our business next year we re going to expect them to be growing in the high single to low double digit range across a range of product lines that service that market and we re going to expect the rest of the business to be toward flat and that there is some improvement in that as well we ve been pulling back from certain parts of the higher price point business and we ve also seen some stability of semi custom in the dealer channel not perfect stability yet so that s our outlook and we would expect a lot of that growth above the market you know because you re thinking of a 4 to 6 housing market when you re talking value price point brands growing roughly double that you know that is in part on the china import situation but it s just also in part on consumers and trades people continuing to shift toward value price point products whether they were using imports or not previously phil ng jefferies analyst got it ok that s really helpful sorry nick fink chief executive officer you re really starting to see the effect of the pivot and the balance of the portfolio as the growing part which has been growing really well for a while it s just become the majority of the portfolio you just have to balance that more toward growth and as pat referenced those trends of kind of accelerated value price point and more stabilized dealer semi custom we saw that toward the end of the year and so as that plays through you just get a much better growth mix phil ng jefferies analyst got it that s helpful and from a growth and performance standpoint great to see doors and security bounce back you know help us understand the key drivers for what you re targeting for 2020 certainly the door side of things levered to new construction are you starting to see that part of the business reaccelerate and some of the operational and tariff dynamics on your security side is it pretty much behind you and we should expect that part of the business kind of reaccelerate from a growth standpoint and profitability standpoint thanks nick fink chief executive officer ok let me ok i think those in products and then i ll hand it to pat for a little bit more color i d say if you step back from doors and security i would start with a lot of growth that we expect to come out of fiberon so we re very very focused on the expansion of the fiberon opportunity and as a reminder the main opportunity there is against what that s 80 of the market and as we go in there we saw a strong consumer brand again kind of unbranded wood and put the expansion into our bicoastal footprint and again it s our new distribution gains you know we expect a fair amount of growth to come out of that business that started to go in at the end of last year as we start to shift toward our distribution gains and i d say that was tracking ahead of expectations so we feel very good about the fiberon opportunity and we ll talk to that in a bit more detail if you go over to doors doors from a pos perspective actually performed really well in the fourth quarter we had some inventory rebalancing inside of retail where we believe we re through that now and then we do expect as you point out to see some acceleration on the wholesale side with exposure to new construction there and inventory was fair throughout the year and so that is a nice opportunity as we through that rebalancing and in security yes through the operational challenges associated with that kind of product platform change that we did we saw the big bounce back in margin which was really healthy and then some nice performance coming through and so that will be much more post that just kind of back to good execution mode pat hallinan chief financial officer yeah i mean so all the businesses grew both in the quarter and the year and i think as you look that s referencing 19 obviously as you look into 2020 as nick referenced we would expect decking to grow roughly mid teens or better we would expect doors to move with the u s new construction and r r market it s probably 60 plus percent new construction so it s going to be in the mid single digits and it will travel higher than that if the labor is available but because it certainly seems like there s new construction demand that s really strong and then we would expect our security business to be in the low to mid single digits depending on the mix of business but you know all businesses grew in the quarter and the year the issues that challenged us at the end of 18 in security are long behind us and the team is very focused on both growth and margin expansion you know across all the business units phil ng jefferies analyst that s great color thanks a lot operator your next question comes from timothy wojs with baird your line is open timothy wojs robert w baird and company analyst hey guys good afternoon nick fink chief executive officer hey tim pat hallinan chief financial officer tim timothy wojs robert w baird and company analyst maybe just on cabinets maybe if you could give us just a little bit of an update on where you feel you are from a capacity standpoint particularly on the semi custom business so i think that that business is maybe undershot your expectations in 2019 and it seems like you re seeing a little bit of a recovery there so just kind of curious when you think you can align some of the capacity there for more of a kind of flat to flattish type market nick fink chief executive officer yeah i would estimate we ll be through that kind of by the end of 2020 so there s still some work to do most of the work has been done the team s put a lot of gates i think now we re probably in the final stretches but expect a bit more to come out as we just rebalance it and make it more efficient and you know it s not it wasn t just as simple as kind of taking a bit out the route to doing that was a big amount of work against creating a network that was far more flexible across all of our nodes than you historically have seen in the cabinet business and so as we come on the backside it s really about having a more effective footprint i think is the way to think about it probably more variable ability to drive across different areas of it and so if we re growth were to come through that we would have the flexibility to address it but we d start out from a much better cost position i estimate by the end of the year we re probably through that i d say it s been pretty accelerating with dave banyard s leadership in there and really pressing on both accelerators of getting through the semi custom rebalancing as well as putting in more capacity on the value and stock side of the business where and we re seeing such growth timothy wojs robert w baird and company analyst ok ok that s helpful and then just on plumbing just the overall growth guide for 2020 so you guys did close to 9 which is great in 2019 and you re guiding more to slow down there i guess in 2020 despite seeing faster new construction i think that business tends to be overweight new construction so could you just kind of true us up on why exactly that would be happening or why is it exactly we see acceleration pat hallinan chief financial officer yeah tim recall that the plumbing business in total has a healthy chunk call it two thirds or thereabouts that is r r and even within that r r it has just a pure replace component that is a bit unique to plumbing versus the rest of our home products business and so we have we re expecting kind of a modest r r acceleration they don t call it three and a half plus or minus half a percentage point and pure replace tends to trail below that and then we re moderating china a bit and so i think it s nothing more than the mix of a u s housing market that we expect you know to be in somewhere in the 4 to 6 range and beat that and then have china be in the teens or thereabouts timothy wojs robert w baird and company analyst ok ok sounds good appreciate the color there goodluck on 2020 nick fink chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from michael rehaut with jp morgan your line is open michael rehaut j p morgan analyst thanks good afternoon everyone first question i had was on how you re thinking about capital deployment this year and next obviously you guys have always taken a pretty balanced approach between after you know the necessary capex you know kind of balancing it between bolt on opportunities or acquisitions and share repurchase you know with the strong free cash flow generation expected you know just trying to get a sense of no 1 how you see the m a backdrop today in terms of the opportunity set in front of you is it greater or lesser than it s been and maybe talk about valuations a little bit you know and if that remains a little quieter this year if we could expect an acceleration of share repurchase nick fink chief executive officer sure i d be happy to talk about that and so just again the priorities we ve always been consistent and very clear first and foremost we do look for opportunities within the business those are our highest returns and we have some really nice things that we re investing behind that are going to drive good growth and then next we go to target an m a and it s accretive and to the extent beyond that we look to return excess capital to the shareholders and so that s kind of our clear priority in that order if you look within m a specifically our priorities are going to remain within plumbing and outdoor living but we are also always evaluating other branded higher margin opportunities where we feel that we could drive incremental value by leveraging the fbhs model into them and you know fiberon is a great example of that we had a model in the playbook that we thought we could bring to it we had an asset in a route to market system through therma tru that was best in class and so bringing the brand building capability the route to market capability to gain something like that has allowed us to drive a lot of value incurred for our shareholders and so that s how we re thinking about opportunities specifically with respect to flow m a we saw in 2019 i think there s no question as should be expected i think in a year where the housing market was slower sellers probably since year working their businesses and driving to better performance i m not going to get into the business of trying to predict whether things get done or not but if i m to measure it by the level of activity i would say for sure that activity has increased and we re definitely seeing increased imbalance that our team is working on and so it does feel that as we re coming into this strengthening housing market there is increased activity in m a and you know you can just sort of play out probability against that that said you touched on valuations as well we will stay disciplined we got a good track record for being disciplined and we will be disciplined and against high valuations we re really going to focus on the quality of synergies and the quality of value creation that we can bring and hold the bar high on that with respect to buybacks we do run our model against the stock and against our plan and what we expect our plan to deliver in terms of value accretion for shareholders and tend to look opportunistically to buy stock as we have in the past in 2019 we spent about 100 million and our stock is still undervalued there s a way to go and so as we kind of balance out those opportunities we ll be testing the value against what we know to be our value creation as we go along michael rehaut j p morgan analyst great thank you very much i appreciate all those comments i guess for my second question i just wanted to revisit cabinets for a moment obviously a big transition over the last couple of years and you know the comments you made around the new management team continuing to accelerate some of the transition work that you re doing just wanted to get a little bit of perspective in terms of perhaps what inning you think we re in in terms of that transition because obviously we ve heard a lot of you know the restructuring and the capacity shifts have been ongoing now for perhaps 18 months or so so just trying to get a sense of where we are in that process how much further you think we need to go because obviously that also comes along with it maybe a little bit higher or temporary area of expense or disruption or inefficiency and would there be another step function improvement let s say if we re still getting through that this year another step function improvement and profitability to expect in 21 nick fink chief executive officer sure i d start by saying i think we re in the later innings of the pivot in u s it s been going on for a long time and it has been monumental shifting the footprint to the extent we ve shifted it i think the outcomes of the fruit that s bearing off of that is the kind of growth that we re expecting in 2020 and so if you think about it we ve had to make the change to get to a point where our footprint supports that kind of growth that would indicate to me that we re in the later stages of the pivot and come to a point where in 2020 indicating 4 to 6 growth with meaningful margin progress now we re not done but a lot of the changes are well under way and now we re starting to see the benefits now you look a little bit even within q4 and we re encouraged by seeing really really strong orders at that value price point where we re putting in capacity plus 18 for december and seeing stabilized semi custom orders in q4 in our dealer channel against that semi custom business and then you look to the margin performance within that and pat touched on this that we saw some temporary inefficiency as we ramped more mexico capacity and you re right i mean it is very hard to do when you experience inefficiency along the way we re now through that and we re seeing the solid margin progress that we expected to see not coming through the business as we re through it end of december and into january and so just another good proof point to us that as we round the corner on the pivot it starts to look for that kind of growth and margin accretion with the business pointed in the right way we have the capacity where we need it and we re starting to get the performance out of it and so there is work to do we will continue to be balanced in the customer activity working really really hard to put in more value price point capacity and with the growth rates we re seeing we re going to have to add capacity there but i believe in 2020 you re going to see the benefit of the work that s been done over the last 18 months come through from both the top line and a margin perspective michael rehaut j p morgan analyst great thanks very much nick fink chief executive officer sure operator your next question comes from susan maklari with goldman sachs your line is open susan maklari goldman sachs analyst thank you good evening nick fink chief executive officer hey susan susan maklari goldman sachs analyst my first question is just can you talk a little bit to the raw material environment that you are seeing as we go into 2020 how that s kind of baked into some of these margins some of the margin guidance you ve given us and how we should be thinking about it coming through over the course of the year pat hallinan chief financial officer yeah so for i ll start with 2019 and i ll go to 2020 to put them both in perspective so 2019 i d say total inflation commodities tariffs logistics was about 80 85 million in total a little more than 2 of cost of goods sold and of that 80 85 million about 50 ish million was tariffs as we look into 2020 and we look at inflation again looking at those same three components we would see full year inflation in the 40 to 50 million range you know so roughly 1 of cogs but 10 million of that is logistics and so in terms of inflation it s about half the rate that we saw in 2019 and we ll offset it with supply chain and where necessary price tariffs a bit more i d say a complicated element in the sense that what things are falling off versus coming on so i kind of put tariffs into a non inflationary discussion they were about 50 million in total in 19 they ll be about 55 million in total to the p l in 2020 but that is with again certain things falling off new things annualizing and some things coming off the balance sheet so i think of tariffs less of an inflation driver and more of a year over year almost flat dynamic we re dealing with we will exit the year with some tariff favorability as some of the balance sheet stuff comes off in the first half of the year but you shouldn t see a margin profile cadence throughout the year that is driven by any real specific inflationary or tariff dynamic none of them are big enough relative to supply chain and pricing actions in the quarter and most of what s driving the 19 result and the 20 result in terms of tariffs are different board product and other hardwood products glass and logistics much more so than metals susan maklari goldman sachs analyst ok that s very helpful thank you and then you know to follow up you mentioned in your remarks nick that there is upside to this guide and to your results this year depending on how things move obviously with all the initiatives you have going on as well as the macro but as you kind of look across the business and the opportunity set and the things that you are doing where do you see the most opportunity where could we expect the most upside in there and you know how do you think about that coming through nick fink chief executive officer well i ll take a step back and for starters i look at almost 19 as the proof point right i couldn t be prouder of our team s performance in 19 frankly it was a year we tended up with a softer market than we anticipated and all sorts of stuff coming at us and the business outperformed the market right it solidly outperformed the market against margin accretion and so if you take that kind of momentum and you place it against our assumptions for 20 you know what we ve done in 20 is we built a plan that will outperform the market and i would take that as a starting point now we ve made assumptions around what we think the market will do we re seeing some really encouraging from builders we have assumed a rate at which that activity is going to convert from both their order books into permits starts and then our orders we see r r and we see demand for housing we see a really favorable interest rate environment or mortgages we ve got to make we ve made some i d say fairly prudent assumptions about the rate at which r r could improve over the course of the year and then we put around at a plan which we go well we re going to beat that market so the underlying premise is to the extent that that market turns out to be better we expect to still have market outperformance and that s where we ll see upside and that upside would place us toward the high end of our guidance and that s conceptually how we think about it now where would that come through well new construction is an area which we ve made a set of assumptions to the extent that builders are able to get labor conversion in foster or productivity of labor out there could be some upside there if r r strengthens or in another area is if the anti dumping countervailing duties have an even foster effect on our cabinets business than we ve anticipated all of those are areas for opportunity you know if you look in how that plays out against the portfolio one thing that s really nice about our portfolio is we ve got this balanced exposure to that r r market about two thirds of the portfolio but we ve got some really nice exposure to the new construction market and the way we work it is in a slow year like 19 we ll manage expenses very tightly to still deliver a good year for shareholders but in a year with some market tailwind as we expect 20 to be we really hope to enjoy that exposure to the new construction and that plays out to various degrees but it plays out throughout the portfolio and so i think if you look at plumbing doors decking i mean all of those and of course cabinets are exposed to some of that new construction tailwind operator and that s all the time that we have for questions i turn the call back to the presenters for any closing remarks duration 61 minutes call

think this bull market will just go on and on forever pour yourself a cuppa joe and read my column today this is your wake up call when stocks are overpriced as they are now it takes little disappointment to send them lower one looming disappointment right now is weak earnings growth below i ll show you the right defensive moves to make under current conditions first let s take a quick look at fourth quarter 2019 earnings growth rates year over year posted so far by the s p 500 as of january 29 the following chart breaks down the performance of all 11 s p 500 sectors on a blended basis blended combines actual results for companies that have reported and estimated results for companies that have yet to report as you can see utilities and financials lead the pack with energy and materials as the worst laggards and yet despite these lackluster earnings results overall stock market valuations are historically high as of yesterday s market close the forward 12 month price to earnings p e ratio for the s p 500 stood at 19 2 this forward p e ratio surpasses the four most recent historical averages for the s p 500 5 year 16 7 10 year 14 9 15 year 14 5 and 20 year 15 5 looney tunes on wall street the stock market continues to defy gravity i m reminded of the warner brothers cartoons that i watched as a kid on television every saturday morning i particularly loved wile e coyote in frantic pursuit of the road runner the hapless predator would run straight off a cliff and continue to pump his legs in midair until he glanced around gulped and plummeted into the canyon perhaps the stock market faces a wile e coyote moment signs of slowing economic growth could jolt the markets back to reality the government revealed wednesday that the u s goods trade deficit increased sharply in december despite u s tariffs designed to close the gap businesses also grew tentative on accumulating inventory the u s commerce department reported yesterday that america s goods trade gap soared 8 5 to 68 3 billion last month the reading prompted the atlanta fed to lower its fourth quarter gross domestic product estimate to a 1 7 pace from a 1 9 rate washington and beijing signed a phase one trade deal this month that rolled back a limited number of tariffs but don t forget that u s duties remain in effect on 360 billion worth of chinese imports president trump yesterday signed the united states mexico canada agreement uscma which replaces the north american free trade agreement nafta when it comes to uscma investors should as the comedian larry david might say curb their enthusiasm my assessment is that uscma is a hollow pr exercise that only marginally alters nafta credible analysts share my view in return for appearing tough on trade the u s has managed to alienate canada and mexico two erstwhile allies the fact is global trade negotiations over the past two years haven t alleviated the u s trade deficit not that the trade deficit actually matters but that s a complex topic for another column what the trade war has done though is put pressure on corporate profits as reflected in weak fourth quarter operating results despite ostensible truces in the trade war business confidence has been shaken by tariffs the commerce department also reported yesterday that retail inventories were unchanged in december after declining 0 8 in november a sign that the economy could contract in coming months in a separate report wednesday the national association of realtors nar revealed that its pending home sales index fell by an unexpectedly sharp 4 9 in december the largest drop since may 2010 the consensus estimate had called for a 1 month over month rise nar cited a shortage of houses on the market as the main culprit compared with one year ago pending sales were up 4 6 a home is still the biggest asset of most americans and remains integral to consumer confidence when the real estate market prospers and unemployment is low people feel wealthier instrumental in generating a wealth effect among americans has been the steady rise in home prices since their collapse during the great recession of 2008 2009 but the wealth effect has diminished in recent months the cooling in december of the housing market is making investors nervous because of the potential ripple effect throughout the economy and financial markets don t expect the federal reserve to come to the rescue this year we ve reached the limits of monetary accommodation central banks in europe and japan have pegged short term policy rates below zero the fed has indicated that it will stand pat on rates in the foreseeable future indeed in a news conference wednesday fed chairman jerome powell pointedly rejected the notion that the u s central bank might adopt negative interest rates although the fed lowered rates three times last year the white house hasn t been satisfied and continues to lobby for below zero rates to stimulate the economy and remember rates can t stay low forever they ll eventually start rising again especially as the massive u s federal deficit takes its toll as the deficit explodes politicians are using

about this story it is an abridged version of the original produced by it is an abridged version of the original produced by calmatters org a nonprofit nonpartisan media venture explaining california policies and politics reporters felicia mello and judy lin contributed to this report with democrats holding all the political power in california for nearly the last decade the golden state has evolved into a laboratory for big blue ideas put a price on carbon we ve done it provide health insurance to undocumented immigrants we do some of that too gun control minimum wage hikes and heavy taxes on the rich are also realities here democratic candidates for president with rare exceptions typically don t point to california as a model at least not explicitly but many of the major policies they re proposing are already happening here to some degree below are some key ways democratic presidential candidates want to make the united states more like california along with analysis of what the state s policy experiments reveal so far tom steyer is the only californian who remains in the race others taking a page from us include michael bennett joe biden michael bloomberg pete buttigieg tulsi gabbard amy klobuchar bernie sanders elizabeth warren and andrew yang boost the minimum wage to 15 per hour what they re proposing nearly all the major democratic candidates want to more than double the federal minimum wage by raising it to 15 an hour exception andrew yang instead proposes giving every american 1 000 a month sanders warren and klobuchar are co sponsors of federal legislation that would gradually raise the hourly minimum wage to 15 over five years biden buttigieg steyer and gabbard also support a 15 minimum wage reflecting the influence of the fight for 15 campaign that labor unions have waged around the country what california is doing california was the first state to approve a 15 minimum wage when lawmakers and then gov jerry brown cut a deal with labor unions in 2016 the unions agreed to take a minimum wage measure off the ballot if the state passed a law increasing wages brown won a provision that allows the state to suspend wage increases during economic downturns california s law gradually phases in wage increases over eight years with a 15 minimum required at all businesses in 2023 how s it going here critics said the forced raises would lead employers to lay off people and replace them with machines as one los angeles business owner did when he learned he d have to pay his dishwashers more but empirical research suggests that for the most part pay increases are not pushing people out of jobs an economist at the university of massachusetts amherst studied seven states including california that have raised wages and found minimal impact on employment however we haven t yet hit the 15 requirement in 2020 the state s minimum wage is 13 for workers at companies of 26 employees or more and 12 at smaller businesses give workers paid family leave what they re proposing all major democratic candidates say they want americans to be able to take at least three months off work with pay to care for a new baby or seriously ill family member gabbard klobuchar sanders and warren co sponsored legislation that would create a national family leave program giving workers two thirds of their normal pay for up to 12 weeks money to pay for it would come from a payroll tax on employers and employees at a rate of 2 cents per 10 in wages bennett biden and buttigieg have told the washington post they support that bill or another plan for 12 weeks of paid family leave steyer and yang have said they d like to go even further and offer six months of paid family leave what california is doing in 2004 california was the first state in the nation to create paid family leave offering workers six weeks of partial pay to care for a newborn or sick family member workers pay for it through a 1 percent payroll tax that goes into the state disability insurance fund gov gavin newsom has expanded the program giving workers eight weeks of paid family leave starting on july 1 how s it going here though almost all workers pay into the program only half of eligible mothers and a quarter of eligible fathers took paid family leave in 2017 state officials report many low wage workers don t take paid leave because they can t afford to get by on partial earnings the program gives workers 60 percent to 70 percent of their normal paychecks depending on their income other workers don t take it because they may lose their jobs if they do legislation to expand job protections and increase the rate of pay has stalled in the past but likely will return to the state capitol though businesses feared increased costs and turnover from giving workers paid family leave a harvard study of the program s first six years showed that didn t turn out to be the case legalize marijuana what they re proposing most of the candidates want to make recreational as well as medical marijuana legal nationwide though a few take the more moderate position of wanting to give states the power to decide bennet sanders and warren co sponsored a federal bill that would legalize marijuana expunge convictions for its use or possession and establish a grant program to bring job training libraries and youth programs to communities most affected by the war on drugs castro buttigieg and yang also favor nationwide legalization with buttigieg going further by saying he also wants to eliminate incarceration for all federal drug possession crimes and retroactively reduce sentences for other drug offenses klobuchar did not co sponsor her congressional colleagues cannabis legalization bill instead she s put her name on legislation that would essentially let states decide whether to permit marijuana biden also wants to leave it up to states to decide whether to allow recreational use but backs legalizing marijuana for medical use nationwide what california is doing california is one of 11 states that have sanctioned cannabis golden state voters made medical marijuana legal in 1996 and approved recreational use in 2016 the law allows adults age 21 and over to possess up to an ounce of marijuana and grow up to six plants for personal use commercial growers and dispensaries must get a license from the state and pay taxes cities are allowed to ban the sale of cannabis and smoking it in public remains illegal the law also downgraded penalties for nearly every crime involving marijuana allowing people with past convictions to petition the court to be resentenced or cleared how s it going here marijuana has become a major lobbying force in the statehouse where newsom is a champion for legalization still creation of a legal marketplace has proved rocky the black market remains huge roughly three quarters of california weed still is being sold illegally most cities in the state have banned dispensaries setting off a legal battle over how much local control the state law provides tax revenues from legal sales are coming in below expectations and producers are pushing back against the state s move to increase tax rates marijuana remains an all cash enterprise because federal law prevents cannabis businesses from using banks the criminal justice impact of legalization is also nascent in the first year after legalization only 10 percent of eligible people took steps to have their prior cannabis crimes downgraded or cleared some prosecutors are working with a nonprofit to identify and inform people who could have their records cleared put a price on carbon what they re proposing most democratic candidates want to curb global warming in part by putting a price on greenhouse gas pollution such as a carbon tax or cap and trade system notable exceptions gabbard and sanders told the washington post they oppose putting a price on carbon yang proposes taxing carbon emissions 40 a ton and increasing the tax over time biden s proposal is less specific calling on congress to pass a law by 2025 putting a price or tax on carbon warren has said she s open to a carbon tax though her climate plan doesn t spell out details for one steyer has donated millions to campaigns aiming to create carbon pricing programs in oregon and washington and defending the one in california what california is doing california s carbon pricing program launched in 2013 the state s cap and trade system forces industry here to either reduce emissions or pay for permits to spew greenhouse gases into the atmosphere auctions where companies buy and sell those permits yield billions of dollars which the state government plows into programs designed to slow climate change such as incentives for solar panels and discounts on clean cars the cap and trade program covers businesses responsible for about 85 percent of the state s greenhouse gas emissions including oil refineries food processors paper mills cement manufacturers and electricity providers that makes it the most wide reaching carbon pricing system in the united states how s it going here california s greenhouse gas emissions have been dropping since its cap and trade experiment began though it s hard to pinpoint how much to credit the complex system it s become a centrist environmental policy attracting support from moderate republicans as well as democrats but it s also criticized by the right and left conservatives complain it adds costs for businesses and consumers while liberals say the system doesn t go far enough to stop pollution in california companies have been allowed to offset some of their obligation by paying for environmental projects in far flung locations such as an incinerator in arkansas cap and trade is one reason gas costs more in california than other states adding about a dime per gallon nonetheless polls show a majority of californians want to fight climate change and don t mind paying more to do it and businesses prefer cap and trade s market based approach over stricter government mandates a recently released report from the nonpartisan legislative analyst concluded the state had scrubbed enough carbon from its economy over the past decade to exceed its climate goals thus far largely due to electricity being increasingly generated by renewables instead of coal the report credited the state s renewable energy mandate as a substantial driver of the shift cap and trade s effects it said are thought to have been relatively modest compared to other policies california s cap and trade system also has fallen short of becoming the national trendsetter originally envisioned by the lawmakers who created it no other states have linked up with california even fellow left coast states oregon and washington have rejected proposals to join two canadian provinces joined california s system but ontario has since backed out and the trump administration is suing california to try to sever its link with quebec contending it amounts to a state illegally engaging in foreign policy california s loner status raises questions about whether one state can remedy a global problem absent a federal approach temporarily take guns from threatening people what they re proposing all of the democratic candidates say they support allowing people to petition a court to have firearms temporarily taken away from people who pose a threat to themselves or others these laws in place in at least 17 states are known by a few names red flag extreme risk protection and gun violence restraining orders klobuchar sanders and warren have co sponsored federal legislation that would give states grants to develop a process for relatives to seek a court order to temporarily block people deemed dangerous from buying a gun and allow law enforcement to temporarily seize their weapons biden supports a similar approach his website says he ll incentivize states to pass red flag laws by giving grants to implement them buttigieg told the new york times that red flag laws have proven successful in states across the country and it s time we made it the national standard bloomberg founded a gun control group that lobbied for red flag legislation in california he s now calling for such a law nationwide what california is doing california passed a law permitting gun restraining orders after the 2014 isla vista massacre in which a 22 year old gunman killed six people and wounded 14 near uc santa barbara it allows immediate family members and police officers to petition the courts to have a dangerous person s guns removed an isla vista victim s parents advocated for the law after the investigation showed the killer s parents were concerned about his mental state before he went on the rampage and had even asked police to check on him but were powerless to take his weapons newsom signed a bill expanding the law so that beginning in september 2020 co workers teachers and employers also can ask courts to take away someone s guns how s it going here academic research suggests that allowing parents and police to seek gun restraining orders is helping prevent some instances of gun violence a uc davis study reviewed 159 cases and found 21 instances in which court orders were used to prevent mass shootings but journalistic investigations have found that parents and police rarely use the law largely because so few people know about it including those in law enforcement san diego law enforcement agencies use gun violence restraining orders more than many other cities and have been awarded state funds to train other agencies to use them a bill that would have developed more training for law enforcement stalled in the legislature in 2019 end gerrymandering what they re proposing the major democratic candidates want to overhaul america s system for drawing political boundaries it s a wonky procedure that can have a big impact on who gets elected to congress and state legislatures in most states here s how it works now every 10 years the political party that controls that state s legislature gets to redraw district boundaries based on the latest census count ensuring each district represents the same number of people but politicians who control the process often concoct maps to protect their own re election and give their party a maximum edge klobuchar and sanders have co sponsored federal legislation that would require states to create independent bipartisan commissions to draw political maps buttigieg steyer warren and yang also say redistricting should be controlled by an independent panel what california is doing california voters rejected the partisan map drawing system in 2008 passing a ballot measure that created an independent redistricting commission to draw legislative boundaries two years later voters expanded the commission s power to also draw lines for congressional districts california s 14 member commission includes five republicans five democrats and four people unaffiliated with a major party politicians lobbyists and campaign donors are not allowed to be on it how s it going here two republicans mega donor charles munger and former gov arnold schwarzenegger were the driving forces behind the switch to california s nonpartisan redistricting system they faced staunch opposition from the state s democratic party establishment which holds the majority in the legislature and didn t want to weaken its grip but as it s turned out the change has benefited democrats they ve won more seats in congress and the legislature than they had under the partisan system that s because the old system benefited incumbents from both parties while the new maps create more competition according to research by the public policy institute of california also the share of californians who are registered republicans has been steadily diminishing for the last two decades so it makes sense that the gop is winning fewer seats one catch california has struggled to find a sufficiently diverse mix of qualified people to serve on the commission and has repeatedly extended the application deadline to do so make college free what they re proposing having some kind of college affordability plan has become de rigueur in this presidential primary and the democratic hopefuls fall into two groups those who call for free college and those who are distancing themselves from the term both sanders and warren are pushing to eliminate tuition and fees at all public colleges and universities sanders also would wipe out all of americans 1 6 trillion in student loan debt while warren would focus debt relief on poor and middle class households in the moderate camp buttigieg released a video criticizing universal free college plans for helping even the kids of millionaires instead he proposes limiting tuition breaks to families that earn less than 100 000 per year biden advocates waiving community college tuition for up to two years and doubling the maximum federal grant for low income students what california is doing the state offers two years of tuition free community college for first time full time students california s major state scholarship the cal grant can also pay for up to full tuition at both two and four year schools up to nearly 13 000 for a year at the university of california for needy students who qualify smaller state grants help with living expenses for some students uc guarantees that students with financial need whose families earn less than 80 000 annually will not have to pay tuition and fees how s it going here while california provides more financial aid per low income student than any other state gaps in programs and the exorbitant cost of living here still make college unaffordable for many that free community college plan it grabbed headlines but actually excludes two thirds of community college students those who attend part time low income students who graduated from high school within the previous year and meet academic requirements are entitled to state scholarships but that guarantee doesn t apply to those who took more time off before college and hundreds of thousands miss out each year meanwhile students are spending an average of about 2 000 per month on non tuition costs like housing food and textbooks expenses that state aid largely fails to cover still students at california s public universities take out less federal loan debt on average than those in other states 17 400 for a bachelor s degree compared with 22 400 nationwide turn gig workers into employees what they re proposing many democrats argue that gig companies such as uber and lyft exploit low wage workers by classifying them as freelancers instead of employees converting their status to employee would make workers eligible for more job protections and overtime pay the issue is big for organized labor since it also makes more workers eligible to join unions sanders was the first candidate to call for national legislation to bar gig companies from classifying workers as freelancers a few months later warren announced support for california legislation that limits which industries can employ gig workers and pledged to enact a similar federal law then buttigieg demonstrated his support of the union backed bill by joining a drivers protest he too promises change nationally what california is doing newsom signed legislation in 2019 requiring many businesses to reclassify independent contractors as employees the law is projected to impact 1 million workers including janitors manicurists and gig workers it also gives the state and large cities new authority to go after companies that don t comply throughout the debate over the bill organized labor lobbied hard for it to pass while businesses lobbied to exempt their industries from the new requirements some industries won exemptions but many did not in his signing statement newsom expressed hope of finding a compromise how s it going here the new law was being challenged from all sides even before it went into effect jan 1 trucking companies won a reprieve from the law while their court challenge to it proceeds but freelance journalists did not meanwhile gig workers have filed a class action lawsuit seeking retroactive pay overtime and benefits gig companies such as uber lyft and doordash are mounting an expensive campaign in the november election to convince voters that gig workers should retain flexibility as freelancers the bill s author democratic assemblywoman lorena gonzalez has indicated she will follow up with more legislation to clarify and expand who should be an employee tax the rich what they re proposing someone has to pay for those ambitious health and education programs the democratic presidential hopefuls advocate so most of them want to increase taxes on the wealthy warren calls for an extra 2 percent tax on households with a net worth of 50 million or more that s about 75 000 households and a 6 percent tax on those worth at least 1 billion sanders takes the idea even further with rates ranging from 1 percent on net worth over 32 million to 8 percent on worth more than 10 billion steyer proposes a similar wealth tax according to his statements to the washington post buttigieg has said he s open to a wealth tax but has drawn more attention for his suggestion that the highest income tax bracket be set at 49 99 percent bennett and biden propose a different way to raise taxes on the rich raise the tax rate on capital gains which are typically paid when people sell stocks for more than they paid for them what california is doing california does not have a tax on net worth but it does have the nation s highest income tax rate on high earners 13 3 percent on those making 1 million or more that s partly because california voters have approved a series of tax hikes on those with high incomes in 2004 voters passed an additional 1 percent tax on incomes over 1 million to fund mental health programs in 2012 as the state recovered from recession voters agreed to temporarily boost taxes on earnings over 250 000 to fund public education and other government services four years later voters extended that tax increase for another dozen years in addition to its progressive income tax structure california squeezes a bit more out of rich people by how it taxes capital gains california treats capital gains as any other income whereas the federal government differentiates between short term and long term capital gains leading to lower tax rates on some stock sales how s it going here a popular narrative says california may tax its wealthiest residents into fleeing the state data however don t back this up at least not yet a stanford study that examined whether rich people left california after recent income tax hikes found a negligible effect the state lost 0 04 percent of its 312 000 millionaires after the 2012 tax increase according to the study most people leaving california earn less than 50 000 a year and are likely driven out by the high cost of living here that points to an important reality despite california s liberal practice of taxing the wealthy to spend on the poor economic inequality is more extreme in california than in almost every other state california s dependence on high earners creates risky volatility in the amount of money the state government takes in each year for a long time the state experienced boom and bust cycles with cuts to services and furloughs for government workers when the economy turned down in 2014 voters passed a law requiring the state to sock away money during good times to save for a rainy day now the state has 19 2 billion in reserves thanks in large part to wealthy californians provide health care to undocumented immigrants what they re proposing almost all the democratic candidates want the federal government to offer health insurance to undocumented immigrants though they have different ideas about how far to go in doing it sanders and warren are co sponsors of the federal medicare for all legislation which would create a government run health plan covering all u s residents regardless of immigration status their legislation is estimated to cost the government an additional 34 trillion over a decade though that figure covers benefits for everyone not just undocumented residents the estimated cost increase was roughly halved when researchers considered a single payer health care system that only covered legal residents bennet biden and buttiegieg have a different vision proposing that undocumented immigrants be allowed to pay for health care through a public option that would exist alongside private health insurance plans klobuchar declined to answer questions from the washington post and the new york times about whether she thinks government health care should cover undocumented immigrants bloomberg before he became a candidate criticized medicare for all as too expensive what california is doing california is one of a half dozen states that provide health coverage to low income undocumented children through medicaid the federal insurance program for the poor medi cal in california that began here in 2016 adding 160 000 kids at a cost of roughly 280 million a year in 2019 california became the first state to insure some undocumented adults when lawmakers approved spending about 98 million a year to expand medi cal to cover unauthorized residents age 19 to 25 about 138 000 people costs are expected to grow to 315 million in 2021 newsom punted on a proposal to cover undocumented immigrants age 65 and older but lawmakers are preparing to try again in 2020 given the state s active participation in the affordable care act the percentage of uninsured californians has dropped to 7 percent an estimated half of whom are undocumented immigrants how s it going here one of the arguments against government funded health care for undocumented immigrants is that it will attract more people to unlawfully settle in the u s to get the benefits california has experienced the opposite with participation in medi cal decreasing among undocumented immigrants and unlawful immigration also on the decline many factors influence these trends of course and experts say the trump administration s harsh stance toward immigrants in the country illegally may repel some from participating in government health programs but just covering people with medi cal doesn t necessarily mean they ll get good health care californians on medi cal have had a harder time getting doctor appointments flu shots and specialty care than medicaid recipients in other states emergency room visits in california have been on the rise since the affordable care act allowed more people to join medi cal even though supporters of expanding insurance predicted the opposite would happen the data on er visits covers the years before undocumented immigrants could join medi cal republicans and some moderate democrats say california shouldn t spend tax dollars helping people who are here unlawfully and caution that adding more obligations to the state budget will only require painful cuts when a recession hits but a majority of californians want their government to provide health care to undocumented immigrants surveys by the public policy institute of california found that 54 percent of state residents supported the idea in 2015 growing to 64 percent in 2019

strategies and long term growth plans i want to thank everyone who attended we enjoyed our conversation with you regarding our growth strategy as we discussed there are four key areas driving our momentum first we have a significant opportunity to build on our strong position and further grow as a wealth management leader with deep client relationships second we re transforming our global asset management business to meet the important needs for active management third we re managing well developed insurance and annuity books of business that generate significant consistent free cash flow and finally ameriprise is delivering profitable growth has a sound balance sheet and is generating a high return for shareholders on our call today i ll discuss our results the operating environment and our progress executing the growth drivers we ve outlined at investor day turning to the markets us equities reached yet another record high and our average weighted equity index that reflects the mix of assets we manage finished up strongly for the year as you know the fed interest rate cuts in 2019 are a headwind and yesterday the fed said that interest rates remain unchanged as january comes to a close equity markets remain strong but with a pick up in volatility we cannot predict the year or market cycles but with deep client relationships good cash flows and a strong balance sheet ameriprise is built to manage these cycles and emerge stronger now let s discuss the quarter on a consolidated level fourth quarter results were quite good compared to a year ago on an adjusted operating basis we delivered revenue growth of 6 excluding auto and home revenue in the year ago period solid eps growth up 11 even after absorbing some additional expenses in corporate a return on equity of 38 6 ex aoci and unlocking which remains well above many peers and with the sale of the auto and home business we generated 161 million in net benefit on a full year gaap pre tax basis our assets under management and administration reached a new high up 18 to 973 billion we also achieved new records in wealth management for retail client assets and advisor productivity that i ll discuss further with that let s now turn to our growth engine advice wealth management we delivered solid revenue and earnings growth in the fourth quarter even with significant decline in short term interest rates margin in awm was nearly 23 continues to be among the best in wealth management i am pleased with how we re executing our priorities we re growing our client base serving more affluent investors and deepening client relationships it all starts with the large and compelling market that we re concentrating on responsible investors with 500 000 to 5 million in investable assets they are looking for a comprehensive advice and strong digital capabilities from an advisor and a firm that they trust ameriprise is uniquely positioned to serve this market and it s translating into terrific results we had an excellent year in advice wealth management including some nice fourth quarter highlights client assets were up 19 while fee based advisory business continues to stand out with more than 4 billion of inflows into advisory in the quarter this brings total wrap assets to 318 billion a 26 increase importantly we had strong client acquisition results in the quarter particularly in our affluent target market and we saw a good pick up in transactional activity as more clients engaged with us in financial planning relationships and in the quarter advisor productivity increased 6 as advisors leveraged the extensive support we offer to help them grow in recruiting we had another good year we continue to attract experienced advisors from across the industry in addition another 63 advisors joined us and it s one of the best quarters for recruiting large production practices what s behind our continued success the deep long lasting relationships we work diligently with clients and we re using our goal based advice expertise and our enhanced client experience to deepen these relationships even further we re also leveraging our recent investments to drive future growth here are some updates we continue to increase uptake of our digitally enabled advice experience to even more clients we completed the roll out of our custom advisory relationship program we finished the conversion of our new customer relationship management platform and we re growing the ameriprise bank we brought more than 1 billion of cash sweep balances on the balance sheet in the fourth quarter bringing our full year total to close to 4 billion and we will continue to bring sweep deposits on the balance sheet this year we will be adding additional capabilities including a mortgage program pledged loans and a savings deposit product i also like to point out that outside of the bank ameriprise wealth management expenses will come back to more normalized levels in 2020 we also continue to receive important recognition in the industry ameriprise was recently certified by jd power for providing an outstanding customer service experience our teams work hard to deliver industry leading service so this means a lot i ll leave you with this take away with our advice value proposition and the investments we ve made we have a great opportunity to continue to grow in the wealth management business i m energized by the opportunity we have in front of us now i will turn to our i a businesses these are strong books that provide earnings diversification and stability we re focused on delivering insurance and annuity solutions that satisfy client needs while continuing to evolve our solution mix in the quarter we generated 185 million in adjusted operating earnings for the protection annuity businesses and in line with our expectations and we continue to generate strong free cash flow in terms of annuity sales total variable annuity cash sales were up when compared to a slower quarter last year and for the year sales were in our typical range of about 4 billion this month we launched our structured solutions annuity product designed exclusively to meet the needs of ameriprise clients we expect this will help shift even more of our books away from products with guarantees fixed annuity sales were down year over year in line with our plan in protection we focused on continuing to shift from iul to vul where we had a very strong growth in vul sales compared to last year overall life insurance in force remained stable at 195 billion as always we re focused on managing risk appropriately and ensuring we have the right product designs for our clients and the environment we will also continue to evaluate further action regarding reinsuring the remaining fixed annuity block this year moving to asset management earnings was strong and flows continued to improve we remain focused on serving client needs and pursuing long term growth opportunities in key areas columbia threadneedle ended the quarter with 494 billion in assets under management up 15 on improving flows and positive markets and the earnings contribution to ameriprise remain good we re making good progress executing our strategy and you can see that in our flow picture we generated 3 3 billion in net inflows in the quarter which was up 8 billion from last year this is our third consecutive quarter of improved flows investment performance was excellent in 2019 across equities fixed income and asset allocation portfolios on an asset weighted basis for our columbia funds over 75 are above medium for one year three year and five year time frames for threadneedle funds over 80 of beating their benchmarks for those same time periods and we re seeing improved results across strategies and regions with global retail leading the way in us retail we have been increasing our market share at six of our top eight broker dealer partner firms and gross sales in our key strategies are good our equity flow rate in the quarter was strong in fact of the 17 active firms we benchmark we were in the top five and one of the few that were a net positive for the quarter and in fixed income we continue to garner good flows and we feel that we can improve even further we re seeing a particular strength in our income franchise for example our dividend income strategic income and mortgage opportunity funds generated more than 2 2 billion in combined net inflows in the quarter in emea retail with brexit now moving forward and reduced uncertainty in the uk sentiment in europe has improved net flows improved by more than 2 billion from last year we re making good progress in fact we were in net inflows in nearly all of our key markets in europe now that we have built out our sicav product range and in global institutional net inflows improved by more than 2 billion ex parent to a net outflow of 1 billion we re gaining traction in a number of areas that we talked to you about in november it was another good quarter in asset management we have a strong product line up excellent performance and global reach and we re focused on executing well to maintain our momentum now let me turn to our final key area of focus our capital strength which is outstanding last quarter i highlighted our strong excess capital position and the benefits of the successful sale of the auto and home business in terms of freeing up capital and focusing our efforts on our core businesses ultimately we ended the year at 2 2 billion of excess capital in the fourth quarter as a continuation of our strong return of capital we returned 125 of operating earnings through the pick up and the pace of our buyback and for the year we reduced our overall share count by 8 to summarize it was an excellent quarter and year for ameriprise we are in a strong position later this year we ll mark our 15th anniversary as an independent publicly traded company we re incredibly proud of what we ve accomplished importantly we re proud of how we re recognized for our client service our records of outperformance and how we consistently deliver for shareholders we re poised and energized to build on our record of performance and growth now walter will discuss the financials in detail and then we ll take your questions walter walter berman executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you jim ameriprise delivered another strong quarter of financial results and business metrics with adjusted operating eps of 11 to 4 20 this was supported by a strong 6 revenue growth excluding the auto and home business that we sold in the quarter the quality of earnings across our businesses was quite strong however within the corporate segment there were a few timing related expense items that i d like to explain first we incurred higher than normal impairments in our low income housing portfolio totaling 25 million the portfolio continues to perform well and we do not anticipate any impact to our going forward expected tax benefits second as part of our reengineering process and evaluation of our overall expense base going into 2020 we took an elevated level of severance charges in the quarter of 11 million this action positions us well moving into 2020 finally we had significant share price appreciation in the quarter which required us to mark to market some of the previously issued share based compensation awards this was a 6 million absolute impact in the quarter but an 18 million variance year over year going forward we expect our corporate segment losses to return to the 70 million range on october 1st we closed the sale of auto and home to american family the transaction generated a net benefit of 161 million over the course of the year but is not recognized within our operating results we returned 125 of earnings to shareholders in the quarter and 110 for the year based upon the sale of auto and home and the changes in our risk profile we enter 2020 with strong balance sheet fundamentals with 2 2 billion in excess capital and a lower risk profile with long term care continuing to perform well which you can see in the appendix in 2020 we will evaluate reducing leverage while remaining committed to return capital at a pace of 100 plus let s turn to page six as i mentioned adjusted operating net revenue was up 6 to 3 billion after excluding auto and home from the prior year period revenue growth was driven by advice wealth management and asset management in advice wealth management we had a substantial increase in wrap assets and improved transactional activity driving an 8 increase in revenue in asset management revenues grew 9 including strong performance fees annuities and protection revenue was essentially flat in summary we delivered strong eps growth of 11 and a return on equity of nearly 39 turning to slide seven you can see that our business mix continues to evolve with advice wealth management generating over half of the company s earnings up from 33 five years ago this profitability improvement has been driven by fundamental organic growth and well managed expenses while still investing for future growth we ve seen a consistent shift in our business mix over the past few years and expect this to continue as we investments in areas of opportunity within wealth management business advice wealth management continues to perform well across leading and lagging indicators as you can see on slide eight advice wealth management adjusted operating net revenues grew 8 wrap assets were up 26 to 318 billion with net inflows of 4 4 billion in the quarter transactional activity also increased 5 year over year we had a good quarter for experienced advisor recruiting with 63 advisors joining us from other firms in the quarter with much higher trailing 12 month productivity and market levels improved nicely pretax adjusted operating earnings were up 5 or 19 million in the face of a 22 million headwind related to recent fed rate cuts a strong increase in revenue allowed us to continue to drive profitable growth despite short term interest rates g a increased 6 excluding the bank consistent with expectations we are continuing to make substantial investments for growth and seeing elevated volume related expenses given strong activity levels our expectation is that g a growth excluding the bank will be in the range of 3 to 4 finally our margin was solid at 22 6 and we expect we can maintain it in this range let s turn to asset management on page nine in the quarter we saw a substantial 8 billion improvement with net inflows of 3 3 billion excluding former parent related flows net inflows were 4 2 billion benefiting from continued improvement in retail in north america and europe as well as from reinvested dividends from a financial perspective the business is demonstrating an improved trajectory asset management continues to generate substantial revenue and pre tax adjusted operating earnings for ameriprise pretax adjusted operating revenue was up 9 to 770 million driven by strong performance fees and market appreciation with lower pressure from the cumulative impact of flows underlying expenses remain well managed within the quarter expenses were impacted by elevated performance fee and year end timing related compensation adjustments as well as a higher distribution expense associated with revenue growth margins in the quarter were 36 remaining in our target range of 35 to 39 turning to page 10 results in annuities and protection are solid annuities continue to perform in line with expectations but very consistent profitability we saw good improvement in variable annuity sales of 9 in the quarter though still down for the full year we have launched a new structured variable annuity product in the first quarter that will further diversify our offering away from benefit features and our variable annuity net amount of risk still remains one of the lowest in the industry protection earnings were down slightly to 65 million claims remain in line with expectations now let s move to balance sheet on slide 11 we accelerated the pace of capital return to shareholders in 2019 with 2 4 billion returned via buybacks and dividends this is a continuation of our long standing track record of capital return in fact over the past 10 years we have returned over 18 billion to shareholders and reduced our diluted share count by approximately 50 we continue to generate substantial free cash flow which along with excellent balance sheet fundamentals will support continued capital return we enter 2020 from a position of strength with 2 2 billion of excess capital we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders assessing potential changes to our capital structure to best support our current business mix and evaluating additional reinsurance opportunities with that we will take your questions questions and answers walter berman executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you and our first question comes from andrew kligerman from credit suisse andrew kligerman credit suisse analyst hey good morning so i m looking at the advisor count and here at 98 71 it s roughly flattish with the last year s number could you talk a little bit about your ability to grow that count going into 2020 and the productivity of those advisors i know revenue per advisor was up 6 year over year a lot of moving parts there so how do you see that evolving in 2020 as well james cracchiolo chairman and chief executive officer yes so we think that the account count would probably pick up a bit as we go forward we actually netted out a number of advisors in the ipi area and others as we reform then restructured that channel as well as in some of the central sites as we shifted things around but we actually feel good about the recruitment we re actually focused a bit more on higher productivity and so the average productivity of the people who were leaving us was still much lower so we focus mainly on the growth of that productivity and the type of people we re bringing in but i think the advisor count should probably pick up a bit more like we were doing more at the beginning part of the year and i feel good about the type of productivity we re bringing in and the recruitment then and the ramping up of the people who are here andrew kligerman credit suisse analyst got it and staying on advice wealth fee rates they were around 108 basis points by our calculation in the quarter and that s kind of versus the recent 109 basis point to 111 basis point range over the last two years or so and so i don t know is that a function of moving up market and how do you why is that and where do you see the fees kind of shaking out in 2020 and 2021 james cracchiolo chairman and chief executive officer yes so i think it s part of the idea of us continuing now to bring in more clients at a little higher levels where then the rates get a bit lower as the asset levels and managing are a bit higher and so that s actually it s a good positive thing for us i mean our net inflow of client activity is pretty strong continues to be good and consistent and we are bringing in more clients and the more affluent and we re probably going to embark on something this year to even focus a bit more even on the higher net worth channels so i think that s a favorable for us andrew kligerman credit suisse analyst got it and then one last quick one 110 payout ratio 110 in 2019 2 2 billion of excess capital could you get that ratio even higher in 2020 walter berman executive vice president and chief financial officer we could but the issue is i think as jim said at the investor day we re targeting at this stage 100 plus but we are certainly monitoring that and evaluating andrew as we do but certainly we have a generation capacity and we will be evaluating that as we move forward andrew kligerman credit suisse analyst thanks a lot operator our next question comes from humphrey lee from dowling partners humphrey lee dowling partners analyst good morning and thank you for taking my questions a question with regard to the g a expenses i think in jim and walter s prepared remarks you talked about expenses should normalize in 2020 and i think specifically in and a wm the g a expenses excluding the bank would be kind of 3 to 5 growth but i guess when we look at the overall enterprise how should we think about the expenses in general and then also how much of a banking related expense do you anticipate for a wm james cracchiolo chairman and chief executive officer okay so i think as we indicated yes i think what you said for awm the expense range after normalizing for the bank is it will be in the 3 to 5 range as it relates to amp it is lower than that and normally will be in the range of 2 that range so we anticipate that will continue as we look but as we evaluate it but that is what is a reasonably good expectation humphrey lee dowling partners analyst okay so including the bank or overall amp g a expenses would be in the 2 range is that what you re suggesting james cracchiolo chairman and chief executive officer no the bank will be above that because we normalize for it at the awm level it s about 200 basis points if you add for the bank so i think it will be a little less for amp because the amp size of the expense base will be neutralized so it gets a little less impact but that is basically from that standpoint of normalized humphrey lee dowling partners analyst okay got it and then in again in your prepared remarks you talked about the fixed annuity block it doesn t look like the lower interest rate right now affects how you think about the block in terms of potential transactions is that a fair statement and then also can you remind us how much statutory capital that you have right now backing that business walter berman executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so listen the interest rates do affect it but we do believe there is a we are evaluating that there is potential viability and certainly pursuing a fixed annuity reinsurance and we are in discussions and we evaluate that this is a general range it s probably around an area of 750 million to 800 million that we can free up humphrey lee dowling partners analyst okay great thank you operator our following question comes from kenneth lee from rbc capital markets kenneth lee rbc capital markets analyst hi thanks for taking my question just one within the asset management business a follow up on the prepared remarks you touched upon seeing improving investor sentiment within the uk emea region due to the brexit clarity i m wondering whether you would expect to see further improvement in net fund flows of this year due to the increase in clarity and perhaps you could just tell us which products investment products you could see potentially gaining from this improving sentiment thanks james cracchiolo chairman and chief executive officer okay so i think you re more explicitly asking about uk in europe our emea business yes we saw a nice improvement bounce back occurring in the fourth quarter moving from some negative in the first month of the quarter to actually inflows in the second and third month of the quarter and we see that continuing europe was actually positive for us good uk was still coming back but it was still a bit weaker but we feel like that will start to change in remedy now that they have gone through the elections at the end of the year so we re reasonably optimistic that there will be a little less uncertainty i mean there is still uncertainty to the extent of what is that trade agreement and things at the end of the year but the people in london are feeling better and feel like the business can come back there and the appetite would increase and we have a good line up i mean we have excellent performance in our funds our uk equity type products are really good we ve gained even in a negative year flows there and we now have a full line of products in the sicav range in europe and that bodes well for us as there is a pick up and we re seeing that pick up in things like european equities and various things like that so we are positive on that to be an improvement this year kenneth lee rbc capital markets analyst great and just one follow up if i may looking at the former parent company related outflows looking back over the past year or so net outflows related to that have been declining just wondering whether we would expect a similar kind of trajectory going forward or just wanted to get your thoughts there thanks james cracchiolo chairman and chief executive officer yes so i think we ve seen some improvement in the domestic part of that and then the outflow from our relationship here the zurich activity has been pretty consistent once in a while they ll have a pension that closes and there is some lumpiness but it s pretty much been running like what we ve seen from quarter to quarter just based on the drawdown of these closed books and assets but as i said the assets that remain there due to a combination of appreciation and even some difference in some of the products that we replace that have a bit higher fee the revenue gets offset even though that flow negative in that that book is there so but i would probably say i it s been running that way consistently for a while so i don t see much change there from a flow but the revenue has been pretty stable kenneth lee rbc capital markets analyst very helpful thank you very much operator our following question comes from john barnidge from piper sandler john barnidge piper sandler analyst thanks deposit volume in 4q 2019 for va s was the highest since 2q 2018 thought it was somewhat surprising given the decline in rates during the year and associated repricing activity can you talk about your positioning in the distribution environment there thank you james cracchiolo chairman and chief executive officer yes we did see a bit more of a pick up i mean a year ago this quarter it was a slower period for us but we saw a bit more activity toward the end of the year we actually just in the end of this month we just launched our structured annuity product and we actually think that would pick up some traction as well in the current year and shift some of the business from the guarantee product i mean we still sell a reasonable portion of annuities without living benefits as well which is good so we re not looking for a substantial growth but we re looking for probably a bit more growth but also a shift to now some of the structured product as well which is good for us so we want to keep that book growing or stable with slight growth which is good and the mix improving so that s what we re probably seeing right now john barnidge piper sandler analyst great and my follow up does brexit clarity change your view around m a for asset management as i believe the fee rate for retail is a bit higher in emea than in the us james cracchiolo chairman and chief executive officer well we want to continue to grow in emea and europe to the point you reference based on fee rates and the use of actives as well so we keep our eye out for opportunities but we actually feel like some of the investments we re making and the expansion of resources that we re putting on the continent gives us some opportunity for further growth there as well john barnidge piper sandler analyst thanks for the answer operator our following question comes from tom gallagher from evercore thomas gallagher evercore analyst good morning just a question on the awm growth just looking at page 13 of the supplement it looks like total client aum versus the wrap accounts is growing a bit slower just curious if are you seeing outflows in the non wrap business and overall how is that impacting your growth in that business and just overall economics james cracchiolo chairman and chief executive officer well looking at the client flows they re still pretty very good so they re in excess of the 4 billion i don t know exactly with the ins and outs there is some ins and outs but a shift between the non wrap to wrap has slowed a lot i mean it s sort of leveled out i can t tell you like from period to period it might be slight but the net of the effect of what those flows are our gross client net client inflows in total so it s within that realm i would probably say with the fourth quarter which is the markets being where they were i d probably think activity would slow it a little more for investment purposes just because people were waiting for the next shoe to drop but i think it s been pretty stable thomas gallagher evercore analyst so jim just following up on that would you say overall flows into the complex from a total client assets would be close to the 4 billion mark james cracchiolo chairman and chief executive officer it s north not of 4 billion but in that range in the fourth quarter thomas gallagher evercore analyst okay that s helpful and then how should we think about total capital return i mean i know you ve returned more than the 90 certainly last year you re sitting on substantial excess as we stand today how are you thinking about utilization of the excess are you thinking more strategic m a or are there opportunities out there and then maybe doing more buybacks if nothing if you don t find anything like where are you leaning now more toward with deployment of that excess particularly after the p c capital freed significant amount james cracchiolo chairman and chief executive officer so as you saw we did pick up the buyback as we said walter just mentioned that we re probably looking to continue we usually say 90 to 100 we re saying probably 100 plus at this point in time not knowing the world and the etc but if things present good opportunities for additional we do that but we constantly monitor the cash flow continues to be quite good and strong as walter also said we re probably looking to reinsure some more as we go through the year so i think buyback still would be probably the main return mechanism we will look presenting to the board about a dividend increase again this year consistent with all the years that we ve done that and you know we always look at some m a strategically to fit in but that depends on opportunities that may come along or not but we have enough capital flexibility that that should not affect our buyback trajectory thomas gallagher evercore analyst okay thanks operator our following question comes from suneet kamath from citi suneet kamath citi analyst thanks good morning i just wanted to start with the a wm margin so if the fed is on hold now is the impact of the what they did last year in terms of rate cut sort of fully baked into the 22 6 margin walter berman executive vice president and chief financial officer yes basically it is a small deviation but basically it is suneet kamath citi analyst and then at investor day i mean i don t want to nitpick here but you talked about a 20 plus margin a wm on this call you re saying you can maintain at 2006 is there sort of in a change in how you re thinking about that margin relative to what you told us at investor day walter berman executive vice president and chief financial officer no not at all suneet kamath citi analyst and then the last one i had is on the bank i think we have a good sense of what the expenses are but can you give us a sense of what the bank revenues are and how you expect that to progress as we move through 2020 walter berman executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so as we indicated we had a small profit in 2019 and we do expect with the launches of different products and adding more transfer sweep money over the revenues will grow obviously this is a challenging market for investment but on that base we do see the revenues growing and also increasing our profitability in 2020 suneet kamath citi analyst do you have a sense of the revenue base though right now from the bank walter berman executive vice president and chief financial officer let me i don t want to guess that so let us get back to you on it i ll get it too suneet kamath citi analyst all right thanks walter operator our following question comes from erik bass from autonomous research erik bass autonomous research analyst hi thank you a couple of follow ups on advice wealth sort of along the same line as suneet s questions i guess first would you expect cash yields to be pretty stable going forward if the fed remains on hold or are there any competitive dynamics that could create some noise there james cracchiolo chairman and chief executive officer no i don t believe that we see any i mean obviously we are constantly monitoring and measuring but no we don t see any of this at this time erik bass autonomous research analyst got it and then morgan stanley recently provided a target of getting its wealth management business margins to the 28 to 30 range over the next two years and i realize there are differences between its business and yours but do you see getting to kind of a mid 20 margin is something that may be achievable over the intermediate term as the bank reaches scale and if you continue to improve advisor productivity levels james cracchiolo chairman and chief executive officer yeah i would say this i mean one of the things very clearly as you have sort of compressed rates out there with what the fed recently did versus some of the banks that might have been started previously where based on their investments and other things like the wirehouses with their banking entities and the use of that but i would actually say if you get a bit better and some of the yield curve or some pick up a little bit on some of the longer rates not substantially i think you can see what we re shifting into the bank with the developments going through the bank that that could be adding to margins even if the fed maintained rates right now so to speak depending on what happens in the larger climate but we re ramping up the bank in a period when those things are pretty compressed but we feel good about it because it gives us the opportunity if things normalize a little better again erik bass autonomous research analyst okay thank you and is there a correlation between productivity and margin or does productivity just help drive revenues but kind of your payout stay the same and it s sort of margin neutral james cracchiolo chairman and chief executive officer the productivity over the years have definitely i mean you can see our margins have grown up pretty pretty tremendously we do still have sort of an independent and an employee base the employee margins have increased nicely our independents are quite good and so we have added through margin based upon the productivity increase and the business growth and i don t see that changing substantially i think what we re just managing is you had spurts in markets and other things so we re just averaging that out right now but as walter said our expense growth should come down a bit outside of the bank back to more normalized levels so we feel good about maintaining and improving that margin over time but again things are with the environment you can t always predict that and what the impact may be in the short term erik bass autonomous research analyst certainly and thank you for the comments operator and the last question comes from alex blostein from goldman sachs alex blostein goldman sachs analyst hey guys thanks for taking a couple of questions here i have a few on awm mostly so i guess first is it possible for you to give us a sense how much in net interest income you expect to generate at the bank in 2020 and sort of what that contemplates in other words are there more deposits you re going to move from sweep or whatever you move that s enough to kind of just put it into loans or other things you guys are doing at the bank that s my first question walter berman executive vice president and chief financial officer i guess let me first since we started the bank midyear obviously we ll get the calendarization effects so that will get the net interest margin increasing on that basis we will be increasing certainly as i indicated the sweep flows into the bank so that well but again as jim has in this market the rates are fairly concerted and we are certainly looking at launching and having a more emphasis on our privilege loan program and certainly on and getting into a deposit program alex blostein goldman sachs analyst okay but no rough sense of in terms of the revenue dollars that you expect to get out of the bank this year walter berman executive vice president and chief financial officer no not exactly that again as we d have to we re not forecasting but certainly there will be an increase and again we are assuming an increase in profitability but i don t have the exact correlation james cracchiolo chairman and chief executive officer and alex we re forming as we ve started to ramp up the bank the shift in the sweep looking at the current environment and regarding both our lending and our investment strategy the roll out of some of the products this year we will be forming that and as that gets more informed we will be chatting with you and informing you as well so we re just at the early stages of that but all the groundwork all the foundational elements even the initial shift in the launch of the credit card the initial sweeps etc have taken place so we re right on track to our plans but the second level of that will be forming as we go in through this year alex blostein goldman sachs analyst got it thanks and then in terms of the asset growth so at a high level everything you guys are talking about sounds great in terms of recruiting higher productivity etc when we look at the wrap flows this year they ve decelerated versus last year despite the fact that what feels like has been a very robust environment for the industry as well as some of your peers so what s been driving the decline in wrap accounts this year what do you think is a reasonable either dollar amount of organic growth do you expect to get out of that over the next kind of 12 months to 24 months and then when you look i guess at the fee rate on wrap accounts that s also been coming down for the last couple of years so kind of help us reconcile all those three maybe thanks james cracchiolo chairman and chief executive officer yeah we don t really see that what you re saying per se i know that the wrap account in previous year or two were a bit higher but remember that was part of an industry shift we were part of that moving with the dol and activities and accelerating some of that transfer but from an organic growth level as i said a 4 4 billion is still pretty nicely organical growth and we see that continuing we feel like our fee rates are pretty good as you said as we continue to move up market some of the fees will be lower naturally based upon pricing but no i don t see it could move slightly from what we said but i don t see a slowdown per se our client activity is good but we do a lot more business than wrap and so importantly it s not just a wrap business per se we try to do more comprehensive business but i feel that that s not necessarily i see a slowing i see things go period to period but i think over the longer term we feel pretty good about it and we think that that will continue and you know our wrap balances were up 26 year over year so i m not sure we re out aligned in anything in the industry there may be some further shift for some people where they were behind on it and accelerating it but we have always had a good strong wrap business alex blostein goldman sachs analyst got it great thanks very much operator duration 48 minutes call participants

interest that the entity within shell that entered into the lease would have to pay to borrow over a similar term and with a similar security the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right of use asset in a similar economic environment the incremental borrowing rate applied to each lease was determined taking into account the risk free rate adjusted for factors such as the credit rating of the contracting entity and the terms and conditions of the lease the weighted average incremental borrowing rate applied by shell upon transition was 7 2 2 shell has applied the practical expedient to classify leases for which the lease term ends within 12 months of the date of initial application of ifrs 16 as short term leases shell has also applied the recognition exemption for short term leases compared with the previous accounting for operating leases under ias 17 the application of the new standard has a significant impact on the classification of expenditures and cash flows it also impacts the timing of expenses recognised in the statement of income with effect from 2019 expenses related to leases previously classified as operating leases are presented under depreciation depletion and amortisation and interest expense in 2018 these were mainly reported in purchases production and manufacturing expenses and selling distribution and administrative expenses with effect from 2019 payments related to leases previously classified as operating leases are presented under cash flow from financing activities in 2018 these were reported in cash flow from operating activities and cash flow from investing activities the adoption of the new standard had an accumulated impact of 4 million in equity following the recognition of lease

as well as power and environmental products shell also enters into contracts for tolling pipeline and storage capacity derivative contracts are entered into for mitigation of resulting economic exposures generally price exposure and these derivative contracts are carried at period end market price fair value with movements in fair value recognised in income for the period supply and purchase contracts entered into for operational purposes as well as contracts for tolling pipeline and storage capacity are by contrast recognised when the transaction occurs furthermore inventory is carried at historical cost or net realisable value whichever is lower as a consequence accounting mismatches occur because a the supply or purchase transaction is recognised in a different period or b the inventory is measured on a different basis in addition certain contracts are due to pricing or delivery conditions deemed to contain embedded derivatives or written options and are also required to be carried at fair value even though they are entered into for operational purposes the accounting impacts are reported as identified items impacts of exchange rate movements on tax balances represent the impact on tax balances of exchange rate movements arising on a the conversion to dollars of the local currency tax base of non monetary assets and liabilities as well as losses and b the

disposed assets excluding special items the company reported a net loss of 46 million or 0 50 per share compared to net income of 183 million or 1 96 per diluted share in 2018 our fourth quarter results reflect bottom of the cycle conditions in market pulp ongoing pricing pressures in paper grades and the slow pricing recovery in lumber said yves laflamme president and chief executive officer the pending acquisition of three sawmills in the u s south is an important step in our transformation strategy it will give us immediate scale in an attractive region with quality assets in a rich fiber basket close to growing end markets our financial position will remain strong after this acquisition and will support us as we continue to progress with our transformation strategy we re pleased with the quarterly improvement in tissue ebitda and the progress around sales growth and productivity gains we re also excited about our recently announced project to modernize the paper machine at kénogami to produce high grade sca supercalendered paper and our plans to grow in biomaterials with the construction of a cellulose filament plant at that mill in both cases taking advantage of synergies within our network of operations in the saguenay lac saint jean region while the paper project is focused on nearer term competitiveness the cellulose filament project highlights the added value we can bring to fiber through our role in its transformation as we look to build the forest products industry of the future non gaap financial measures such as adjustments for special items and adjusted ebitda are explained and reconciled below operating income variance against prior period consolidated the company reported an operating loss of 69 million in the quarter compared to 18 million in the third quarter most of the change was attributable to costs associated with the indefinite idling of the augusta georgia mill 31 million and lower selling prices 17 million net of the costs associated with the augusta idling manufacturing costs were lower in the quarter 8 million due largely to favorable timing of outages despite production disruptions at the calhoun tennessee mill volumes were lower 4 million with most of the impact in wood products 9 for all of 2019 the company generated operating income of 17 million compared to 379 million in 2018 the largest difference was selling prices 240 million particularly for wood products and pulp followed by higher manufacturing costs 128 million net of the costs associated with the augusta idling due mostly to higher fiber costs and additional maintenance an unfavorable variance 47 million related to gains on divestitures impairments write downs and closure costs including augusta lost contribution from the divested assets 46 million and a decrease in overall shipments 27 million with drops in the wood products and paper segments the unfavorable items were partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization 45 million the favorable impact of the weaker canadian dollar 43 million lower selling general and administrative or sg a expenses 29 million due to lower variable compensation and favorable freight costs 11 million market pulp the market pulp segment recorded an operating loss of 18 million in the fourth quarter compared to 12 million in the third quarter the wider loss reflects a 4 reduction in average transaction price to 601 per metric ton only partially offset by lower maintenance costs due to the timing of maintenance outages but the operating cost per unit or the delivered cost was unchanged at 663 per metric ton because of a 27 000 metric ton decrease in shipments due to the scheduled annual outage at the saint félicien quebec mill and production disruptions at the calhoun mill accordingly ebitda in the segment fell to negative 12 million in the quarter finished goods inventory fell to 68 000 metric tons its lowest level since 2012 in 2019 the market pulp segment reported operating income of 39 million compared to 172 million in 2018 the change reflects mostly the significant drop in pricing during 2019 down on average by 72 per metric ton to 690 as shipments rose by 40 000 metric tons after adjusting for the divestitures of catawba and fairmont in 2018 the delivered cost rose by 15 per metric ton as a result of higher manufacturing costs which were affected by higher fiber costs and unfavorable maintenance the annual operating income variance was favorably affected by the weaker canadian dollar favorable sg a expenses and a lower depreciation expense ebitda in the segment was 62 million tissue the tissue segment incurred an operating loss of 1 million in the quarter an improvement of 2 million compared to the third quarter most of the improvement that led to ebitda of 4 million in the segment largely reflects lower internal pulp costs accordingly the delivered cost dropped by 116 per short ton or 6 for the year the tissue segment incurred an operating loss of 16 million compared to 30 million in 2018 the average transaction price increased by 160 per short ton as a result of better products and customer mix and price increases shipments were also 15 higher reflecting a full year of calhoun shipments the delivered cost also improved by 43 per short ton on better productivity and lower freight costs due to the new distribution center in calhoun ebitda for the segment was 2 million for the complete year a 17 million improvement over 2018 wood products the wood products segment reported an operating loss of 5 million in the quarter only slightly wider than the operating loss of 4 million in the third quarter quarter over quarter pricing improved by 22 per thousand board feet or 6 but the effect was more than offset by the 39 million board feet reduction in shipments due to seasonality and lingering uncertainty around the strength of the recovery and higher manufacturing costs associated with road building and log transportation as well as higher stumpage fees this caused an increase in the delivered cost of 26 per thousand board feet to 377 consistent with last quarter the company recorded over 70 million board feet of downtime in the quarter for 240 million in 2019 ebitda in the segment was unchanged in the quarter at 4 million for 2019 the wood products segment recorded an operating loss of 6 million compared to operating income of 169 million in 2018 the change reflects a 90 per thousand board feet drop in average transaction price or 20 and a reduction of 115 million board feet in shipments in each case reflecting a sharp drop in market prices in the second half of 2018 and a slow recovery through 2019 the delivered cost rose only slightly year over year reflecting mostly higher fiber costs largely offset by the favorable effects of the weaker canadian dollar ebitda in the segment reached 28 million compared to 201 million in 2018 newsprint newsprint s operating income decreased by 4 million in the quarter to breakeven the average transaction price fell by 30 per metric ton from the third quarter mostly reflecting difficult conditions in offshore markets which represent approximately 35 of newsprint shipments and to a lesser extent the downward pressure within north america the delivered cost improved by 15 per metric ton reflecting mostly the cost benefits of idling augusta which only operated for two weeks in the quarter shipments and finished goods inventory were both unchanged in the quarter ebitda declined by 4 million to 7 million in the quarter for 2019 newsprint s operating income was 49 million a 25 million reduction from 2018 year over year the average transaction price slipped by 14 per metric ton to 588 with most of the weakness for the year coming in export markets the delivered cost was essentially unchanged as the impact of higher chip prices was offset by the favorable effect of the weaker canadian dollar and a lower depreciation expense in the segment shipments were down by 192 000 metric tons in the year or 13 as a result of lower global demand ebitda was 78 million in 2019 down from 140 million in 2018 in november the company announced the indefinite idling of the augusta mill with capacity of 214 000 metric tons as a result of the decline in north american newsprint consumption the company took about 160 000 metric tons of temporary downtime in 2019 the decision allows it to focus production on fewer more competitive mills and to eliminate fixed costs associated with surplus capacity specialty papers the specialty papers segment incurred an operating loss of 1 million in the quarter down by 5 million from the third quarter the reduction is almost entirely due to lower pricing which decreased by 30 per short ton on softer market conditions even as shipments rose seasonally by 12 000 short tons the delivered cost increased by less than 1 and finished goods inventory fell by 18 to 40 000 shorts tons a record low the segment generated ebitda of 10 million down from 15 million in the previous quarter for 2019 operating income in the segment was down by 7 million to 33 million year over year average transaction price rose by 21 per short ton to 739 per short ton shipments fell by 356 000 short tons including nearly 300 000 short tons from the sale of catawba the delivered cost rose by 14 per short ton year over year due mainly to higher maintenance and higher fiber costs ebitda was 76 million in 2019 down from 87 million in 2018 consolidated quarterly operating income variance against year ago period the company s operating results were 144 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2018 the change reflects the unfavorable effects of lower selling prices 98 million mainly in the pulp and paper segments an unfavorable variance 51 million related to gains on divestitures impairments write downs and closure costs including augusta and the lost contribution from the divestiture of catawba and fairmont 24 million these were partially offset by favorable sg a expenses and depreciation and amortization 15 million due mostly to lower variable compensation expenses lower manufacturing costs 9 million due in part to the idling of augusta net of inventory write downs and lower freight expenses 5 million corporate and finance on december 24 the company announced an agreement to acquire from conifex timber inc three sawmills in the u s south for 163 million plus working capital delivered at closing which is currently estimated at 13 million the three sawmills with combined production capacity of 550 million board feet are located in cross city florida and glenwood and el dorado arkansas the company expects the transaction to close in the coming days it intends to finance the acquisition with existing credit facilities the company used 35 million of cash in operating activities in the fourth quarter including a payment of 14 million following a court decision which the company is appealing relating to the 2012 acquisition of fibrek inc only 2 million of the closure costs associated with the indefinite idling of augusta were cash items in the quarter the company expects a further outflow of up to 5 million cash in the first quarter of this year the company repurchased 3 million shares of common stock in the quarter for 12 million 5 million shares for 24 million for all of 2019 with capital expenditures of 31 million in the quarter 113 million for the year and softwood lumber duty deposits of 13 million 59 million for the year and 162 million total to date on the balance sheet the company completed the year with 3 million of cash in october the company entered into an amended and restated senior secured credit facility for up to 360 million replacing the existing 185 million facility entered into in september 2016 the amended credit agreement includes a term loan facility of up to 180 million with a delayed draw period of up to three years and maturities of six to ten years at the company s option as well as a six year revolver of up to 180 million in connection with the refinancing the company repaid a term loan from the previous facility with proceeds from the new facility it drew 25 million from its revolving credit facilities in the quarter to support working capital needs due to an 80 basis points decrease in applicable discount rates the net pension and other postretirement benefit liability on the year end balance sheet increased by over 200 million from last year to 1 5 billion outlook our average transaction price in market pulp is down by over 200 per metric ton from its peak about one year ago but we believe the cycle reached bottom in the fourth quarter indeed we see stronger operating rates especially in softwood pulp as indicators of long term demand growth for quality market pulp which is consistent with the recently reported steps the industry has taken toward pricing recovery with our existing tissue footprint we expect progressive earnings growth for 2020 in the business as we continue to build on recent improvements around sales growth and productivity gains we re excited with the prospects around the pending acquisition of three u s sawmills as our timing allowed us to achieve an attractive price the upside will come with the turnaround plan for the assets and continued momentum in market conditions from their recent soft levels we will continue to maximize the earnings power and cash generation of our paper segments although we have modest expectations

january 1 2019 under the new standard all lease contracts with limited exceptions are recognised in the financial statements by way of right of use assets and corresponding lease liabilities shell applied the modified retrospective transition method and consequently comparative information is not restated as a practical expedient no reassessment was performed of contracts that were previously identified as leases and contracts that were not previously identified as containing a lease applying ias 17 leases and ifric 4 determining whether an arrangement contains a lease at january 1 2019 additional lease liabilities were recognised for leases previously classified as operating leases applying ias 17 these lease liabilities were measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted using entity specific incremental borrowing rates at january 1 2019 in general a corresponding right of use asset was recognised for an amount equal to each lease liability adjusted by the amount of any prepaid or accrued lease payment relating to the specific lease contract as recognised on the balance sheet at december 31 2018 provisions for onerous lease contracts at december 31 2018 were adjusted to the respective right of use assets recognised at january 1 2019 the reconciliation of differences between the operating lease commitments disclosed under the prior standard and the additional lease liabilities recognised on the balance sheet at january 1 2019 is as follows lease liabilities reconciliation million undiscounted future minimum lease payments under

modified retrospective transition method lease payments were discounted at january 1 2019 using an incremental borrowing rate representing the rate of interest that the entity within shell that entered into the lease would have to pay to borrow over a similar term and with a similar security the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right of use asset in a similar economic environment the incremental borrowing rate applied to each lease was determined taking into account the risk free rate adjusted for factors such as the credit rating of the contracting entity and the terms and conditions of the lease the weighted average incremental borrowing rate applied by shell upon transition was 7 2 2 shell has applied the practical expedient to classify leases for which the lease term ends within 12 months of the date of initial application of ifrs 16 as short term leases shell has also applied the recognition exemption for short term leases compared with the previous accounting for operating leases under ias 17 the application of the new standard has a significant impact on the classification of expenditures and cash flows it also impacts the timing of expenses recognised in the statement of income with effect from 2019 expenses related to leases previously classified as operating leases are presented under depreciation depletion and amortisation and interest expense in 2018 these were mainly reported in purchases production and manufacturing expenses and selling distribution and administrative expenses with effect from 2019 payments related to leases previously classified as operating leases are presented under cash flow from financing activities in 2018 these were reported in cash flow from operating activities and cash flow from investing activities the adoption of the new standard had an accumulated impact of 4 million in equity following the recognition of lease liabilities of 16 037 million and additional right of use

certain gas contracts in the ordinary course of business shell enters into contracts to supply or purchase oil and gas products as well as power and environmental products shell also enters into contracts for tolling pipeline and storage capacity derivative contracts are entered into for mitigation of resulting economic exposures generally price exposure and these derivative contracts are carried at period end market price fair value with movements in fair value recognised in income for the period supply and purchase contracts entered into for operational purposes as well as contracts for tolling pipeline and storage capacity are by contrast recognised when the transaction occurs furthermore inventory is carried at historical cost or net realisable value whichever is lower as a consequence accounting mismatches occur because a the supply or purchase transaction is recognised in a different period or b the inventory is measured on a different basis in addition certain contracts are due to pricing or delivery conditions deemed to contain embedded derivatives or written options and are also required to be carried at fair value even though they are entered into for operational purposes the accounting impacts are reported as identified items impacts of exchange rate movements on tax balances represent the impact on tax balances of exchange rate movements arising

the us economy expanded at 2 3 percent last year well short of trump s 3 percent target again according to united states president donald trump the us economy was in a rather dismal state until he and his administration turned it into a roaring geyser of opportunity how he described it to an audience at last week s world economic forum in davos switzerland but us government figures released on thursday belie the geyser narrative by confirming that the us economic growth in 2019 was the weakest in three years and once again fell well short the president s often touted three percent growth target us gross domestic product gdp which measures the value of all goods and services produced across the economy grew at an annualised rate of 2 1 percent in the fourth quarter bringing full year growth for 2019 to 2 3 percent the us department of commerce said on thursday president trump had predicted that the economy would grow by three percent or more thanks largely to a 1 5 trillion dollar tax cut package that his fellow republicans pushed through congress in 2017 but the tax cuts have failed to deliver on that promise corporations which saw their tax rate slashed from 35 percent to 21 percent ploughed a lot of those savings into buying back their own stock rather than sinking it into growth boosting measures such as expanding their businesses or investing in research and development to spur innovation meanwhile a tax cut translates into less revenue for the us government which continues to spend more than it takes in annually so called deficit spending earlier this week the us congressional budget office said the us federal deficit will reach 1 trillion this year and hit 1 3 trillion every year after through 2030 while deficit spending can be useful when the economy is stuck in a recession and needs a kick start too much deficit spending can slow growth as the national debt rises and it s already an eye watering 23 trillion and counting the interest payments on that debt rise too which leaves less money available to spend on programmes that benefit the nation s citizens strength and disappointment the commerce department data revealed that fourth quarter us economic growth was buoyed by home purchases that were encouraged by lower borrowing costs the us federal reserve cut interest rates three times last year as well as us defence spending and a decrease in imports but consumer spending the engine of the us economy accounting for roughly two thirds of us economic growth decelerated in the fourth quarter another potentially worrying trend business investment declined for a third straight quarter the longest stretch since 2009 that could ripple through the economy by weighing on job growth and consumer spending but some analysts see reason for better growth ahead the trade war between the us and china has injected uncertainty into the business outlook and stoked fears of recession but the signing of the phase one trade deal between washington and beijing this month has helped ease concerns the 2 1 annualised gain in fourth quarter gdp was not quite as solid as it looked with consumption growth slowing and business investment contracting for a third consecutive quarter capital economics chief us economist paul ashworth wrote in a note to clients nevertheless with the survey evidence beginning to improve slightly and the phase one trade deal easing one of the headwinds holding back investment we expect gdp growth to gradually accelerate this year the us labour market has also remained on track creating more than enough jobs to aborb new entrants into the labour force each month and unemployment is still hovering near a half century low the us federal reserve cited low unemployment and the strong us jobs market when voted to leave interest rates unchanged at the end of its first policy meeting of the year on wednesday

year operating revenue for 2019 was 2 55 billion 8 lower than the record level achieved in 2018 this reflected higher revenue in the second half of the year versus the first half as we anticipated our record fourth quarter revenue of 708 million was 3 higher than the prior year s period in financial advisory we completed the year with 1 36 billion in revenue in the fourth quarter our advisory revenue was in line with the prior year quarter reflecting a substantial increase in revenue from europe and asia pacific in asset management we generated 1 16 billion in revenue for the year in the fourth quarter operating revenue increased by 7 over the prior year s quarter reflecting higher management fees and incentive fees fourth quarter management and other fees increased 2 sequentially from the third quarter reflecting higher average aum for full year 2019 our average fee was 49 basis points down from 51 basis points in 2018 this reflected a shift in our mix of assets we had net inflows for the year in our quantitative and fixed income strategies while at the same time we experienced net outflows in our emerging markets platform incentive fees for the year were 21 million the same amount as in 2018 fourth quarter incentive fees were 14 million reflecting strong relative and absolute performance across a mix of our equity and fixed income strategies key strategies generating incentive fees included quantitative and global equities and convertibles and emerging markets debt average aum for the fourth quarter was 238 billion up 6 from last year s period and up 2 sequentially in the third quarter of 2019 the sequential increase was driven by market appreciation of 13 billion foreign exchange appreciation of 4 billion and net inflows of approximately 500 million for the full year we experienced net outflows of 9 billion driven primarily by outflows in emerging markets equity and debt as well as multiregional equity other platforms had strong net inflows for the year including quantitative and local equities and our global and multiregional fixed income platforms we finished 2019 with aum of 248 billion and as of january 28 aum was approximately 247 billion the decrease reflected foreign exchange depreciation of 2 4 billion and net outflows of 1 1 billion offset by market appreciation of 2 3 billion market volatility has been increasing in january and we anticipate additional near term outflows of approximately 500 million for the month looking ahead across our franchise asset management is off to a good start with aum well above the average level for 2019 in financial advisory we have momentum entering the first half of the year our current level of activity is higher than at this time last year and we are encouraged by the increase in european m a where we have a deeply established presence and growing opportunities driven in part by shareholder activism we re seeing strong demand across our advisory practices globally including restructuring engagements turning to expenses we continue to demonstrate our cost discipline and ability to manage the firm through cycles our compensation ratio for 2019 on an adjusted basis was 57 5 up from a record low of 55 1 in 2018 on an awarded basis our annual comp ratio was 57 7 compared to 55 8 for 2018 our comp ratio was well within our targeted range adjusted noncompensation expense for the year rose 3 to 499 million reflecting our increased investments in the business primarily in our technology infrastructure which we have highlighted throughout the year for the full year 2019 our noncomp expense ratio of 9 19 6 remains within our targeted range our effective tax rate for 2019 was 24 1 compared to 22 7 a year ago this was in line with our expectations of an annual effective tax rate in the mid 20s for the coming year 2020 we continue to expect an effective tax rate in the mid 20 range turning now to capital allocation we continue to generate strong cash flow and return capital to our shareholders in 2019 we returned 850 million primarily through a combination of share repurchases and dividends during the year we repurchased 13 7 million shares which included 1 7 million in the fourth quarter as a result our fourth quarter diluted weighted average share count declined by 9 from the prior year to 115 5 million shares in 2020 we expect to continue our share repurchase program at a minimum to offset potential dilution from our year end equity grants our total outstanding repurchase authorization is now 370 379 million ken will now conclude our remarks kenneth jacobs chairman and chief executive officer thank you evan the year is off to a strong start overall the global macroeconomic environment remains constructive fundamentals for global equity markets are steady and credit conditions remain favorable we re seeing momentum in global m a including europe as business confidence grows and despite global trade tensions we ve seen an increase in cross border transactions around the world the forces driving global strategic activity remain in place technology driven disruption continues to be a catalyst for m a across industries shareholder activism has become a global phenomenon last year almost half of all activist campaigns had an m a thesis in addition climate risk is becoming increasingly relevant to company valuations and is an emerging catalyst for strategic activity our esg expertise is well entrenched in our asset management business and we are building out this expertise as a firm in financial advisory we are well positioned we have the most sophisticated strategic and shareholder advisory capabilities deep relationships in local markets around the world and the expertise of global sector and specialty teams in asset management institutional investors are increasingly dividing the portfolios between low cost passive strategies and high value added active strategies we have a world class investing franchise in markets that reward deep fundamental research and our quantitative strategies are competing effectively in the market for low cost products we see opportunities for growth across our businesses and we are allocating our resources accordingly we remain focused on serving all of our clients well while we manage the firm for profitable growth and shareholder value over the long term now let s open the call to questions questions answers operator thank you we can take our first question from brennan hawken of ubs please go ahead your line is open brennan hawken ubs analyst hi good morning thanks for taking the question just wanted to ask on expenses noncomp really looked quite good versus at least what i had been expecting was there some onetime any onetime noise in there that we should adjust or think about when we re considering a baseline on which to build here into 2020 kenneth jacobs chairman and chief executive officer evan evan russo chief financial officer yeah hey brennan good morning look as we said the noncomp came in about 130 million in q4 we continue to focus on maintaining the cost discipline as we talked about throughout the year this year noncomp increases reflected a couple of things one is the continued rolling in of our technology investments as well as some additional marketing and business development as we started ramping up more marketing in the middle of this year and it was offset as you mentioned by a couple of other items most notably lower pension costs in this year versus last year last year q4 we had some higher pension costs that got accrued in that quarter and this year we had less pension costs that accrued so i guess that s the one component but i d say it s a combination of the cost discipline that we ve been working through throughout the year but for the year on an ongoing basis i think we expect to remain at elevated levels for the next few quarters as we ve mentioned as we continue to roll in our technology projects we expand hiring and continue to grow our real estate our footprint grow our real estate footprint to ready expansion as we invest for the future i think look brennan it s always important to remember our spending in our noncomp the way we think about it is it s very much strategic spending we re creating a stronger platform a strong and more vibrant platform to accelerate growth so i think this quarter was a good quarter we got a couple of components in there that were helpful but i think it s sort of in line with the way we ve been managing costs throughout the year brennan hawken ubs analyst great that s really helpful appreciate the time operator thank you we can now take our next question from chris walsh of wolfe research please go ahead your line is open chris walsh hey guys good morning evan russo chief financial officer morning chris walsh just wanted to ask one quick one on the share count recognizing that amortization of historical stock accruals generally higher in the first half of each year and that 2019 may have seen elevated net buybacks after the net debt issuance and with a lower stock price how should we think about appetite for buyback and kind of the cadence of buyback over the course of 2020 evan russo chief financial officer sure hey chris i ll take that one i mean look we continue to focus on as we ve been saying focus on returning the excess cash to our shareholders as you mentioned we had accelerated a lot of buybacks earlier in this year as we mentioned we bought back 13 7 million shares over the course of the year frankly almost 20 million shares over the last 15 months so i mean at a minimum as we always say we re going to offset the dilution we get this quarter we bought back enough shares to offset the amortization of shares effectively keeping the weighted average share count flat i think if you think out into 2020 we re going to continue to use the excess cash flow to buy back shares the first couple of quarters we focus on buying back the dilution and then as we get later into the year we see what kind of excess cash we have we ll be putting it to work to work to reduce the share count as best we can chris walsh got it thanks and then just one more on flows in the asset management business you saw a much better flow in december and i don t want to read it too much into one data point and i heard your color around expectations for negative flows in january so just kind of wanted to see if anything has changed in your outlook there at all can you speak to the uptake of some of your newer launches and comment on any allocation trends you re seeing across your client base evan russo chief financial officer sure so look i think when you think about our flows as you said we had positive net flows in q4 and we ve had some outflows net outflows at the beginning of this year as well look you have to remember as we always say we are in a lot of most of our assets 85 of our assets are in institutional side it s pretty lumpy so you re going to get some movement from time to time plus important to remember i mean we had over 13 billion of gross inflows just in q4 so inflows and outflows there s always material movements in every given quarter so i think our outlook remains the same as it s been we ve seen some outflows as we called out in the em platform in the quarter and the full year and then specifically as we ve said in the past specifically in the value part of our platform we ve talked about value underperforming growth and quality value has been under pressure out of favor as you well know the growth part of our platform is performing really well we re having great performance there and indeed performance is pretty strong across most of the aum that we have over 70 of our funds are outperforming on a one year basis and so i think our trends will continue i think we expect to see some muted outflows some additional outflows as we said in some of the emerging markets products in this quarter and i think but i think our outlook for the business continues to remain the same we re focusing on performance and we expect the flows will follow chris walsh great thanks for answering my questions operator thank you we can now take our next question from devin ryan of jmp securities please go ahead devin ryan jmp securities analyst great good morning guys how are you evan russo chief financial officer good morning devin ryan jmp securities analyst first one here just on operating leverage in the model and just expectations in how we should think about incremental margins just given some of the moving parts with some of the headcount changes late last year but then i also hear your commentary around investment into the business continuing and then hopefully there s some revenue growth in 2020 as well so just trying to put that all together and get an update on any moving parts that we should be thinking about for incremental margins kenneth jacobs chairman and chief executive officer sure so i ll take the first part of it and then if there s a follow up with evan on some of the specifics what i d say is look it s pretty straightforward when there s revenue growth we tend to get pretty good operating leverage in the business and revenue declines it s more difficult to get that kind of operating leverage and i think we do a pretty good job in the revenue decline to manage the real cost of compensation which were reflected in the awarded comp on both sides of the business so what i d say is this year feels better than last year at the start we ve got strong momentum going into 2020 it feels a lot better to me than it did at the same time last year so we would get revenue growth this year you should expect to see improved operating leverage in the business devin ryan jmp securities analyst got it terrific ok and then just one on the advisory backdrop and great to see the improved momentum relative to a year ago and when i talk to investors one thing that continues to come up is just how the u s elections could start to affect the markets if at all and i think there s some concern that as we get closer it could start to create a little bit of paralysis and so i m curious if you re hearing about that at all from clients if you have a view of whether it feels like that s going to be a big factor or the trends that are driving conversations today both in the u s and outside the u s kind of stronger than potential disruption from that kenneth jacobs chairman and chief executive officer well i think right now the drivers of the market are related to the macroenvironment the economy as a whole which is remains pretty robust in the u s and has stabilized and probably improving in parts of europe and if you look at the traditional factors that drive activity credit valuation confidence levels credit remains widely available rates are at historic lows spreads are reasonable financing again widely available valuations probably a little rich in parts of the market a little more reasonable in other parts of the market i think in terms of confidence levels trade tensions have been reduced with the phase 1 of the china trade agreement and then the mexico and canada agreement is now signed i think that helps and the election itself as we get closer perhaps there s volatility around that but again i think one of the lessons of the last 12 years is oftentimes less gets done after election than people expect because of the nature of majorities and supermajorities in congress and the inability to get that much through so i think in some ways there obviously could be concerns around election but there are also issues that kind of moderate that and i think as we get closer to the election we ll see but for the moment we don t see much commentary around the elections affecting deal activities devin ryan jmp securities analyst great that s helpful color thanks ken operator thank you we can now take our next question from richard ramsden of goldman sachs please go ahead richard ramsden goldman sachs analyst ok good morning guys i was hoping that you could expand a bit on some of the momentum that you re seeing in the european business and i guess specifically the question is now there s a clearer path for brexit do you think activity is going to accelerate from here or do you think that would be more of the drivers to the strength that you ve seen over the last 6 months thanks kenneth jacobs chairman and chief executive officer sure so i think we saw us a pickup in activity in europe in the first half of 19 that reflect that was reflected in closings in the in our completions in the fourth quarter for us and things feel a little more robust right now than they did a year ago even in europe and obviously for us as a whole full firm right now in terms of brexit clearly having more certainty around brexit is helping the investment client and the decision making climate in the u k in particular and i would expect that we expect that there will be a pickup activity in the u k i think we ve already seen some of it starting and dialogues are increasing and i think with credit conditions the way they are and such i think we will see a pickup there evan russo chief financial officer well i think with the amount of capital that s going into private equity activity levels in private equity are going to remain high credit conditions are robust as i said before and the need to invest and also the need to find realizations on portfolios keep that to be a very robust market and strategic market remains active so i think overall both markets are healthy richard ramsden goldman sachs analyst ok thanks a lot operator thank you we will now take our next question from michael brown of kbw michael brown kbw analyst hi good morning ken and evan kenneth jacobs chairman and chief executive officer morning michael brown kbw analyst so i appreciate the color on the activity levels and any additional color on europe you had mentioned that cross border has kind of improved as well i was looking to get a little more color as to kind of which regions you re kind of seeing that and i would also appreciate some additional color on what you re seeing in some of the other regions outside of kind of europe but what are you seeing in latin america canada other parts of asia as well kenneth jacobs chairman and chief executive officer ok i think yeah there s been for us at least some pickup in cross border activities in europe cross border into the u s we had a couple of nice transactions announced in the second half of the year and some activity on the part of some of the large chinese companies into latin america i think activity in asia has been more muted and activity from asia into the u s obviously much more muted particularly in china into the u s much more muted and china into europe still some transactions i think we ll see a little bit of a pickup into the u k perhaps over the course of the year but not at the level they were a few years back but overall it s ok michael brown kbw analyst ok thanks and if i could just follow up on the capital return question i appreciate that you probably kind of reevaluate as you get to the second half of the year but i guess as we think about kind of your current valuation at what level would you look to maybe do less buybacks and shift back to more of a special dividend to return any excess cash to investors evan russo chief financial officer sure so i think we ve been pretty clear all year about the way we ve been thinking about it shifting our focus a little bit more toward the share repurchases after some discussions with shareholders and obviously looking at the value that we ve been trading at and i don t think we have a hard value that we would say hey we trigger one to the other i think we were in this mode where we see significant value in the shares and we re going to continue to use our excess cash flow for share repurchases over that period and i think that served us well i think what we re going to continue to do as we ve always done have a balanced approach to our capital management strategy which starts obviously with our common dividend and we ve been gradually increasing it over the years and i think we would expect to continue to gradually increase it to match the growth rate of the business of course to offset any compensation dilution and after that after we figure out whatever cash we need in the business the rest will be returned to shareholders and we make those decisions as we go throughout the year but right now we re very we feel good about the business as ken said we feel good about the outlook as we go into this coming year and i think that ll our goals will be to continue on our current plan of repurchasing shares look i would say our capital management strategy as a whole our goal is very clear you know to be prudent but as well as opportunistic in capital structure and capital management and i think we ve been doing that michael brown kbw analyst great thanks guys operator thank you we ll now take our next question from jeff harte of piper sandler jeffery harte piper sandler analyst good morning guys a couple for me looking at noncomp expense i mean really only being up 3 year over year in 2018 despite all the investments is i think pretty good should we be thinking about a similar growth rate in 2020 given that you re still investing evan russo chief financial officer yeah so look as we ve said that we expect the noncomp to come out even a little higher than it did i think we focused as we ve gone through the beginning of this year with revenues falling to really tighten up a little bit i think some of the benefits came from pushing out some of the expenses into next year and so i think we re expecting to see additional growth in noncomp we expect it to remain at elevated levels over the coming quarters as more of the technology projects that we ve really started over the last 18 months start to roll in into the noncomp line and we start amortizing those expenses so i think we would expect to see it continue to grow or probably at or above that level and going back to sort of where the averages have been for most of this year jeffery harte piper sandler analyst ok and something i don t tend to ask much about but the corporate segment revenues were pretty strong there relative to at least what we were expecting are there items to highlight there and is there also kind of a starting point as far as the run rate that we should think about for that line evan russo chief financial officer sure so look we had higher corporate revenues this year as you know there s lots of components that go into the corporate line for us it s everything that doesn t really go into the businesses and there s just a lot of components everything from the cash and returns that we get on cash as you know that that s been changing as rates have gone up around the world and our cash position starts to earn some benefits fx revaluations any insurance proceeds but most importantly it s related to other investments so legacy private equity that we have on the balance sheet as well as all of our seed portfolio that we have for our asset management business any of the hedged and unhedged components any gains or losses go through the corporate revenue line so and as you know it can be a little bit of volatility from quarter to quarter this quarter i think a lot of those things kind of moved in our direction and so we have about 12 million of corporate revenue i d say for the year 29 million certainly at the higher end of where we ve been historically i think from a framework of when we start at the beginning of the year we kind of think on average if you go back over the last two or three years 3 million to 5 million is probably the right area but again there s going to be a lot of volatility because there s a lot of components there that move and they re just not controllable in many cases jeffery harte piper sandler analyst ok and on kind of little kind of deeper thought i guess you mentioned earlier and you have been mentioning about systems and kind of data and investments there and the ability to identify opportunities early i get that in asset management can you talk a little bit about how that s may be helping the advisory business which had kind of historically i thought of as more pure relational kenneth jacobs chairman and chief executive officer yeah so i think let me step back the advisory business you re right relationships matter enormously but if you sort of think about what we re effectively doing in the advisory business on one hand we re helping guide boards senior managements in making big strategic decisions and then helping execute those decisions and in many respects we re trying to predict the outcomes before they happen and one of the key outcomes we re trying to predict is stock price performance around specific events and those events can be anything from a sale a spin off an acquisition of an asset or of a company a repurchase program change in allocation of capital among other things and a big part of that is prediction and event prediction what s going to happen around this event and part of that is predicting shareholder behavior and so a lot of our efforts are going into seeing if we can develop tools that better predict what is going to happen around these events and if you think of many of the advances in data science and machine learning and ai it s really to improve your capacity to predict better and that s where we re focusing our entry energy jeffery harte piper sandler analyst ok thank you operator thank you we ll now take our next question from jim mitchell of buckingham research jim mitchell buckingham research analyst hey good morning ken maybe just a bigger picture question on you seem obviously a little bit better about the environment going into the year i guess given all the different pockets of revenue whether it s capital advisory sovereign advisory m a what are you i guess most excited about in terms of the growth prospects from here over the next 12 to 24 months where do you see the greatest opportunity and where are you investing the most kenneth jacobs chairman and chief executive officer good question so one of the great things about our franchise in the advisory side is we have enormous white space so there s a plethora of places where there s opportunity to invest and so part of our challenge is just drilling down on the places where we think there is the most opportunity and the best chance for success i think a few areas that sort of jump out or following the trends of where capital is going and one of the things that s happening is obviously an enormous amount of capital is going toward alternative investments private equity private investments and one of the things which we are really focused on is making sure that we re well positioned to capitalize on that trend on the advisory side that means making sure that we are really well positioned with what we describe as the crosscut market what we think of as private owners of assets that could be the sponsored universe but increasingly it s families and many of the large pension funds and positioning ourselves and net flow of capital is very important that also helps drive our pca business so that s another area which is very important and of course making sure that we re really focused on the things that drive our business as a whole which are relationships with big important companies doing the most important things they do and then also making sure that we re sort of on the cutting edge in terms of capabilities around advice which we ve demonstrated i think in making sure that our shareholder activism practice is on the cutting edge both in the united states and now especially in europe where i think we re easily the market leader there jim mitchell buckingham research analyst ok that s helpful and is there any long term opportunity for in china as they open up their markets is that something that you think you need to start positioning for or feel well positioned for if that happens kenneth jacobs chairman and chief executive officer well i think on the advisory side we re very well positioned for that we have an outstanding team in china that i think is probably easily one of the handful of best advisory practices in china with a full team built out based in a mix of beijing and hong kong and then on the asset management side of the business i think some of the changes in the regulatory environment in china opened up some significant opportunities for all asset managers in terms of distribution and that s something we are keeping our eye on jim mitchell buckingham research analyst great great thanks operator thank you we ll now take our next question from manan gosalia of morgan stanley please go ahead your line is open manan gosalia morgan stanley analyst hi good morning kenneth jacobs chairman and chief executive officer morning manan gosalia morgan stanley analyst i was wondering if you could just give us an update on the business realignment that you had took last quarter so on the asset management side i think you previously mentioned that there would be a 300 million to 400 million drag on aum growth associated with the strategies that you were closing down so is that already in the run rate now and maybe separately you can also talk about how you re thinking about reinvesting some of the dry powder that you created from that realignment evan russo chief financial officer sure so as you mentioned we announced in q3 business realignment we expected it to go through q3 and q4 we completed our program in q4 as we said it impacted approximately 200 employees split between financial advisory asset management and corporate i think as you mentioned i mean given the current environment for the first half of this year we saw the business performance we wanted to get ahead of the curve we thought it was a good opportunity to take a hard look and identify areas of business strategies some of the debts we ve made that we re performing slower or had less opportunity in the future to take the initiative to kind of take those off the table and redeploy them in other areas now we re we ve been continuously reinvesting throughout the year and you can see that in the fact that our even with the impacted employees relating to business realignment our headcount is roughly flat within 1 of where we started the year so we ve been continuously to reinvesting this into the areas that we continue to see as bigger opportunities so this is more for us is sort of self funding some of the growth opportunities and the investments we ve been wanting to make and i think a lot of that has to relate to the areas where ken has mentioned that we see bigger opportunities in the future some of the components of financial advisory where we think the biggest opportunity is from a white space perspective as we ve talked about in the past and also the asset management just making sure we re putting resources in areas of growth such as alternatives and others and just redeploying on a consistent basis into the areas that are doing well and have greatest opportunity manan gosalia morgan stanley analyst got it and then just a quick one for me on the noncomp side you mentioned you increased marketing and business development this quarter where are you spending the incremental dollars and is that a change in strategy at the margin or is that just normal quarter to quarter volatility evan russo chief financial officer yeah it s normal quarter to quarter volatility i mean it s really marketing business development throughout this year was a little bit higher than it s been in the past as we saw the slowdown in revenue specifically in the financial advisory business we had higher marketing costs as we spent more time on the road engaging with clients and that s just natural in the business there i don t think there s any material change in the way in which we re managing the business or seeing the tight spend we re doing this has always it kind of comes up and down depending on business activity depending on closing the kind of the types of reimbursements we get from clients so i think it s sort of in that range and i don t think there s anything specific there that i would call out manan gosalia morgan stanley analyst got it thanks very much operator duration 41 minutes call participants alexandra

in december 2017 trump predicted that u s gross domestic product gdp growth would reach 6 percent but two years later gdp growth actually slowed to just 2 1 percent in the final quarter of 2019 the department of commerce estimated thursday that between october and december the gross domestic product which measures the value of goods and services produced in the u s grew at just 2 1 percent year over year growth was 2 3 percent last year well below the three percent projections set by the trump administration and nowhere close to the 6 percent the president once predicted the economy now has hit 3 percent nobody thought we d be anywhere close i think we can go to 4 5 and maybe even 6 percent ultimately trump said december 16 2017 at the time 2017 gdp growth hit 3 2 percent in the third quarter and rose to 3 5 percent in the fourth quarter for all of trump s assertions that the u s currently has the greatest economy in history gdp growth under his administration has averaged only slightly higher than it did during former president barack obama s final four years in office the average gdp growth under obama from 2013 to 2016 was 2 2 percent while in trump s first three years it has been just under 2 5 percent trump s best year for gdp growth was 2018 when it reached an average of 2 9 percent under obama annual gdp growth hit 2 9 percent in 2015 as well which was the highest annual growth his administration achieved president donald trump speaks before signing the united states mexico canada trade agreement usmca during a ceremony on the south lawn of the white house on january 29 in washington d c president donald trump speaks before signing the united states mexico canada trade agreement usmca during a ceremony on the south lawn of the white house on january 29 in washington d c drew angerer getty trump s administration has also never achieved quarterly gdp growth above 3 5 percent under obama gdp growth reached 5 5 percent and then 5 percent in both the second and third quarters of 2014 trump and republicans have repeatedly pointed to low unemployment and a booming stock market to tout the administration s economic achievements but critics have raised concerns about ballooning debt and growing budget deficits the president s tax cuts which he and his supporters claimed would bring a boom of economic growth have fueled the deficit while largely benefiting the wealthiest americans and corporations meanwhile trump s protracted trade war with china and trade tensions with allies have taken a toll on the economy but the president this week signed the landmark united states mexico canada agreement usma which has replaced the previous north american free trade agreement nafta he also signed a phase one trade deal with china this month suggesting that some trade tensions will improve over the coming year despite criticisms of trump s economic policies the continued gdp growth will be viewed positively overall economists have previously raised concerns about the possibility of another recession so sustained growth is a welcome sign that is an unusual degree of consistency for what can be a volatile series and it is the sort of thing that will please policy makers said eric winograd a senior economist at alliancebernstein told business insider two percent is strong enough to avoid being too close to recession but not so strong as to suggest overheating

million and a 0 1 million increase in net interest income partially offset by higher noninterest expense of 1 3 million and lower noninterest income of 0 1 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 the 0 1 million increase in net income was attributable to higher net interest income of 1 9 million higher noninterest income of 0 6 million and a 0 6 million decrease in the loan loss provision partially offset by higher noninterest expense of 2 6 million and income taxes of 0 4 million the increase in net income of 4 6 million for the full year 2019 versus 2018 was attributable to higher

overnight funds and loans offset the unfavorable rate variance due to the lower overnight funds rate compared to the prior year periods the increase in net interest income was driven by deposit growth predominately noninterest bearing which funded growth in overnight funds and loans additionally average yields rates were generally favorable as higher rates prior to 2019 continued to migrate through the earning asset portfolios the federal funds target rate reached a recent high in the second quarter of 2019 at a range of 2 25 to 2 50 during the second half of 2019 the federal open market committee reduced rates by an aggregate of 75 basis points to the current range of 1 50 to 1 75 these rate cuts resulted in downward repricing of our variable adjustable rate earning assets which to date has been offset by loan growth and a corresponding reduction in rates paid on our negotiated rate deposit products we continue to prudently manage our overall cost of funds which was 26 basis points for the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 33 basis points for the third quarter of 2019 due to highly competitive fixed rate loan pricing in our markets we continue to review our loan pricing and make adjustments where we believe appropriate and prudent our net interest margin for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 3 89 a decrease of three basis points from the third quarter of 2019 and an

the third quarter 2019 was due primarily to the growth and composition of our earning assets the increase in the margin compared to the fourth quarter 2018 reflected a three basis point increase in our earning asset yield and a five basis point decline in our cost of funds the increase in the margin compared to 2018 was attributable to a 29 basis point increase in our earning asset yield partially offset by an eight basis point increase in our cost of funds in general overnight rates rose into the second quarter 2019 at which time they reversed and began to fall in response to the fed rate cuts the provision for loan losses for the fourth quarter of 2019 was negative 0 2 million and reflected a lower level of net loan losses this compares to a provision expense of 0 8 million for

6 million or 4 5 increase over the fourth quarter of 2018 for the full year 2019 noninterest income totaled 53 1 million a 1 5 million or 2 9 increase over 2018 which reflected higher wealth management fees of 1 8 million mortgage banking fees of 0 6 million and bank card fees of 0 6 million partially offset by lower deposit fees of 0 6 million and other income of 0 9 million the improvement in wealth management fees was driven by higher trading activity by our retail brokerage clients and to a lesser extent growth in assets under management a lower rate environment drove higher residential loan production and the increase in mortgage banking fees higher debit card utilization by our clients and credit card promotions throughout the year drove the improvement in bank card fees the decline in deposit fees reflected lower overdraft fees and the reduction in other income was primarily attributable to a miscellaneous recovery in the fourth quarter of 2018 and lower miscellaneous fees the same aforementioned factors drove the variance versus the fourth quarter of 2018 noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2019 totaled 29 1 million an increase of 1 3 million or 4 6 over the third quarter of 2019 and 2 6 million or 9 9 over the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2019 higher compensation expense primarily incentives and legal professional fees related to the brand mortgage llc transaction drove the increase the increase over the fourth quarter of 2018 was primarily attributable to lower other real estate owned oreo expense in the fourth quarter of 2018 which reflected a large gain from the sale of a banking office higher compensation expense base salaries and commissions also contributed to the variance for the full year 2019 noninterest expense totaled 113 6 million a 2 1 million or 1 9 increase over 2018 which primarily reflected higher compensation expense of 2 4 million base salaries and commissions and oreo

million or 0 9 over the third quarter of 2019 and an increase of 140 2 million or 5 5 over the fourth quarter of 2018 the increase in average earning assets compared to both prior periods reflected a

bloomberg when indian prime minister narendra modi began his second term in may i d hoped for a reset of his government s fraught relationship with domestic business and global capital eight months later the stalemates have only multiplied while the world s view of the country under his watch has dimmed the annual budget on february 1 will present another opportunity for course correction but if the previous budget in july it is presented late in election years is any guide truth and honesty may rank way below expediency and bravado there s no shortage of ideas to fix the economy provided new delhi accepts that it s facing a crisis the last budget would have been the right time to press the panic button however the newly re elected government tried to whitewash its funding crunch with outlandish forecasts of tax collection that have fallen badly short tax cuts haven t delivered doubling down on those rosy predictions with an off budget corporate tax cut cheered the stock markets but worsened the government s revenue shortfall and did nothing for an economy wide insufficiency of demand nominal gross domestic product growth of 7 5 per cent is the slowest in more than four decades virtually every industry from banking and auto to real estate power and telecom is in disarray the fiscal space available to fight the slowdown is limited kickstarting sell offs india is doing some things right modi has restarted a privatization programme that s been dead for nearly two decades a white elephant like air india ltd may finally cease being a burden on the taxpayer legislation to make layoffs easier so that private firms will undertake labor intensive work is also welcome though the likes of bangladesh and vietnam have already stolen a march in textiles and electronics to reclaim the economic goals obscured by a fog of political nationalism finance minister nirmala sitharaman has to acknowledge that the fiscal deficit of the federal government is around 4 5 5 per cent of gdp nowhere close to the 3 3 per cent target for the financial year ending march 31 there s little chance of that happening gst letdown the 2017 goods and services tax has flopped pushing new delhi to incur more liabilities outside the budget for instance by dipping into people s post office savings for food subsidies without accepting that the gst needs an overhaul a fair share won t reach india s states and into the hands of people who can spend it but fixing the gst isn t something that can be done in the budget it will require a buy in from states that are being starved of resources with many of india s state governments virulently opposed to what they see as home minister amit shah s agenda of turning india into a hindu nation it s unclear if a coordinated effort to stabilize the rudderless economy is politically feasible equity markets may be chuffed if finance minister sitharaman does away with a tax on long term capital gains though i would be more keen to see a bold recapitalization of the broken shadow banking system an indian version of the us troubled asset relief program which floated the american economy through the 2008 financial crisis is needed as for generating resources in a weak economy a push to include indian government debt in global indexes is a good idea but foreigners will demand even more transparency than local investors telling them that the government s debt to gdp ratio currently 46 per cent will perhaps miss the 40 per cent target set for march 2025 by as many as five years could push borrowing costs higher and nudge the rupee lower
