another important dispatch from the greanville post be sure to share it widely what if tomorrow nobody but the unites states would use the us dollar every country or society would use their own currency for internal and international trade their own economy based non fiat currency it could be traditional currencies or new government controlled crypto currencies but a country s own sovereign money no longer the us dollar no longer the dollar s foster child the euro no longer international monetary transactions controlled by us banks and by the us dollar controlled international transfer system swift the system that allows and facilitates us financial and economic sanctions of all kinds confiscation of foreign funds stopping trades between countries blackmailing unwilling nations into submission what would happen well the short answer is that we would certainly be a step close to world peace away from us financial hegemony towards nation states sovereignty towards a world geopolitical structure of more equality we are not there yet but graffitis are all over the walls signaling that we are moving quite rapidly in that direction and trump knows it and his handlers know it which is why the onslaught of financial crime sanctions trade wars foreign assets and reserves confiscations or outright theft all in the name of make america great again is accelerating exponentially and with impunity what is surprising is that the anglo saxon hegemons do not seem to understand that all the threats sanctions trade barriers etc are provoking the contrary to what should contribute to american greatness economic sanctions in whatever form are effective only as long as the world uses the us dollar for trading and as reserve currency once the world gets sick and tired of the grotesque diktats of washington and the sanction schemes for those who do no longer want to go along with the oppressive rules of the us they will be eager to jump on another boat or boats abandoning the dollar and valuing their own currencies meaning trading with each other in their own currencies and that outside of the us banking system which so far even controls trading in local currencies as long as funds have to be transferred from one nation to another via swift many countries have also realized that the dollar is increasingly serving to manipulate the value of their economy the us dollar a fiat currency by its sheer money mass may bend national economies up or down depending in which direction the country is favored by the hegemon let s put the absurdity of this phenomenon in perspective today the dollar is based not even on hot air and is worth less than the paper it is printed on the us gdp is us 21 1 trillion in 2019 world bank estimate with current debt of 22 0 trillion or about 105 of gdp the world gdp is projected for 2019 at us 88 1 trillion world bank according to forbes about us 210 trillion are unfunded liabilities net present value of future projected but unfunded obligations 75 years mainly social security medicaid and accumulated interest on debt a figure about 10 times the us gdp or two and a half times the world s economic output this figure keeps growing as interest on debt is compounded forming part of what would be called in business terms debt service interest and debt amortization but is never paid back in addition there are about one to two quadrillion dollars nobody knows the exact amount of so called derivatives floating around the globe a derivative is a financial instrument which creates its value from the speculative difference of underlying assets most commonly derived from such inter banking and stock exchange oddities like futures options forwards and swaps this monstrous debt is partly owned in the form of treasury bonds as foreign exchange reserves by countries around the world the bulk of it is owed by the us to itself with no plans to ever pay it back but rather create more money more debt with which to pay for the non stop wars weapon manufacturing and lie propaganda to keep the populace quiet and in lockstep this amounts to a humongous worldwide dollar based pyramid system imagine this debt comes crashing down for example because one or several big wall street banks are on the brink of bankruptcy so they claim their outstanding derivatives paper gold another banking absurdity and other debt from smaller banks it would generate a chain reaction that might bring down the whole dollar dependent world economy it would create an exponential lehman brothers 2008 on global scale the world is increasingly aware of this real threat an economy built on a house of cards and countries want to get out of the trap out of the fangs of the us dollar it s not easy with all the dollar denominated reserves and assets invested abroad all over the globe a solution may be gradually divesting them us dollar liquidity and investments and moving into non dollar dependent currencies like the chinese yuan and the russian ruble or a basket of eastern currencies that are delinked from the dollar and its international payment scheme the swift system beware of the euro it s the foster child of the us dollar there are increasingly blockchain technology alternatives available china russia iran and venezuela are already experimenting with government controlled cryptocurrencies to build new payment and transfer systems outside the us dollar domain to circumvent sanctions india may or may not join this club whenever the modi government decides which way to bend east or west the logic would suggest that india orients herself to the east as india is a significant part of the huge eurasian economic market and landmass india is already an active member of the shanghai cooperation organization sco an association of countries that are developing peaceful strategies for trade monetary security and defense comprising china russia india pakistan most central asian countries and with iran waiting in the wings to become a full fledged member as such sco accounts for about half of the world population and a third of the world s economic output the east has no need for the west to survive no wonder that western media hardly mention the sco which means that the western average public at large has no clue what the sco stands for and who are its members government controlled and regulated blockchain technology may become key to counter us coercive financial power and to resist sanctions any country is welcome to join this new alliance of countries and new but fast growing approach to alternative trading and to finding back to national political and financial sovereignty in the same vein of dedollarization are indian barter banks they are for example trading indian tea for iranian oil such arrangements for goods to be exchanged against iranian petrol are carried out through indian barter banks where currencies i e iranian rials and indian rupees are handled by the same bank exchange of goods is based on a list of highest monetary volume indian trade items against iranian hydrocarbon products for example iran s large import of indian tea no monetary transaction takes place outside of india therefore us sanctions may be circumvented since no us bank or us treasury interference can stop the bilateral trade activities at this point it might be appropriate to mention facebook s attempt to introduce a globe spanning cryptocurrency the lira little is known on how exactly it will or may function except that it would cater to billions of facebook members around the world according to facebook there are 2 38 billion active members imagine if only two thirds about 1 6 billion opened a libra account with facebook the floodgate of libras around the world would be open libra is or would be a privately owned cryptocurrency and coming from facebook could be destined to replace the dollar by the same people who are now abusing the world with the us dollar it may be projected as the antidote to government controlled cryptocurrencies thus circumventing the impact of dedollarization beware of the libra despite us and eu sanctions german investments in russia are breaking a 10 year record in 2019 by german business pouring more than 1 7 billion into the russian economy in the first three months of 2019 according to the russian german chamber of commerce the volume of german companies investments in russia is up by 33 by 400 million since last year when total investments reached 3 2 billion the largest since 2008 despite sanctions which amounted to about 1 billion combined for 140 german companies surveyed and registered with the chamber of commerce and despite western anti russia pressure russia german trade has increased by 8 4 percent and reached nearly 62 billion in 2018 in addition notwithstanding us protests and threats with sanctions moscow and berlin continue their nord stream 2 natural gas pipeline project which is expected to be finished before the end of 2019 not only is the proximity of russian gas a natural and logical supply source for germany and europe it will also bring europe independence form the bullying sales methods of the united states and payments will not be made in us dollars in the long run the benefits of german russian business and economic relations will far outweigh the illegal us sanctions once this awareness has sunk in there is nothing to stop russian german business associations to flourish and to attract other eu russian business relations all outside of the dollar dominated banking and transfer system president trump s trade war with china will eventually also have a dedollarization effect as china will seek and already has acquired other trading partners mostly asian asian pacific and european with whom china will deal in other than dollar denominated contracts and outside the swift transfer system for example using the chinese international payment system cips which by the way is open for international trade by any country across the globe this will not only circumvent punishing tariffs on china s exports and make us customers of chinese goods furious as their chinese merchandise is no longer available at affordable prices or no longer available at all but this strategy will also enhance the chinese yuan on international markets and boost the yuan even further as a reliable reserve currency ever outranking the us dollar in fact in the last 20 years dollar denominated assets in international reserve coffers have declined from more than 90 to below 60 and will rapidly decline further as washington s coercive financial policies prevail dollar reserves are rapidly replaced by reserves in yuan and gold and that even in such staunch supporters of the west as is australia washington also has launched a counter productive financial war against turkey because turkey is associating and creating friendly relations with russia iran and china and foremost because turkey a nato stronghold is purchasing the russian s 400 cutting edge air defense system a new military alliance which the us cannot accept as a result the us is sabotaging the turkish currency the lira which has lost 40 since january 2018 turkey will certainly do whatever it can to get out from under the boot of the us dollar stranglehold and currency sanctions and further ally itself with the east this amounts to a double loss for the us turkey will most likely abandon all trading in us dollars and align her currency with for example the chinese yuan and the russian ruble and to the detriment of the atlantic alliance turkey may very likely exit nato abandoning nato will be a major disaster for the us as turkey is both strategically as well as in terms of nato military power one of the strongest if not the strongest nation of the 29 nato members outside of the us if turkey exits nato the entire european nato alliance will be shaken and questioned other countries long wary of nato and of storing nato s nuclear weapons on their soils especially italy and germany may also consider exiting nato in both germany and italy a majority of the people is against nato and especially against the pentagon waging wars form their nato bases in their territories in germany in italy to stem against this trend the former german defense minister ursula von der leyen from the conservative german cdu party is being groomed to become jean claude juncker s successor as president of the european commission mr juncker served since 2014 ms von der leyen was voted in tonight 17 july with a narrow margin of 9 votes she is a staunch supporter of nato her role is to keep nato as an integral part of the eu in fact as it stands today nato is running the eu this may change once people stand up against nato against the us vassal the eu administration in brussels and claim their democratic rights as citizens of their nation states europeans sense that these pentagon initiated and ongoing wars and conflicts supported by washington s european puppet allies may escalate into a nuclear war their countries nato bases will be the first ones to be targeted sinking europe for the 3rd time in 100 year into a world war however this one may be all destructive nuclear and nobody knows or is able to predict the damage and destruction of such a catastrophe nor the time of recovery of mother earth from an atomic calamity so let s hope turkey exits nato it would be giant step towards peace and a healthy answer to washington s blackmail and sabotage against turkey s currency the us currency sanctions are in the long run a blessing it gives turkey a good argument to abandon the us dollar and gradually shift towards association with eastern moneys mainly the chinese yuan thereby putting another nail in the us dollar s coffin however the hardest blow for washington will be when turkey exits nato such a move will come sooner or later notwithstanding ms von der leyen s battle cries for nato the breaking up of nato will annihilate the western power structure in europe and throughout the world where the us still maintains more than 800 military bases on the other hand the disbanding of nato will increase the world s security especially in europe for all the consequences such an exit will bear exiting nato and economically exiting the us dollar orbit is a further step towards dedollarization and a blow to us financial and military hegemony finally investments of the chinese belt and road initiative bri also called the new silk road will be mostly made in yuan and local currencies of the countries involved and incorporated in one or more of the several bri land and maritime routes that eventually will span the globe some us dollar investments may serve the people s bank of china china s central bank as a dollar divesting tool of china s huge dollar reserves which currently stands at close to two trillion dollars the bri promises to become the next economic revolution a non dollar economic development scheme over the coming decades maybe century connecting peoples and countries cultures research and teaching without however forcing uniformity but promoting cultural diversity and human equality and all of it outside the dollar dynasty breaking the nefarious dollar hegemony this is an article by contributing editor

many pakistanis see the terms of the 6 billion bailout package as a hostile takeover of their economy and government on july 3 the international monetary fund approved a 6 billion bailout package to help return sustainable growth to pakistan s economy throughout the deal spanning 39 months the imf will review pakistan s progress on a quarterly basis as part of the agreement 1 billion has been released to pakistan this is the 13th imf bailout for pakistan with the fund looking toward the correction of structural imbalances in the country in this regard the imf had announced in the negotiations over the past couple of months that islamabad would have to increase taxation in order to repay external debt and increase foreign exchange reserves details of the agreement reveal the targets that have been set for pakistan requiring the country to increase the foreign exchange reserves from the current 6 824 billion to 11 187 billion next year as a result the country s net reserves are expected to increase from negative 17 7 billion to negative 10 8 billion over the same period the imf has further asked pakistan to pay 37 359 billion in external debt within the duration of the imf bailout deal islamabad owes 14 682 billion of this figure to beijing largely due to the china pakistan economic corridor cpec the increase in taxation required by the imf was visible in this fiscal year s financial budget with the government increasing the federal board of revenue s fbr tax collection target from 3 94 trillion pakistani rupees 25 billion to 5 5 trillion rupees the documents further reveal that over the next two years of the bailout package additional 1 5 trillion rupee and 1 31 trillion rupee hikes in revenue collection have been scheduled even before the budget was passed the government had already implemented steps to enhance taxation with hikes in the price of petrol and electricity government officials confirm that further hikes are expected next month in addition to the heavy taxation another precondition of the imf bailout was the devaluation of the pakistani currency which the fund deemed to be artificially valued with the imf calling for a market determined value of the pakistani currency the rupee has lost over half its value since december 2017 resulting in the inflation rate reaching a five year high at 9 4 percent in april and expected to rise to over 13 percent as per the fund s forecast the all pakistan anjuman e tajran meaning trader s association calling a nationwide strike is one example of the impact that the rise in taxation has had on local industries as a result the working class in pakistan is rising up against what it calls the imf s imperialistic takeover of the country package is littered with conditionalities that are putting burden on the lives of ordinary people pakistani people and traders have no capacity to pay taxes demanded by the imf farooq tariq spokesperson and the former general secretary of the awami workers party told the diplomat as part of the package the imf installed its own intelligent people on key posts not only does it serve the imf s purpose of increasing its stranglehold over the country it reflects a total lack of confidence in pti s capacity to do the job tariq added pti refers to pakistan tehreek e insaf the current ruling party of the country multiple interviews with officials in the finance ministry reveal that the appointments of former imf mission chief reza baqir as the governor of the state bank of pakistan and former finance minister abdul hafeez shaikh as the prime minister s adviser on finance were enforced by the imf in the lead up to the bailout agreement when asked a senior government official told the diplomat that the imf forced the issue to install its own men amid continued deadlock with former finance minister asad umar the imf s pressure further escalated after it was revealed that the entirety of the loan pakistan received from saudi arabia and the uae at the turn of the year was spent to prevent the currency market from crashing senior financial journalist and analyst at fx empire shahab jafry questions the manner in which the imf has forced the government to manage the local currency s valuation the currency market was going haywire and you had to dump the dollar to buy the rupees to support the local currency the government says it is letting the rupee free float it can t let that happen the country will collapse in 48 hours he told the diplomat the currency has an annual 5 percent depreciation against the dollar i don t see the rupee stabilizing because i don t see the economy stabilizing in the modern day in competitive floating currencies you have to have a very strong export revenue generation to have a stable currency or oil reserves because you are prone to imports and the fluctuation of commodities and currencies can crash markets jafry added observers note the usual imf pattern in its current dealings with pakistan with the fund employing trusted people in countries where there is large scale misappropriation of funds obtained from international institutions abdul hafeez shaikh the pm s financial adviser was also part of the team that negotiated the 11th bailout package with the imf as the finance minister during the pakistan people s party ppp rule from 2008 to 2013 last month an entire inquiry commission was formed to probe the alleged corrupt practices of the ppp and the pakistan muslim league nawaz over the past decade while many see it as an attempt to audit the funding received in the past others see it as a maneuver led by the current ruling party the pti to victimize its political opponents with the help of the pakistan army farooq tariq maintains that the military establishment has had a role to play in the aggravation of the economy and the pti isn t the first party to seek the army s help in maintaining the vicious circle of debt for pakistan pakistan goes to the imf every few years because of its ruling political parties inability to run the economy the reason is very simple military and debt expenses both take up over half of the national budget at present the successive governments have bowed down to the pressures of the generals and the creditors not to reduce these two unproductive expenditures he said where the army bolsters particular parties to safeguard its economic interests the imf wants pakistan to pursue certain geopolitical interests for many the bailout agreement reveals that instead of economic reforms geostrategic interests are at the heart of the deal the imf package is a straitjacket for pakistan s economy the imf document illustrates a very simplistic thought process economist and political scientist farrukh saleem the pti government s former spokesperson on energy and economy told the diplomat they say the budget deficit is extremely high the solution is to increase the revenue by 45 percent how exactly it s a shrinking economy similarly they say the trade deficit is extremely high and then devalue the rupee the imf isn t trying to solve pakistan s problems at all the package has zero reforms be it power budget deficit or trade deficit after all the imf is not a purely economic institute it s a political institute as well saleem added the former spokesperson maintains that the imf is advancing u s security interests in the region by using the bailout package to ensure islamabad s compliance he refers to this year s wikileaks document army special operations forces unconventional warfare originally written in september 2008 as evidence of how the imf and world bank are used to serve u s regional goals lieutenant general talat masood former secretary of pakistan s ministry of defense production says there are obvious u s goals that the imf is looking to fulfill they would like to control our nuclear development they don t want us to spend on conventional forces and try to match india they want us to focus on the economy they don t want us to use lashkar e taiba and others to destabilize india and afghanistan also cpec and our relationship with china is too strong for their liking they want us to contribute significantly in the afghan peace process by pushing the taliban masood told the diplomat masood believes the recent arrest of let chief hafiz saeed in the lead up to prime minister imran khan s visit to the united states underlines that islamabad has succumbed to the american demands but masood is also critical of pakistan s own policymaking which renders it vulnerable to external pressure pakistan s policies are so shallow and aren t based on any foundational principles and hence can t be defended it s a weakness of policy and the internal structure of pakistan that they have to succumb to external pressure he adds

what everyone most feared was a relapse it would have been one more tragedy piled up on top of the biggest tragedy in human history in designing the bretton woods system seventy five years ago many were very much afraid that it hadn t gone far enough once the war ended world war ii the us in particular might fall back into depression then what it may sound absurd today at the time the possibility was taken very seriously more outside of the us than inside quite a few economists and politicians warned that when war spending stopped just as america s victorious legions came back home the economy waiting for them would be too much like the depression they had left behind when they first went off to fight there was some very influential policymakers believed more than a small risk of it tearing the new monetary system apart and therefore redoing 1929 all over again the entire purpose of bretton woods had been to avoid just that fate in the final agreement in the form of the joint statement of experts on the establishment of an international monetary fund a clause was inserted in case the world might run short of dollars a us depression could in theory starve the rest of the world of needed currency as edward bernstein recalled four decades later this would allow other countries to impose discriminatory restrictions against the united states if the dollar holdings of the fund became scarce because of a large and persistent us surplus as a result of a depression in the united states edward m bernstein had received his phd in economics from harvard in 1931 just as the great depression was at its worst spending the rest of the decade teaching in 1940 he was given a job as the treasury department s principal economist working closely with harry dexter white during the early war years when it came time for bretton woods bernstein was made the us delegation s chief technical advisor in that position dr bernstein had a large hand in designing the imf he said that the novelty of the fund which came out of bretton woods one that didn t include john maynard keynes supranational currency bancor was that it was like a gold standard but not so rigid as the classical system had been there had to be some flexibility built into it somewhere recalling one of the chief elements of failure and monetary contagion following the 1929 crash the deflationary effects of gold settlements could be avoided if surplus countries acquired foreign currencies rather than gold no less than international currency elasticity that s how the world would avoid any kind of global currency shortage which of course gold adherents would argue was entirely the point of the classical gold standard there should be limits to currency fiat especially not all currency is fiat to many classicists the great depression was more about the twenties as a whole than just 1929 but are the monetary factors the same when superimposed upon international trade and capital flows that was to keynes the beauty ofbancor it would be separate from what today we regularly call everything bubbles this international currency wouldn t be a store of value merely the medium of exchange whose entire purpose was to facilitate the spread of trade this is why in a letter written to dr bernstein following bretton woods lord keynes remarked i should like to see the board of the fund composed of cautious bankers and the board of the bank of imaginative expansionists recounting the letter thirty nine years later dr bernstein clarified keynes was talking about the bankers of 1945 not those of 1983 what had changed about bankers you ask for one thing those in the later group would have laughed at the very idea of a us current account surplus what had come to define bretton woods ragged end was the persisting opposite condition there had been no depression in 1946 for several reasons chief among them how the new monetary order had worked enough to stabilize the global monetary system so that a truly global economy absolutely starving for prosperity could be unleashed and unleashed it had been which required a ton of monetary resources to the bankers of 1983 the spread of those resources was quite different than what keynes harry white or edward bernstein had ever imagined that doesn t necessarily make it a bad thing indeed bretton woods itself lasted a scant sixteen years dr bernstein in 1983 regretted how it was coming apart as early as 1957 the system broke down after 1957 but not because the united states failed to maintain stability of prices and costs in fact the 1958 65 period may have been the most stable in our history the system s flaws lay in the system s success a contradiction no one had anticipated later to be called triffin s paradox especially foreign economists in 1944 who were worried about a new us depression hoarding dollars from the rest of the world the world simply needed dollars and more of them some amount of elasticity in what did become the global medium of exchange the gold adherents were also right in that there could also be too much currency thus the great inflation of the seventies but it wasn t governments who set the transition from bretton woods to the next global standard there s been endless talk and scholarship about the seventies a lot written about the smithsonian agreement and whatnot but it was the bankers who created the succeeding form of international exchange unlike 1944 it happened organically without any organized mission economist paul samuelson in april 1971 called it the doctrine of benign neglect in other words politicians had lost out on the purpose of international monetary arrangements in this brave new global world they either didn t know what to do or were too paralyzed by politics to do anything they knew something needed to be changed without realizing that what was necessary was already changing into that vacuum flowed the international banker there was no need for governments to do much of anything except recognize what had already become reality the official end of bretton woods nixon s closing of the gold window in 1971 was mere formality all the functions and purposes of international exchange had already been absorbed under cover of benign neglect by the credit based currency of bankers the eurodollar in this system where bank balance sheets are supreme and the international medium of exchange is whatever liability one bank can get another bank to accept geography no longer matters the allure of keynes bancor was that it would operate separately in between competing governments the eurodollar would exist separated from everything offshore and interbank this flexibility unlocked massive potential qualitative possibilities before quantitative expansion what robert roosa in 1984 at bretton woods called new networks of interbank relations it would be left to alan greenspan in june 2000 alarmed about those very proliferation of products whose products bankers my purpose here is not chastise them or to trade in conspiracies about wall street in thinking about how to get out of the mess that s been left to us by an unbroken doctrine of benign neglect for authorities did not stop neglecting we must first recognize what we have regardless of how anyone feels about it this is a credit based system that you can t just cast aside on a whim no matter how forcefully anyone might wish to that s really the only thing left of bretton woods successor the lack of any alternative not that anyone isn t desperately searching for one china s top central banker zhou xiaochuan all the way back in march 2009 at the bottom of the somehow global financial crisis lodged the first official protest he was also one of the very few to recognize this primary aspect the outbreak of the current crisis and its spillover in the world have confronted us with a long existing but still unanswered question i e what kind of international reserve currency do we need to secure global financial stability and facilitate world economic growth which was one of the purposes for establishing the imf the acceptance of credit based national currencies as major international reserve currencies as is the case in the current system is a rare special case in history what the pboc governor got right was credit based overshadowed by what he got wrong the latter being what led to such vehement counter protest the eurodollar is no one s national currency the primacy of a credit based system is an architectural challenge not a political question and certainly it should never be made into a partisan one i ll give you a recent example to show you what i mean in november 2014 the federal reserve convened what it called the alternative reference rates committee arrc as its name implies its task was to come up with something to replace the current reference rate libor as the world s benchmark hundreds of trillions in notional derivatives as well as trillions in debt are priced based on what some might call a fantasy a panel of banks in the british bankers association comes up with a rate of interest at which they d lend unsecured money to other banks if ever asked to that s what libor is it isn t based on actual transactions and because of the scandals surrounding it one of the most important numbers in all the world has been made suspect on june 22 2017 the arrc settled upon sofr the standard overnight financing rate as libor s replacement this official alternative would be calculated by the federal reserve bank of new york starting in april 2018 taking within it data collected mostly in the domestic repo market private tri party gc transactions placed through bank of new york mellon treasury gc tri party run through ficc and any bilateral exchanges settled dvp cleared via ficc it would be a more robust and reality based alternative one grounded in repo by the hundreds of billions in daily volume setting aside frbny s embarrassing launch of sofr the branch messed up the initial calculations april 2 to april 12 which had to be later restated this sanctioned alternative has gained little traction according to the cme group the chicago based derivatives exchanges sofr futures in june 2019 averaged 145 179 contracts open interest that was up 1 053 5 from open interest in june 2018 when there had been 12 586 contracts it may sound impressive until you see how over in eurodollar futures by contrast there was 12 8 million open on average last month there were 13 9 million last june in february 2017 there were about 12 5 million at the end of 2013 10 6 million those 12 8 million eurodollar futures contracts represent 12 8 trillionnotional delivery of eurodollar deposits priced based on 3 month libor global banks and investors just aren t giving up on this interbank scheme no matter how many times authorities nudge them the london interbank offered rate may be fictional but the one thing it has going for it is it is in the exact right place london dollars not new york eurodollar futures and libor pertain the global currency whereas sofr is only domestic repo it seems as if the hierarchy should be reversed admittedly there are links between money markets but these aren t what they used to be leaving sofr and libor dealing with somewhat different circumstances the government isn t mandating the one over the other yet but regulators have made very clear they expect a determined migration from the outset it has largely been ignored the uk s bank regulator the financial conduct authority concurrently announced in 2017 that it had secured commitments to continue the voluntary submissions required to calculate libor through 2021 speaking for the fca chief executive andrew bailey said the fca had spoken to all the current panel banks about agreeing voluntarily to sustain libor until end 2021 adding here has been wide support from the panel banks for sustaining libor for this period this isn t a matter of fat dumb and happy bankers resisting getting with the program for no good reason there are serious operational considerations that relate to eurodollar as opposed to dollar there s an unthinkably complex and consuming infrastructure that makes up credit based money then a whole lot more putting it offshore it doesn t just get switched on and off by fiat pun intended this is what the de dollar protesters never consider even if zhou xiaochuan did if regulators run into such reluctance for just a reference and benchmark pricing rate how does anyone think they are going to replace the eurodollar as world reserve currency americans see this as an unwarranted intrusion upon their sovereignty that ship sailed in 1944 the door held wide open by benign neglect in early 2018 the international press was abuzz about the so called petroyuan the launch of commodity derivatives pricing crude oil in chinese renminbi the chinese would undermine the us dollar and do it through opec a flood of stories appeared declaring the petrodollar s day as done the chinese weren t attempting to replace the dollar merely to alleviate some of the oppressive pressures of the eurodollar indeed they are no closer because the petrodollar isn t a real thing the eurodollar is because that s what all the banks use you don t replace the dollar by replacing the eurodollar you have to replace the way bankers do things in a way as the sofr mess implies it has a stranglehold on them too john maynard keynes had famously objected to bretton woods being called a gold standard standing before the house of lords keynes had declared the early imf its very opposite that certainly overstates the matter as ed bernstein said it wasn t going to be the same it couldn t be since fdr s executive order 6102 but it also wasn t that different which is why there had been such a seamless transition into this new and initially prosperous world order they at least started out knowing something about the system they were trying to change whether cryptocurrency or sofr petroyuan and audit the fed there is actually quite a bit of appetite for doing money differently so many are dissatisfied though they can t quite put their finger on exactly why and for exactly what even trade protectionism populism renewed interest in socialism these are all symptoms of the same disease things have come full circle anyway sort of faced again with the prospects for an international currency shortage seventy five years later it will do no good to sanction the united states for a global lack of dollars it doesn t have them either just check the most recent sofr calculation
john bellamy foster is the editor of monthly review i am concerned with power politics that is to say i make use of all means that seem to me to be of service without the slightest concern for the proprieties or for codes of honor adolf hitler1 the rise of donald trump to president of the united states is commonly thought to represent the triumph of right wing populism or simply populism 2 the term populism is notoriously difficult to define since lacking any definite substantive content it is used in the dominant discourse to refer to any movement that appeals to the people while attacking the elites 3 in the united states populism has a much older history associated with the great agrarian revolt of the late nineteenth century 4 but today the concept primarily has to do with the growth in europe and more recently in the united states of so called right wing populism and only secondarily with what are labeled left wing populist movements such as syriza in greece podemos in spain or occupy in the united states right wing populism is a euphemism introduced into the european discussion in the last few decades to refer to movements in the fascist genus fascism neofascism post fascism characterized by virulently xenophobic ultra nationalist tendencies rooted primarily in the lower middle class and relatively privileged sections of the working class in alliance with monopolistic capital 5 this can be seen in the national front in france the northern league in italy the party for freedom in the netherlands the uk independence party the sweden democrats and similar parties and movements in other advanced capitalist countries 6 the same basic phenomenon has now triumphed in the united states in the form of trump s rise to chief executive yet mainstream commentary has generally avoided the question of fascism or neofascism in this context preferring instead to apply the vaguer safer notion of populism this is not just because of the horrific images of nazi germany and the holocaust that the term fascist evokes or because it has been increasingly used as an all purpose term of political abuse rather the liberal mainstream s aversion to the neofascist designation arises principally from the critique of capitalism that any serious engagement with this political phenomenon would entail as bertolt brecht asked in 1935 how can anyone tell the truth about fascism unless he is willing to speak out against capitalism which brings it forth 7 in today s political context it is crucial to understand not only how the failures of neoliberalism give rise to neofascism but also to connect these developments to the structural crisis of monopoly finance capital that is to the regime of concentrated financialized and globalized capitalism only based on such a thoroughgoing historical critique is it possible to conceive the necessary forms of resistance the cloak of populism the notion of right wing populism is employed in liberal discourse as a mildly negative epithet one that both decries this tendency and at the same time offers it a cloak by setting aside the whole question of fascism neofascism this reflects the ruling class s ambiguous relation to the radical right which for all its supposed radicalism is recognized as fully compatible with capitalism indeed the forces of the neofascist right while still regarded warily by global elites have been systematically de demonized in much of europe and are often seen as acceptable partners in a center right or right center government 8 the trump phenomenon is now undergoing a comparable assimilation historians federico finchelstein and pablo piccato wrote in a recent washington post op ed that racism and charismatic leadership bring trump close to the fascist equation but he might be better described as post fascist which is to say populist modern populism arose from the defeat of fascism as a novel post fascist attempt to bring back the fascist experience to the democratic path creating in turn an authoritarian form of democracy other mainstream commentators are even more allergic to any association of the trump phenomenon with fascism thus vox writer dylan matthews insists trump is not a fascist he s a right wing populist most commentators deftly avoid the question altogether for new york times columnist thomas edsall trump represents the ascendance of right wing populism in america plain and simple 9 the hegemonic liberal approach to these issues is deeply rooted in transformations in political theory that go back to the cold war populism as a political rubric is seen as conforming to the coordinates of the theory of totalitarianism as propounded most famously by hannah arendt in this view all forms of opposition to the liberal democratic management of capitalist society from whichever direction they come are to be viewed as illiberal totalitarian tendencies and are all the more dangerous if they have mass based roots society is thus only democratic to the extent that it is restricted to liberal democracy which confines the rights and protections of individuals to those limited forms conducive to a structurally inegalitarian capitalist regime rooted in private property such a society as marxist economists paul baran and paul sweezy wrote in monopoly capital is democratic in form and plutocratic in content 10 within this dominant possessive individualist perspective populism has therefore come to mean all movements with any popular appeal that challenge the prevailing liberal democratic state apparatus in advanced capitalist societies a major ideological shift occurred with the fall of the soviet union in 1991 leading to the almost universal acceptance of the liberal democratic state as the sole bulwark against totalitarianism and evil a view associated in particular with arendt as slavoj žižek writes in did somebody say totalitarianism the elevation of hannah arendt into an untouchable authority is perhaps the clearest sign of the theoretical defeat of the left of how the left has accepted the basic coordinates of liberal democracy democracy versus totalitarianism etc and is now trying to redefine its op position within this space throughout its entire career totalitarianism was an ideological notion that sustained the complex operation of taming free radicals of guaranteeing the liberal democratic hegemony dismissing the leftist critique of liberal democracy as the obverse the twin of the rightist fascist dictatorship and it is useless to try to redeem totalitarianism through division into subcategories emphasizing the difference between the fascist and communist variety the moment one accepts the notion of totalitarianism one is firmly located within the liberal democratic horizon the contention is that the notion of totalitarianism far from being an effective theoretical concept is a kind of stopgap instead of enabling us to think forcing us to acquire a new insight into the historical reality it describes it relieves us of the duty to think or even actively prevents us from thinking 11 today s conventional use of the term populism derives directly from this same liberal democratic horizon 12 populism is seen as representing incipient anti democratic dictatorial and even totalitarian tendencies to be found on both right and left insofar as they oppose liberal democracy jan werner müller answers the question what is populism raised in the title of his book by calling populism a danger to democracy it can be described as the permanent shadow of representative politics likewise cas mudde and cristóbal kaltwasser state in their populism a very short introduction theoretically populism is most fundamentally juxtaposed to liberal democracy populists are thus seen as tending toward extremism precisely in their opposition to the liberal democratic state that has traditionally dominated in capitalist society 13 nearly every substantive issue is lost in this definition of populism most notably the quite different ways in which left and right revolts occur their distinct class ideological bases and their divergent indeed incompatible objectives fascism is the antonym of liberal democracy within a capitalist society its advocates wish to replace liberal democracy with a different form of management of the capitalist system removing basic civil rights and limits on executive power strengthening the repressive apparatus to weaken working class organization and adopting ethno nationalist forms of social exclusion in contrast socialism is the antonym not of the liberal democratic state but of capitalism itself socialists seek to replace capitalism with an entirely different mode of production based on both substantive equality and substantive democracy 14 nevertheless faced with a resurgence of fascist tendencies in western societies many on the left have chosen perhaps only for the sake of convenience to join the arendtian consensus hence populism is portrayed even by leading analysts on the left as an incoherent and irrational attack on elites born of anti democratic and totalitarian tendencies acceptance of this view marks a significant political and ideological retreat ceding the terms and direction of the debate to the interests of the liberal democratic establishment commenting on the hegemonic framing of the radical right as populist and the analytical problems that it presents andrea mammone observes in his transnational neofascism in france and italy that the terms populism and national populism were deliberately introduced in recent decades by liberal european commentators in order to replace fascism neofascism as the used terminology this move was designed to provide a sort of political and democratic legitimization of right wing extremism moreover the rechristening of such movements as populist mammone argues had less to do with any aspect of the movements themselves than with the presumption that liberal democratic institutions were now too solid to permit an actual neofascist takeover instead these neofascist forces were increasingly seen as politically malleable with a potentially useful role in stabilizing capitalist society checkmating the left 15 likewise political scientist walter laquer notes that use of the term populist generates nothing but great fuzziness and requires subcategories to distinguish left from right it is particularly misleading he argues with respect to the right wing movements to which the term is most often applied hence laquer prefers to use neofascism for what is variously called right wing extremism right wing radicalism radical right wing populism national populism all terms that he finds unsatisfactory in addressing a historically specific political tendency within the larger fascist genus 16 given this complex and contested ideological context it is all the more important to acknowledge those notable radical commentators including judith butler noam chomsky juan cole henry giroux paul street and cornel west who have rejected the populist designation for the trump phenomenon and see it as part of a larger neofascist wind disrupting advanced capitalist states nor is this a minor issue at stake is nothing less than the left s understanding of and response to an ascendant transnational neofascist movement in europe and the united states in the context of a deepening economic and political crisis 17 political movements within the fascist genus have their mass basis in the lower middle class or petty bourgeoisie overlapping with the more privileged sections of the working class the lower middle class in the united states today comprises close to a third of the u s population its representative members are lower level managers semiprofessionals craftsmen foremen and non retail sales workers with household incomes typically running around 70 000 a year 18 it is from this stratum and from some workers in blue collar industries especially in rural areas as well as from owners of small businesses and corporate franchises that trump has drawn his most ardent support 19 in this respect the lower middle class can be understood as what c wright mills called the rearguarders of the capitalist system in times of crisis this class often gives rise to a radical petty bourgeois ideology divorced from both more traditional working class and liberal views one that criticizes crony capitalists and government elites while at the same time allying itself with giant corporations and the ultra rich against an often racialized other namely low income people of color immigrants and the working poor 20 more privileged than the increasingly precarious majority of the working class but denied the security and wealth of the upper middle class this section of the population is the one most prone to intense nationalism and racism calling for the revival of lost values and traditions or palingenetic ultra nationalism palingenesis means rebirth ultimately however the neofascist project like classical fascism before it relies on an alliance of the lower middle class with monopoly finance capital leading ultimately to the betrayal of the movement s mass base 21 a legal revolution the sheer elasticity of the vague concept of populism is evident in the fact that hitler and the nazi party are often cited as examples of this phenomeon 22 classical fascism was a complex political formation that despite the violence associated with its rise has often been described as the result of a legal revolution both mussolini in italy and hitler in germany sought to carry out their political revolutions within and through the capitalist state apparatus maintaining at least a semblance of the constitutionality needed to stabilize and legitimate the new order indeed the dominant image of fascism projected by the movement itself was of an organized capitalism under a centralized total state referring to the concentration of power within the state and a new racialized vision of national sovereignty 23 in his legality oath at the 1930 leipzig reichswehr trial hitler told the court the constitution only maps out the arena of battle not the goal we enter the legal agencies and in that way will make our party the determining factor however once we possess the constitutional power we will mold the state into the shape we hold to be suitable hitler rose to power not by abolishing the weimar constitution but rather as historian karl bracher explained through the erosion and abrogation of its substance by constitutional means 24 by november 1932 it was clear that the nazi party could not win a majority of the parliamentary seats hitler however would find another way to power through his appointment as chancellor once at the helm hitler moved quickly to invoke article 48 of the weimar constitution which authorized the executive together with the army to claim emergency powers and enact any measures deemed necessary to restore public order originally intended as a safeguard against the left this meant that the executive was free to act independently of the parliament promulgating laws on its own and suspending civil liberties with the setting of the reichstag fire at the end of february 1933 a month after he was sworn in as chancellor hitler was able to wield article 48 thereby concentrating power in the executive this was soon followed by the enabling act the law to eliminate peril to nation and reich which further eroded the separation of powers 25 however the transition to full power and the consolidation of the third reich required a process of gleichschaltung or bringing into line over the course of 1933 34 during which most other branches of the state and civil society were incorporated into the new nazi order largely voluntarily but under a growing terror regime it is important to recognize that all of this was given legal form as was fascist management of the state in general historian nikolaus wachsmann notes that far from renouncing the law or the judiciary the nazi state imposed a system of legal terror the third reich did not become an all out police state leading nazis occasionally even made public gestures of support for the legal system at least in the early years of the dictatorship hitler himself publicly promised in his speech on 23 march 1933 that the german judges were irremovable at the same time though he also expected the legal system to fall into line with his general wishes demanding elasticity in sentencing crucially hitler and other senior nazis stressed that judges were ultimately answerable to the national community not to abstract legal principles the only guideline for judges it was said was the welfare of the german people and the mythical will of the national community was frequently invoked to justify brutal punishment that this will was in reality nothing more than the will of the nazi leaders or more precisely hitler s own was not seen as a contradiction the legal apparatus was an essential element of nazi terror it played a central role in the criminalisation of political dissent and the politicisation of common crime trials were not completely hidden from the public on the contrary the nazi media were full of news about court cases and sentences 26 hitler explicitly refused to set aside the weimar constitution and codify his new order arguing that justice is a means of ruling justice is the codified practice of ruling a new constitution would therefore be premature and would only weaken the revolution eventually of course the gleichschaltung process was complete and the identification of the führer with the law was absolute under the resulting führerprinzip as the nazi jurist carl schmitt wrote the führer safeguards the reich 27 similarly mussolini s defenders always insisted in the words of italian fascist julius evola that il duce did not seize power but received it from the king and under the conformist institutional garb of entrusting the government to him there was the equivalent of a sort of completely legal investiture 28 fascist propaganda strained to give to mussolini s dictatorship the trappings of constitutionalism as if the october 1922 march on rome had never taken place this appearance of legality was only made possible by the support of the capitalist class and the military as well as the broader political right the elaborate performance of constitutional order continued even as systematic repression and authoritarianism deepened a defining feature of fascism was its continuation of the capitalist separation of state and economy even as the role of the state was transformed the very notion of the privatization of the economy now associated with neoliberalism was a nazi invention reflecting the third reich s massive denationalization of industry in sectors such as steel mining shipbuilding and banking 29 command of industry and finance was returned to capital the nazi state strongly favored economic concentration passing legislation designed to promote cartels tax policy likewise favored the capitalist class tax increases were levied primarily upon non business taxpayers in the population the tax burden was thus enlarged for wage earners and consumer groups in general 30 and while hitler s concern to protect big business and private property did not prevent him from encouraging embezzlement and corruption among his associates in general private property at least for racially pure germans and the institutions of capitalism remained sacrosanct 31 at the same time fascist regimes in both italy and germany were known for supporting and even expanding the welfare state albeit with racial exclusions social provision grew enormously under mussolini garnering global praise in germany the welfare state was a cornerstone of the regime as historian sheri berman writes the nazis supported an extensive welfare state of course for ethnically pure germans it included free higher education family and child support pensions health insurance and an array of publicly supported entertainment and vacation options economic expansion driven by demand generated through spending on infrastructure and the military ensured full employment even as unions were abolished and wages repressed the number of unemployed fell from almost 6 million in 1933 when hitler came to power to 2 4 million at the end of 1934 when he was to consolidate his power as führer by 1938 germany had effectively achieved full employment while most other capitalist countries were still mired in the great depression the unemployment rate in the united states that year was 19 percent 32 none of this is to deny the deeply repressive character of the fascist state its abrogation of human rights its militarism imperialism and racism 33 yet at the same time the classical fascist state sought to legitimate itself and consolidate its position with the population or that part of the population that it considered its mass base once in power however fascist states purged many of their more radical followers as in the night of the long knives june 30 to july 2 1934 in hitler s germany in the process of linking up more firmly with monopoly capital today s neofascism builds on these earlier fascist myths of the legal revolution along with the notion of a more organized efficient capitalist state able to transcend the liberal democratic impasse it promises both policies of ethno national exclusion and of revitalized economic growth and employment through infrastructure spending and military expansion at the same time it is often less inclined than the traditional right to attack the welfare state or to promote austerity in france marine le pen s national front has recently tried to remake itself as a more broadly anti establishment party exploiting popular discontent to attract a wider range of supporters including some who formerly identified with the left despite this cynical rebranding the party s politics of petty bourgeois resentment reactionary catholicism and virulent xenophobia together with its link to the upper echelons of the capitalist class mark it as neofascist 34 like the classical fascism of italy and germany in the 1920s and 30s neofascism arises from interrelated crises of capitalism and the liberal democratic state undermining the latter while seeking to shore up the former given that explicit identification with classical fascism remains taboo in mainstream politics organized neofascism today is presented as formally democratic and populist adhering to legal constitutional structures nevertheless like all movements in the fascist genus neofascist ideology combines racist nationalist and culturalist myths with economic and political proposals aimed primarily at the lower middle class or petty bourgeoisie in alliance with monopoly capital while also seeking to integrate nationalistic working class supporters and rural populations increasingly neofascism draws support from relatively privileged wage workers that in the late twentieth century enjoyed a degree of prosperity and status but who now find their living conditions imperiled in the stagnating advanced capitalist economy of the early twenty first century 35 the single most important ideological figure in the growth of neofascism in europe in the post second world war years and in the promotion of its distinct cultural perspective was the italian philosopher julius evola 1898 1974 as laquer has observed evola was at the extreme wing of historical fascism influencing mussolini with respect to race and racism and later turning to hitler as a more authentic representative of the fascist project significantly evola was present at hitler s general headquarters in 1943 on the very day when the waffen ss troops were to bring mussolini there following their rescue of him from imprisonment in italy after he had been deposed in the 1930s evola wrote everything that is heroism and the dignity of the warrior in our conception must be considered justified from a higher point of view in the same way that we have to oppose with complete precision and on all levels everything that is a democratic and levelling disorder 36 evola was known for his virulent anti semitism even by the standards of the time he frequently criticized fascism for not being pure enough following the second world war evola was to develop a set of neofascist theoretical works under the mantle of traditionalism including postwar editions of his fascist treatise revolt against the modern world 1934 as well as such works as men among the ruins 1953 ride the tiger 1961 the path of cinnabar 1963 and fascism viewed from the right 1970 the fascism of italy and germany in the 1920s and 1930s he argued needed to be defended in its positive aspects and separated from the specific mistakes that hitler and mussolini made that led to its defeat in the second world war as evola scholar h t hansen put it in his introduction to men among the ruins evola came to be viewed as the spiritual father of a group of radical neofascists in the broad sense of the word often under the innocuous rubric of traditionalism giorgio almirante party chairman of the msi movimento sociale italiano heir to the old fascist party called evola the marcuse of the right only better 37 evola s cultural analysis emphasized the values of tradition spiritualism idealism hierarchy and counterrevolution and pointed to the need for a new warrior class 38he wrote in ride the tiger when material incentives don t suffice the only influence over the masses today and now even more than ever is on the plane of impassioned and subintellectual forces which by their very nature lack any stability these are the forces that demagogues popular leaders manipulators of myths and fabricators of public opinion count on in this regard we can learn from yesterday s regimes in germany and italy that positioned themselves against democracy and marxism 39 the pure fascist or neofascist state would be organized around superior elite racial stocks divesting itself of inferior races aryanism needed to be interpreted not as related simply to the germanic stock but in a way that encompassed europeans more broadly or at least the aryan roman race 40 evola also wrote of the decadence of modern woman and the feminist idiocy the revolt against the modern world included a revolt against science none of modern science he stated has the slightest value as knowledge 41 although evola had no economic analysis to speak of he insisted that the state of the new fascist era like that of the old should be based on private property and corporatism with the destruction of any autonomous working class organizations the state though should retain its relative autonomy securing the entire system from above through its monopoly of the use of force sovereignty viewed in palingenetic ultra nationalistic and authoritarian terms needed to be absolute 42 evola and other neofascist thinkers such as the influential french theorist alain de benoist created the ideological foundations for the transnational neofascist movement that emerged in europe beginning in the 1970s and later spread to the united states the movement was to gain a mass following as a result of the increasing economic stagnation in the advanced capitalist world and has grown by leaps and bounds since the great financial crisis of 2007 09 nevertheless the organizational roots of many of these developments were formed in europe in the 1970s this can be seen for example in the formation of what were called hobbit camps for neofascist youth in italy named after the creatures in j r r tolkien s novels with the notion of hobbits standing for the lower middle class the largely forgotten population who were rising up to transform the world this same idea was later to catch on with the alt right in the united states 43 a key figure today in what mammone calls the transnational neofascist movement is the russian philosopher aleksandr dugin who has built his fourth political theory on evola s ideas as well as those of schmitt de benoist and the german philosopher martin heidegger attracting the favorable attention of the u s alt right 44 trump and the neofascist alliance ironically it is in the united states where there are no neofascist parties of any electoral standing that the radical right has enjoyed its greatest victory so far from the republican primaries to his defeat of hillary clinton in the electoral college trump s path to the white house depended on his appeal to the lower middle class and parts of the white working class as well as rural and evangelical christian voters at every turn trump s campaign flouted convention and propriety instead exploiting evola s impassioned and subintellectual forces a key source of trump s success was his connection to the alt right in particular breitbart news and its ceo steve bannon who became trump s campaign manager channeling the radical right s contempt for the political establishment the bannon breitbart strategy spoke to the fears and resentments of a decisive section of the lower middle and working classes with bannon s help trump also attracted the strategic support of certain powerful members of the capitalist class particularly the silicon valley tycoon peter thiel and the billionaire hedge fund mogul robert mercer and his daughter rebekah 45 trump s quintessentially neofascist strategy of enlisting mass support through racist and nativist appeals to lower middle class insecurities while allying with core elements of the ruling class has sown confusion in elite political circles and the corporate media lacking any historical or class references mainstream pundits saw his campaign as a confused hybrid of right and left some otherwise astute analysts on the left portrayed him as a centrist while still others insisted that he had no principles or plan at all that his chaotic campaign was governed only by the candidate s egoistic impulses 46 nevertheless what should be clear at this point is that the trump administration came into office with what can only be called a neofascist political project trump s domestic agenda reflected the class alliances and subintellectual ideology that brought him to power in addition to the well known muslim ban and the proposed wall along the u s mexico border the trump administration has pressed for deconstruction of the administrative state as bannon was to call it the gutting of the environmental protections and scientific agencies the elimination of most federal regulations on business a trillion dollar increase in infrastructure spending privatization of education a huge rise in military spending the effective elimination of obamacare the end of net neutrality and steep cuts to taxes on corporations and the rich trump has filled his cabinet and advisory positions with a ghoulish ensemble of billionaires wall street insiders hardline generals alt right ideologues and climate change deniers 47 although it is true that the administration s early months were marked by fierce battles inside the west wing between alt right true believers and more moderate plutocratic interests these conflicts only reflected the inherent contradictions in the neofascist alliance that has defined the trump white house the representatives of the alt right are preoccupied with pure power politics and with bringing the federal branches and bureaucracies into line while the plutocrats trump s real constituency appear to be steering the administration toward a newly unfettered form of corporate oligarchy 48 the symbolic rivals in this factional struggle are bannon the alt right firebreather who stands for trump s base though he is himself an alumnus of goldman sachs and a consummate elite insider and trump s son in law and advisor jared kushner a real estate scion seeking to safeguard the interests of financial capital bannon though supporting a hard nosed capitalism is primarily concerned with deconstructing the administrative state and producing political results that appeal to trump s base the key to winning an election he explains is to play to people without a college education high school people that s how you win elections his main interest is thus in carrying out a political revolution 49 kushner in contrast is a more politically detached figure concerned first and foremost with questions of capital accumulation and furthering the interests of the ruling class thus representing trump s own ultimate interest at present the administration s focus seems to be on loosening all restraints on corporate cronyism and instituting tax reform in favor of the plutocrats kushner s domain but as the mid term elections near trump will likely swing back toward the alt right at least rhetorically bannon s domain in the imperial sphere the administration initially sought a détente with russia with the object of shifting the full force of the u s empire against the islamic world or that part of it in the middle east and africa not securely within the u s empire and china this planned geopolitical shift put the white house at odds with both the national security deep state and leading sections of the capitalist class and only heightened the conflict between the kushner and bannon factions within the white house but with his first national security advisor michael flynn forced to resign over his alleged ties to russia and with his poll numbers at historic lows trump abruptly changed course by launching an attack on syria in one stroke trump donned the attire of commander in chief to near universal media acclaim in the words of cnn pundit fareed zakaria he became president of the united states that night thus within little more than two weeks from late march to mid april the world witnessed dramatically increased civilian casualties from u s bombings in the middle east as trump turned day to day decisions over to the military commanders on the ground the launching of fifty nine cruise missiles at a syrian air base the dropping of the mother of all bombs in afghanistan and explicit threats of military action against north korea 50 some commentators naïvely suggested that this pivot toward a war room posture on the part of the administration conflicted with its supposed original isolationist values and therefore represented a shift to the center the mainstream media went so far as to declare that trump s reversals including the removal of bannon from the national security council meant that he had finally decided on a more presidential course in fact these were precisely the kind of violent swings in u s imperial posture that were to be expected from a neofascist white house the original détente with russia was dropped without the abandonment of any of their earlier geopolitical objectives aimed at increasing pressure on the islamic state and china 51 the stark reality is that under trump the united states is being armed to the teeth and is exhibiting greater signs of belligerence the new administration has now signed on to the neoconservative strategy of simultaneously opposing both russia and china nor should this be occasion for any particular surprise significantly it was none other than bannon who declared america has to be strong economically strong and militarily strong and a strong america could be ultimately a provider of pax americana that is a new unipolar world empire none of this places trump outside the mainstream of u s foreign policy indeed the demand to restore u s power abroad is supported by the entire u s ruling class as evidenced by the that the fact that hillary clinton promised on the campaign trail to impose no fly zones in syria which would have brought the world to the brink of a global thermonuclear war and by her recent strong support of trump s actions against syria nevertheless the trump administration in its short time in office has managed to signal a bravado and recklessness in the use of force coupled with a shift toward military over civilian control in this area that is nothing short of ominous 52 the new barbarism as indicated above the white house has been the site of competing allegiances responses to the interests of monopoly finance capital on one side and to trump s lower middle class base on the other while there is no doubt that the administration will ultimately prioritize the former over the latter betraying its claims to populism to retain any credibility with its base the white house nonetheless must perform an elaborate dance promoting the interests of the corporate rich while distancing itself from the upper middle class professional strata so loathed by trump s supporters 53his policies must give expression to lower middle class interests and to some extent working class demands even if these are not to be realized 54 the political and strategic constellation represented by bannon breitbart and the mercers is therefore vital hence the neofascist strategy that marks the trump white house thus far is likely to continue incorporating both the alt right and plutocratic factions upon entering the white house trump immediately raised up representatives of the alt right who had been key to his campaign here the role of bannon still trump s chief strategist and the main link to breitbart remains central ideologically the alt right relies on the ideas of thinkers such as evola dugin and oswald spengler the influential early twentieth century german historian and author of the decline of the west 55 bannon has demonstrated considerable acquaintance with evola s work professing admiration for evola s traditionalism particularly the sense of where it supports the underpinnings of nationalism and the expansion of white european cultural sovereignty for bannon the right s global struggle is to be seen in terms of a renewal of the historic war of the judeo christian west against islam now extended to include the national cultural exclusion of non white immigrants into europe and the united states 56 a crucial part of the streamlined neofascist appeal that bannon imparted early on to the trump campaign and then carried over to the white house is geared to economic nationalism bannon argues that the globalists gutted the american working class and created a middle class in asia this points to a kind of empire in reverse where working class white americans who formerly benefitted from unrivaled u s hegemony in the world economy are now seeing their jobs taken away by asians while they are being flooded by illegal latino immigrants and by refugees from middle east countries dominated by radical islamic terrorists crony capitalists financiers on the take and liberal globalists are all to blame trump bannon breitbart and the alt right rely heavily on racially coded language or dog whistles as signals to reach their more militant white supporters who are encouraged to see immigrants refugees and non white populations generally as constituting a combined economic and cultural threat 57 the racial strategy can be seen in bannon s repeated references metaphorically to the camp of the saints this is the title of a novel by french writer jean raspail undoubtedly one of the most racist works of its kind ever published in 1975 when the book was translated into english the usually staid kirkus reviews wrote that the publishers are presenting the camp of the saints as a major event and it probably is in much the same sense that mein kampf was a major event this rabidly racist novel depicts an invasion by 800 000 wretched creatures refugees on the derelict last chance armada who seek to take over france as a beachhead into white europe the camp of the saints meanwhile hordes of chinese threaten russia a french cruise ship has been seized in manila and barricades have been erected by whites around black ghettos in new york the title comes from st john s revelation 20 9 and they went up on the breadth of the earth and compassed the camp of the saints about and the beloved city and fire came down from the god of heaven and devoured them from page 1 on the book is full of murder rape carnage atrocities and the most extreme forms of racism reducing people to body parts with severed racially signified body parts strewn everywhere its cover advertises it as the apocalyptic controversial bestselling novel about the end of the white world it is intended to generate the emotional subintellectual basis in evola s terms for unutterable violence directed not just at asians but at all non white races who are seen as racial threats 58 the camp of the saints has been taken up by the alt right as a kind of racist code for bannon it refers to refugees flooding from the middle east and africa into europe as he declared in 2015 it s been almost a camp of the saints type invasion into central and then western and northern europe a year later he stated the whole thing in europe is all about immigration it s a global issue today this kind of global camp of the saints 59 after pointedly alluding to the camp of the saints in an interview with jeff sessions now u s attorney general who bannon has described as one of the intellectual moral leaders of this populist nationalist movement in this country bannon asked do you believe the elites in this country have the backbone have the belief in the underlying principles of the judeo christian west to actually win this war sessions answered i m worried about that 60 others have taken this up as well iowa gop congressman steve king referred in a radio interview in march 2017 to the possibility of race wars in the united states today strongly recommending that people read the camp of saints in this context 61 trumpism is rife on a daily basis with racism misogyny and extreme nationalism bannon and breitbart refer coyly to the alt right movement as one made up of working class hobbits a term for its forgotten white lower middle class working class adherents this refers back to a negative reference by arizona republican senator john mccain to tea party hobbits 62 bannon took it up as an ironic term standing for trump s hardcore constituency in doing so though he was undoubtedly aware of the earlier neofascist hobbit camps that had been formed in italy with a similar meaning indeed the u s alt right as represented by breitbart could be described today as a toxic mixture of european neofascism u s white supremacism and christian fundamentalism the trump phenomenon draws on some of the most sordid aspects of u s past including genocide of native americans slavery jim crow and imperialism of all u s presidents the one that is seen by bannon and by trump himself as most closely related to the new resident at 1600 pennsylvania avenue is andrew jackson ostensibly because of the popular democratic upsurge associated with him and his attack on the bank of the united states but also undoubtedly because of his wealthy slaveholder status his gruesome role in the indian wars and his government s forcible removal of the eastern tribes in the trail of tears trump declared in an interview in april 2017 that if jackson had still been alive he died sixteen years before the confederate forces opened fire on fort sumter and presumably had been president he would have prevented the civil war an absurd statement doubtless meant as a dog whistle to his alt right white supremacist supporters who idealize the slave south and the confederacy 63 trump s own outlook and ambitions intersect ideologically with the alt right as his 2011 book tough times make america great again shows trump declared on the campaign trail that the only important thing is the unification of the people because the other people don t mean anything 64 nevertheless the owner of trump tower in manhattan represents monopoly finance capital first and foremost indeed trump s attacks on crony capitalism and his calls for draining the swamp are belied by the billionaires and lobbyists that he has brought into his administration and the cronyism which is everywhere visible starting with his own family and extending to the special access to the president given to those ultra wealthy interests who belong to his mar a lago golf club 65 the neofascist thrust of the trump white house can be seen in those chosen to occupy key strategic roles an example of this is curtis ellis a member of trump s beachhead transition team appointed as special assistant to the secretary of labor ellis a breitbart author wrote an article in may 2016 for the world news daily called the radical left s ethnic cleansing of america in this article which was to be celebrated by bannon and featured on breitbart ellis argued that for the globalist left the death literally of white working people is a desired outcome a feature not a bug the death of american working class whites was planned by the radical left and carried out with willing executioners at the highest levels of american politics academia and business 66 such nationalistic racist views aimed at the left and at non white populations were strongly encouraged by trump in his campaign for the presidency and his actions since coming into office trumponomics and the crisis of the u s political economy the neoliberal era in the united states cornel west had declared ended with a neofascist bang 67 neoliberalism was itself a ruling class response to the deepening economic stagnation of the capitalist economy as the quarter century of prosperity from the late 1940s through the early 1970s broke down needing a stimulus the u s economy resorted first in the reagan period to military spending and tax cuts but soon benefitted more fundamentally from the long decline in interest rates the so called greenspan put which fed a period of vast debt credit expansion and what paul sweezy called the financialization of the capital accumulation process 68 the result was a bubble economy that continued into the clinton and george w bush presidencies then came to a sudden end with the bursting of the housing bubble and the subsequent crisis of 2007 09 trillions of dollars were poured into corporate coffers in an attempt to bail out defaulting financial institutions as well as heavily indebted non financial corporations the subsequent economic recovery has been one of sluggish growth or secular stagnation a period of endless crisis 69 everywhere neoliberalism has come to stand for policies of austerity financial speculation globalization income polarization and corporate cronyism creating what michael yates has called the great inequality 70 across the advanced economies michael jacobs and mariana mazzucato write the share of gdp going to labor fell by 9 percent on average between 1980 and 2007 in the united states between 1975 and 2012 the top 1 percent gained around 47 percent of the total increase in incomes 71wealth inequality has increased even faster in 1963 the average wealth of families in the ninety ninth percentile in the united states was six times that of wealth holders in the fiftieth percentile in 2013 it was twelve times 72 all of this has been accompanied by the erosion of u s hegemony in the world economy the growth of a new imperialism based on the global labor arbitrage taking advantage of wage differentials between the global north and south the changing role of manufacturing and investment in the context of the digital revolution and neoliberal attacks on labor these factors have enormously undermined the position of the working population in the united states while also intensifying the exploitation of workers in the global south what was once seen in hyped up fashion as a social contract between capital and labor in the heyday of u s hegemony and prosperity has now disintegrated entirely with it has disappeared what was once called the labor aristocracy a minority of relatively privileged largely unionized workers in the advanced capitalist world who benefitted indirectly from unrivaled u s imperial hegemony and the siphoning of profits from the global south 73 monopoly finance capital now freely outsources production from the global north to the global south in what has become a new age of imperialism characterized by a race to the bottom for workers throughout the world economy 74 the social democratic campaign of bernie sanders in the 2016 election showed the potential for a grassroots left upsurge in this context the main fear of the ruling class but sanders s extraordinary campaign representing an approach that would undoubtedly have won in a contest with trump by drawing on a far wider working class base was blocked by a democratic party establishment that had long since put into place a superdelegate system and a structure of control through the democratic national committee expressly designed to prevent such a left takeover of the party the road was thus left open to trump in this context there is no real doubt about the source of trump s success he received a remarkable 77 percent of the vote among those who said their financial situation had worsened in the preceding four years 75 few understood this overall economic dynamic better that bannon the strategic brains behind the trump campaign who had worked on wall street as an investment banker before moving to hollywood and making ultra right wing political films testing the zeitgeist and finally taking over breitbart with a realism completely lacking in neoliberal circles he remarked i don t think there s any doubt that the world is in the beginning state of a crisis that it can t avoid raging against liberals he stated that the left globalists destroyed the american working class the issue now is about americans looking to not get f ed over 76 trump s declarations about the carnage in the u s economy in his inaugural address written by bannon and his breitbart colleague stephen miller now a special adviser to trump his claims that the united states should have taken the iraqi oil as payment for its deposing saddam hussein and his so called truthful hyperbole regarding labor statistics he claimed the unemployment rate in 2016 was as high as 35 or more were all part of this same strategy 77 this also included his attack on unfair trade taken from the playbook of the left his emphasis on protecting social security his proposal to cut prescription drug prices through competitive bidding and his promised trillion dollars for infrastructure spending all of this was designed to draw support from wage workers that the democrats abandoned likewise the virulent attacks on illegal immigrants and refugees the building of the wall between the u s and mexico and trump s strong law and order stance including suggestions that black lives matter be put under federal surveillance were all part of the attempt to consolidate mass support for trump in class economic and racial terms 78 casting aside the obama era trans pacific partnership trump has raised the prospect of trade and currency wars with china to save american jobs he appointed as director of the white house national trade council economist peter navarro author of the coming china wars which accuses china of unleashing a new imperialism on the globe and of currency manipulation the united states navarro argues should end its mutually parasitic economic codependence with china and fight back economically and militarily among navarro s other works are death by china 2011 and crouching china what china s militarism means to the world 2015 79 trump has vowed to more than double the rate of growth of the economy yet his economic policy is largely a supply side one of generating windfalls to monopoly finance capital through wholesale deregulation and lavish tax cuts mainly for the wealthy and corporations he repeatedly declared that he would hugely expand infrastructure spending which would give a boost to the real estate and construction sectors yet since the trump plan is based on tax cuts to firms rather than a massive increase in spending and is supposed to be strung out over ten years it will do little to stimulate the economy as a whole indeed none of this can lift the economy out of stagnation the most likely result is continued slow growth possibly interrupted by a bubble effect in the financial sector 80 the one thing that is certain is the business cycle the economy is nearing its peak and recession is on the horizon to be expected within a few years any prospect for real economic gains for the mass of the population will run into the triple contradiction of economic stagnation financial crisis and declining u s hegemony that characterize the epoch of monopoly finance capital rather than alter these conditions trump s economic policy is likely to aggravate the problem this means that the trump regime will probably gravitate as its only economic option to further military spending increases and imperialist adventures coupled with greater economic repression of workers at home particularly among the poorest sectors of the work force conceived as the surest way to make america great again the greatest danger under these circumstances is that an increase in internal repression bannon is on record as supporting joseph mccarthy s anti communist witch hunt in the 1950s will have its counterpart in an increase in external repression and war without bounds seen as a way of lifting the economy 81 already certain restraints on the global use of force have been removed a new upsurge in barbarism nationally and internationally is in the wind this time armed with weapons capable of destroying the world as a place for human habitation indeed the exterminism that is a real danger in these circumstances is already evident in the renunciation of all efforts to contain climate change which trump calls a hoax this then threatens the eventual collapse of civilization and even the extinction of humanity under a continuation of capitalist business as usual resistance in the post truth society in writing the truth five difficulties brecht stated nowadays anyone who wishes to combat lies and ignorance and to write the truth must overcome at least five difficulties he must have the courage to write the truth when truth is everywhere opposed the keenness to recognize it although it is everywhere concealed the skill to manipulate it as a weapon the judgment to select those in whose hands it will be effective and the cunning to spread the truth among such persons these are formidable problems for writers living under fascism but they exist also for those writers who have fled or been exiled they exist even for writers in countries where civil liberty prevails 82 brecht would not be at all surprised that the rapid growth of neofascism in the united states and europe has coincided with the declaration by the oxford dictionaries that the word of the year for 2016 in recognition of trump s political rise was the adjective post truth significantly another word on the short list for word of the year was alt right the oxford dictionaries define post truth as relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief 83 blatant violation of the truth and what georg lukács called the destruction of reason has always been associated with fascism and has helped prepare the ground for its rise 84 it is impossible to understand our current social reality divorced from class analysis nor is it possible to resist that reality effectively without class organization a defining feature of contemporary liberal democratic ideology which set the conditions for today s post truth society has been the retreat from class and particularly from the notion of the working class ironically brought back into the mainstream in relation to trump 85 this makes it possible for the vague term populism to cloak the growing neofascist threat of our time resistance to these trends is only possible as brecht reminds us by first having the courage the keenness the skill the judgment and the cunning to address the truth with respect to this demonic political phenomenon it is necessary to recognize the truth in its historical structural and dialectical connections insisting on the fact that today s neofascism is the inevitable product of the crisis of monopoly finance capital hence the only effective way to resist is to resist the system itself against today s neofascist wind the movement toward socialism is the final barricade the only genuine class human ecological defense notes

if bruce springsteen wrote a song about the fed or the ecb or the boj there d be a line in there what are they good for absolutely nothing since the great recession they ve been good for two things driving interest rates to negative in europe and under half a percent in the u s and gobbling up toxic assets like mortgage backed securities mbs or guaranteeing the market it would buy bonds from private investors as the biggest banks in the world guarantee a bond has a buyer even in a bearish scenario big investors bought fixed income instruments largely because they knew the central banks of the u s europe and japan would be the buyer of last resort no one is buying for yield yield is fool s gold indeed entire hedge funds were built around this concept of buying a bond or a formerly toxic derivative like an mbs for 100 and selling it to the fed for 101 the old days of watching out for inflation are no longer a central bank s main metric for monetary policy inflation is under control thanks in part to technological advancements making everything from port logistics to grocery shopping cheaper than it used to be mature advanced economies have gotten used to low interest rates seeing how inflation isn t going up and strong labor markets aren t hurting inflation cutting rates keeps those old economies alive the policy reaction function of the main central banks appears to be shifting led by the federal reserve and european central bank ecb they are signaling a return to rate cuts and bond buying programs major central banks seem trapped in an era of ultra loose monetary policy says rob subbaraman co head of global macro research at nomura securities very low interest rates for an unusually long period of time involve diminishing returns and rising costs that make normalization of monetary policy increasingly difficult the fed s monetary policy intentions continue to be a key talking point for investors the stock markets are up because of it the reaction in the bond market to u s nonfarm payroll recently where job numbers beat expectations or last week s consumer price index data which showed inflation edging up a little pushed the yield curve a little higher from its early july lows there is what may be a temporary support level of 2 yield for u s treasury 10 year bond in countries like japan and germany 2 looks like speculative grade credit the strong job market and stable economy has some fund managers debating whether we need rate cuts why lower interest rates when the u s stock market is at a record high and the u s unemployment rate is at a 50 year low would not a looser monetary policy just pump up the everything bubble even more asks neil mackinnon an economist with vtb capital in a note to clients on tuesday cheaper credit means a return to leverage something the u s has been reducing since the great recession globally the debt to gdp ration is at a record high of 320 according to the institute of international finance lower interest rates exacerbate that by making debt more tempting because debt is so cheap that makes credit markets riskier when this business cycle turns recessionary so far there is no recession on the horizon in the u s outside of the u s emerging markets debt to gdp is now at a record and chinese corporate debt to gdp in particular stands at 155 of gdp chinese corporates accounted for 42 of all emerging market corporate bonds issued this year as that market continues to open up to foreign investors fed chairman jerome powell seems concerned about the persistent undershoot in their core inflation projections more jobs more money higher tariffs why isn t everything more expensive today at the very least why isn t demand for consumer goods pushing up prices brown brothers harriman s chief strategist scott clemons has argued in the past that americans are not as levered up as they were pre great recession they are still paying off debts and not that interested in overleveraging like before that s one explanation measures of inflation expectations have been falling outside of the u s as well removing the main driver for rate hikes to curb demand leading to higher consumer prices it seems as if inflation targeting is yesterday s monetary policy formula at least in the advanced economies this is the japanification thesis vtb capital s mackinnon says regarding the major economies facing a japan style outlook of economic stagnation worth noting german bond yields now pay less than japan a country known for the carry trade they have entire financial services set up to borrow in yen and buy brazilian bonds in the local currency there instead for much of japan it s worth the risk as their fixed income pays next to nothing hold a 10 year japanese treasury bond and you ll get a 0 13 return on your investment based on current yield not total return meanwhile negative yielding global government bonds stand at 13 trillion that s up 2 trillion in two years to put that into perspective imagine the economy of brazil being worth 0 instead of the roughly 2 trillion it pumps out annually the only way brazil looks attractive in that case is if 0 is better than 0 5 then you re a brazil trading genius there are actually 14 companies in europe s speculative grade bond market trading with a negative yield today speculative grade is the nice way of saying junk bond at the start of the year no high yield bonds were trading below zero japan is approaching its 22nd year of lowering rates without there being any uplift in inflation the bank of japan boj serves as a backdrop to the local securities market buying stocks and bonds here at home the yield for a 10 year treasury bond is 0 3 after inflation which is the bond market s way of saying they believe the economy is slowing and central banks will return to market supportive policies in the fourth quarter of 2018 companies spent a record 223 billion on share buybacks they did that largely by accessing the debt markets and buying their shares with cheap credit it s like japan s carry trade borrow at 3 pump up a stock that s growing at 10 as an example apple spent billions buying back its shares assuming they borrowed to do so even at a whopping 5 apple shares are up nearly 30 year to date and over 7 in the last 12 months some political pundits have pointed out that quantitative easing made income and wealth inequality worse they blame that on the rise of populism and a push to deglobalize the world economy qe and bond market control by the central banks have forced investors to take on greater investment risk this 10 year trend has inflated asset valuations because more people are buying things like real estate for income and stocks for both growth and dividend income seeing how bonds and savings don t pay as the prices of those assets rise people holding them get richer down market worthless bond yields hit middle income retirees who have much of their savings in conservative investments it also hurts young people in urban centers where most of the employment is and where most of the real estate purchases are being made by the upper middle class and the rich this makes it harder for many people to afford down payments on first homes in cities like new york washington d c and san francisco some of this view that central bank policy is turning the world off to globalization may be short sighted voters have been pushing back against the established political powers well before the first qe program started out of washington from the day china joined the world trade organization in 2001 to year after year of political disappointments the electorate felt rudderless prior to the advent of brexit in the u k 5 star in italy and trump in the u s in the future low inflation may lead to fewer workers and fewer workers could mean a weaker economy but will the fed follow the ecb and go to zero at zero what is the point of a central bank other than to be a backstop to the local securities market central banks tend to cut interest rates by as much as 500 basis points in a recession that would take the current fed funds rate of 2 5 to 2 5 in theory of course there is no reason for the fed to have a negative rate it would just go to zero or maybe one or two basis points over that and the market would push it to negative as it did in europe ecb s interest rate is 0 deposit rates are negative in some cases it costs savers to hold money in a bank it would be foolish for central bankers to admit as much but their room for monetary policy normalization to build policy space to fight the next recession is narrowing says subbaraman in other words they are trapped source forbes

restructuring actions non operating pension costs and acquisition costs in the second quarter of 2018 gaap results included net after tax charges of 4 2 million as after tax restructuring charges were mostly offset by a tax benefit from the u s tax cuts and jobs acts of 2017 base net income attributable to sonoco base earnings for second quarter 2019 was 0 95 per diluted share compared with 0 93 in 2018 see base earnings definition explanation and reconciliation to gaap earnings later in this release sonoco previously provided second quarter 2019 base earnings guidance of 0 93 to 0 99 per

acquisition is expected to close by the end of the third quarter of 2019 third quarter and full year guidance update base earnings for the third quarter of 2019 are estimated to be in the range of 0 88 to 0 94 per diluted share compared to 0 86 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2018 full year 2019 base earnings guidance remains at 3 52 to 3 62 per diluted share as a result of the after tax cash flow impact from the voluntary contribution to the company s u s defined benefit pension plans full year 2019 operating cash flow guidance has been lowered to a range of 435 million to 455 million down from the previous range of 600 million to 620 million also the company now expects free cash flow to be 60 million to 80 million compared with previous guidance of 225 million to 245 million note third quarter and full year 2019 gaap guidance are not provided in this release due to the likely occurrence of one or more of the following the timing and magnitude of which we are unable to reliably forecast possible gains or losses on the sale of businesses or other assets restructuring costs and restructuring related impairment charges acquisition related costs and the income tax effects of these items and or other income tax related events these items could have a significant impact on the company s future gaap financial results ceo comments on second quarter results commenting on the company s second quarter gaap and base earnings performance rob tiede president and chief executive officer said sonoco s diverse mix of businesses produced solid operating results during the quarter despite challenging global macroeconomic conditions where we saw further slowing in demand in many of our served markets in addition we experienced unforeseen fires floods and other events which damaged four of our operations resulting in insurance deductible and other business losses of approximately 2 cents per share overall in the second quarter net sales were essentially flat and gaap net income attributable to sonoco declined primarily due to our targeted restructuring efforts which are focused on reducing costs and improving operating margin base net income gained 3 0 percent to a record 96 5 million as improvements in productivity and earnings from acquisitions more than offset lower volume mix gaap gross profit margin was a strong 20 2 percent unchanged from last year s quarter and approximately 25 basis points higher than first quarter while gaap operating profit declined from last year due to higher restructuring and other costs base operating profit increased 4 4 percent to a record 144 3 million while base operating margin increased approximately 50 basis points from last year our consumer packaging segment reported lower sales and operating profit compared to last year s quarter however operating margin improved slightly to 10 4 percent sales in our paper and industrial converted products segment were up 3 6 percent while operating profit was essentially flat with last year s record results and operating margin declined 52 basis points also our display and packaging segment continued its turnaround with operating margin expanding 477 basis points over the prior year period and in our protective solutions segment operating profit improved 4 8 percent and operating margin expanded by 66 basis points second quarter review net sales for the second quarter were 1 36 billion down slightly from last year s second quarter sales of 1 37 billion the sales decline was driven by lower volumes and a stronger us dollar these negative impacts were largely offset by increased sales from acquisitions gaap net income attributable to sonoco in the second quarter was 81 2 million or 0 80 per diluted share a decrease of 8 3 million compared with 89 4 million or 0 88 per diluted share in 2018 second quarter gaap earnings included after tax non base charges totaling 15 3 million 10 0 million of which were after tax charges related primarily to restructuring activities the remaining 5 3 million was related almost exclusively to non operating pension costs in the second quarter of 2018 gaap earnings included 4 2 million of after tax non base net charges 2 5 million of which were after tax charges related primarily to previously initiated restructuring activities the remaining 1 7 million is primarily costs related to acquisitions and contemplated acquisitions adjusted for these items base earnings in the second quarter of 2019 were 96 5 million or 0 95 per diluted share an increase of 2 8 million compared with 93 6 million or 0 93 per diluted share in 2018 base earnings and base earnings per diluted share are non gaap financial measures adjusted to remove restructuring related items asset impairment charges acquisition expenses non operating pension costs and certain income tax related events and other items if any the exclusion of which the company believes improves comparability and analysis of the ongoing operating performance of the business see base earnings definition explanation and reconciliation to gaap earnings later in this release gross profit was 275 3 million in the second quarter which was down slightly from 276 5 million reported in the same period in 2018 gross profit as a percentage of sales was 20 2 percent unchanged from 20 2 percent in the same period in 2018 second quarter selling general and administrative expenses decreased 8 8 million from the prior year to 132 2 million this decrease was driven by a significant focus across the business on lowering controllable costs which was partially offset by the addition of expenses from acquisitions segment review sonoco reports its financial results in four operating segments consumer packaging display and packaging paper and industrial converted products and protective solutions segment operating results do not include restructuring and asset impairment charges acquisition expenses interest income and expense income taxes or certain other items if any the exclusion of which the company believes improves comparability and analysis consumer packaging sonoco s consumer packaging segment includes the following products and services round and shaped rigid containers and trays both composite and thermoformed plastic extruded and injection molded plastic products printed flexible packaging global brand artwork management and metal and peelable membrane ends and closures second quarter 2019 sales for the segment were 602 8 million compared with 616 1 million in 2018 segment operating profit was 62 9 million in the second quarter compared with 63 7 million in the same quarter of 2018 segment sales declined 2 2 percent compared to the prior year s quarter due to lower volume mix and the negative impact of foreign exchange rigid paper containers sales volume declined in north america as well as flexible packaging and rigid plastics as many served markets experienced slowing customer demand segment operating profit decreased 1 1 percent compared to the prior year s quarter as the benefit of productivity improvements and a positive price cost relationship was more than offset by weaker volume segment operating margin improved slightly to 10 4 percent in the quarter from 10 3 percent in 2018 display and packaging the display and packaging segment includes the following products and services designing manufacturing assembling packing and distributing temporary semi permanent and permanent point of purchase displays supply chain management services including

glass covers second quarter 2019 sales for this segment were 134 8 million compared with 143 3 million in 2018 the segment reported an operating profit of 5 9 million in the current quarter compared with an operating loss of 0 6 million in the prior year s quarter sales declined 5 9 percent compared to last year s quarter as volume growth in domestic displays and international pack centers was more than offset by reduced revenue from exiting a pack center contract late in the third quarter of 2018 segment operating profit improved 6 5 million due to higher volume mix improved productivity and the non recurrence of operating losses at the exited pack center paper and industrial converted products the paper and industrial converted products segment includes the following products paperboard tubes cones and cores fiber based construction tubes wooden metal and composite wire and cable reels and spools and recycled paperboard linerboard corrugating medium recovered paper and material recycling services second quarter 2019 sales for the segment were 491 3 million up from 474 1 million in 2018 segment operating profit was 61 2 million in the quarter compared with 61 5 million in 2018 during the quarter the company s trent valley ontario canada paper mill was flooded by the trent river resulting in a six day production outage temporarily higher operating costs and an expense incurred for the insurance deductible segment sales increased 3 6 percent from the prior year s quarter due to sales added by the 2018 acquisition of conitex this was partially offset by lower volume mix and the negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rates current quarter paperboard corrugated medium and tube and core volumes were weak across all geographies segment operating profit was essentially flat with the prior year s quarter as earnings from the conitex acquisition productivity improvements and a slightly positive price cost relationship effectively offset negative volume mix segment operating margin declined 52 basis points to 12 5 percent protective solutions the protective solutions segment includes the following products custom engineered paperboard based and expanded foam protective packaging and components and temperature assured packaging second quarter 2019 sales were 130 8 million down from 132 9 million in 2018 operating profit was 14 3 million a 4 8 percent increase from the second quarter of 2018 this segment s sales were modestly lower year over year due primarily to lower volume mix as strong sales growth for temperature assured packaging was offset by declines in molded foam and consumer fiber packaging segment operating profit improved modestly as strong productivity improvements were partially offset by a negative price cost relationship segment operating margin compared to the prior year quarter improved 66 basis points to 10 9 percent corporate tax net interest expense for the second quarter of 2019 increased to 16 0 million compared with 15 1 million during the same period in 2018 primarily due to higher non u s debt balances and reduced interest income on lower offshore cash balances the 2019 second quarter effective tax rates on gaap and base earnings were 26 3 percent and 25 9 percent respectively compared with 26 1 percent and 26 8 percent respectively in the prior year s quarter the effective tax rate on gaap earnings for the second quarter of 2019 was slightly higher due primarily to one time adjustments in the second quarter of 2018 related to the u s tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the lower base effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2019 was primarily attributable to a decreased impact from the global intangible low taxed income gilti tax year to date results for the first six months of 2019 net sales were 2 7 billion up 40 9 million compared with 2 7 billion in the first six months of 2018 sales grew 1 5 percent in the first half of the year due to acquisitions and higher selling prices implemented to recover higher input and operating costs which were partially offset by lower volume mix and a 65 million negative impact of foreign exchange gaap net income attributable to sonoco for the first half of 2019 was 154 8 million or 1 53 per diluted share compared with 163 5 million or 1 62 per diluted share in the first half of 2018 earnings in the first half of 2019

was partially offset by the addition of expenses from acquisitions base operating profit for the first six months of 2019 increased 8 2 percent to 272 3 due primarily to acquisitions and productivity improvements which were partially offset by volume declines cash flow and free cash flow for the first half of 2019 cash generated from operations was 40 1 million compared with 251 2 million in 2018 a decrease of 211 2 million pension plan contributions net of non cash expense increased by 193 2 million from last year s six month period due to the company s voluntary 190 million contribution to the the company s u s defined benefit pension plans in the second quarter of 2019 an increased consumption of cash for working capital of 20 8 million also contributed to the period over period decease in operating cash flow while the seasonal changes in business activity consumed cash in both periods this increase was more meaningful in 2019 due to greater year over year increases in business activity from the prior year s end free cash flow for the first six months of 2019 was a use of cash that totaled 144 9 million compared with a provision of cash of 88 8 million in the same period last year a decrease of 233 6 million mostly attributable to the 211 2 million decrease in cash flow from operations discussed above the remaining decrease in free cash flow was driven by higher year to date net capital expenditures and cash dividends which totaled 100 8 million and 84 2 million respectively compared with 82 7 million and 79 8 million respectively in 2018 see free cash flow description and reconciliation later in this release free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations minus net capital expenditures and cash dividends net capital expenditures are defined as capital expenditures minus proceeds from and or plus costs incurred in the disposition of capital assets as of june 30 2019 total debt was approximately 1 55 billion compared with 1 39 billion as of december 31 2018 and the company had a total debt to total capital ratio of 45 5 percent at the end of the second quarter compared to 43 9 percent at the end of 2018 the increase in total debt from year end was driven by a new 200 million term loan drawn during the second quarter which was used to fund a 190 million voluntary pension contribution to the sonoco u s defined benefit pension plans cash and cash equivalents were 96 3 million as of june 30 2019 compared with 120 4 million at december 31 2018 third quarter and full year 2019 outlook sonoco expects third quarter 2019 base earnings to be in the range of 0 88 to 0 94 per diluted share base earnings in the third quarter of 2018 were 0 86 per diluted share full year 2019 base earnings per diluted share are expected to be in a range of 3 52 to 3 62 which is unchanged from the company s previous guidance however this earnings estimate now includes an approximately 0 03 per diluted share negative impact from higher interest expense associated with a 200 million term loan drawn in the second quarter to fund the company s u s pension plans this guidance also does not reflect the pending acquisition of corenso holdings america the expected full year 2019 tax rate is unchanged at approximately 25 5 percent operating cash flow for 2019 is now expected to be in the range of 435 million to 455 million which is reduced from the previous guidance of 600 million to 620 million due to the after tax cash flow impact from the company s 200 million voluntary contributions to its u s defined benefit pension plans additionally free cash flow is now expected to be 60 million to 80 million compared to previous guidance of 225 million to 245 million free cash flow guidance includes total expected 2019 cash dividend payments to shareholders of approximately 170 million although the company believes the assumptions reflected in the range of guidance are reasonable given uncertainty regarding the impact of new and potential tariffs the future performance of the overall economy potential changes in raw material prices and other costs as well as other risks and uncertainties including those described further below actual

reported or gaap results adjusted to exclude amounts including the associated tax effects relating to restructuring initiatives asset impairment charges non operating pension costs or income environmental charges acquisition related costs gains or losses from the disposition of businesses excess property insurance recoveries pension settlement costs and certain other items if any including other income tax related adjustments and or events the exclusion of which management believes improves comparability and analysis of the ongoing operating performance of the business these adjustments which are referred to as non base result in the non gaap financial measures referred to in this press release as base earnings and base earnings per diluted share these non gaap measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non gaap measures used by other companies in addition these non gaap measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles sonoco continues to provide all information required by gaap but it believes that evaluating its ongoing operating results may not be as useful if an investor or other user is limited to reviewing only gaap financial measures sonoco uses these non gaap financial measures for internal planning and forecasting purposes to evaluate its ongoing operations and to evaluate the ultimate performance of each business unit against plan forecast all the way up through the evaluation of the chief executive officer s performance by the board of directors in addition these same non gaap measures are used in determining incentive compensation for the entire management team and in providing earnings guidance to the investing community sonoco management does not nor does it suggest that investors should consider these non gaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap sonoco presents these non gaap financial measures to provide users information to evaluate sonoco s operating results in a manner similar to how management evaluates business performance material limitations associated with the use of such measures are that they do not reflect all period costs included in operating expenses and may not reflect financial results that are comparable to financial results of other companies that present similar costs differently furthermore the calculations of these non gaap measures are based on subjective determinations of management regarding the nature and classification of events and circumstances that the investor may find material and view differently to compensate for these limitations management believes that it is useful in understanding and analyzing the results of the business to review both gaap information which includes all of the items impacting financial results and the non gaap measures that exclude certain elements as described above whenever sonoco uses a non gaap financial measure except with respect to guidance it provides a reconciliation of the non gaap financial measure to the most closely applicable gaap financial measure whenever reviewing a non gaap financial measure investors are encouraged to fully review and consider the related reconciliation as detailed below third quarter and

author s note cap uses black and african american interchangeably throughout many of our products we chose to capitalize black in order to reflect that we are discussing a group of people and to be consistent with the capitalization of african american trade policy has played and will continue to play a prominent role in forming or curtailing economic opportunity for america s diverse working class unfortunately president donald trump s renegotiated north american free trade agreement nafta the united states mexico canada agreement usmca does not do enough to consider the needs of working americans 1 among other oversights trump s trade deal lacks certain and swift labor enforcement provisions fails to mention climate change and locks in high drug prices for pharmaceutical companies the proposed trade agreement serves as yet another example of corporate handouts to the very people squeezing the working class and securing greater profits and power for the wealthiest few 2 moreover president trump s deal fails to consider the unique needs and concerns of workers of color continuing a long trend in the trade policy sphere while race is rarely the focal point of policy debates regarding globalization and trade in the united states people of color particularly black people are far more prevalent than commonly appreciated in the sectors that are hurt most by trade additionally systemic economic and social inequities along racial lines can intensify the effects of trade dislocations increasing the need for racially conscious trade policies 3 importantly the pains associated with the rules governing trade are compounded by the broader overwhelming economic barriers that black people face 4 existing racial inequities make job loss disproportionately damaging for black people in the united states all the while current and past administrations have failed to put black people front and center in the debate over the myriad effects of trade and globalization black people comprise a significant portion of u s manufacturing workers including in certain geographic areas that are most exposed to trade flows in certain industries including automobile manufacturing black people are overrepresented compared with their share of manufacturing workers overall for example though black people represent 12 3 percent of manufacturing workers overall they comprise 16 7 percent of motor vehicle and motor vehicle equipment manufacturers and 17 4 percent of tire manufacturers both industries that have been vulnerable to the accelerated growth of auto component production alternatives in other countries 5 as a result they have faced pressures in the past few decades automation and technological change have played a role in the decline of manufacturing but trade policy has as well and the latter offers a clear policy vehicle that could curtail these negatives pressures on segments of the populations that are most vulnerable to international trade flows unfortunately president trump s usmca has missed the mark on a critical opportunity to correct mistakes of trade rules past and set high road standards to fix how trade rules have negatively affected black communities this issue brief looks at the effect of the decline in manufacturing which is in part due to exposure to globalized trade flows without adequate measures in place to protect workers from adverse consequences the decline of the manufacturing sector compounded with other structural issues that disproportionately disadvantage black people has significantly harmed black communities manufacturing and black communities black men and women have been particularly hurt by declines in manufacturing jobs resulting from trade in many traditional manufacturing industries ones that have been historically dominated by men black men increasingly were able to participate in high paying jobs during the early and mid 20th century 6 thus when globalization took many of these jobs overseas black men were hit especially hard compared with their share in the labor force black workers are more likely than their white counterparts to be displaced due to trade 7 when the scope and pace are reasonable job losses from trade can be made up through other economic policies but this has not been the case in all regions and communities 8 moreover a serious and lasting consequence of the growth in international trade has been a decline in the manufacturing wage premium enjoyed by u s workers 9 in addition to other structural labor market factors including automation and technological change trade with china also affected black workers although the share of black workers displaced by china trade is slightly less than the overall average share of black workers in the labor force the jobs from which they were displaced were good ones 10 in addition to the wage premium the manufacturing sector has historically been a stronghold for union organizing with disproportionately higher unionization rates than in private nonmanufacturing jobs 11 black union workers have higher wages and better access to health and retirement benefits than their nonunion peers 12 furthermore manufacturing provided more jobs for high school educated workers than did other sectors of the economy making jobs in this industry some of the best available for black and hispanic workers who on average have lower levels of educational attainment and wages than their white counterparts 13 geographic effects the decline in u s manufacturing employment particularly since china s accession to the world trade organization in 2000 and the subsequent influx of low cost chinese goods and outflow of some manufacturing jobs has hit communities across the united states hard 14 additionally although manufacturing as a whole is disproportionately white this is not the case for all geographic regions 15 some areas with disproportionately high black populations including northern mississippi western tennessee central regions of virginia and cities such as gary indiana and youngstown ohio have suffered from job displacement due to what economist david autor has dubbed china shock 16 this term refers to a profound shift in trade patterns across the world and its demonstrated effects on local labor markets particularly where industries exposed to foreign competition are concentrated the decline of detroit s auto industry cities such as detroit have been especially hurt by the auto industry s decline and the city s economic pains were intensified by the great recession 17 a 2015 study by reynolds farley of the university of michigan looked at detroit s history of racial conflict in the context of the black middle class and the importance of the manufacturing sector 18 in the mid 20th century manufacturing secured key good jobs that sustained a financially secure black middle class in detroit by 1950 the city s black community was the most prosperous in the nation as measured by earnings and family income though manufacturing employment in detroit plummeted across all races during the latter half of the 20th century the black middle class was more dependent on manufacturing jobs than the white middle class slightly less than one third of all black employed individuals worked for manufacturers a rate about double that of white workers making the disappearance of these jobs particularly devastating to this group the study found that from 1970 through 2013 the number of black manufacturing transportation utilities and construction workers employed in the city fell by nearly half from 102 000 to 53 000 black men furthermore the study found that these workers average earnings fell by almost 7 000 during the same time period ultimately these labor market shifts including the dramatic fall in manufacturing in detroit a sector that largely supported the black middle class played a role in detroit s bankruptcy and the fate of the city automation and technological change automation and technological change have also had a steady negative effect on manufacturing employment in the united states since the late 1970s 19 over the past several decades process improvements and automation have transformed workplaces and contributed to a decline in the share of manufacturing employees in the united states technology including computers and the internet has become more prevalent and less costly across the united states increasing the productivity of each manufacturing worker and therefore allowing manufacturing firms to produce larger quantities of goods with fewer more productive workers 20 though access to technology can make some workers more valuable others are left less well off for example atms have replaced tellers and computers and voicemail have replaced many secretaries 21 moreover globalization and the inadequate global rules of trade further intensified this decline in manufacturing jobs resultantly putting additional negative employment and wage pressures on workers pressures that have been compounded by the existing systemic inequities that disadvantage black workers in the u s labor market 22 employment unionization and wage effects according to a 2018 study looking at the impact of manufacturing employment on black and white americans from 1960 through 2010 the decline in manufacturing contributed to a 12 percent overall increase in the racial wage gap for men as well as increases in other socio economic gaps in the black community 23 because the manufacturing sector provided high paying jobs to less educated men and given that black americans generally had lower levels of educational attainment than their white counterparts the black population stood to gain more from manufacturing jobs thus the decline in u s manufacturing had a disproportionately negative effect on black workers the study concluded that despite the legislative successes of the civil rights movement in the 1960s and steady improvement in the educational outcomes of black students racial wage and employment gaps have not improved and in many cases have widened other research has emphasized this point finding that increased import competition with japan played a sizable role in the economic hardships experienced by black communities in the 1970s and 1980s the increase in import exposure decreased manufacturing employment increased labor force nonparticipation and decreased median household earnings for black men stalling economic progress for black communities during this time period 24 another recent analysis from the institute of labor economics examined the effects of this decline in manufacturing employment identifying a significant deterioration in socio economic outcomes for whites and blacks higher inequality within each group and larger racial gaps 25 black workers have also faced a consistent and widening wage gap within the manufacturing sector in fact from 1979 through 2015 the difference between wages of black and white workers within the industry increased by more than 3 percent all the while policies that have proven to help shrink this systematic divide have been under steady attack 26 the decline of unionization is a complex story for far too long black workers were systematically excluded from jobs and industries that often coincided with unionization and higher wages at its passage the national labor relations act of 1935 or the wagner act initially excluded agricultural and domestic workers who were and are predominantly people of color and did not include language prohibiting unions from discriminating based on race 27 consequently what should have been a golden ticket to economic opportunity a union job in a manufacturing community slipped out of reach for many workers of color as black workers moved to the industrializing north during the early to mid 20th century they fought to integrate the unionized manufacturing industry during world war ii the roosevelt administration bolstered these efforts by requiring defense contractors to prevent racial discrimination and to respect workers bargaining rights 28 in addition in 1944 the u s supreme court issued a landmark ruling that required unions to represent all workers on the job without racial discrimination 29 as a result empirical evidence shows that the advantage in union membership that white households held in the 1940s began to disappear during the war period 30 today black workers are more likely than workers of other races to be unionized a characteristic that typically leads to better wages and black workers in unions receive higher wages and better benefits than black workers who are not in unions 31 it is also true that black union workers today are more likely to be older female more educated and working in the public sector than they were in the early 1980s 32 yet unionization rates among black workers have fallen dramatically due to a changing u s economy and efforts by conservative and corporate interest groups to weaken organized labor over the past several decades 33 in 1983 31 7 percent of black workers were represented by a union compared with just 13 8 percent of black workers in 2018 34 this decline in unionization goes hand in hand with a decreasing share of income going to the middle class putting even more pressure on groups who have historically lagged behind 35 infrastructure crisis in flint michigan a 2016 report from the alliance for american manufacturing underscored the need to center communities of color in the trade debate 36 it found that deindustrialization has had a devastating broad effect on black workers families and communities pointing to the case of flint michigan as an example as of 2006 the city of flint had lost tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs largely due to the steady decline of its auto industry in 2011 the negative economic effects on flint were so profound that then michigan governor rick snyder r declared a state of fiscal emergency 37 to save money government officials began drawing the city s water from the flint river rather than from the detroit river or lake huron the water from the flint river was polluted and reacted badly with the pipes that brought water into the city introducing toxic levels of lead into the water supply some reports maintain that deindustrialization including decades of plant closures and layoffs that eviscerated flint s tax base ultimately eroded the city s infrastructure which in turn jeopardized the health of thousands of flint s residents 38 officially 12 people died and 90 were sickened from legionnaires disease a severe form of pneumonia caused by legionella bacteria found in flint s drinking water though it remains unclear how many children will face mental development issues due to the exposure to high levels of lead 39 five years later flint residents still do not have certain access to clean water 40 temporary workers in manufacturing furthermore the use of temporary workers or temps in industries such as manufacturing is growing 41 a growing body of research shows that temporary work arrangements are lowering wages and standards for manufacturing workers especially for black workers who comprise 26 percent of the temp workforce compared with just 12 1 percent of the overall workforce 42 one study shows that higher wage manufacturing plants use fewer temporary workers and that unionization rates negatively correlate with a manufacturing plant s use of temporary workers 43 in some instances temp agencies have even enabled companies to unlawfully discriminate in hiring 44 a 2016 investigation of temp agencies found that worksite employers and their temp agencies discriminated against black and female job applicants 45 such arrangements have increasingly46 allowed companies to divide workers collective power and ultimately drive down wages as businesses are motivated to minimize labor costs and liabilities 47 nafta 2 0 and the road not taken trade policy offers an avenue through which policymakers can either exacerbate or counter the negative effects of job dislocation on employment and workers wages particularly for black workers that arise from integrating lower wage workers into the global economy without robust labor and environmental standards and enforcement as well as other government investment strategies globalization and trade will continue to exert this predictable downward pressure on wages and employment among certain populations and regions while policymakers have recognized racial justice as a principal progressive priority they have largely failed to recognize trade s effect on communities of color 48 this should spark concern for progressives as congress considers new trade deals such as the usmca that will have lasting effects for decades to come progressives should keep in mind what is at stake for communities of color including but not limited to black people who already face disproportionate economic and socio economic hurdles 49 trump s trade deal will have devastating effects on black americans health among other problematic aspects president trump s proposed trade deal locks in high prescription drug prices for big pharma while higher prescription drug prices hurt everyone they disproportionately affect black people who tend to hold much less wealth than white americans report significantly worse health conditions across socio economic status and are disproportionately uninsured for this reason access to prescription medications is an issue of particular importance for black communities and those who advocate for them 50 trump s trade deal poses a threat to the environment president trump s proposed deal also fails to include or address environmental injustices and the threats of climate change although everyone is harmed by the effects of industrial pollution and climate change black people are more likely to live near polluters and breathe polluted air and are thus more likely to be exposed to fine particulate matter a known carcinogen than their white counterparts 51 moreover studies show that natural disaster preparation varies by race and that the long term impacts of disasters disproportionately fall on low income communities of color making the centrality of environmental enforcement especially important to black communities 52 conclusion policymakers need to recognize that even though black communities are hurt most by the lack of environmental standards and expanded monopoly protections for pharmaceutical companies and stand to benefit most from a progressive approach to trade black people would not be the sole beneficiaries a progressive rewrite of the rules governing trade could also function as a comprehensive strategy to support economically competitive high road trade policies that would empower a thriving middle class and climate sustainable growth across nations as written president trump s agreement does nothing to mitigate the negative effects of the decline in manufacturing on the contrary it omits strong and enforceable provisions that would protect labor rights 53 without strong standards and meaningful labor enforcement the usmca will simply maintain subminimum wages in mexico and continue the trend of manufacturing jobs moving overseas displace american workers and ultimately inflict the most harm on communities who are already structurally disadvantaged by wider economic challenges daniella zessoules is a special assistant for economic policy at the center for american progress the author would like to thank onyeka obi an intern with the economic policy team at the center for their research help and input

subir roy senior economic analyst of all the fresh ideas in the 2019 20 union budget it did not have too many the one that has become the most controversial is the move to issue sovereign currency bonds in foreign markets to meet a part of the government s gross borrowing programme virtually all commentators have opposed the idea with some qualifying it by saying that a token issue will do no harm the important thing will be not to go ahead with the practice in a bigger way over time but going by news reports the government seems to be not only moving ahead with the idea but also looking at a fairly large issue of 3 4 billion to begin with the indian government has so far stayed away from commercial borrowing abroad restricting itself to loans from multilateral agencies like the world bank this has allowed it to keep its sovereign external debt to a low 5 per cent of the gdp hence there is space now for some sovereign commercial debt to be raised abroad but as raghuram rajan former rbi governor has explained this space would not have existed had the government done earlier what it is seeking to do now what is the government s rationale for going in for a bit of what it has carefully stayed away from till now issuing a bit of say dollar bonds abroad at a very good that is low rate of interest will enable the government to create a benchmark which will then let private borrowers access funds abroad more cheaply than till now the chances of the government getting a good rate now are high because the international markets are currently flush with funds but the present situation needs to be treated with caution a scenario of excess liquidity can easily turn into one of scarcity if a financial crisis manifests itself it is useful to recall that when the global markets were flush with petro dollars after the oil price rises of the seventies latin american countries were encouraged by global bankers to borrow freely and they did then when the global financial crisis hit in 2008 and liquidity vanished there was massive latin american default another reason cited by the government is that by taking a part of its borrowing programme abroad it will be creating space for domestic borrowers who will likely see a fall in interest rates this will encourage greater private borrowing and facilitate the much needed investment but the government can achieve the same result leave space for private borrowers by directly taking recourse to the rbi and not have to go abroad the foremost reason given by those who are opposed to the idea is that it will make the government of india bear the currency risk for repayment rupees will have to be converted into dollars at the then going rate on the other hand if the same foreign investors bought rupee denominated government bonds in india at the time of encashment they would be able to convert the rupees to dollars at the then going rate if the rupee depreciates against the dollar over time as is likely the government would be the loser if it borrowed abroad and the gainer if it borrowed at home if despite this the government seeks to borrow abroad it can be under one scenario it needs to shore up its foreign currency reserves which are running low this was the case when india faced its worst currency crisis in 1991 and went in for quasi sovereign borrowing by getting the state bank of india to issue the india development bonds the current situation with reserves running at over 400 billion is the opposite india s reserves are plentiful and there is absolutely no need to borrow abroad to acquire further reserves and take on a bit of exchange risk what is more further significant accretion to reserves will raise the value of the rupee vis à vis the dollar and make life difficult for exporters one question mark that hangs over the decision is its timing the government has said it has been debating this idea internally over a long time and has now decided to go ahead with it this prompts the question why right now by borrowing abroad the government will be integrating the economy further with the global economic structure on the other hand currently there is a degree of uncertainty across the world over the merits of globalisation which is a part of the free market system that has been embraced across countries since the demise of the soviet union so india seems to be moving towards globalisation at a time when there is a case for rethinking things there can however be a non economic reason for going in for this economic gambit there is a good chance that at this juncture india will be able to issue foreign currency bonds at rates comparable to what the top economies are getting once this happens india will have the pleasure of seeing itself among the leading global powers this will be grist to the mill for the current dispensation which likes to project a muscular image of india it is the same mindset that has put the goal before the nation of becoming a 5 trillion economy the bottomline is we don t need the hard currency it comes with some risk but getting it under currently available terms will be good for our self perception
the nicaraguan government s violent repression against demonstrators protesting its brutal neoliberal policies resulting in more than 300 people being killed by regime forces since april 2018 is only one of the reasons why various leftist social movements have condemned the nicaraguan regime led by president daniel ortega and vice president rosario murillo the left has many more reasons to denounce the policies of the regime to understand this we must go back to 1979 that year saw the victory of an authentic revolution in nicaragua that combined a popular uprising self organization of cities and neighborhoods in rebellion and the action of the sandinista national liberation front frente sandinista de liberación nacional fsln a political military organization inspired by a marxist guevarist castroist model the revolution put an end to the 42 year authoritarian rule of the somoza dynasty which had appropriated the state its armed forces administration and significant parts of its economic assets and established a strong alliance with the united states the somoza dictatorship proved to be an effective bulwark against progressive political forces multinationals could maintain and increase their plundering of nicaragua s national resources in exchange for commissions that added to the increasingly important wealth of the ruling family the fsln was founded in the 1960s as a leftist group opposing the government mainly through guerrilla warfare it was not until some of its guerrillas took high ranking members of the nicaraguan ruling classes as hostages in december 1974 that it was considered a potentially serious threat to the dictatorship after the spectacular action of the sandinista guerrillas the regime declared a state of emergency increased its repressive grip over nicaraguan society and hunted down the fsln earlier that year liberal factions of the bourgeoisie opposing the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of the somoza ruling clique had already formed the democratic union of liberation unión democrática de liberación udel under the leadership of pedro joaquín chamorro cardenal editor of the liberal newspaper la prensa they hoped to gather political momentum and force the regime to liberalize the fsln eventually split into three factions the prolonged people s war faction remained committed to the strategy of accumulating forces in remote areas until they would have enough strength to liberate entire regions of the country and launch a final assault against somoza s army the proletarian tendency emerged to challenge the prolonged people s war strategy considering it inadequate given the absence of a permanent occupying army they argued that since the rural populations would not directly witness the imperialist endeavor they would not join the guerrillas in massive numbers furthermore the development of capitalist production in the country with the economic development of the 1950s and 1960s had given rise to an agricultural and industrial proletariat constituting respectively 40 and 10 of the active population by 1978 the proletarian tendency therefore focused on organizing mass working class organizations in urban areas gaining the support of industrial workers with the perspective of launching a swift insurrection when the conditions to do so would be met finally the terceristas whose main figures included daniel ortega and his brother humberto also advocated an insurrectional strategy but were open to tactical alliances with the liberal factions of the bourgeoisie opposing somoza while the proletarian tendency stressed the need for a mass uprising and self organization the terceristas displayed substitutionist tendencies that implied an armed insurrection led by organized guerrillas but without a simultaneous mass uprising would be sufficient to overthrow the regime and take power eventually the regime lifted the state of emergency in 1977 thinking that the guerrilla movement was defeated and the conditions for entering negotiations with the liberal opposition were ripe but fsln factions were prompt to resume their armed actions in urban areas in january 1978 the murder of pedro joaquín chamorro cardenal by regime soldiers was caught on video it sparked tremendous anger among the liberal opposition as well as among the population a general strike supported by the liberal bourgeoisie was launched while fsln groups staged armed actions against somoza s national guard in august another general strike was called sandinista guerrillas staged an assault against the national palace where a joint session of both chambers of the parliament was taking place taking hundreds hostage this resulted in the liberation of several political prisoners from somoza s jails more importantly spontaneous uprisings took place against the regime enabling the left to gain momentum over the liberal opposition after the fsln called for insurrection several urban uprisings errupted in september 1978 while these were decisively defeated by the national guard this scared the liberal opposition whose representatives sought to enter negotiations with the regime that were to be mediated by the u s dominated organization of american states oas the terceristas denounced this turn of events and withdrew from the front they had helped to build with the liberal opposition in january 1979 somoza turned down the proposals of the liberal opposition the momentum was then with the sandinistas who reunited and created the following month the new patriotic national front frente patriótico nacional fpn in which they were the politically dominant force as the fsln prepared to launch a broad military offensive they called for a general strike in june as mass urban uprisings occurred the armed insurrection quickly moved in to liberate areas of the country one after the other somoza s army disintegrated when the army stronghold in the capital was finally liberated on july 19 1979 its remnants had no choice but to flee in particular to neighboring honduras in the new fpn government the revolutionary political forces pledged to install a democratic regime guarantee a non alignment of nicaragua s foreign policy thus putting an end to the alliance with the united states and develop a mixed economy the development of cooperatives and state owned enterprises would be encouraged while the existence of private capital would not be fundamentally threatened as long as it was perceived as patriotic that is loyal to the sandinista revolution rather than to the overthrown somoza regime or u s imperialism during the next two years several developments illustrated how different nicaragua was from other cases in which the left had come to power through elections in latin america these included chile in 1970 venezuela in 1998 1999 brazil in 2002 2003 bolivia in 2005 2006 and ecuador in 2006 2007 due to the destruction of anastasio somoza s army and the flight of the dictator the fsln not only assumed governmental power but also replaced the somocista military with a new army that was put at the service of the people it also took control over the banks and decreed a public monopoly on foreign trade over the 1980s major social progress was made in the areas of health care education improving housing conditions even if they remained rudimentary fuller rights to organize and protest as well as access to credit for small producers thanks to nationalization of the banking system these represented undeniable progress but the fsln government was forced to fight a decade long war against counterrevolutionary forces known as the contras who were heavily supported by the united states unable to satisfy its ambition of direct military intervention washington settled for a low intensity conflict that would strangle nicaragua economically and isolate the fsln politically u s imperialism and its vassals such as the regime of carlos andrès perez in venezuela and regional dictatorships as in honduras that served as the contras staging base found it necessary to contain the spreading of this extraordinary experiment in social liberation and renewal of national dignity in fact social revolt was rampant in the region in particular in el salvador and guatemala where revolutionary forces close to the sandinistas had been active for decades however in 1990 the fsln lost the general election to the right with violeta chamorro the widow of pedro joaquín chamorro cardenal elected president under chamorro nicaragua was to fully embrace the neoliberal austerity promoted by the washington consensus by the end of the decade nicaragua became the second poorest country in the americas after haiti assessing the sandinista experience in the 1990s as a result of disappointed hopes there were those who posited that what was needed was to try to change society without taking power unfortunately it is not possible to change society unless people take power at the level of the state the question is rather how to build an authentic democracy that is power exercised directly by the people for the purpose of emancipation in nicaragua it was necessary to overthrow the somoza dictatorship through the combined action of a popular uprising and the intervention of a political military organization as such the victory of july 1979 remains a popular triumph worthy of celebration without the ingenuity and tenacity of the people during the struggle the fsln would not have succeeded in striking the decisive blow against the somoza dictatorship several questions arise did the fsln go too far in the changes it made in the society did it take the wrong direction or are the disappointing subsequent developments the result of aggression by north american imperialism and its allies in nicaragua and elsewhere in the region in fact the fsln leadership did not go far enough in its radicalization first the fsln leadership did not go far enough in implementing radical measures to support segments of the population who were the most exploited and oppressed beginning with the poor rural population but also with underpaid factory health care and education workers it made too many concessions to agrarian and urban capitalists second the fsln with its slogan national directorate give us your orders did not provide sufficient support to self organization and worker control it placed limits that were highly detrimental to the revolutionary process of course responsibility for the outbreak of the war lies exclusively with the enemies of the sandinista government which had no choice but to confront the aggression nevertheless errors were made in the means of waging the war humberto ortega the head of the army formed a regular army equipped with expensive heavy tanks unsuitable against the guerrilla methods of the contras further the mandatory conscription of the country s youth was unpopular this combined with the errors made in the area of agrarian reform had damaging consequences in a recent interview henry ruiz one of the nine members of the national leadership in the 1980s pointed out the campesinos were not favored on the contrary they were affected by the war the war waged by the contra and the war waged by us agrarian reform was seriously insufficient and the contras took full advantage of that fact much more land should have been distributed to rural families giving them title to the property instead the sandinista leadership nationalized the major somoza estates but spared major capitalist groups and powerful families whom certain sandinista leaders wanted to turn into allies or fellow travelers compounding this error the fsln wanted to quickly create a state agrarian sector and cooperatives to replace the large somozist estates priority should have been given to small and medium private farms distributing property titles and providing material and technical aid to the new campesino owners additionally priority should have been given to support production for the domestic market improving and increasing the domestic and regional market would have made maximum use of organic agriculture methods on the one hand the leadership of the fsln made too many concessions to bourgeois forces who were considered allies and on the other hand engaged in excessive statism or artificial cooperativism the result was not long in coming a part of the population disappointed by the decisions of the sandinista government was attracted to the contras the latter had the intelligence to adopt a discourse aimed at the disillusioned campesinos telling them that they would help them overthrow the fsln this would then result in a fair distribution of land and agrarian reform it was deceitful propaganda but widely believed in the countryside certain people within the sandinista movement conducted surveys on the ground and alerted the leadership to what was happening these included work coordinated by orlando nuñez who remained loyal to ortega despite his initial left wing stance work done by others independent of the government and related to liberation theology came to the same conclusions a number of rural organizations linked to sandinism unag atc etc were also aware of the problems but engaged in self censorship internationalist experts specializing in the rural world also sounded the alarm concessions were made to local big capital wrongly perceived as being patriotic and an ally of the people wage increases were limited and the bosses recieved fiscal incentives in the form of lower taxation such an alliance should have been rejected at each important stage criticism from within and outside of the fsln emerged the magazine envío for instance was founded in 1981 as a publication that provided critical support to nicaragua s revolutionary process from the perspective of liberation theology s option for the poor but such criticism was not taken into account by the leadership which was more and more dominated by daniel ortega his brother humberto and víctor tirado lópez all three supported the tercerista faction which did not have a full understanding of the necessity of self organization and was inclined to alliances with the bourgeoisie they were joined by tomas borge and bayardo arce of the prolonged people s war faction further the four other members of the national leadership did not form a bloc to oppose the continuation and deepening of the errors it is important to point out that proposals for alternative policies were formulated both inside and outside the fsln constructive critical voices did not wait for the 1990 electoral failure to propose new directions but they received only a limited hearing and remained relatively isolated illegitimate and odious debt odious debt according to the doctrine for a debt to be odious it must meet two conditions 1 it must have been contracted against the interests of the nation or against the interests of the people or against the interests of the state 2 creditors cannot prove they they were unaware of how the borrowed money would be used we must underline that according to the doctrine of odious debt the nature of the borrowing regime or government does not signify since what matters is what the debt is used for if a democratic government gets into debt against the interests of its population the contracted debt can be called odious if it also meets the second condition consequently contrary to a misleading version of the doctrine odious debt is not only about dictatorial regimes see éric toussaint the doctrine of odious debt from alexander sack to the cadtm the father of the odious debt doctrine alexander nahum sack clearly says that odious debts can be contracted by any regular government sack considers that a debt that is regularly incurred by a regular government can be branded as odious if the two above mentioned conditions are met he adds once these two points are established the burden of proof that the funds were used for the general or special needs of the state and were not of an odious character would be upon the creditors sack defines a regular government as follows by a regular government is to be understood the supreme power that effectively exists within the limits of a given territory whether that government be monarchical absolute or limited or republican whether it functions by the grace of god or the will of the people whether it express the will of the people or not of all the people or only of some whether it be legally established or not etc none of that is relevant to the problem we are concerned with so clearly for sack all regular governments whether despotic or democratic in one guise or another can incur odious debts the leadership of the fsln should also have questioned repayment of the public debt inherited from the somoza dictatorship and broken with the world bank world bank wb the world bank was founded as part of the new international monetary system set up at bretton woods in 1944 its capital is provided by member states contributions and loans on the international money markets it financed public and private projects in third world and east european countries it consists of several closely associated institutions among which 1 the international bank for reconstruction and development ibrd 189 members in 2017 which provides loans in productive sectors such as farming or energy 2 the international development association ida 159 members in 1997 which provides less advanced countries with long term loans 35 40 years at very low interest 1 3 the international finance corporation ifc which provides both loan and equity finance for business ventures in developing countries as third world debt gets worse the world bank along with the imf tends to adopt a macro economic perspective for instance it enforces adjustment policies that are intended to balance heavily indebted countries payments the world bank advises those countries that have to undergo the imf s therapy on such matters as how to reduce budget deficits round up savings enduce foreign investors to settle within their borders or free prices and exchange rates and the international monetary fund imf international monetary fund along with the world bank the imf was founded on the day the bretton woods agreements were signed its first mission was to support the new system of standard exchange rates when the bretton wood fixed rates system came to an end in 1971 the main function of the imf became that of being both policeman and fireman for global capital it acts as policeman when it enforces its structural adjustment policies and as fireman when it steps in to help out governments in risk of defaulting on debt repayments as for the world bank a weighted voting system operates depending on the amount paid as contribution by each member state 85 of the votes is required to modify the imf charter which means that the usa with 17 68 of the votes has a de facto veto on any change the institution is dominated by five countries the united states 16 74 japan 6 23 germany 5 81 france 4 29 and the uk 4 29 the other 183 member countries are divided into groups led by one country the most important one 6 57 of the votes is led by belgium the least important group of countries 1 55 of the votes is led by gabon and brings together african countries as a dependent country aligned with the united states somoza s nicaragua received a massive amount of foreign lending in the 1970s in addition to multilateral institutions such as the world bank and the imf there were several international private bank lenders while the loans were officially for development they were used to strengthen the authoritarian regime and increase the wealth of somoza and his clique after the latter left the country with most of their assets the new sandinista government was in dire need of funding in order to implement progressive policies and encourage industrialization somoza s debt would soon impede the implementation of such policies when the fsln took power the foreign debt stood at 1 5 billion by 1981 its servicing represented 28 of the country s export revenue admittedly it would not have been easy for the government of a country like nicaragua to face its creditors alone but it could have begun questioning the legitimacy of the debts from the very institutions that had financed the dictatorship the sandinista government could have launched an audit of these debts by calling for citizen participation and could have gained support by the broad international movement around the demand that the debts be abolished agreeing to repay the debt meant defending the interests of the nicaraguan bourgeoisie who had invested in the debt issued by somoza and borrowed from u s banks for the sandinista government repayment also avoided confrontation with the world bank and the imf even with the government s efforts to maintain collaboration these institutions decided to suspend their financial relations demonstrating how useless it was to make the concessions yet after the external debt reached seven billion dollars the fsln government implemented a structural adjustment structural adjustment economic policies imposed by the imf in exchange of new loans or the rescheduling of old loans structural adjustments policies were enforced in the early 1980 to qualify countries for new loans or for debt rescheduling by the imf and the world bank the requested kind of adjustment aims at ensuring that the country can again service its external debt structural adjustment usually combines the following elements devaluation of the national currency in order to bring down the prices of exported goods and attract strong currencies rise in interest rates in order to attract international capital reduction of public expenditure streamlining of public services staff reduction of budgets devoted to education and the health sector etc massive privatisations reduction of public subsidies to some companies or products freezing of salaries to avoid inflation as a consequence of deflation these saps have not only substantially contributed to higher and higher levels of indebtedness in the affected countries they have simultaneously led to higher prices because of a high vat rate and of the free market prices and to a dramatic fall in the income of local populations as a consequence of rising unemployment and of the dismantling of public services among other factors imf plan that degraded the conditions of the poor without affecting the rich the plan introduced in 1988 resembled the usual conditions imposed by the imf and world bank even while these institutions had still not resumed financial relations the fsln government policies were leading the revolutionary process straight into a wall this resulted in the right s victory in the february 1990 election in short the government maintained an economic orientation that was compatible with the interests of nicaragua s wealthy bourgeoisie and major private foreign corporations it was an export oriented economy based on low wages in order to remain competitive on the world market what prevented the revolution from advancing was the failure to put people at the core of the transition that followed the overthrow of the somoza dictatorship not overly radical policies but this was not doomed to happen the government should have paid more attention to the needs and aspirations of the people in rural as well as urban areas to break away from the export oriented extractivist model that depends on competitiveness on the international market the sandinistas could have gone against the interests of the capitalists that still dominated extractivist industry they could have done more to gradually implement protectionist policies in favor of the small and medium sized producers who supplied the domestic market and limited imports this would not have required peasants and small and medium enterprises to sacrifice for the international market instead of encouraging the masses to follow orders given from the top of the fsln self organization by citizens could have been promoted at all levels with citizens given control over the public administration as well as over the accounts of private companies the political institutions developed under the fsln government were not fundamentally different from those of a parliamentary democracy with a strong presidency this structure could not and did not provide the basis for a counter power when the right was elected in 1990 refusal to stand up to creditors that demand repayment of an illegitimate debt is generally the beginning of the abandonment of the program of change if the burden of illegitimate debt is not denounced people are condemned to bear that burden we stress the issue of illegitimate debt because should the oppressive regime of daniel ortega and rosario murillo be replaced it would be essential for a popular government to call into question debt repayment should the right take leadership in the overthrow of the regime we can be certain that it will not call the debt into question in 1989 the fsln government reached an agreement with the contras that put an end to fighting which was of course a positive development yet it was a pyrrhic victory when the sandinista leadership called a general election in february 1990 it felt certain it would win having just negotatied a peace agreement they expected to reap 70 of the votes in the elections they were flabbergasted by their loss the result struck the sandinista leadership with an overwhelming wave of panic the right won partly by threatening that the war would resume with an fsln victory the fsln leadership hadn t perceived the growing discontent within a large portion of the population many observers attributed the result to president daniel ortega s failure to abolish military conscription ed this illustrates the gap between the majority of the people and a leadership that had become used to giving orders many people wanted to avoid further bloodshed and thus reluctantly voted for the right hoping for a permanent end to war others were disappointed by the fsln government s policies in the countryside deficient agrarian reform and in cities negative consequences of the austerity measures enforced by the structural adjustment program begun in 1988 although sandinista organizations could still rely on support among young people workers and civil servants as well as among a significant number of farm laborers after the stunning electoral defeat daniel ortega adopted an attitude that swung back and forth between compromise with the government and confrontation the sandinista leadership with daniel and humberto ortega at its head negotiated the transition with violeta chamorro s new government humberto was still general in chief of a starkly reduced army the most left wing members of the army had been dismissed further on his order four sandinista officers were imprisoned under the pretext that they supplied missiles to the farabundo martí national liberation front fmln which was attempting an uprising in el salvador a few months into violeta chamorro s term a movement protesting massive layoffs in the public services gathered steam trade unions launched a general strike and sandinista barricades were set up in managua and cities acoss the country but the struggle was cut short with the fsln working out a compromise with chamorro s government while some austerity measures were withdrawn others remained part of the sandinista grassroots were disgruntled by the terms of the settlement this was to be the pattern the grassroots would mobilize the fsln would work out a compromise and austerity continued the public sector in both agriculture and manufacturing was reduced the public banking sector dismantled and the state s monopoly on foreign trade ended chamorro incorporated former contras into the police force austerity advanced it must be acknowledged that after the victory of the right a significant part of the estates formerly expropriated from the somocistas after the 1979 victory were appropriated by a few sandinista leaders those who organized this piñata claimed to be securing assets for the fsln against a government that might want to confiscate the party s assets daniel ortega s consolidation of power a grouping of sandinista militants from the revolutionary period came to reject the leadership s orientation in the years that followed that took time and daniel ortega took advantage of the slow dawning of awareness to consolidate his influence within the fsln marginalizing or excluding those who defended a different orientation simultaneously he succeeded in maintaining privileged relations with a number of leaders of popular sandinista organizations who felt that in the absence of anyone else he was the leader most likely to defend the gains made during the 1980s that explains in part why in 2018 the ortega regime still retained the support of part of the population this remained true despite his use of extremely brutal methods of repression ortega s consolidation of power within the fsln in the 1990s is best summed up by in a 2014 article by mónica baltodano former guerrilla commander former member of the fsln leadership and now a member of the movement for the rescue of sandinismo movimiento por el rescate del sandinismo mprs the dispute within the fsln between 1993 and 1995 persuaded ortega and his iron circle of the importance of controlling the party apparatus that became more concretized precisely in the fsln s 1998 congress in which what remained of the national directorate i e the sandinista assembly and the fsln congress itself were replaced with an assembly whose participants were mainly the leaders of the grassroots organizations loyal to ortega little by little even that assembly stopped meeting at that point an important rupture occurred by then it was already evident that ortega was increasingly distancing himself from leftist positions and centering his strategy on how to expand his power his emphasis was power for power s sake mónica baltodano goes on to explain the building of alliances that ultimately led to daniel ortega s coming back to the presidential office an alliance building process started then to increase his power the first was with president arnoldo alemán which produced the constitutional reforms of 1999 2000 ortega s central aims in that alliance were to reduce the percentage needed to win the presidential elections on the first round divvy up between their two parties the top posts in all state institutions and guarantee security to the fsln leaders personal properties and businesses in exchange he guaranteed alemán governability by putting a stop to strikes and other struggles for grassroots demands the fsln stopped opposing the neoliberal policies in the following years the main leaders of the party s once mass organizations became national assembly representatives or were brought into the structures of ortega s circle of power with that they obviously stopped resisting and struggling for all the things they had once believed in those years also saw the forming of ties i wouldn t call it an alliance with the head of the catholic church cardinal obando the main purpose of that linkage was control of the electoral branch of government through obando s personal intimate relation with roberto rivas who had been heading the electoral branch since 2000 it also bought ortega increased influence with both the catholic faithful and the church hierarchy after alemán was charged with corruption and sentenced to 20 years imprisonment the agreement he had concluded with ortega proved to be profitable ortega saw to it that the men he had placed in the judicial system arranged preferential treatment for alemán allowing him to serve out his sentence under house arrest later in 2009 two years after his election as president of nicaragua daniel ortega gave his support to the supreme court s decision to quash alemán s conviction and release him a few days later alemán returned the favor by ensuring that the parliamentary group of the liberal party he led voted for the election of a sandinista at the head of the national assembly the constitutional reforms of 1999 2000 reduced the percentage needed to win the presidential election on the first round to 35 of the votes if the candidate has a five percent margin over the candidate coming in second ortega was elected with 38 07 of the votes in november 2006 and took office in january 2007 he was re elected in november 2011 and again in november 2016 in the 2016 election ortega s longtime partner rosario murillo ran and was elected as his vice president she had long been government spokesperson revolution betrayed since 2007 the policies which have been implemented by ortega and murillo have looked more like the policies pursued by the three right wing governments that succeeded one another between 1990 and 2007 than a continuation of the sandinista experience from 1979 1990 over the past 12 years daniel ortega s government did not carry out any structural reform there was no socialization of the banks no new agrarian reform despite the very important concentration of land in the hands of big landowners no tax reform in favor of more social justice free trade zone regimes have been expanded contracting of internal and external debt has been pursued under the same conditions that favor the creditors through the interest interest an amount paid in remuneration of an investment or received by a lender interest is calculated on the amount of the capital invested or borrowed the duration of the operation and the rate that has been set payments they receive and that allow them to impose policies in their favor through blackmail in 2006 the sandinista parliamentary group voted hand in hand with the right wing mps in favor of a law totally prohibiting abortion there are no exceptions whatsoever including cases of danger to the health or life of the pregnant woman or pregnancy resulting from rape under his presidency ortega has refused to call the measure into question in fact the prohibition was included in the new criminal code that entered into force in july 2008 this retrograde legislation was accompanied by serious attacks on organizations defending women s rights and over the years they have been among the most active in opposition to the ortega government in another very troubling development references to the catholic religion have been systematically used by the regime in particular by rosario murillo who has made a point of denouncing women s rights organizations and the support they receive from abroad in their struggle for the right to abortion as being the devil s work nicaragua is still characterized by very low wages pronicaragua the official agency promoting foreign investment in the country brags of he minimum wage the most competitive at the regional level which makes nicaragua an ideal country to set up labor intensive operations over the recent years labor insecurity starkly increased the informal economy represented 60 of the total employment in 2009 a figure which stood at 80 by 2017 while the number of millionaires increased no progress was made towards a diminution of social inequalities the growth in wealth with the help of daniel ortega s government has mainly benefitted national and international capital furthermore ortega and his family have become wealthier the main trigger of the social protests that started in april 2018 was the announcement by ortega s government of neoliberal measures to be taken concerning social security in particular pension reform these measures were advocated by the imf with which ortega has maintained excellent relations since he took office in a statement published in february 2018 the imf congratulated the government for its achievements economic performance in 2017 was above expectations and the 2018 outlook is favorable staff recommends that the inss reform plan secures its long term viability and corrects the inequities within the system staff welcomes the authorities efforts to alleviate inss financing needs the most unpopular measures were a five percent decrease of the pensions meant to finance medical expenses and a limitation of the annual indexation of these pensions over the inflation inflation the cumulated rise of prices as a whole e g a rise in the price of petroleum eventually leading to a rise in salaries then to the rise of other prices etc inflation implies a fall in the value of money since as time goes by larger sums are required to purchase particular items this is the reason why corporate driven policies seek to keep inflation down rate future pension benefits for the close to one million workers affiliated to the pension system would be based on a less favorable calculation resulting in deep cuts in benefits these were the measures that sparked a mass protest movement at first mainly composed of students and young people other protest movements especially the mainly peasant and indigenous based movements against the construction of a trans oceanic canal quickly joined the canal meant as an alternative to the panama canal would if built en danger both the environment and livelihoods of peasants along the proposed route ortega did postpone the social security re forms but not before he initiated a spiral of repression which resulted in more than 300 protesters being killed by security forces and pro regime militiamen joining the protesters was a population horrified by the government s repressive response the protests radicalized demanding not only the release of those imprisoned but demanding the fall of the regime while unable to provide any evidence the government accused the protesters of being right wing golpistas and terrorists who were working towards regime change with the support of u s imperialism furthermore ortega and murillo strengthened their use of religious fundamentalist references and denounced the protesters as having satanic rituals and practices as opposed to the rest of the nicaraguan people because the nicaraguan people are god s people on 19 july 2018 during the rally on the anniversary of the sandinista revolution to try and strengthen his legitimacy ortega repeated these absurd satanic claims and called on the catholic bishops to exorcize the protesters and chase out the devil which supposedly had taken possession of them by the middle of july the government s policy of terror regained control of the streets subsequently mass arrests took place and several hundred people labelled as terrorists by the government remain imprisoned some tortured and forced to give false confessions by way of conclusion the sandinista revolution started as an extraordinary experience of social liberation and renewal of national dignity in a dependent country whose status as a backyard for u s imperialism had been accepted by its authoritarian dynastic rulers for decades the achievements of the sandinista government between 1979 and 1990 while they allowed for significant improvements of the living conditions of most of the nicaraguans did not break with the export oriented extractivist model dominated by big capital nor did they promote active citizen participation in the economic and political decision making processes the fact that the political institutions and internal organization of the fsln were left undeveloped allowed neoliberalism to regain a foot hold further there were no tools people could use to prevent the ortega regime from corrupting the other government institutions this understanding of the nicaraguan revolution and its degeneration stresses the need for revolutionaries and socialist activists to encourage the broadest possible participation of the masses in the fight for their emancipation as well as to maintain their self organization a corollary is the need for revolutionaries to struggle against the bureaucratization of their organizations leadership beginning with building organizations that respect internal democracy this was underestimated by the fsln which remained a political military organization after it had seized power it did not even organize its first congress as a political organization until 1991 after the victory of the right in 1990 the subsequent steps taken by the fsln leadership under daniel ortega were clearly meant for him to return to power for power s sake the left wing of the fsln which organized critical currents during the 1990s was too timid in its opposition finally the international left needs to have a materialist analysis of social and political processes there is no reason to cling to fantasized ideas of really existing socialism the evolution of the fsln and the policies they led in nicaragua since 2007 should be analyzed for what they are rather than on the basis of what daniel ortega and rosario murillo presumably stood for as fsln activists during the 1970s and 1980s clearly ortega and murillo s deepening of the neoliberal policies pursued by their right wing predecessors as well as their total ban on abortion should be denounced by the international left furthermore the left should strongly oppose the repression currently organized against the protesters and demand the immediate release of all political prisoners in adopting such a stance the left should in no way compromise itself by supporting a right wing pro imperialist opposition on the contrary this stance should be accompanied by an effort to link with and reinforce the critical sandinistas and other members of the progressive opposition to ortega and murillo we need to look toward the youth who have mobilized strongly since april 2018 to the feminist movement and to the peasant and indigenous movements who have opposed the transoceanic canal and other destructive projects linked with the export led capitalist mode

the international monetary fund imf headquarters building is seen ahead of the imf world bank spring meetings in washington us april 8 2019 the appointment of france s christine lagarde to head the european central bank has created a vacancy at the top of the international monetary fund which was established three quarters of a century ago as guarantor of global monetary stability since the imf and the world bank were set up at the end of world war ii to establish a cooperative global economic order after the chaos the conflict had wrought the former has been led by a european and the latter by a united states citizen that convention reflects the economic and political realities of 1945 when the us and europe dominated the emerging new world order there is nothing in the rules however to prevent non western candidates from taking the top posts many have argued that these institutions should cast the net wider to better reflect the realities of the 21st century in which countries such as china now have enormous economic power there are no indications that the us and europe are quite ready to relinquish their hold on the two main global financial institutions this year the tradition of naming someone from the us to lead the world bank was maintained with the appointment of former treasury official david malpass as its president as for the vacancy at the imf france s finance minister bruno le maire has already been quoted as saying the top job there should once again go to a european pragmatists would argue that what matters is not where these top officials come from but rather the policies they pursue the imf has been widely criticized over the years for pursuing western interests by imposing austerity on developing countries in return for its fiscal support in a world in which trade tensions are building and the model of wider globalization is under threat there is more than ever a need for consensus in the top financial institutions to preserve the benefits of cooperation a file photo of christine lagarde lagarde s leadership of the imf was viewed positively in beijing which supported her candidacy for the post she took up in 2011 she backed the inclusion of the chinese yuan into the imf s currency basket previously made up of dollars yen pounds and euros lagarde established a good relationship with chinese leaders and was among world leaders who were in beijing in april to discuss investment opportunities in the belt and road initiative president xi jinping said that in advancing the bri china was applying debt sustainability criteria recommended by the imf so what can china and other imf participants expect of lagarde s successor european or not the key credential of the next imf chief will be to defend the interests of the new world economic powers while maintaining the trust of the us and europe one of the key challenges will be dealing with an irascible and unpredictable white house poorer developing countries will need to know that if economic disaster strikes the imf will be there to bail them out without imposing crippling terms there has been speculation that given asia s new role in the global economy the imf might break with tradition and appoint a non westerner the new york times reported that early shortlists for the top job included singapore s tharman shanmugaratnam and egyptian american businessman mohamed el erian the potential european candidates include the bank of england governor mark carney a canadian who also has british and irish citizenship china already has one of the most senior posts at the imf with former people s bank of china official zhang tao serving as its deputy managing director high on the new imf chief s agenda will be confronting the impact of president donald trump s trade war on china which lagarde recently warned threatens global economic growth and which may cost 455 billion in lost output next year she said there were growing concerns that the most recent us china tariff s could further reduce investment productivity and growth and that trump s threats of tariffs on mexico were also of concern the world bank has been equally gloomy predicting that increased political uncertainty would push down world growth to 2 6 percent this year its weakest since 2016 these are self inflicted wounds that must be avoided lagarde said how by removing the recently implemented trade barriers and by avoiding further barriers in whatever form any downturn will impact smaller economies as well as large ones obliging the new imf chief to deal with emerging crises the imf is due to disburse a new tranche of aid to argentina any day now at the end of the day the nationality of the new imf chief is perhaps the least important thing to consider about lagarde s successor as the financial times commented far more important than nationality is the ability to do one job above all to use the fund s weight to defend the open world economy and help sustain global cooperation harvey morris is a senior media consultant for china daily uk
aa earnings call for the period ending july 18 2019 alcoa corporation aa q2 2019 earnings call 5 00 p m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks operator good afternoon and welcome to the alcoa corporation second quarter 2019 earnings presentation and conference call i would now like to turn the conference over to james dwyer vice president of investor relations please go ahead james dwyer vice president of investor relations thank you sean and good day everyone i m joined today by roy harvey alcoa corporation president and chief executive officer and william oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer we will take your questions after comments by roy and bill as a reminder today s discussion will contain forward looking statements relating to future events and expectations that are subject to various assumptions and caveats factors that may cause the company s actual results to differ materially from these statements are included in today s presentation and in our sec filings in addition we have included some non gaap financial measures in this presentation reconciliations to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures can be found in the appendix to today s presentation any reference in our discussion today to ebitda means adjusted ebitda also a note on our financial statements effective january 1 2019 the company changed its accounting method for valuing certain inventories from lifo to average cost the effects of the change in accounting principle have been retrospectively applied to all prior periods presented finally as previously announced the earnings release and the slide presentation are available on our website with that here s roy roy c harvey president and chief executive officer thank you jim and thank you to everyone for joining today s call in the second quarter we maintained stability in our operations and took several steps to improve the business in our segments bauxite reported healthy profitability and alumina achieved production records and steady profits despite lower alumina prices lower alumina prices combined with other favorable impacts helped our aluminum segment to rebound from quarterly loss even as metal prices weakened further and across our segments our renewed focus on manufacturing excellence continued to bear fruit through greater stability and better operational performance as we had committed our businesses also drove the benefits of lower raw material costs to our bottom line lastly we made a progress on long term projects to strengthen our aluminum portfolio and closed a significant transaction tied to our maaden joint venture which provides immediate benefits for our company while restructuring charges tied to that transaction were largely responsible for a second quarter net loss excluding those special items on an adjusted ebitda basis we reported steady profitability with that let s start with an overview of second quarter results we reported a net loss of 402 million or 2 17 a share excluding special items we reported an adjusted net loss of 2 million or 0 01 per share on an adjusted ebitda basis excluding special items we generated 455 million lastly we ended the quarter with a solid 834 million of cash even after sizable cash outlays in the quarter turning to safety we re disappointed that we experienced two serious injuries in the second quarter both in our aluminum business as a reminder our focus is on preventing serious injuries defined as life ending or life altering both employees are now focused on rehabilitation and recovery still these incidents underscore the importance and urgency of our work to further strengthen our safety programs safety remains our most important goal ensuring that everyone who walks through our doors goes home safe and sound we also made real progress this quarter on a number of portfolio strengthening initiatives we amended our ma aden joint venture agreement and divested our minority interest in the rolling mill the exit reduces operating losses and simplifies our business in saudi arabia our interests in the remaining portion of the ma aden joint venture remain the same in our aluminum portfolio in quebec we reached two competitive six year labor contracts the first at baie comeau and the second at becancour the contract at becancour ends an 18 month lockout at the smelter and the process to fully restart idle capacity gets under way later this month also in quebec we are implementing plans to increase the production capacity at deschambault one of the lowest cost smelters in the alcoa system the canadian government will offset some costs for the project expected to be complete in 2021 in spain we made significant progress toward removing historically uncompetitive capacity from our aluminum portfolio earlier this month we signed a conditional agreement with a private equity investment firm to divest the alcoa aviles and la coruna plants lastly turning to markets while we are reducing our estimate for global aluminum demand growth we continue to project a global aluminum deficit for the year we also see aluminum inventory trending lower and other reasons for optimism with that i ll turn it over to bill for a detailed review of our second quarter results william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks roy let s start with the income statement revenues were flat sequentially as higher volumes and energy revenues were more than offset by lower realized prices for alumina and aluminum revenues declined 868 million year on year primarily on lower alumina and aluminum prices in the quarter restructuring charges drove the net loss attributable to alcoa corporation to 402 million or 2 17 per share on a 185 5 million shares outstanding special items totaled 400 million after tax and non controlling interest of that amount cost related to the mrc divestiture were 319 million also included is a charge of 38 million related to the pension benefit plan offered at baie comeau quebec as part of the new labor agreement we did not take a charge related to our aviles and la coruna smelters this quarter as we did not sign the conditional divestiture agreement until july 5 we expect that charge ranging from 100 million to 140 million depending on the outcome of the process to occur in the third quarter now let s look at the income statement excluding special items our second quarter adjusted net loss excluding special items was 2 million or 0 01 per share improving 41 million sequentially adjusted ebitda excluding special items was 455 million down 12 million sequentially our second quarter ebitda margin was 16 7 two items in the quarter second quarter sg a and r d expenses declined 14 million the non recurrence of the 20 million receivable write offs in the first quarter was partially offset by slightly higher overhead spending our second quarter operational tax rate was 46 5 decreasing eight percentage points sequentially as we trued up the year to date rate to reflect higher earnings in non tax paying jurisdictions let s look closer at the factors driving adjusted ebitda in the quarter this quarter we offset the majority of the impact of slightly lower alumina and aluminum prices lower market prices for alumina and to a lesser extent aluminum drove adjusted ebitda down 79 million sequentially taken together all other impacts improved 67 million sequentially nearly offsetting the price impact a few key points favorable smelter energy prices combined with higher energy sales from brazil hydros to drive adjusted ebitda up 38 million raw material costs improved 22 million primarily from favorable caustic prices the strong us dollar drove another 19 million of improvement a negative impact was from higher production cost of 18 million resulting from scheduled maintenance activities in the bauxite and alumina segments finally we can see the positive impacts of improved operations in our alumina segment reflected in better volume and the benefit of the canadian section 232 tariffs exemption for half of the quarter shown in the other column now let s move to the segments in the segments bauxite adjusted ebitda declined 14 million primarily on higher maintenance costs and lower production at mrn alumina adjusted ebitda was basically flat as improved caustic prices favorable currency and higher shipment volumes almost entirely offset the lower realized alumina prices and higher production costs the aluminum segment adjusted ebitda improved 99 million sequentially on a number of factors lower smelter power costs and higher earnings from the brazil hydros lower alumina costs non recurrence of the receivable write off in the first quarter and we also started to see positive impacts from the spanish smelter curtailments and the canadian tariff exemption non segment impacts netted to negative 29 million down 94 million sequentially intersegment eliminations declined 87 million to negative 1 million in the second quarter as alumina prices were more stable in the quarter turning to the balance sheet we ended the second quarter with cash of 834 million down 183 million sequentially this change from first quarter to second quarter is due to the 306 million in prior year tax payments primarily in australia as well as cash contributions totaling 100 million related to the divestiture of alcoa s 25 interest in the ma aden rolling facility days working capital improved four days sequentially to 31 days with improvements across all working capital components our free cash flow net of contributions from and distributions to non controlling interest was negative 173 million in the first half of the year primarily due to the one time payments moving to the outlook our full year outlook remains mostly unchanged from last quarter s outlook with four adjustments we expect transformation ebitda to improve 10 million to 15 million to nearly breakeven we expect other corporate to be 10 million better a 120 million instead of a 130 million our full year operational tax rate is expected to increase to 55 to 65 as alumina segment profits react to lower market prices in the third quarter to catch up the year to date tax rate we expect approximately 35 million tax expense in addition to the amount calculated using the full year rate given current market conditions capital expenditures are expected to be 40 million lower with return seeking capital at 120 million and sustaining capital at 290 million regarding cash impacts of restructuring depending upon the outcome of the aviles and la coruna process could range from 60 million to 70 million in the second half of 2019 in the appendix we also list additional considerations for the third quarter which provide sequential benefits totaling approximately 75 million to 90 million they include 5 million to 10 million related to higher volume and lower maintenance costs in bauxite 30 million to 35 million related to higher volume lower maintenance cost and lower caustic costs in the alumina segment and then in the aluminum segment 35 million to 40 million of lower alumina costs compared to the second quarter a negative 10 million expected lower brazil hydro prices will be partially offset by expected better rolling results and 15 million related to the removal of section 232 tariffs on canadian origin us sales lower raw material costs and other performance improvements are expected to provide that sequential benefit let me turn it back to roy roy c harvey president and chief executive officer thanks bill in our markets we expect bauxite will remain in surplus this year china is importing and stockpiling additional bauxite from guinea and southeast asia due to dwindling supply in the country and to de risk the long complicated import supply chains involved bauxite depletion in china will likely persist suggesting that chinese refiners will need to seek additional sources of bauxite outside their country in the alumina market we continue to expect a slight 2019 surplus driven by the restart of the alunorte refinery in brazil and lower alumina demand due to an overall decrease in worldwide smelting operations this surplus is partially offset by environmental related reductions in china and india we saw a series of alumina curtailments due to bauxite supply concerns in china and the mismanagement of bauxite residue in both china and india in china specifically the government forced three separate refineries in shaanxi province to curtail due to environmental related issues with bauxite residue we also saw news this past quarter about refinery upgrades implemented to meet emission standards at the same time some chinese inland refineries cut production due to difficulties sourcing appropriate bauxite because of depleted domestic sources those refineries were unable to immediately replace that bauxite from seaborne sources taken altogether environmental concerns in india and china remove almost 2 million ton metric tons of production from our 2019 balance considering all these developments it remains clear that operating in an environmentally sustainable way is a key to success at alcoa we strive to be leaders in environmental health and safety practices which gives us our license to operate and makes us a partner of choice in the industry finally in aluminum we continue to project a global deficit while we still see growing global demand trade tensions macroeconomic headwinds and a slowdown in global manufacturing has informed our lower demand projection we expect these headwinds will likely result in slower growth in aluminum end use sectors this year particularly in the global automotive sector while not in our base outlook ongoing trade talks central bank policy decisions and chinese stimulus measures provide room for optimism and are potential swing factors for aluminum demand both this year and next our 2019 outlook for aluminum supply on the other hand is tighter as the postponement of smelter projects in china and the recent curtailment of a bauxien smelter will outweigh the impact of the planned restart of the abi smelter in becancour quebec which is beginning later this month and will continue into the second quarter of 2020 in china authorities continue to enforce the national permitting policy for smelters which by law caps total aluminum smelting capacity as a result china s aluminum supply growth for 2019 is estimated at less than 250 000 tons equivalent to a growth rate of less than 1 that is one of the lowest chinese year on year growth figures in both percentage and absolute volume terms since 2000 with a sustained aluminum deficit forecast we continue to expect lower global inventories for aluminum inventories measured in days of consumption continue to decline and are expected by years end to reach levels not seen in more than a decade since before the global financial crisis in 2008 because of demand growth and falling stocks we estimate the inventories in days of consumption terms will have steadily decreased from a peak of 119 days in 2009 to an estimated 56 to 59 days at the end of 2019 in the longer term demand in key end use sectors such as transportation construction and packaging is expected to grow steadily over the next decade aluminum will continue to help the global economy meet its energy efficiency and general sustainability objectives as inventories continue to be consumed in this deficit market we are optimistic about the future of aluminum its supply chain and alcoa s role in this industry turning to our operations over the course of the last quarter we ve remained focused on strengthening the company by executing key projects improving processes and reliability and upgrading equipment importantly our drive for consistent manufacturing excellence continue to yield results with production records and renewed stability in operations in bauxite while average daily tons dropped sequentially due to lower production at the mrn mine in brazil and planned maintenance at willowdale in western australia daily production still rose 1 year over year at willowdale we safely completed a major overhaul of the mines crusher last quarter to provide uninterrupted internal supply to our wagerup refinery the mine had built stocks to prepare for the planned maintenance in alumina our refinery portfolio already among the most competitive in the world posted record quarterly production up 2 from the same period last year we re also completing a residue filtration project at pinjarra our second such improvement project at our western australia refineries first successfully installed at kwinana this technology allows residue to be dry stacked conserving both water and land use and providing a more stable residue disposal area given the efficiency and competitiveness of our refineries we re also reviewing equipment upgrades and debottlenecking projects for our alumina plants in both western australia and brazil in aluminum we continue to take steps to strengthen the company overall for example as bill and i mentioned earlier last quarter we divested our minority interest in the ma aden rolling facility with our exit we avoid future capital contributions for the mill and were released of all obligations related to the ma aden rolling company this eliminates ongoing financial losses and frees up future cash our remaining interest in the ma aden jv which includes the mine refinery smelter and casthouse remain intact we also took steps to reinforce our competitive aluminum footprint in quebec first we reached two new six year labor contracts one at baie comeau and another at becancour the contract of becancour ends an 18 month lockout at the smelter a full restart process is scheduled to officially begin july 26 and will be completed in the second quarter of next year good labor contracts ultimately benefit both the employer and employees by increasing the long term sustainability and profitability of plants enabling us to provide good paying jobs now and for future generations at our deschambault facility we ve implemented plans to increase the smelters 260 000 metric tons of annual production capacity by approximately 10 canada s strategic innovation fund will contribute cad10 million to offset a portion of the cad85 million upgrade expected to be complete in 2021 the investment will help deschambault to innovate by acquiring cutting edge equipment to boost its average enable it to lower cost and increase aluminum production lastly in spain we signed a conditional agreement with a private equity investment firm to divest the alcoa aviles and la coruna plants the proposed deal is part of a collective dismissal agreement with workers representatives at both facilities for the acquisition to close however the investment for must provide a credit facility by the end of the month to support future operations or the collective dismissal will take effect earlier in the year these two smelters were curtailed reducing aluminum smelting capacity 5 year over year over the last few years we ve consistently emphasized the importance of our three strategic priorities to reduce complexity drive returns and strengthen the balance sheet at the guidepost that drive our decisions as we enter the second half of the year we will stay true to these priorities to further strengthen alcoa we will continue to emphasize the importance of our safety systems to keep our people from harm and maintain our unwavering commitment to responsible and sustainable practices across our operations a key factor in our corporate reputation we re committed to maintaining the operational improvements we ve made over the first half of the year and we look forward to doing even better in the second half of 2019 as raw material prices remain favorable we ll work to drive those benefits to the bottom line to strengthen our company overall we ll evaluate projects across the globe that remove uncompetitive assets from our portfolio so we can put our capital and efforts behind the assets and projects that generate the best returns alcoa was founded on innovation more than 130 years ago and we will continue our focus on developing breakthrough technology processes and products for a more sustainable future we ll undertake these efforts to make our company more competitive and strengthen our balance sheet as appropriate all to provide consistent returns to our stockholders with that bill and i would be happy to take your questions sean please remind us of the instructions and we ll get started questions and answers operator we will now begin the question and answer session our first question will come from david gagliano with bmo capital markets please go ahead david gagliano bmo capital markets analyst hi thanks for taking my questions i don t have a lot tonight just in terms of the canadian deal the becancour restart we know that s a low cost asset can you frame the volume impact and separately help us to frame the ebitda impact somehow and obviously assuming prices and input costs remain the same as they are now once that asset restart and also the timing of that ramp up to full production by 2q 2020 roy c harvey president and chief executive officer yeah so dave the ramp up you know we are running part of the plant currently right so we are still running half of the line the ramp up will be occur through the second quarter and essentially be much more weighted into the first half of next year so minimal tons in the third quarter some tonnage in the fourth quarter and then tons in the first half as far as you saw that we put out a range of restart costs so in the second half we re anticipating 30 million to 35 million of after tax restart costs in the first half of next year an additional 30 million to 35 million of after tax restart costs but i would tell you that the plants turns ebitda positive under current market conditions in the second quarter and i would anticipate that the plant essentially pays for the restart over the course of the next 12 months so it overcomes those restart costs over the next 12 months so that s the detail that we re able to provide david gagliano bmo capital markets analyst okay that s helpful thank you and then just my unrelated follow up in alumina and bauxite when you add up the equipment upgrades and the debottlenecking programs that were mentioned on the call what do you think your alumina and bauxite volumes will be once those are finished and what s the timing william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer we gave guidance specifically around the third quarter dave so we are guiding to a pretty strong third quarter so just to be clear around the third quarter we essentially said a couple of things 30 million to 35 million of ebitda improvement in the third quarter associated with better volumes the lower maintenance costs and the lower caustic costs in alumina so that s the outlook that we provided roy c harvey president and chief executive officer and dave i d also tie it back to the ranges that we gave as far as production and shipments for the year better said william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer yes it s good roy c harvey president and chief executive officer so that that gives you a good way to double check the information that bill is giving you and then also look forward at what s remaining for the second half of the year william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so we have done 6 7 million metric tons in the first half and we re predicting 13 6 to 13 7 for the year so that allows you to back into what the second half looks like david gagliano bmo capital markets analyst totally understand for 2019 i was really getting up beyond 2019 it sounded like and maybe i misunderstood the prepared remarks i thought we re more geared toward longer term projects in alumina and bauxite what i m asking is with the projects that you have in the pipeline now what do you think your alumina and bauxite volumes would be in say for example three years from now based on the projects that you have approved between you and alumina limited roy c harvey president and chief executive officer yes i think the answer is going to be dave that we don t have those those larger projects yet approved david gagliano bmo capital markets analyst all right roy c harvey president and chief executive officer and so where we find ourselves is in essentially the engineering stage and so once we have the final details in engineering we then have a look at markets and how we see those markets evolving because as you can imagine these are projects that pay off over a number of years and we ll then make a decision on it so at this point i would say that we are on our normal creep trajectory and you can see that through the historical production figures but we are always trying to find a way to drive some production improvements across the portfolio these projects and whether it s in brazil or western australia that would be step changes that would offer more tonnages and as we finalize the engineering we will give you a better overview of what those projects cost and the kinds of tonnages that would be coming out david gagliano bmo capital markets analyst okay that s helpful thank you roy c harvey president and chief executive officer thanks dave william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks dave operator our next question comes from chris terry with deutsche bank please go ahead chris terry deutsche bank analyst hi bill and roy couple of questions from me the first one just on the cash balance in terms of the stated 1 billion minimum just interested in your comments around the current move in interest rates lower what that might do to your unfunded pension and how we think about that 1 billion versus the current cash balance and then the second question is just around the cash flow slide 25 adding those items together gives around 75 million to 90 million benefit related to better caustic maintenance et cetera and then in the quarter alumina and aluminum now coming off into this quarter just thinking about free cash flow specifically when you step through perhaps the restructuring costs in spain and any other capex items just directionally how you think about the free cash flow there and then just related to that the 15 million in the section 232 number that you ve guided to i thought it was a little higher than that i thought more like 10 to 12 per month is the number i remember just some comments on that as well thanks william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer chris you re limited to two questions i think you worked in like six or eight there i think i think i tried to tried to capture all of them so let me take a crack and roy if i missed any you jump in you re right interest rates are lower and that means that discount rates on the pension are lower and we give a sensitivity of approximately 160 million on the liability for every 25 basis point move in in the discount rate year to date discount rates i don t recall off the top of my head but we re probably in the 50 basis point to 75 basis point lower year to date but the year is not over and interest rates we know change during the course of the year so you can use a sensitivity there to get an idea of how our pension liability will perform however i would tell you that on the asset side we year to date have had a pretty good year along with the with the strengthening the markets so we ve gotten expected return on assets of 6 75 we ve exceeded that year to date i m not going to provide the exact number because the year is not over yet but we will be able to make up some of that negative differential from lower discount rates should those persist with better asset returns as you know we ve transitioned our asset portfolio to much more of a traditional asset portfolio largely focused around equity investments and a liability hedging structure that s that s much more of a physical liability hedging structure than any type of an option structure so overall the year is not done but better asset returns this year than what we ve seen in the past as far as free cash flow goes there is a lot of questions embedded in that i would point you to the cash considerations page tries to walk you through or the cash consideration section in the outlook page tries to walk you through some of the big cash considerations for the year but as you alluded to we are projecting performance improvement in the third quarter and we gave a lot of details around that performance improvement in the third quarter that will be that will be at least today partially offset with some of the lower prices that we re seeing but that remains to be seen what what prices will do as far as free cash flow items to keep in mind i believe we ve guided to 60 million to 70 million of spain cash outflow in the rest of the year associated with either of the two potential outcomes in spain we ve guided to 30 million to 35 million of abi in the second half of restructuring charges so overall i think you can look at the considerations on the considerations page for free cash flow let me address the cash balance and we and i think your question started with the cash balance and we have a target of having 1 billion of cash on hand we ended the quarter with 834 million i would suggest to you that s not a bad outcome we handled as roy said a legacy a future liability in mrc so we paid 100 million in the second quarter to exit mrc that was a combination of a trailing cash call associated with the earnings of mrc from 34 million and an additional contribution of 66 million associated with getting out of the future losses and future debt repayment of mrc so i m actually very pleased with that outcome and then on top of that we made trailing cash payments associated with the earnings the outsized earnings in 2018 of around 306 million of cash payments on taxes associated with the earnings so even though we weren t able to maintain our 1 billion cash balance the 834 million is a pretty good outcome and then the last one the 232 sorry i had it written down here recall that we have a partial quarter benefit associated with 232 in the second quarter so when we guide toward an incremental 15 million benefit in the third quarter that s on top of the 10 million benefit that we got in the second quarter so in aggregate now that canada is exempted from the 232 tariffs we would anticipate an annual benefit of approximately 200 million from the 232 tariffs so that as you said was approximately 10 million before we bring back abi i m sorry 10 million a month before we bring back abi abi helps with that so in aggregate 200 million on an annual basis so i hope i have addressed all of your questions chris terry deutsche bank analyst yes you got them all thanks very much appreciate all the detail william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer good thanks chris operator our next question comes from timna tanners from bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead timna tanners bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey guys good evening i just wanted to roy c harvey president and chief executive officer hi timna timna tanners bank of america merrill lynch analyst hello i just wanted to review with you you ve been going through your assets pretty methodically and calling out ones that are underperforming and disposing of them but what s left that s not core specifically wondering about the rolling mill and warrick and since you have no longer broken that out is that an asset that could be split off are there other assets that are not core you re expanding in a market that is actually shrinking in terms of demand and so i m wondering if you re still looking to reduce or if you re actually kind of more in expansion mode so i guess two questions in there roy c harvey president and chief executive officer timna let me let me hit that first and then bill bill can chime in we re careful not necessarily to drive to define what is core and what s not core but rather what assets are we the best owners of and there is some obvious ones like pinjarra or wagerup that we would argue that we are certainly the best operators but when you look at assets like warrick or the brazilian hydros these are assets that are very valuable to us and i believe particularly with warrick we re bringing a significant improvement in volumes in qualities and the ability to drive improving relationships and contracts with our customers and as well as putting some capital to use so i think we re we re putting the right emphasis and making the right changes to see that to see those assets improve for the long term however to call them core which i think implies that we would never consider a divestiture is a bit further than we would go it comes down to fair pricing and it also comes down to a review on the uses and deployment of cash that we have for the future and so when you look across the portfolio you ve got sort of a couple of that i ve already mentioned you also have a series of plants where we re taking very active active and deliberate deliberate actions in order to improve them whether they are in the aluminum portfolio or alumina or bauxite and these are places that are really inside of our core businesses but where we have real levers to try and improve them i call attention to san ciprian in spain which is has a challenging energy situation and portland in east australia which also it shares a challenging energy situation as well and when you look at assets that still have potential for fundamental changes when you think about the sao luis smelter down in brazil which is currently completely idled it s a place where if you have the right power contract you could see a very different outcome for that so we try and drive across or we try and analyze and look for opportunities across all of those to improve them but also look for ways in order to make our portfolio better performing over the long term william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah the only thing i would add to that roy and it s really just a compliment what you said and timna what i would point you to is consider what we were able to accomplish in the second quarter and i think that i think we showed in the second quarter that we re willing to take action in our portfolio when we need to take action so in aggregate just to summarize we got the mrc deal done we got abi to a position where we ve gotten a labor agreement in abi and we re in the process of in late july restarting it we got a labor agreement in baie comeau that positions us for success for the next six years we moved the ball significantly in spain right we did the final chapter isn t written yet in spain at aviles and la coruna but i can tell you and from my perspective i thought it would take us a lot longer to get where we ve gotten in spain and i think we ve done a great job there we ve announced a small expansion at deschambault and it s not huge but it s a 10 creep project at deschambault which has good economics at the same time we re recovering on stability in our alumina business and we ve shown that in the production numbers and the mining business just keeps kind of chugging along successfully so i think i think our future actions are probably best informed by what we were able to accomplish in the second quarter timna tanners bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay that s helpful if i could i wanted to understand a little bit better your outlook because on the one hand if you read through your release and the presentation you clearly are calling for smaller deficits and bigger surpluses but your commentary it sounded more upbeat but i just want to understand do you think that recently shrunk chinese demand is a temporary situation because of the consumer s lack of confidence around trade for example do you think that we can see aluminum demand resume kind of historical patterns could you just comment a little bit more about how you re thinking about the outlook and supply and demand going forward and the three factors you said that could turn the market for the positive could that be a delayed outcome if we see like the central banks and the chinese stimulus and the trade war get a positive outcome or do you think that would have a pretty quick impetus thanks roy c harvey president and chief executive officer yeah timna so that s i think you put your finger on on an important topic and so and i think you actually did a pretty good job at answering part of your own question which is always nice from my perspective so remember that when we sit down to prepare for earnings it is by necessity a snapshot of how we see current conditions and so what we ve been trying to do is not just provide a snapshot but also to try and help help you and help our other investors and analysts to understand what can be affecting that both upwards or downwards i think when we look at the amount of volatility in the market today and just the turbulence around announcements on a day by day basis around trade etc and how that connects with economics and then of course how that connects with aluminum i think we re seeing just an incredible amount of volatility and so that volatility then impacts how quickly manufacturing is growing and consuming materials and so aluminum has the incredible benefit over these years of being so intertwined with so many different parts of the economy it has an incredible growth story and so even given some of these uncertainties in these trade tensions etc it continues to be a place where growth is happening it s just that when we take a snapshot of how we ve seen that develop over these this first six months of the year it led us to give a lower demand view than what we had given in the past the second part of the question is is i would argue even more important because the past is not necessarily a good indicator of the future here the first thing you asked was is does this indicate slower growth in the future and i think that very much depends on how you look at the future developing i think at some point we will be past the trade tensions i think we will we are already seeing financial stimulus inside of china and if there if their relative slow down they continue to grow pretty nicely from an economy standpoint as you continue to see some of the some of that slowdown inside of their economy you re going to see more stimulus that moves from financial to physical and to infrastructure and that will then give you a number of impacts positive impacts particularly in aluminum and so from that standpoint i don t think that this particular earnings snapshot is indicative of the long term potential that aluminum has as a commodity and i d also turn your attention to the other side of the supply demand balance which is supply i think one of the one of the hallmarks of what we re seeing in the world today is that you re also seeing action on the supply side i d call your attention in aluminum specifically to the fact that china is growing the least amount of aluminum productive capacity since 2000 and so that is i think that is a very disciplined response to the fact that that there is some of this uncertainty happening in the market itself and i think that shows that there is a lot more discipline to the aluminum market in today s world and i think also on the alumina side not to leave that behind i also think that people are finding the alumina business and production to be very complicated very complicated particularly in a world today where the environmental repercussions of good or bad tailings management is more and more important and so painfully highlighted with what s been happening around the world and so that i think bodes well for the future of our industry because it will help to level the playing field and ensure that each and every refinery around the world is following that same set of environmental dynamics and designing those refineries or those bauxite mines or those aluminum smelters in a way that allows for a sustainable production and sustainable growth so i think what we ve been trying to portray is that the balances that we see still remain in good control we are seeing this economic slowdown for 2019 but we still have a lot of optimism not only for declining inventories this year but for a very bright future of aluminum into the future timna tanners bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay thank you roy c harvey president and chief executive officer thanks timna operator our next question comes from paretosh misra with berenberg please go ahead paretosh misra berenberg analyst great thanks for taking my question it seems to me like there is some incremental interest in aluminum as a material of choice in packaging because of sustainability benefits that you highlighted actually and some of the packaging companies have seen big share price gain this year so just wondering is that packaging business completely scrap based or how or when does it begin to make a bigger impact on the supply demand for the primary aluminum side roy c harvey president and chief executive officer yes paretosh so that s a it s an interesting question because is it scrap based it s almost indifferent that if you continue to grow the consumption of aluminum if you would continue to embed aluminum into your into these new into these new products it drives higher consumption of the metal across all of the metal sources and that in the end is good for alcoa and for other metal producers and because there is only so much scrap available and now that scrap availability changes as you start to see more recycling in different economies or you start to see the end of some of the infrastructure that is then replaced with new infrastructure but we don t necessarily see scrap as a as a competitor for for our business and in fact look for ways to also use recycling to strengthen our business whether it s by bringing recycled products into our casthouses connected with our smelters or whether it s in our warrick plant where we actually bring in scrap from some of our customers and from elsewhere so i see that as additive and so the more that we can drive the more we can drive these new products and the more that we can segment our market and the more we can convince people about not only recycled content but low carbon aluminum content or also just the sustainable nature through for example the aluminum stewardship initiative the more we can drive this awareness of the sustainability baked in to alcoa s products and we have a series of what we like to think of as green aluminum ecolum ecodura in the sustana line the more we can drive that the better it is for our industry and by turn the better it is for alcoa so i think that is i think that is a story that still has a lot to develop and it s one of the reasons that we re working as hard as we are on elysis which is the will be the lowest lowest carbon aluminum on the planet once we get that out to commercial production paretosh misra berenberg analyst okay got it interesting thanks for that and then second follow up on the raw material side in the smelting business after all these recent changes what s your position with regard to anodes are you are you going to be net short or self sufficient william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer regarding anodes we still do some importing of anodes from china but it s a fairly small amount paretosh so we make the majority of our anodes in our own facilities in our smelters in our bake furnaces in the smelters so a small amount of imported anodes from china paretosh misra berenberg analyst got it thanks bill thanks roy roy c harvey president and chief executive officer thanks paretosh operator our next question comes from matthew korn with goldman sachs please go ahead matthew korn goldman sachs analyst hey good evening everybody just a couple left for me so you withdrew from the ma aden rolling company last month what prompted the decision to do it now did you see some reason to downgrade your expectations on the achievable potential achievable returns of that particular asset and if so why roy c harvey president and chief executive officer let me let me start on that and bill can chime in if he wants to add i don t think there was a particular catalyst from a business standpoint the fact is is as we went into to separation a number of years ago and as we watch that plant develop it wasn t what ma aden had in mind for the development of that plant just didn t fit with our capital allocation priorities and to be quite honest it wasn t generating the types of cash flows and returns that we would want from that that deployment of capital and so as we as we continue to drive improvements in our bauxite mine and alumina refinery in country which is now operating very stably or aluminum smelter which has been operating stably for a while now the fact that that rolling mill and the test automotive mill was not performing stood out more and more and so as those discussions were developing inside of the board room and as we saw some of the as we saw an opportunity in order to make a change it just happened to it happened to coincide with the with some of the some of the factors and some of the things that ma aden was considering and so it became a good opportunity for us to discuss what would it take for us to exit that particular that particular joint venture william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer and so you re spot on roy i mean just a couple of the the financial aspects of the decision matthew we were as i said we contributed 100 million 34 million of that was a capital cost associated with past losses so we contributed an additional 66 million to be able to exit the rolling mill to put it in perspective that rolling mill in 2018 we had approximately 35 million of losses in our income statement in 2018 associated with the rolling mill and going forward we had approximately 300 million of debt our share associated with that mill outstanding so we essentially we re exiting an ebitda breakeven mill that was looking at significant cash associated with debt repayment in the future all for an incremental 66 million after the cash call and it came down to a financial decision to exit roy c harvey president and chief executive officer and if i can just add one more piece to matthew we ve been part of the concept behind the warrick rolling mill go was up going with alcoa corporation was so that we d have a complete product offering through time what we found is that yes we have been able to commercialize the saudi arabian rolled products but we ve also been able to develop a customer base that is very tied to warrick and that i think is has helped our customers both to improve themselves but has also been very very profitable and has helped us to grow volumes inside of the warrick rolling mill and so i think we re in a pretty good spot even though we were exiting that joint venture we re still in a very good spot commercially for the warrick business as well matthew korn goldman sachs analyst got it guys i really appreciate all that detail let me just sly one more small one in bill you did say that given current market conditions you re bringing down capex for the year is a little bit lower what in particular are you slowing in response to market when you re looking that over the rest of the year roy c harvey president and chief executive officer we had built in some amount of capital associated with some growth projects that we were looking at really from in the engineering phase and we have slowed those down a little bit and then on the sustaining capex side you can see we ve just trimmed from a 300 million estimate to 290 million estimate so a very small amount but it essentially says hey in today s market environment with the target that we have of keeping 1 billion of cash cash on the balance sheet we re really tightening the belt to try to make sure that every capital dollar that s spent makes a lot of sense operator our next question comes from lucas pipes with b riley fbr please go ahead lucas pipes b riley fbr analyst yes thank you very much and good evening everyone i wanted to ask an industry question i think in the past you made references to what percentage of the global aluminum supplies uneconomical and i think you also specifically highlighted that china now we ve had a change in a lot of the input factors on the pricing side etc i wondered if you can give us an update as to where you see kind of breakeven in china what percentage is economical and then also around the rest of the world thank you william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer yes lucas so i ll tell you that with the flat cost curve that we re seeing now that can that can shift pretty quickly and so let me let me illustrate that first by talking a little bit about the alumina cost curve so if you take today s conditions we estimate about 7 of the rest of the world and about 5 of china are under water and so that s that s a pretty a relatively small amount when you think about where how much pricing has changed through time again when you look at aluminum and again you take the current api or current alumina pricing and take the and current aluminum pricing you end up with about 4 rest of the world and 2 in china however if you go back a week ago where alumina prices were higher both in china and in the rest of the world you ended up with almost a third of chinese capacity under water so relatively small changes in the underlying input raw materials or in alumina in the case of aluminum can have some pretty significant impacts across the market so it s it tends to be a pretty dynamic calculation lucas pipes b riley fbr analyst that is very helpful thank you for that detail maybe one last follow up on the inventory side what s your perspective on shadow inventories and do you have a sense for where inventory stand in china versus the rest of the world thank you william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer yes we tend to we tend to try and aggregate all of the inventories that we see out there and so when you think about the what you can actually see on the london metal exchange or on the chinese exchange we try to take that and then add on to it our understanding of what is sitting in the market and we do that by trying to close one eye and listen to everything that we re hearing and i think that we found we ve had good success is being able to being able to understand and evaluate how those inventories are changing and so when i when i mentioned the sort of how those inventories are developing those are meant to actually include the shadow inventories or the inventories that are also held off exchange we also have a couple couple of small warehouses that we run inside of our plant so that helps us to understand some of the financials and economics associated and it also gives us a front row seat to see when when people are interested in warehousing aluminum as an example and baie comeau is a very good example of the place where we ve done where we ve done that kind of business roy c harvey president and chief executive officer and just to put a fine point on it when we re looking at inventory numbers globally we would say there s probably around 10 7 million metric tons of inventory in the world of which roughly half of that is what you would call shadow we would call it unreported stocks so roughly 2 5 million metric tons in china and 2 5 million metric tons held outside of china so the numbers that we quote and when roy talks about inventories coming down and inventories potentially ending the year at a 10 year low that inclusive of our best estimate of what unreported inventories are operator our next question comes from justin bergner with g research please go ahead justin bergner g research analyst good afternoon roy good afternoon bill roy c harvey president and chief executive officer hey justin justin bergner g research analyst to start your tax situation clearly your tax rate is very high given how your profits and losses split up between the us and the rest of the world from past statements it seems like the cash tax rate isn t too much below the operational tax rate what are your long term strategies that you re either thinking through or working through to try and get that down to a more normal level william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah it s a justin it s a really tough question to answer and i think the reason why i touched tough question to answer is because you hit on it our tax rate is based on the jurisdictions in which we in which we make profits in today s environment we have losses in a number of jurisdictions that have valuation allowances against the taxes and therefore have a essentially a 0 tax rate that s in places like the us and spain conversely we pay taxes and accrue for tax expenses in places where we have long term profitability in places like australia canada brazil and so therefore you can see some some really strange tax rates as profitability gets lower tax rates can get higher as far as taking actions we have nols that can be used in the us so as we hopefully can get profitability in some of our us facilities that profitability will be essentially tax free because we ve got nols to use up so i would tell you that we look at tax planning all around the world and make our best estimate to try to essentially minimize our tax bill but the tax rates that you see are a function of where we make money and where we don t make money justin bergner g research analyst okay i understood but in theory you could acquire earning asset in the us in your industry or an adjacent industry and put those put those nols to use sooner william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer that s correct and i would tell you as we look at capital allocation in any of its forms we take marginal tax rates into consideration so as we look at assets in the us from an expansion perspective in the existing portfolio that we have we apply a 0 tax rate in the near term as we look at opportunities for expansion in australia we apply have applied the 30 tax rate in australia so it is built into our capital allocation model as we consider where we put capital around the world roy c harvey president and chief executive officer and i ll just chime in really quickly and just to support what bill is saying we understand and find that there are ways that we can try to improve the tax situation whether it s driving quick and better improvements in the way that we produce in the underlying cost structure and therefore the profitability of intalco or massena or try and drive more businesses that end up being tax free businesses by down in texas or in other places where we re performing transformation activities in trying to drive some new businesses so those tend to be blocking and tackling but it s trying to find a way to absorb and use those nols it s very important to us justin bergner g research analyst great thank you i just had one quick clarification question for the becancour restart what are the total cash costs that you are anticipating across the remainder of 2019 and 2020 william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah we haven t guided the cash cost but i think i think it s you probably have three components of cash associated with the restart of abi so you ve got the second half after tax expense of 30 million to 35 million we will have some capital expenditures to to get abi back to the level that we want it to be at that s included in the 290 million and the 120 million of return seeking capital and sustaining capital that we ve guided to so those numbers are inclusive of of the restart of abi and there will be some level of working capital i would probably estimate it at the 20 million to 30 million level of working capital build in abi so the three components restart cost 30 million to 35 million working capital estimate of probably 20 million to 30 million and then capex but the capex is built into the guidance that we provided operator our next question will come from michael dudas with vertical research partners please go ahead michael dudas vertical research partners analyst hi gentlemen thanks for taking the question just one question roy wanted to share your current thoughts on how industry governments are trying to get a more fair environment relative to the global aluminum industry roy c harvey president and chief executive officer yeah it s that is certainly something that we have talked a lot about in these earnings calls it s something that we take each and every meeting that we have whether it s here in the us in canada or elsewhere and so i think we ve seen some fits and starts i think just recently we ve seen some discussions around how to are specifically around the subsidization and particularly in china but elsewhere can also be the case and also started to see some movement toward trying to present a united front so that it becomes a bit more complicated when we start fighting about the trade and tariffs and so we re trying to trying to move away from for example the 232 was released in that on canada was a great step forward now we want to start building that partnership with canada with europe elsewhere around the world so that we can start to see start to see a more level playing field we re not trying to shift it in our favor necessarily we re trying to have as orderly an industry as we possibly can and i ll not tell you that that is easy in order to assemble that coalition it takes time and it takes and it takes effort but it is something that i believe i believe and particularly with the oecd report that was just published here a little while ago and without jumping into too much information about that it essentially shows the the incredible and almost order of magnitude size of the subsidization inside of china as opposed to as opposed to what happens in aluminum around the planet i think there s a lot of really good information that we can use in that report and in what we ve been talking about before in order to better strengthen that coalition so more to come but rest assured michael we re trying to we are out there advocating for this and using all of the opportunities we have to explain that to the decision makers operator and our final question will come from john tumazos with john tumazos independent research please go ahead john tumazos john tumazos independent research analyst thank you could you review the share buybacks the shares outstanding at june 30th are about 1 million less than a year ago and could you give a little more background on the ma aden rolling mill not so much the financial numbers as did the market grow last year was there more competition from rolled products coming from china russia or germany or what not roy c harvey president and chief executive officer let me answer your second question first just because i think it s i think it is a point that that s worth that s worth exploring a little bit i think for the ma aden rolling mill specifically it was built with an eye to a very rapidly expanding economic growth circled around aluminum consumption inside of saudi arabia so if you imagine i think the kingdom what they wanted to drive was not just bauxite alumina aluminum rolling it was to also build all of that automotive production inside of country and so that is a very noble purpose and i think we shared in the in that vision and dream to see that grow quickly but i think when it came to pragmatic reality it takes time to develop those industries and so unfortunately for us when we think about the preciousness of our capital resources we don t necessarily as as alcoa corporation have the patience to wait for that to grow and nor do we have any kind of impact that we can bring on trying to grow that into the kingdom and so when you think about the divergence of interest between ma aden and alcoa corporation they are very much tied into what the what this new this new plan inside of the inside of the kingdom is trying to develop and so they by having full control over that rolling mill i think they can also help to help to make that vision more of a reality william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer and let me let me just briefly answer your question around shares outstanding john if you go back to the second quarter of last year where we made earnings we you use a diluted share count and that diluted share count last year was 188 7 million shares that included stock options and awards of 2 3 million shares fast forward to the second quarter of this year where essentially because we re in a loss position we have to the accounting will tell you you have to take a more conservative view of shares outstanding and you have to use the shares outstanding that exclude the equivalent shares so we d be at 185 5 million shares outstanding at the end of the second quarter the differential between the second quarter of last year and the second quarter of this year is the net impact of having bought back shares in the fourth quarter of last year recall that we spent 50 million on share buybacks in the fourth quarter at roughly a 29 0 i should say roughly at 29 03 average share price that we purchased in the fourth quarter of last year that is approximately 1 7 million shares so the differential is the combination of that and any shares that were used as part of management compensation so that s the difference john tumazos john tumazos independent research analyst thank you roy c harvey president and chief executive officer thanks john operator this now concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to roy harvey for any closing remarks roy c harvey president and chief executive officer thank you sean and thank you everyone for your time today as we enter the second half of 2019 we are committed to maintaining all the improvements that we ve made so far this year and we are also hard at work to achieve and do even more so thank you for your time today we appreciate the questions and we look forward to sharing our third quarter results in october back to you sean operator duration 71 minutes call participants james dwyer vice

washington the international monetary fund on wednesday said that the us dollar was overvalued by 6 percent to 12 percent based on near term economic fundamentals while the euro japan s yen and china s yuan were seen as broadly in line with fundamentals reuters reported the imf has been at odds with u s president donald trump over his use of tariffs to resolve trade imbalances but its assessment that the dollar is overvalued is likely to give trump more fodder for his frequent complaints that dollar strength is hampering u s exports trump has railed against european and chinese policies that lead to what he calls devaluation of the euro and other currencies against the dollar the fund s external sector report an annual assessment of currencies and external surpluses and deficits of major economies showed that current account surpluses remained centered in the euro area and other advanced economies such as singapore while deficits remained persistent in the united states britain and some emerging market economies the report said net creditor positions had increased again and were now at a historical peak of about 20 percent of global gross domestic product or about four times the level seen in the early 1990s net debtor positions were at a similar level the fund which has warned that the u s china trade war could cost the global economy about 455 billion next year said recent trade policy actions were weighing on global trade flows eroding confidence and disrupting investment but they had done nothing to reverse external imbalances thus far instead of tit for tat tariffs surplus and deficit countries should work to revive liberalization efforts and strengthen the rules based multilateral trading system that has been in effect for the past 75 years the imf said it said short term financing risks were generally contained since debtor positions were concentrated in reserve currency issuing economies but risks remained for the global economy an intensification of trade tensions or a disorderly brexit outcome with further repercussions for global growth and risk aversion could affect other economies that are highly dependent on foreign demand and external financing it said over the medium term trade tensions could become entrenched and further divergence of external stock positions could trigger costly disruptive adjustments in key debtor economies that could spill over to the rest of the world it said countries with deficits like the united states and britain should pare back spending in a growth friendly manner while those with big surpluses like germany the netherlands and korea should boost public infrastructure investment and discourage excessive saving while the report assessed the euro s valuation as appropriate for the eurozone as a whole it said the euro s real effective exchange rate was 8 percent to 18 percent too low for germany s fundamentals given its high current account surplus the report said that while china s yuan was broadly in line with its fundamentals imf models showed wide divergences with desired policies from an 11 5 percent undervaluation to an 8 5 percent percent overvaluation due to uncertainties over beijing s policy outlook

fourth quarter 2018 dividend as we continue to deliver on the dividend growth plan we outlined two years ago said richard d kinder executive chairman during the second quarter we maintained discipline by continuing to fund growth capital through operating cash flows without accessing capital markets in addition fitch ratings recognized our strengthened balance sheet as it joined other ratings agencies in upgrading our credit rating in short the company had another strong quarter and the future is bright said chief executive officer steve kean these are exciting times for kinder morgan with booming u s natural gas and oil production projected to grow more than 30 percent through 2030 continued kean our north american footprint positions us extremely well in both the near and long term as a leading infrastructure provider for those and other essential energy products kean added one of the foundations for our future growth is the fact that our network connects key natural gas supply basins to robust and growing demand points along the gulf coast more than 70 percent of the forecasted u s natural gas demand growth between 2018 and 2030 is expected to be in texas and louisiana where we already have significant assets in place and key growth projects in our backlog led by the natural gas pipelines segment our commercial financial and operating performance in the second quarter was very strong said kmi president kim dang we generated second quarter earnings per common share of 0 23 compared to an 0 08 loss per common share in the second quarter of 2018 at 0 50 per common share dcf per share was flat to the second quarter of 2018 with 559 million of excess dcf above our declared dividend we also made excellent progress on our gulf coast express pipeline project and defeated a court challenge to our permian highway pipeline project we look forward to completing both of those projects as they are critical to the development of resources in the permian basin continued dang as noted above kmi reported second quarter net income available to common stockholders of 518 million compared to a net loss of 180 million for the second quarter of 2018 and dcf of 1 128 million up from 1 117 million for the comparable period in 2018 these increases were due to greater contributions from the natural gas pipelines segment and lower financing costs partially offset by the elimination of the kinder morgan canada business segment following the trans mountain sale and lower commodity prices impacting our co 2 segment net income also improved year over year due to non cash impairments taken during the second quarter of 2018 advertisement 3 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content kmi s project backlog for the second quarter stood at 5 7 billion 400 million less than the first quarter of 2019 with additions of approximately 400 million in new projects primarily in the natural gas pipelines segment offset by approximately 800 million in projects placed in service and other project capital adjustments excluding the co 2 segment projects kmi expects projects in the backlog to generate an average project ebitda multiple of approximately 5 6 times for the first six months of 2019 kmi reported net income available to common stockholders of 1 074 million compared to 305 million for the first six months of 2018 and dcf of 2 499 million up 6 percent from 2 364 million for the comparable period in 2018 net income for the first six months also improved year over year due primarily to the non cash impairments taken during the second quarter of 2018 2019 outlook for 2019 kmi s budget contemplates declared dividends of 1 00 per common share dcf of approximately 5 0 billion 2 20 per common share and adjusted ebitda of approximately 7 8 billion adjusted ebitda is currently estimated to be slightly below budget primarily due to the delay in elba s in service date lower ngl prices impacting the co 2 segment and the impact of 501 g settlements partially offset by the strong performance of the west region natural gas business unit the 501 g settlements were in line with kmi s previous estimates and the resolution of those matters is a positive outcome albeit not reflected in the 2019 budget dcf is expected to be on budget as lower interest expense offsets the slightly lower adjusted ebitda kmi budgeted to invest 3 1 billion in growth projects and contributions to joint ventures during 2019 kmi now expects to be slightly below that amount due to lower capital expenditures in the co 2 segment kmi expects to use internally generated cash flow to fund the vast majority of its 2019 discretionary spending without the need to access equity markets due to the adjusted ebitda impact discussed above kmi now expects to end 2019 with a net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio of approximately 4 6 times kmi does not provide budgeted net income available to common stockholders the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to dcf and adjusted ebitda or budgeted metrics derived therefrom such as the portion of net income attributable to an individual capital project the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to project ebitda due to the impracticality of predicting certain amounts required by gaap such as unrealized gains and losses on

and henry hub natural gas of 3 15 per million british thermal units mmbtu consistent with forward pricing during the company s budget process the vast majority of revenue kmi generates is fee based and therefore not directly exposed to commodity prices for 2019 kmi estimates that every 1 per barrel change in the average wti crude oil price impacts dcf by approximately 9 million each 1 percent change in the ratio of the weighted average ngl price per barrel to the wti crude oil price per barrel impacts dcf by approximately 3 million and each 0 10 per mmbtu change in the price of natural gas

hedged to minimize this sensitivity details may be found in the supplemental earnings pages posted on kmi s website at of business segments the natural gas pipelines segment s financial performance for the second quarter of 2019 was higher relative to the second quarter of 2018 said dang the transmission assets saw higher revenue on el paso natural gas epng due to increases in its base business and expansion related activity driven by permian basin demand partially offset by the negative impact of the 501 g settlement from tennessee gas pipeline tgp due to projects placed in service and on kinder morgan louisiana pipeline kmlp due to the sabine pass expansion that went into service in december 2018 the segment also benefited from continued growth on its gathering and processing assets in louisiana and texas due to increased drilling and production in the haynesville and eagle ford basins respectively natural gas transport volumes were up 10 percent compared to the second quarter of 2018 with the largest gains on epng and kmlp followed by colorado interstate gas pipeline company cig wyoming interstate company wic and ruby pipeline this constitutes the sixth quarter in a row in which volumes exceeded the previous comparable prior year period by 10 percent or more epng benefited from permian related activity and colder weather in california kmlp s increase was due to the sabine pass expansion in service cig improved due to increased production in the dj basin and colder weather wic saw higher flows from the dj and powder river basins and ruby volumes were up due to colder west coast weather and pacific northwest pipeline outages natural gas gathering volumes were up 16 percent from the second quarter of 2018 due primarily to higher volumes on the kinderhawk and

percent particularly in the petrochemical industry the products pipelines segment earnings were down slightly compared with the second quarter of 2018 as strong contributions from kinder morgan southeast terminals central florida pipeline double eagle pipeline and the km condensate processing facility were offset by reduced contributions from km crude condensate pipeline kmcc due to lower average re contracted rates and from sfpp due primarily to higher operating expenses dang said crude and condensate pipeline volumes were up 2 percent compared to the second quarter of 2018 while total refined products volumes were flat versus the same period in 2018 terminals segment earnings were up this quarter due to an impairment taken in the second quarter of 2018 that was treated as a certain item segment earnings before certain items were down in the liquids business which accounts for nearly 80 percent of the segment total increased contributions from expansion projects placed in service and higher throughput and ancillary contributions were more than offset by reduced volumes as well as off hire time on our jones act tankers caused by mississippi river closures due to historically high water levels along with tank lease costs at the edmonton south terminal paid pursuant to a lease agreement with trans mountain that became a third party arrangement due to our sale of trans mountain said dang advertisement 6 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content contributions from the terminals segment s bulk business were down compared to the second quarter of 2018 on lower volumes across several key commodities including petroleum coke steel and coal the co 2 segment was negatively impacted versus the

equity investments dd a and certain items segment ebda before certain items net income before interest expense taxes dd a and certain items adjusted ebitda adjusted earnings adjusted earnings per common share net debt adjusted net debt and project ebitda are presented herein our non gaap measures described above should not be considered alternatives to gaap net income or other gaap measures and have important limitations as analytical tools our computations of these non gaap measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others you should not consider these non gaap measures in isolation or as substitutes for an analysis of our results as reported under gaap dcf should not be used as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities computed under gaap management compensates for the limitations of these non gaap performance measures by reviewing our comparable gaap measures understanding the differences between the measures and taking this information into account in its analysis and its decision making processes advertisement 9 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content certain items as used to calculate our non gaap measures are items that are required by gaap to be reflected in net income but typically either 1 do not have a cash impact for example asset impairments or 2 by their nature are separately identifiable from our normal business operations and in our view are likely to occur only sporadically for example certain legal settlements enactment of new tax legislation and casualty losses dcf is calculated by adjusting net income available to common stockholders before certain items for dd a total book and cash taxes sustaining capital expenditures and other items dcf is a significant performance measure useful to management and external users of our financial statements in evaluating our performance and in measuring and estimating the ability of our assets to generate cash earnings after servicing our debt paying cash taxes and expending sustaining capital that could be used for discretionary purposes such as common stock dividends stock repurchases retirement of debt or expansion capital expenditures we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to dcf is net income available to common stockholders a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to dcf is provided herein dcf per common share is dcf divided by average outstanding common shares including restricted stock awards that participate in dividends segment ebda before certain items is used by management in its analysis of segment performance and management of our business general and administrative expenses are generally not under the control of our segment operating managers and therefore are not included when we measure business segment operating performance we believe segment ebda before certain items is a significant performance metric because it provides us and external users of our financial statements additional insight into the ability of our segments to generate segment cash earnings on an ongoing basis we believe it is useful to investors because it is a measure that management uses to allocate resources to our segments and assess each segment s performance we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to segment ebda before certain items is segment earnings before dd a and amortization of excess cost of equity investments segment ebda segment ebda before certain items is calculated by adjusting segment ebda for the certain items attributable to a segment which are specifically identified in the footnotes to the accompanying tables advertisement 10 story continues

partners share of dd a and book taxes which are specifically identified in the footnotes to the accompanying tables adjusted ebitda is used by management and external users in conjunction with our net debt to evaluate certain leverage metrics therefore we believe adjusted ebitda is useful to investors we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda is net income adjusted earnings is net income available to common stockholders before certain items adjusted earnings is used by us and certain external users of our financial statements to assess the earnings of our

exchange impact on euro denominated bonds for which we have entered into currency swaps and v 50 of the outstanding kml preferred equity adjusted net debt is net debt with the cash component as of

of net investment hedges of our foreign current risk with respect to our share of the kml return of capital on january 3 2019 we believe the most comparable measure to net debt and adjusted net debt

tunisia has managed to contain inflation however its economic outlook is faced with risks as a result of higher oil prices weaker growth in the economies of its trading partners and an appreciation in its currency which requires greater focus by the government on reducing budget and fiscal deficits the international monetary fund said strong monetary and fiscal policy implementation during the first half of 2019 have helped reduce inflation to 6 8 percent in june from a peak of 7 7 percent a year earlier but more needs to be done to keep inflation lower the washington based international lender said in a statement following a conclusion of a visit by its team to the north african country from july 11 to 17 at the same time risks to the economic outlook for 2019 have increased since the fifth review bjorn rother who led the imf staff visit to the country said in a statement growth will likely be limited to at most 2 percent reflecting notably the disappointing performance of industry in recent months moreover the recent appreciation of the dinar the increase in oil prices and slower growth in tunisia s main trading partners are likely to weigh on the fiscal and external current accounts despite the more favorable than expected performance of the tourism sector these trends make it even more critical to stay the course on policy implementation mr rother said tunisia s economy has been in crisis since the overthrow of zine el abedine ben ali in 2011 with people struggling due to high levels of unemployment and inflation political turmoil and a failure to implement reforms over the past eight years have deterred investment needed to create jobs forcing the government to implement austerity measures in return for loans totalling about 2 8 billion from imf near term policies should continue to focus on reducing fiscal and external deficits lowering inflation further and strengthening the social safety net for low income households it said the imf also urged the north african nation to continue strong performance on tax and tax arrears collection as well as additional measures to contain current expenditures including through continued moderation of the wage bill and energy subsidies in an environment of higher international oil prices meeting the budget deficit target of 3 9 per cent of gdp for 2019 is critical to slow down the accumulation of public debt that reached 77 per cent of gdp at the end of 2018 mr rother said monetary policy should remain geared towards reducing inflation that erodes the purchasing power of tunisians while exchange rate flexibility can support an improvement in the current account and international reserves
sejong prices of the us dollar and gasoline directly affect a large proportion of south korean businesses and households in terms of manufacturing costs and purchasing power while monetary authorities sometimes have intervened in the foreign exchange market and hamper the cheap dollar in an attempt to promote exports the greenback s current strong position versus the korean won suggests the local economy has been sagging simultaneously a hike in international prices of crude oil which is traded in dollars has posed an aggravated burden on the economy whenever the won lost ground to the greenback market indices were quite unfavorable to the korean economy during the second quarter of the year amid the bright outlook on the us economy compared to the lackluster conditions in korea and a spike in crude prices from a variety of uncertainty over global oil supply headquarters of the korea exchange in munhyeon dong busan yonhap headquarters of the korea exchange in munhyeon dong busan yonhap it seemed that the indices went to a certain extent of stabilization starting from june unluckily however the dollar and crude prices bounced back from the end of june or early july the dollar which traded at 1 155 5 won on june 28 climbed by 2 2 percent in less than a month to close at 1 181 3 won on july 17 as a v shape bounce back since 1 187 5 won on june 17 compared to 1 116 won at the end of 2018 the dollar has risen by 65 3 won 5 8 percent this year amid the situation the rating setting meeting of the us federal open market committee slated for july 30 31 is drawing close attention among local market participants the us decision and following remarks will determine midterm direction of the exchange rates some predict the dollar could surpass 1 200 won later this year said a currency futures trading analyst in seoul whenever the dollar has hovered over 1 200 won since the 1990s it has led to a variety of problems in terms of financial soundness for the consumer corporate and state sectors the korean won has also lost ground to major key currencies such as the euro and japanese yen the euro rose by 46 41 won 3 6 percent in three months from 1 278 16 won on april 19 to 1 324 57 on july 17 the japanese currency which traded under 1 000 won per 100 yen in the middle of december 2018 climbed by more than 90 won 9 1 percent in seven months to reach 1 090 84 won on july 17 2019 compared to the early part of president moon jae in s term the japanese currency has shot up by 16 4 percent from 936 38 won per 100 yen posted on jan 12 2018 the nation s gasoline prices had stopped their recent losing streak as of july 14 after falling for the 37 consecutive trading days those rebounded for the fourth consecutive day to trade at 1 490 47 per liter on july 17 gasoline prices recorded growth of 12 3 percent 166 23 won in less than six months from 1 324 24 won per liter on feb 15 though there were reported progress in resolving conflicts between iran and the us uncertainty over crude prices is still lingering on which involves some petroleum producers output reduction efforts and frequent geopolitical tensions analysts say graphic by han chang duck the korea herald graphic by han chang duck the korea herald

share on an adjusted ebitda basis excluding special items we generated 455 million lastly we ended the quarter with a solid 834 million of cash even after sizable cash outlays in the quarter turning to safety we re disappointed that we experienced two serious injuries in the second quarter both in our aluminum business as a reminder our focus is on preventing serious injuries defined as life ending or life altering both employees are now focused on rehabilitation and recovery still these incidents underscore the importance and urgency of our work to further strengthen our safety programs safety remains our most important goal ensuring that everyone who walks through our doors goes home safe and sound we also made real progress this quarter on a number of portfolio strengthening initiatives we amended our ma aden joint venture agreement and divested our minority interest in the rolling mill the exit reduces operating losses and simplifies our business in saudi arabia our interests in the remaining portion of the ma aden joint venture remain the same in our aluminum portfolio in quebec we reached two competitive six year labor contracts the first at baie comeau and the second at becancour the contract at becancour ends an 18 month lockout at the smelter and the process to fully restart idle capacity gets under way later this month also in quebec we are implementing plans to increase the production capacity at deschambault one of the lowest cost smelters in the alcoa system the canadian government will offset some costs for the project expected to be complete in 2021 in spain we made significant progress toward removing historically uncompetitive capacity from our aluminum portfolio earlier this month we signed a conditional agreement with a private equity investment firm to divest the alcoa aviles and la coruna plants lastly turning to markets while we are reducing our estimate for global aluminum demand growth we continue to project a global aluminum deficit for the year we also see aluminum inventory trending lower and other reasons for optimism with that i ll turn it over to bill for a detailed review of our second quarter results william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks roy let s start with the income statement revenues were flat sequentially as higher volumes and energy revenues were more than offset by lower realized prices for alumina and aluminum revenues declined 868 million year on year primarily on lower alumina and aluminum prices in the quarter restructuring charges drove the net loss attributable to alcoa corporation to 402 million or 2 17 per share on a 185 5 million shares outstanding special items totaled 400 million after tax and non controlling interest of that amount cost related to the mrc divestiture were 319 million also included is a charge of 38 million related to the pension benefit plan offered at baie comeau quebec as part of the new labor agreement we did not take a charge related to our aviles and la coruna smelters this quarter as we did not sign the conditional divestiture agreement until july 5 we expect that charge ranging from 100 million to 140 million depending on the outcome of the process to occur in the third quarter now let s look at the income statement excluding special items our second quarter adjusted net loss excluding special items was 2 million or 0 01 per share improving 41 million sequentially adjusted ebitda excluding special items was 455 million down 12 million sequentially our second quarter ebitda margin was 16 7 two items in the quarter second quarter sg a and r d expenses declined 14 million the non recurrence of the 20 million receivable write offs in the first quarter was partially offset by slightly higher overhead spending our second quarter operational tax rate was 46 5 decreasing eight percentage points sequentially as we trued up the year to date rate to reflect higher earnings in non tax paying jurisdictions let s look closer at the factors driving adjusted ebitda in the quarter this quarter we offset the majority of the impact of slightly lower alumina and aluminum prices lower market prices for alumina and to a lesser extent aluminum drove adjusted ebitda down 79 million sequentially taken together all other impacts improved 67 million sequentially nearly offsetting the price impact a few key points favorable smelter energy prices combined with higher energy sales from brazil hydros to drive adjusted ebitda up 38 million raw material costs improved 22 million primarily from favorable caustic prices the strong us dollar drove another 19 million of improvement a negative impact was from higher production cost of 18 million resulting from scheduled maintenance activities in the bauxite and alumina segments finally we can see the positive impacts of improved operations in our alumina segment reflected in better volume and the benefit of the canadian section 232 tariffs exemption for half of the quarter shown in the other column now let s move to the segments in the segments bauxite adjusted ebitda declined 14 million primarily on higher maintenance costs and lower production at mrn alumina adjusted ebitda was basically flat as improved caustic prices favorable currency and higher shipment volumes almost entirely offset the lower realized alumina prices and higher production costs the aluminum segment adjusted ebitda improved 99 million sequentially on a number of factors lower smelter power costs and higher earnings from the brazil hydros lower alumina costs non recurrence of the receivable write off in the first quarter and we also started to see positive impacts from the spanish smelter curtailments and the canadian tariff exemption non segment impacts netted to negative 29 million down 94 million sequentially intersegment eliminations declined 87 million to negative 1 million in the second quarter as alumina prices were more stable in the quarter turning to the balance sheet we ended the second quarter with cash of 834 million down 183 million sequentially this change from first quarter to second quarter is due to the 306 million in prior year tax payments primarily in australia as well as cash contributions totaling 100 million related to the divestiture of alcoa s 25 interest in the ma aden rolling facility days working capital improved four days sequentially to 31 days with improvements across all working capital components our free cash flow net of contributions from and distributions to non controlling interest was negative 173 million in the first half of the year primarily due to the one time payments moving to the outlook our full year outlook remains mostly unchanged from last quarter s outlook with four adjustments we expect transformation ebitda to improve 10 million to 15 million to nearly breakeven we expect other corporate to be 10 million better a 120 million instead of a 130 million our full year operational tax rate is expected to increase to 55 to 65 as alumina segment profits react to lower market prices in the third quarter to catch up the year to date tax rate we expect approximately 35 million tax expense in addition to the amount calculated using the full year rate given current market conditions capital expenditures are expected to be 40 million lower with return seeking capital at 120 million and sustaining capital at 290 million regarding cash impacts of restructuring depending upon the outcome of the aviles and la coruna process could range from 60 million to 70 million in the second half of 2019 in the appendix we also list additional considerations for the third quarter which provide sequential benefits totaling approximately 75 million to 90 million they include 5 million to 10 million related to higher volume and lower maintenance costs in bauxite 30 million to 35 million related to higher volume lower maintenance cost and lower caustic costs in the alumina segment and then in the aluminum segment 35 million to 40 million of lower alumina costs compared to the second quarter a negative 10 million expected lower brazil hydro prices will be partially offset by expected better rolling results and 15 million related to the removal of section 232 tariffs on canadian origin us sales lower raw material costs and other performance improvements are expected to provide that sequential benefit let me turn it back to roy roy c harvey president and chief executive officer thanks bill in our markets we expect bauxite will remain in surplus this year china is importing and stockpiling additional bauxite from guinea and southeast asia due to dwindling supply in the country and to de risk the long complicated import supply chains involved bauxite depletion in china will likely persist suggesting that chinese refiners will need to seek additional sources of bauxite outside their country in the alumina market we continue to expect a slight 2019 surplus driven by the restart of the alunorte refinery in brazil and lower alumina demand due to an overall decrease in worldwide smelting operations this surplus is partially offset by environmental related reductions in china and india we saw a series of alumina curtailments due to bauxite supply concerns in china and the mismanagement of bauxite residue in both china and india in china specifically the government forced three separate refineries in shaanxi province to curtail due to environmental related issues with bauxite residue we also saw news this past quarter about refinery upgrades implemented to meet emission standards at the same time some chinese inland refineries cut production due to difficulties sourcing appropriate bauxite because of depleted domestic sources those refineries were unable to immediately replace that bauxite from seaborne sources taken altogether environmental concerns in india and china remove almost 2 million ton metric tons of production from our 2019 balance considering all these developments it remains clear that operating in an environmentally sustainable way is a key to success at alcoa we strive to be leaders in environmental health and safety practices which gives us our license to operate and makes us a partner of choice in the industry finally in aluminum we continue to project a global deficit while we still see growing global demand trade tensions macroeconomic headwinds and a slowdown in global manufacturing has informed our lower demand projection we expect these headwinds will likely result in slower growth in aluminum end use sectors this year particularly in the global automotive sector while not in our base outlook ongoing trade talks central bank policy decisions and chinese stimulus measures provide room for optimism and are potential swing factors for aluminum demand both this year and next our 2019 outlook for aluminum supply on the other hand is tighter as the postponement of smelter projects in china and the recent curtailment of a bauxien smelter will outweigh the impact of the planned restart of the abi smelter in becancour quebec which is beginning later this month and will continue into the second quarter of 2020 in china authorities continue to enforce the national permitting policy for smelters which by law caps total aluminum smelting capacity as a result china s aluminum supply growth for 2019 is estimated at less than 250 000 tons equivalent to a growth rate of less than 1 that is one of the lowest chinese year on year growth figures in both percentage and absolute volume terms since 2000 with a sustained aluminum deficit forecast we continue to expect lower global inventories for aluminum inventories measured in days of consumption continue to decline and are expected by years end to reach levels not seen in more than a decade since before the global financial crisis in 2008 because of demand growth and falling stocks we estimate the inventories in days of consumption terms will have steadily decreased from a peak of 119 days in 2009 to an estimated 56 to 59 days at the end of 2019 in the longer term demand in key end use sectors such as transportation construction and packaging is expected to grow steadily over the next decade aluminum will continue to help the global economy meet its energy efficiency and general sustainability objectives as inventories continue to be consumed in this deficit market we are optimistic about the future of aluminum its supply chain and alcoa s role in this industry turning to our operations over the course of the last quarter we ve remained focused on strengthening the company by executing key projects improving processes and reliability and upgrading equipment importantly our drive for consistent manufacturing excellence continue to yield results with production records and renewed stability in operations in bauxite while average daily tons dropped sequentially due to lower production at the mrn mine in brazil and planned maintenance at willowdale in western australia daily production still rose 1 year over year at willowdale we safely completed a major overhaul of the mines crusher last quarter to provide uninterrupted internal supply to our wagerup refinery the mine had built stocks to prepare for the planned maintenance in alumina our refinery portfolio already among the most competitive in the world posted record quarterly production up 2 from the same period last year we re also completing a residue filtration project at pinjarra our second such improvement project at our western australia refineries first successfully installed at kwinana this technology allows residue to be dry stacked conserving both water and land use and providing a more stable residue disposal area given the efficiency and competitiveness of our refineries we re also reviewing equipment upgrades and debottlenecking projects for our alumina plants in both western australia and brazil in aluminum we continue to take steps to strengthen the company overall for example as bill and i mentioned earlier last quarter we divested our minority interest in the ma aden rolling facility with our exit we avoid future capital contributions for the mill and were released of all obligations related to the ma aden rolling company this eliminates ongoing financial losses and frees up future cash our remaining interest in the ma aden jv which includes the mine refinery smelter and casthouse remain intact we also took steps to reinforce our competitive aluminum footprint in quebec first we reached two new six year labor contracts one at baie comeau and another at becancour the contract of becancour ends an 18 month lockout at the smelter a full restart process is scheduled to officially begin july 26 and will be completed in the second quarter of next year good labor contracts ultimately benefit both the employer and employees by increasing the long term sustainability and profitability of plants enabling us to provide good paying jobs now and for future generations at our deschambault facility we ve implemented plans to increase the smelters 260 000 metric tons of annual production capacity by approximately 10 canada s strategic innovation fund will contribute cad10 million to offset a portion of the cad85 million upgrade expected to be complete in 2021 the investment will help deschambault to innovate by acquiring cutting edge equipment to boost its average enable it to lower cost and increase aluminum production lastly in spain we signed a conditional agreement with a private equity investment firm to divest the alcoa aviles and la coruna plants the proposed deal is part of a collective dismissal agreement with workers representatives at both facilities for the acquisition to close however the investment for must provide a credit facility by the end of the month to support future operations or the collective dismissal will take effect earlier in the year these two smelters were curtailed reducing aluminum smelting capacity 5 year over year over the last few years we ve consistently emphasized the importance of our three strategic priorities to reduce complexity drive returns and strengthen the balance sheet at the guidepost that drive our decisions as we enter the second half of the year we will stay true to these priorities to further strengthen alcoa we will continue to emphasize the importance of our safety systems to keep our people from harm and maintain our unwavering commitment to responsible and sustainable practices across our operations a key factor in our corporate reputation we re committed to maintaining the operational improvements we ve made over the first half of the year and we look forward to doing even better in the second half of 2019 as raw material prices remain favorable we ll work to drive those benefits to the bottom line to strengthen our company overall we ll evaluate projects across the globe that remove uncompetitive assets from our portfolio so we can put our capital and efforts behind the assets and projects that generate the best returns alcoa was founded on innovation more than 130 years ago and we will continue our focus on developing breakthrough technology processes and products for a more sustainable future we ll undertake these efforts to make our company more competitive and strengthen our balance sheet as appropriate all to provide consistent returns to our stockholders with that bill and i would be happy to take your questions sean please remind us of the instructions and we ll get started questions and answers operator we will now begin the question and answer session our first question will come from david gagliano with bmo capital markets please go ahead david gagliano bmo capital markets analyst hi thanks for taking my questions i don t have a lot tonight just in terms of the canadian deal the becancour restart we know that s a low cost asset can you frame the volume impact and separately help us to frame the ebitda impact somehow and obviously assuming prices and input costs remain the same as they are now once that asset restart and also the timing of that ramp up to full production by 2q 2020 roy c harvey president and chief executive officer yeah so dave the ramp up you know we are running part of the plant currently right so we are still running half of the line the ramp up will be occur through the second quarter and essentially be much more weighted into the first half of next year so minimal tons in the third quarter some tonnage in the fourth quarter and then tons in the first half as far as you saw that we put out a range of restart costs so in the second half we re anticipating 30 million to 35 million of after tax restart costs in the first half of next year an additional 30 million to 35 million of after tax restart costs but i would tell you that the plants turns ebitda positive under current market conditions in the second quarter and i would anticipate that the plant essentially pays for the restart over the course of the next 12 months so it overcomes those restart costs over the next 12 months so that s the detail that we re able to provide david gagliano bmo capital markets analyst okay that s helpful thank you and then just my unrelated follow up in alumina and bauxite when you add up the equipment upgrades and the debottlenecking programs that were mentioned on the call what do you think your alumina and bauxite volumes will be once those are finished and what s the timing william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer we gave guidance specifically around the third quarter dave so we are guiding to a pretty strong third quarter so just to be clear around the third quarter we essentially said a couple of things 30 million to 35 million of ebitda improvement in the third quarter associated with better volumes the lower maintenance costs and the lower caustic costs in alumina so that s the outlook that we provided roy c harvey president and chief executive officer and dave i d also tie it back to the ranges that we gave as far as production and shipments for the year better said william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer yes it s good roy c harvey president and chief executive officer so that that gives you a good way to double check the information that bill is giving you and then also look forward at what s remaining for the second half of the year william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so we have done 6 7 million metric tons in the first half and we re predicting 13 6 to 13 7 for the year so that allows you to back into what the second half looks like david gagliano bmo capital markets analyst totally understand for 2019 i was really getting up beyond 2019 it sounded like and maybe i misunderstood the prepared remarks i thought we re more geared toward longer term projects in alumina and bauxite what i m asking is with the projects that you have in the pipeline now what do you think your alumina and bauxite volumes would be in say for example three years from now based on the projects that you have approved between you and alumina limited roy c harvey president and chief executive officer yes i think the answer is going to be dave that we don t have those those larger projects yet approved david gagliano bmo capital markets analyst all right roy c harvey president and chief executive officer and so where we find ourselves is in essentially the engineering stage and so once we have the final details in engineering we then have a look at markets and how we see those markets evolving because as you can imagine these are projects that pay off over a number of years and we ll then make a decision on it so at this point i would say that we are on our normal creep trajectory and you can see that through the historical production figures but we are always trying to find a way to drive some production improvements across the portfolio these projects and whether it s in brazil or western australia that would be step changes that would offer more tonnages and as we finalize the engineering we will give you a better overview of what those projects cost and the kinds of tonnages that would be coming out david gagliano bmo capital markets analyst okay that s helpful thank you roy c harvey president and chief executive officer thanks dave william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks dave operator our next question comes from chris terry with deutsche bank please go ahead chris terry deutsche bank analyst hi bill and roy couple of questions from me the first one just on the cash balance in terms of the stated 1 billion minimum just interested in your comments around the current move in interest rates lower what that might do to your unfunded pension and how we think about that 1 billion versus the current cash balance and then the second question is just around the cash flow slide 25 adding those items together gives around 75 million to 90 million benefit related to better caustic maintenance et cetera and then in the quarter alumina and aluminum now coming off into this quarter just thinking about free cash flow specifically when you step through perhaps the restructuring costs in spain and any other capex items just directionally how you think about the free cash flow there and then just related to that the 15 million in the section 232 number that you ve guided to i thought it was a little higher than that i thought more like 10 to 12 per month is the number i remember just some comments on that as well thanks william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer chris you re limited to two questions i think you worked in like six or eight there i think i think i tried to tried to capture all of them so let me take a crack and roy if i missed any you jump in you re right interest rates are lower and that means that discount rates on the pension are lower and we give a sensitivity of approximately 160 million on the liability for every 25 basis point move in in the discount rate year to date discount rates i don t recall off the top of my head but we re probably in the 50 basis point to 75 basis point lower year to date but the year is not over and interest rates we know change during the course of the year so you can use a sensitivity there to get an idea of how our pension liability will perform however i would tell you that on the asset side we year to date have had a pretty good year along with the with the strengthening the markets so we ve gotten expected return on assets of 6 75 we ve exceeded that year to date i m not going to provide the exact number because the year is not over yet but we will be able to make up some of that negative differential from lower discount rates should those persist with better asset returns as you know we ve transitioned our asset portfolio to much more of a traditional asset portfolio largely focused around equity investments and a liability hedging structure that s that s much more of a physical liability hedging structure than any type of an option structure so overall the year is not done but better asset returns this year than what we ve seen in the past as far as free cash flow goes there is a lot of questions embedded in that i would point you to the cash considerations page tries to walk you through or the cash consideration section in the outlook page tries to walk you through some of the big cash considerations for the year but as you alluded to we are projecting performance improvement in the third quarter and we gave a lot of details around that performance improvement in the third quarter that will be that will be at least today partially offset with some of the lower prices that we re seeing but that remains to be seen what what prices will do as far as free cash flow items to keep in mind i believe we ve guided to 60 million to 70 million of spain cash outflow in the rest of the year associated with either of the two potential outcomes in spain we ve guided to 30 million to 35 million of abi in the second half of restructuring charges so overall i think you can look at the considerations on the considerations page for free cash flow let me address the cash balance and we and i think your question started with the cash balance and we have a target of having 1 billion of cash on hand we ended the quarter with 834 million i would suggest to you that s not a bad outcome we handled as roy said a legacy a future liability in mrc so we paid 100 million in the second quarter to exit mrc that was a combination of a trailing cash call associated with the earnings of mrc from 34 million and an additional contribution of 66 million associated with getting out of the future losses and future debt repayment of mrc so i m actually very pleased with that outcome and then on top of that we made trailing cash payments associated with the earnings the outsized earnings in 2018 of around 306 million of cash payments on taxes associated with the earnings so even though we weren t able to maintain our 1 billion cash balance the 834 million is a pretty good outcome and then the last one the 232 sorry i had it written down here recall that we have a partial quarter benefit associated with 232 in the second quarter so when we guide toward an incremental 15 million benefit in the third quarter that s on top of the 10 million benefit that we got in the second quarter so in aggregate now that canada is exempted from the 232 tariffs we would anticipate an annual benefit of approximately 200 million from the 232 tariffs so that as you said was approximately 10 million before we bring back abi i m sorry 10 million a month before we bring back abi abi helps with that so in aggregate 200 million on an annual basis so i hope i have addressed all of your questions chris terry deutsche bank analyst yes you got them all thanks very much appreciate all the detail william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer good thanks chris operator our next question comes from timna tanners from bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead timna tanners bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey guys good evening i just wanted to roy c harvey president and chief executive officer hi timna timna tanners bank of america merrill lynch analyst hello i just wanted to review with you you ve been going through your assets pretty methodically and calling out ones that are underperforming and disposing of them but what s left that s not core specifically wondering about the rolling mill and warrick and since you have no longer broken that out is that an asset that could be split off are there other assets that are not core you re expanding in a market that is actually shrinking in terms of demand and so i m wondering if you re still looking to reduce or if you re actually kind of more in expansion mode so i guess two questions in there roy c harvey president and chief executive officer timna let me let me hit that first and then bill bill can chime in we re careful not necessarily to drive to define what is core and what s not core but rather what assets are we the best owners of and there is some obvious ones like pinjarra or wagerup that we would argue that we are certainly the best operators but when you look at assets like warrick or the brazilian hydros these are assets that are very valuable to us and i believe particularly with warrick we re bringing a significant improvement in volumes in qualities and the ability to drive improving relationships and contracts with our customers and as well as putting some capital to use so i think we re we re putting the right emphasis and making the right changes to see that to see those assets improve for the long term however to call them core which i think implies that we would never consider a divestiture is a bit further than we would go it comes down to fair pricing and it also comes down to a review on the uses and deployment of cash that we have for the future and so when you look across the portfolio you ve got sort of a couple of that i ve already mentioned you also have a series of plants where we re taking very active active and deliberate deliberate actions in order to improve them whether they are in the aluminum portfolio or alumina or bauxite and these are places that are really inside of our core businesses but where we have real levers to try and improve them i call attention to san ciprian in spain which is has a challenging energy situation and portland in east australia which also it shares a challenging energy situation as well and when you look at assets that still have potential for fundamental changes when you think about the sao luis smelter down in brazil which is currently completely idled it s a place where if you have the right power contract you could see a very different outcome for that so we try and drive across or we try and analyze and look for opportunities across all of those to improve them but also look for ways in order to make our portfolio better performing over the long term william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah the only thing i would add to that roy and it s really just a compliment what you said and timna what i would point you to is consider what we were able to accomplish in the second quarter and i think that i think we showed in the second quarter that we re willing to take action in our portfolio when we need to take action so in aggregate just to summarize we got the mrc deal done we got abi to a position where we ve gotten a labor agreement in abi and we re in the process of in late july restarting it we got a labor agreement in baie comeau that positions us for success for the next six years we moved the ball significantly in spain right we did the final chapter isn t written yet in spain at aviles and la coruna but i can tell you and from my perspective i thought it would take us a lot longer to get where we ve gotten in spain and i think we ve done a great job there we ve announced a small expansion at deschambault and it s not huge but it s a 10 creep project at deschambault which has good economics at the same time we re recovering on stability in our alumina business and we ve shown that in the production numbers and the mining business just keeps kind of chugging along successfully so i think i think our future actions are probably best informed by what we were able to accomplish in the second quarter timna tanners bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay that s helpful if i could i wanted to understand a little bit better your outlook because on the one hand if you read through your release and the presentation you clearly are calling for smaller deficits and bigger surpluses but your commentary it sounded more upbeat but i just want to understand do you think that recently shrunk chinese demand is a temporary situation because of the consumer s lack of confidence around trade for example do you think that we can see aluminum demand resume kind of historical patterns could you just comment a little bit more about how you re thinking about the outlook and supply and demand going forward and the three factors you said that could turn the market for the positive could that be a delayed outcome if we see like the central banks and the chinese stimulus and the trade war get a positive outcome or do you think that would have a pretty quick impetus thanks roy c harvey president and chief executive officer yeah timna so that s i think you put your finger on on an important topic and so and i think you actually did a pretty good job at answering part of your own question which is always nice from my perspective so remember that when we sit down to prepare for earnings it is by necessity a snapshot of how we see current conditions and so what we ve been trying to do is not just provide a snapshot but also to try and help help you and help our other investors and analysts to understand what can be affecting that both upwards or downwards i think when we look at the amount of volatility in the market today and just the turbulence around announcements on a day by day basis around trade etc and how that connects with economics and then of course how that connects with aluminum i think we re seeing just an incredible amount of volatility and so that volatility then impacts how quickly manufacturing is growing and consuming materials and so aluminum has the incredible benefit over these years of being so intertwined with so many different parts of the economy it has an incredible growth story and so even given some of these uncertainties in these trade tensions etc it continues to be a place where growth is happening it s just that when we take a snapshot of how we ve seen that develop over these this first six months of the year it led us to give a lower demand view than what we had given in the past the second part of the question is is i would argue even more important because the past is not necessarily a good indicator of the future here the first thing you asked was is does this indicate slower growth in the future and i think that very much depends on how you look at the future developing i think at some point we will be past the trade tensions i think we will we are already seeing financial stimulus inside of china and if there if their relative slow down they continue to grow pretty nicely from an economy standpoint as you continue to see some of the some of that slowdown inside of their economy you re going to see more stimulus that moves from financial to physical and to infrastructure and that will then give you a number of impacts positive impacts particularly in aluminum and so from that standpoint i don t think that this particular earnings snapshot is indicative of the long term potential that aluminum has as a commodity and i d also turn your attention to the other side of the supply demand balance which is supply i think one of the one of the hallmarks of what we re seeing in the world today is that you re also seeing action on the supply side i d call your attention in aluminum specifically to the fact that china is growing the least amount of aluminum productive capacity since 2000 and so that is i think that is a very disciplined response to the fact that that there is some of this uncertainty happening in the market itself and i think that shows that there is a lot more discipline to the aluminum market in today s world and i think also on the alumina side not to leave that behind i also think that people are finding the alumina business and production to be very complicated very complicated particularly in a world today where the environmental repercussions of good or bad tailings management is more and more important and so painfully highlighted with what s been happening around the world and so that i think bodes well for the future of our industry because it will help to level the playing field and ensure that each and every refinery around the world is following that same set of environmental dynamics and designing those refineries or those bauxite mines or those aluminum smelters in a way that allows for a sustainable production and sustainable growth so i think what we ve been trying to portray is that the balances that we see still remain in good control we are seeing this economic slowdown for 2019 but we still have a lot of optimism not only for declining inventories this year but for a very bright future of aluminum into the future timna tanners bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay thank you roy c harvey president and chief executive officer thanks timna operator our next question comes from paretosh misra with berenberg please go ahead paretosh misra berenberg analyst great thanks for taking my question it seems to me like there is some incremental interest in aluminum as a material of choice in packaging because of sustainability benefits that you highlighted actually and some of the packaging companies have seen big share price gain this year so just wondering is that packaging business completely scrap based or how or when does it begin to make a bigger impact on the supply demand for the primary aluminum side roy c harvey president and chief executive officer yes paretosh so that s a it s an interesting question because is it scrap based it s almost indifferent that if you continue to grow the consumption of aluminum if you would continue to embed aluminum into your into these new into these new products it drives higher consumption of the metal across all of the metal sources and that in the end is good for alcoa and for other metal producers and because there is only so much scrap available and now that scrap availability changes as you start to see more recycling in different economies or you start to see the end of some of the infrastructure that is then replaced with new infrastructure but we don t necessarily see scrap as a as a competitor for for our business and in fact look for ways to also use recycling to strengthen our business whether it s by bringing recycled products into our casthouses connected with our smelters or whether it s in our warrick plant where we actually bring in scrap from some of our customers and from elsewhere so i see that as additive and so the more that we can drive the more we can drive these new products and the more that we can segment our market and the more we can convince people about not only recycled content but low carbon aluminum content or also just the sustainable nature through for example the aluminum stewardship initiative the more we can drive this awareness of the sustainability baked in to alcoa s products and we have a series of what we like to think of as green aluminum ecolum ecodura in the sustana line the more we can drive that the better it is for our industry and by turn the better it is for alcoa so i think that is i think that is a story that still has a lot to develop and it s one of the reasons that we re working as hard as we are on elysis which is the will be the lowest lowest carbon aluminum on the planet once we get that out to commercial production paretosh misra berenberg analyst okay got it interesting thanks for that and then second follow up on the raw material side in the smelting business after all these recent changes what s your position with regard to anodes are you are you going to be net short or self sufficient william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer regarding anodes we still do some importing of anodes from china but it s a fairly small amount paretosh so we make the majority of our anodes in our own facilities in our smelters in our bake furnaces in the smelters so a small amount of imported anodes from china paretosh misra berenberg analyst got it thanks bill thanks roy roy c harvey president and chief executive officer thanks paretosh operator our next question comes from matthew korn with goldman sachs please go ahead matthew korn goldman sachs analyst hey good evening everybody just a couple left for me so you withdrew from the ma aden rolling company last month what prompted the decision to do it now did you see some reason to downgrade your expectations on the achievable potential achievable returns of that particular asset and if so why roy c harvey president and chief executive officer let me let me start on that and bill can chime in if he wants to add i don t think there was a particular catalyst from a business standpoint the fact is is as we went into to separation a number of years ago and as we watch that plant develop it wasn t what ma aden had in mind for the development of that plant just didn t fit with our capital allocation priorities and to be quite honest it wasn t generating the types of cash flows and returns that we would want from that that deployment of capital and so as we as we continue to drive improvements in our bauxite mine and alumina refinery in country which is now operating very stably or aluminum smelter which has been operating stably for a while now the fact that that rolling mill and the test automotive mill was not performing stood out more and more and so as those discussions were developing inside of the board room and as we saw some of the as we saw an opportunity in order to make a change it just happened to it happened to coincide with the with some of the some of the factors and some of the things that ma aden was considering and so it became a good opportunity for us to discuss what would it take for us to exit that particular that particular joint venture william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer and so you re spot on roy i mean just a couple of the the financial aspects of the decision matthew we were as i said we contributed 100 million 34 million of that was a capital cost associated with past losses so we contributed an additional 66 million to be able to exit the rolling mill to put it in perspective that rolling mill in 2018 we had approximately 35 million of losses in our income statement in 2018 associated with the rolling mill and going forward we had approximately 300 million of debt our share associated with that mill outstanding so we essentially we re exiting an ebitda breakeven mill that was looking at significant cash associated with debt repayment in the future all for an incremental 66 million after the cash call and it came down to a financial decision to exit roy c harvey president and chief executive officer and if i can just add one more piece to matthew we ve been part of the concept behind the warrick rolling mill go was up going with alcoa corporation was so that we d have a complete product offering through time what we found is that yes we have been able to commercialize the saudi arabian rolled products but we ve also been able to develop a customer base that is very tied to warrick and that i think is has helped our customers both to improve themselves but has also been very very profitable and has helped us to grow volumes inside of the warrick rolling mill and so i think we re in a pretty good spot even though we were exiting that joint venture we re still in a very good spot commercially for the warrick business as well matthew korn goldman sachs analyst got it guys i really appreciate all that detail let me just sly one more small one in bill you did say that given current market conditions you re bringing down capex for the year is a little bit lower what in particular are you slowing in response to market when you re looking that over the rest of the year roy c harvey president and chief executive officer we had built in some amount of capital associated with some growth projects that we were looking at really from in the engineering phase and we have slowed those down a little bit and then on the sustaining capex side you can see we ve just trimmed from a 300 million estimate to 290 million estimate so a very small amount but it essentially says hey in today s market environment with the target that we have of keeping 1 billion of cash cash on the balance sheet we re really tightening the belt to try to make sure that every capital dollar that s spent makes a lot of sense operator our next question comes from lucas pipes with b riley fbr please go ahead lucas pipes b riley fbr analyst yes thank you very much and good evening everyone i wanted to ask an industry question i think in the past you made references to what percentage of the global aluminum supplies uneconomical and i think you also specifically highlighted that china now we ve had a change in a lot of the input factors on the pricing side etc i wondered if you can give us an update as to where you see kind of breakeven in china what percentage is economical and then also around the rest of the world thank you william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer yes lucas so i ll tell you that with the flat cost curve that we re seeing now that can that can shift pretty quickly and so let me let me illustrate that first by talking a little bit about the alumina cost curve so if you take today s conditions we estimate about 7 of the rest of the world and about 5 of china are under water and so that s that s a pretty a relatively small amount when you think about where how much pricing has changed through time again when you look at aluminum and again you take the current api or current alumina pricing and take the and current aluminum pricing you end up with about 4 rest of the world and 2 in china however if you go back a week ago where alumina prices were higher both in china and in the rest of the world you ended up with almost a third of chinese capacity under water so relatively small changes in the underlying input raw materials or in alumina in the case of aluminum can have some pretty significant impacts across the market so it s it tends to be a pretty dynamic calculation lucas pipes b riley fbr analyst that is very helpful thank you for that detail maybe one last follow up on the inventory side what s your perspective on shadow inventories and do you have a sense for where inventory stand in china versus the rest of the world thank you william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer yes we tend to we tend to try and aggregate all of the inventories that we see out there and so when you think about the what you can actually see on the london metal exchange or on the chinese exchange we try to take that and then add on to it our understanding of what is sitting in the market and we do that by trying to close one eye and listen to everything that we re hearing and i think that we found we ve had good success is being able to being able to understand and evaluate how those inventories are changing and so when i when i mentioned the sort of how those inventories are developing those are meant to actually include the shadow inventories or the inventories that are also held off exchange we also have a couple couple of small warehouses that we run inside of our plant so that helps us to understand some of the financials and economics associated and it also gives us a front row seat to see when when people are interested in warehousing aluminum as an example and baie comeau is a very good example of the place where we ve done where we ve done that kind of business roy c harvey president and chief executive officer and just to put a fine point on it when we re looking at inventory numbers globally we would say there s probably around 10 7 million metric tons of inventory in the world of which roughly half of that is what you would call shadow we would call it unreported stocks so roughly 2 5 million metric tons in china and 2 5 million metric tons held outside of china so the numbers that we quote and when roy talks about inventories coming down and inventories potentially ending the year at a 10 year low that inclusive of our best estimate of what unreported inventories are operator our next question comes from justin bergner with g research please go ahead justin bergner g research analyst good afternoon roy good afternoon bill roy c harvey president and chief executive officer hey justin justin bergner g research analyst to start your tax situation clearly your tax rate is very high given how your profits and losses split up between the us and the rest of the world from past statements it seems like the cash tax rate isn t too much below the operational tax rate what are your long term strategies that you re either thinking through or working through to try and get that down to a more normal level william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah it s a justin it s a really tough question to answer and i think the reason why i touched tough question to answer is because you hit on it our tax rate is based on the jurisdictions in which we in which we make profits in today s environment we have losses in a number of jurisdictions that have valuation allowances against the taxes and therefore have a essentially a 0 tax rate that s in places like the us and spain conversely we pay taxes and accrue for tax expenses in places where we have long term profitability in places like australia canada brazil and so therefore you can see some some really strange tax rates as profitability gets lower tax rates can get higher as far as taking actions we have nols that can be used in the us so as we hopefully can get profitability in some of our us facilities that profitability will be essentially tax free because we ve got nols to use up so i would tell you that we look at tax planning all around the world and make our best estimate to try to essentially minimize our tax bill but the tax rates that you see are a function of where we make money and where we don t make money justin bergner g research analyst okay i understood but in theory you could acquire earning asset in the us in your industry or an adjacent industry and put those put those nols to use sooner william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer that s correct and i would tell you as we look at capital allocation in any of its forms we take marginal tax rates into consideration so as we look at assets in the us from an expansion perspective in the existing portfolio that we have we apply a 0 tax rate in the near term as we look at opportunities for expansion in australia we apply have applied the 30 tax rate in australia so it is built into our capital allocation model as we consider where we put capital around the world roy c harvey president and chief executive officer and i ll just chime in really quickly and just to support what bill is saying we understand and find that there are ways that we can try to improve the tax situation whether it s driving quick and better improvements in the way that we produce in the underlying cost structure and therefore the profitability of intalco or massena or try and drive more businesses that end up being tax free businesses by down in texas or in other places where we re performing transformation activities in trying to drive some new businesses so those tend to be blocking and tackling but it s trying to find a way to absorb and use those nols it s very important to us justin bergner g research analyst great thank you i just had one quick clarification question for the becancour restart what are the total cash costs that you are anticipating across the remainder of 2019 and 2020 william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah we haven t guided the cash cost but i think i think it s you probably have three components of cash associated with the restart of abi so you ve got the second half after tax expense of 30 million to 35 million we will have some capital expenditures to to get abi back to the level that we want it to be at that s included in the 290 million and the 120 million of return seeking capital and sustaining capital that we ve guided to so those numbers are inclusive of of the restart of abi and there will be some level of working capital i would probably estimate it at the 20 million to 30 million level of working capital build in abi so the three components restart cost 30 million to 35 million working capital estimate of probably 20 million to 30 million and then capex but the capex is built into the guidance that we provided operator our next question will come from michael dudas with vertical research partners please go ahead michael dudas vertical research partners analyst hi gentlemen thanks for taking the question just one question roy wanted to share your current thoughts on how industry governments are trying to get a more fair environment relative to the global aluminum industry roy c harvey president and chief executive officer yeah it s that is certainly something that we have talked a lot about in these earnings calls it s something that we take each and every meeting that we have whether it s here in the us in canada or elsewhere and so i think we ve seen some fits and starts i think just recently we ve seen some discussions around how to are specifically around the subsidization and particularly in china but elsewhere can also be the case and also started to see some movement toward trying to present a united front so that it becomes a bit more complicated when we start fighting about the trade and tariffs and so we re trying to trying to move away from for example the 232 was released in that on canada was a great step forward now we want to start building that partnership with canada with europe elsewhere around the world so that we can start to see start to see a more level playing field we re not trying to shift it in our favor necessarily we re trying to have as orderly an industry as we possibly can and i ll not tell you that that is easy in order to assemble that coalition it takes time and it takes and it takes effort but it is something that i believe i believe and particularly with the oecd report that was just published here a little while ago and without jumping into too much information about that it essentially shows the the incredible and almost order of magnitude size of the subsidization inside of china as opposed to as opposed to what happens in aluminum around the planet i think there s a lot of really good information that we can use in that report and in what we ve been talking about before in order to better strengthen that coalition so more to come but rest assured michael we re trying to we are out there advocating for this and using all of the opportunities we have to explain that to the decision makers operator and our final question will come from john tumazos with john tumazos independent research please go ahead john tumazos john tumazos independent research analyst thank you could you review the share buybacks the shares outstanding at june 30th are about 1 million less than a year ago and could you give a little more background on the ma aden rolling mill not so much the financial numbers as did the market grow last year was there more competition from rolled products coming from china russia or germany or what not roy c harvey president and chief executive officer let me answer your second question first just because i think it s i think it is a point that that s worth that s worth exploring a little bit i think for the ma aden rolling mill specifically it was built with an eye to a very rapidly expanding economic growth circled around aluminum consumption inside of saudi arabia so if you imagine i think the kingdom what they wanted to drive was not just bauxite alumina aluminum rolling it was to also build all of that automotive production inside of country and so that is a very noble purpose and i think we shared in the in that vision and dream to see that grow quickly but i think when it came to pragmatic reality it takes time to develop those industries and so unfortunately for us when we think about the preciousness of our capital resources we don t necessarily as as alcoa corporation have the patience to wait for that to grow and nor do we have any kind of impact that we can bring on trying to grow that into the kingdom and so when you think about the divergence of interest between ma aden and alcoa corporation they are very much tied into what the what this new this new plan inside of the inside of the kingdom is trying to develop and so they by having full control over that rolling mill i think they can also help to help to make that vision more of a reality william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer and let me let me just briefly answer your question around shares outstanding john if you go back to the second quarter of last year where we made earnings we you use a diluted share count and that diluted share count last year was 188 7 million shares that included stock options and awards of 2 3 million shares fast forward to the second quarter of this year where essentially because we re in a loss position we have to the accounting will tell you you have to take a more conservative view of shares outstanding and you have to use the shares outstanding that exclude the equivalent shares so we d be at 185 5 million shares outstanding at the end of the second quarter the differential between the second quarter of last year and the second quarter of this year is the net impact of having bought back shares in the fourth quarter of last year recall that we spent 50 million on share buybacks in the fourth quarter at roughly a 29 0 i should say roughly at 29 03 average share price that we purchased in the fourth quarter of last year that is approximately 1 7 million shares so the differential is the combination of that and any shares that were used as part of management compensation so that s the difference john tumazos john tumazos independent research analyst thank you roy c harvey president and chief executive officer thanks john operator this now concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to roy harvey for any closing remarks roy c harvey president and chief executive officer thank you sean and thank you everyone for your time today as we enter the second half of 2019 we are committed to maintaining all the improvements that we ve made so far this year and we are also hard at work to achieve and do even more so thank you for your time today we appreciate the questions and we look forward to sharing our third quarter results in october back to you sean operator duration 71

source xinhua 2019 07 18 12 52 20 editor yang yi video player close washington july 17 xinhua china s current account surplus in 2018 narrowed further as its external position was assessed to be in line with fundamentals and desirable policies reflecting progress in rebalancing the international monetary fund said wednesday a noteworthy development is the continued narrowing of china s current account surplus against a backdrop of greater exchange rate flexibility and reer real effective exchange rate appreciation over the last decade gita gopinath imf s chief economist said at a press conference china s current account surplus continued its decline in 2018 reaching 0 4 percent of gdp in 2018 according to the imf s newly released annual external sector report this mainly reflects a shrinking trade balance driven by high import volume growth and a continued increase in the services deficit mostly driven by tourism as well as higher prices of certain products in recent years china s economy has become increasingly reliant on domestic demand rather than exports according to the latest data from the national bureau of statistics retail sales of consumer goods rose 8 4 percent year on year in the first half of 2019 with online sales surging 17 8 percent from a longer perspective china s current account surplus has declined substantially relative to the peak of about 10 percent of gdp in 2007 reflecting strong investment growth real effective exchange rate appreciation weak demand in major advanced economies technological upgrades in manufacturing and a widening of the services deficit the imf report said in an overall assessment china s external position in 2018 was broadly in line with the level consistent with medium term fundamentals and desirable policies which represents a change from earlier assessments of moderately stronger gopinath said achieving a lasting external rebalancing will require gradual reining in expansionary macroeconomic policies and adopting further structural reforms china s average reer rate in 2018 appreciated by about 1 4 percent relative to 2017 driven by the appreciation in the nominal effective exchange rate the report said adding that external balance assessment indicated that china s reer to be at the same level as warranted by fundamentals and desirable policies china registered a small net capital inflow of 30 billion u s dollars in 2018 compared with net capital outflows of 103 billion dollars in 2017 the report said on china s economy gopinath said it s important for china to continue its pivot toward more domestic demand driven growth to ensure that there is less reliance on credit and to encourage the growth of the private sector the report showed that current account surpluses in 2018 remained centered in the euro area driven by germany and the netherlands and in other advanced economies such as singapore and south korea while deficits remained persistent in britain the united states and some emerging market economies such as argentina and indonesia following the global financial crisis overall current account surpluses and deficits fell sharply from about 6 percent of global gdp in 2007 to about 3 5 percent in 2013 since then global current account imbalances have declined slightly to 3 percent of world gdp in 2018 the report said risks from the current configuration of external imbalances are generally contained at least in the near term as current account deficits and debtor positions are largely concentrated in advanced economies that issue reserve currencies gopinath said trade tensions she said have so far not significantly affected global current account imbalances but are weighing on global investment and growth urging all countries to work cooperatively on the issue recent bilateral trade actions have had no discernible impact on the global imbalances as external imbalances reflect macro policies that affect aggregate saving and investment gopinath said highlighting the impact of trade tensions she said that higher tariffs have been associated with increased prices for consumers and have been eroding business confidence and disrupting global supply chains gopinath said the imf also found that the effects of exchange rates on trade flows are relatively muted in the short term especially in economies where trade is largely invoiced in the dollar this means that the benefits of exchange rate flexibility in terms of external rebalancing or buffering the economy to reer shocks maybe limited in the near term she said this points to the need of complimenting exchange rate flexibility with other cyclical policy instruments countries with excess current account deficits like britain and the united states should adopt or continue with growth friendly fiscal consolidation while those with excess current account surpluses like germany and south korea should use fiscal space to boost public infrastructure investment and potential growth gopinath said the economist noted both deficit and surplus countries should focus on tackling the underlying macro and structural sources of imbalances instead of resorting to distorted trade actions calling for carefully tailored and sequenced structural policies countries should work jointly toward reviving liberalization efforts and strengthening the rule based multilateral trade system that has served the global economy well over the past 75 years said gopinath
cck earnings call for the period ending july 18 2019 crown holdings inc cck 0 26 q2 2019 earnings call 9 00 a m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks operator good morning and welcome to crown holdings second quarter 2019 conference call i would now like to turn the call over to mr thomas kelly senior vice president and chief financial officer sir you may now begin thomas a kelly senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you maisy and good morning with me on today s call is tim donahue president and chief executive officer on this call as in the earnings release we will be making a number of forward looking statements actual results could vary materially from such statements additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to vary is contained in the press release and in our sec filings including in our form 10 k for 2018 and subsequent filings earnings for the quarter were 1 02 per share compared to 0 99 in the prior year quarter comparable earnings per share were 1 46 in the quarter versus 1 55 in 2018 net sales were in line with 2018 as increased beverage can volumes were offset by 180 million of unfavorable currency translation segment income in the quarter was also in line with the prior year has improved the results in americas beverage offset lower results in european food and transit packaging and unfavorable currency translation as outlined in the release we estimate third quarter 2019 adjusted earnings of between 1 50 and 1 60 per share and full year adjusted earnings of between 5 05 and 5 20 per share these estimates assume exchange rates remain at their current levels and a full year tax rate of between 25 and 26 we currently estimate 2019 full year adjusted free cash flow of between 725 and 750 million with approximately 440 million in capital spending with that i will turn the call over to tim timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director thank you tom and good morning to everyone i ll try to be as brief as possible and we ll then open the call to questions as reflected in last night s release and as tom has just summarized overall second quarter performance was about as expected although the results were mixed across the operating segments unit volume demand for food and beverage remained firm through the second quarter and was up in most geographies in transit overall volumes were down 2 we have summarized the major projects in progress and those recently completed in the release all of which are on the same timing as we described in april with the notable addition of the two new lines in new york and ontario in a supplemental table to the release we have provided the currency impact on sales and segment income by operating segment so my comments will focus on currency neutral performance in americas beverage overall sales units advanced 2 with north america up 1 and latin america up 4 mainly on the strength of brazil and colombia segment income up 27 million in the quarter continued to benefit from a significantly improved cost structure in 2019 as well as the higher volume levels lower freight costs and the lack of start up costs in third party can sourcing in the united states compared to 2018 are just some of the factors contributing to the improved cost position in 2019 can demand in the brazilian market remains extremely strong which our results to date reflect however we remain sold out and we will be short of needed capacity until the new rio verde plant comes online late this year from already verde tight capacity we have sold 6 more volume in brazil in the first half and will not have enough production capacity to match last year s second half volume output there is a new can competitor now operational in colombia and beginning july 1 we will experience a significant reduction in can demand in that country the result income loss as budgeted and expected combined with our brazilian capacity constraints will flatten income results for the segment in the second half compared to the prior year unit volumes in european beverage improved 6 over the prior year with europe up 8 and the middle east down 0 5 strong performances in eastern europe and the uk coupled with volume from the new facilities in italy and spain offset softness in dubai and turkey segment income up 3 in the quarter reflects the volume increase lower start up costs in italy and spain compared to the first quarter and the cycling of prior year middle eastern volume comparisons sales unit volumes in european food increased 0 5 in the second quarter although our mix was unfavorable to income across product categories growth in tomatoes was more than offset by decreases in dairy and fish contributing to a segment income decline of 20 million compared to the prior year selling price realization was positive was not enough to offset inflationary cost increases while some of the seasonal crops were delayed up to two weeks coming out of the second quarter we expect an otherwise normal seasonal third quarter pack and production levels while flat to the prior year in the first half our plan to be up 8 in the second half leading to significantly higher cost absorption than last year as a result we expect second half income performance to be in line to slightly better than 2018 for the year however income will be down in the segment as we do not recover the first half shortfall clearly a disappointing result in 2019 following the poor harvest in 2018 but the business is sound consumer demand for packaged food is strong and we will continue to reduce costs in the business segment income in asia pacific advanced 5 million in the quarter as double digit volume demand double digit demand growth in southeast asia more than offset the volume impact from the closure of the two facilities in china excluding currency sales in transit were down 1 6 in the second quarter due almost entirely to 2 lower overall net volumes as price impacts were negligible the impact of volume and negative mix drove the reduction in segment income compared to the record performance in last year s second quarter while down from the prior year this is a business that has generated 90 million to 95 million of ebitda per quarter in nine of the last 10 quarters so the second quarter was right in line with our expectations looking ahead to the balance of the year we are forecasting the third and fourth quarters to be in the lower part of that ebitda band so roughly 4 5 roughly 4 million to 5 million per quarter below last year as we make allowances for what could be slower economic activity this is a very diverse business across end markets product applications and geographies and while more cyclical than cans it is nonetheless a stable business the business continues to perform well requires very little capital and generates significant cash in non reportables 6 volume growth in north america food more than offset some softness in the us aerosol market and looking ahead it appears that in the markets where we operate that is the upper midwest and east coast all conditions point to affirm north american food hardest a mixed operating results through six months to non operating items currency and pension which we identified at the beginning of the year have been about a 0 25 per share headwind in the first half or 0 12 to 0 13 in each quarter operationally demand remained strong across our global beverage businesses and we are aggressively moving to install needed additional capacity which is the main source of the free cash revision food can demand remains firm throughout although below our expectations in europe following last year s drought conditions transit has performed according to plan in the first half and perhaps the team is being overly cautious heading into the back half but we ll see so in summary continuing firm demand strong cash flow and several projects under way to continue to service customers and drive future value and with that maisy we are now ready to open the call to questions questions and answers operator certainly sir we will now begin the question and answer session speakers our first question is from the line of anthony pettinari of citigroup your line is now open anthony pettinari citigroup analyst good morning timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director good morning thomas a kelly senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning anthony pettinari citigroup analyst tim in transit you cited 2 lower net volumes and i was wondering if it s possible to parse out how the us business did versus the non us businesses maybe how consumables did versus tools and equipment and then just sequentially as you went through the quarter and maybe into july did you see trends deteriorate significantly in certain regions or in certain categories any kind of detail if you give will be helpful timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director sure so i think if we looked at consumables versus equipment in the second quarter it looks like if we re down 2 the equipment maybe makes up at 0 7 of that in the consumables are 1 of that ex currency i m talking i would say that in july we are on track through the quarter things were april was soft may was fairly firm the first three weeks of june were firm the last week of june was soft but july has started off firm again so i think on i think as we sit here today we re only three weeks into the quarter but the guidance we ve given you for the third and fourth quarters to be off about 4 million to 5 million per quarter 8 million to 10 million for the back half in a 1 2 billion business back half business so down a touch but not strikingly down and i think where we re at in july for the first 17 days or 18 days we feel pretty good about that right now anthony pettinari citigroup analyst okay that s helpful and then just switching the european food is it possible to parse out how much of the miss was relative to your expectations was this weaker mix versus the inflationary cost increases that you referenced and then just more of a big picture question i think two of your large competitors now have sold or moved food can into kind of a jv structure just any thoughts you have on the business is placed with the portfolio timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director so i to parse out mix and compared to the prior year and then i ll give you compared to expectations compared to the prior year volume up a little bit but mix negative and priced well up as i said not enough to cover cost and i d say that s probably of the 20 million let s say eight of its price and 12 of its mix if you just want some round numbers and i could be off 1 million or 2 million one way or the other but you kind of get the to adjust there i think the two transactions that the two competing companies have done in food are very different one was just a north american business and a smaller business the other is a global business and a very large business both have the same both of the companies accomplishing the same thing they retain a significant interest in the new company going forward so they re not really exiting the business and they always retain the option to acquire the business or acquire a controlling stake in the business in the future depending upon what their private equity partner does but in the near term both acquiring significant proceeds in the near term either to delever and or to return to shareholders and you re aware of what each of them are doing i would say that our food can business you know is while it is down in europe this year and up in north america currently both of those businesses provide significant free cash flow and given where interest rates are today any move in that regard would be dilutive to free cash flow and that the interest that you would save by paying off low cost debt would not be enough to offset the free cash flow that you give up so in the near term we like the we always like the business they are stable businesses they ve got their ups and downs but there are more or less stable business the european food business is far different than the north american food business but there is a place for food cans in both markets and we don t we talk about sustainability a lot as it relates to beverage cans there s not a lot of talk about food cans in regards to sustainability but one way food can packaging in tetra flexible and plastic is even more of an environmental burden then i would say plastic bottles are in the beverage world plastic bottles as you ve heard me describe are separable and recyclable tetra and flexible are all trash not recyclable in any great way and food cans steel food cans are entirely recyclable so the hope is that there is more momentum on the food packaging side to more fully embrace food cans from an environmental or sustainable standpoint and we continue to like the business anthony pettinari citigroup analyst okay that s helpful i ll turn it over timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director thank you operator thank you so much our next question is from the line of ghansham panjabi of baird your line is now open ghansham panjabi robert w baird analyst hey guys good morning timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director good morning ghansham ghansham panjabi robert w baird analyst so i guess first off on the plant conversion can you sort of take us through the logics the conversion versus just building a new plant and since you called out the new lines is having the capability to produce specialty can should we expect further investments in your end to boost your capabilities in north america timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director yes so the weston i saw your note this morning ghansham and we probably didn t make it clear enough in the release so apologies the weston plant currently has two beverage can lines and one food can line so for the food can line the pieces of the food can line that are in good shape that is the washer we ll use that for the beverage line but much of the equipment going into the third line in western for beverage will be new equipment and so i would describe to you that if we re spending x dollars in nichols to put a third food can line and that will spend x minus 10 million or 12 million in weston and that minus 10 million or 12 million is the using the washer and i think we re we ve got a couple of pieces of equipment s that are in pretty good shape from the recently shutdown lawrence plant that will use but much of that equipment is brand new and well operate as if it s a brand new line from front to back in weston just as well the nichols or any other brand new lines so we perhaps weren t as clear on that but it is a beverage can plant it s not a food can plant and as you just rightly pointed out we don t have the capability both of those lines well the capability to produce sleek and 16 ounce which we need in our portfolio in which we ve been trying to catch up to the market i think we are up year on year we re probably up our mix is probably a 3 percentage points to 4 percentage points from last year to this year between standard 12 ounce and sleek in 16 and we ll continue to look for responsible ways to improve our portfolio and our percentage of those growing portions of the market ghansham panjabi robert w baird analyst okay that s helpful and then just a broader question on your north american sort of capacity footprint pepsi on their call last week seemed to indicate that they would push alternative can sizes for their sparkling water brand and also start to trial stillwater on the west coast i guess is your current footprint across the us able to supply these type of large customer initiatives especially for specialty cans i m just trying to put your 1 volume growth you called out in north american context as it relates to capacity footprint thanks timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director yes well 1 volume growth essentially were sold out right and as we described in april we are not sourcing cans from third parties just to sell more cans we did in an effort to try to correct or significantly improve the cost structure we gave up some business so that we would focus on the business that we could actually produce not just sell cans that we bought from others so the additional capacity that we ve announced last evening will obviously help us grow into contracted volumes that we already have next year beginning in january 1 20 and forward and we would expect much more volume growth next year than the 1 we just recorded as it relates to supply and customers on a national basis for a variety of these sizes our non standard 12 ounce portfolio capacity portfolio exists in as we ve described before texas mississippi new york and now ontario and in the future we ll continue to review is there something we should be doing in the midwest or west coast to further broaden our portfolio ghansham panjabi robert w baird analyst yes thanks a lot tim timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director you re welcome operator thank you so much our next question is from the line of edlain rodriguez of ubs your line is now open edlain rodriguez ubs analyst good morning guys timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director good morning edlain rodriguez ubs analyst a quick question on transit i think like last quarter you ve talked about like pricing competition going on in the industry like is this accelerate in and how do you deal with that do you have to compete on pricing yourself i m quoting last quarter you said you didn t want to lower prices so how do you deal timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director yes so listen price was the impact of price compared to the prior year was negligible i want to say far less than 0 5 in the quarter so there was no price impact the situation that i referred to in q1 the principal us competitor for plastic strap was sold to private equity they were somewhat aggressive as they were in their sale process and so that has that s now behind us and so that situation has settled down but it s a very diverse business we don t we have not seen any price any negative price consequences other than that one situation edlain rodriguez ubs analyst okay and in bev can like are you changing your expectation for growth like what are your expectation for growth in the different markets and are they changing given the environmental issues that need to be addressed out there timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director well i think we like you and like many others view the current environment for beverage cans globally to be the best we ve seen in 30 some years and so many of you are new to the industry but for the long time beverage cans were let s be clear were not a great business but this is now a great time to be in beverage cans and i think that s going to exist for several or many years to come given what we and you and many other see with the environmental sustainability or environmental impacts of the beverage can versus competing packages we however are being somewhat cautious as we look to install a new capacity until we see more concrete signs of demand or we get business under contract ahead of putting capacity and so the capacity that we announced last night you should fully expect that that is fully under contract and is necessary to meet contract requirements it is not built on spec so we ll continue to review each market but the markets all of the markets southeast asia europe brazil north america seem to be extremely firm with conversions looking to happen to can dependent upon the can industry s ability to meet that conversion requirement and so we like others are very fortunate and we look forward to many good years to come here edlain rodriguez ubs analyst okay makes sense thank you timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director thank you operator thank you so much our next question on queue is from the line of chip dillon of vertical research your line is now open chip dillon vertical research analyst yes good morning tim and tom for the details timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director good morning chip thomas a kelly senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning chip chip dillon vertical research analyst first question is it looks like when we look at the growth in europe and particularly not including the middle east i mean it s really really great 4 5 in the first quarter you said i think 8 in the second can you talk a little bit about what s going on there is that the market itself or are you just happening to be in segments where it looks like you re gaining share when you look at the overall market timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director so i think if the market chip this is market driven and this is a continuing trend that we ve seen for several years or over a decade 15 years now with the exception i think of 2003 the german deposit legislation and 2009 i think every year for the last 15 years or 18 years we ve seen 2 to 4 4 to 5 market growth in europe as the market grows segments of the market continue to grow whether that s eastern europe southern europe turkey and continuing conversions from glass to can and that s continuing why are we up so much in the second quarter i think as we described to you last year we didn t benefit as much as some of the others benefited last year because we were capacity constrained and at the time we told you we had two new projects coming online and then in 2019 if we had an undersized portion of the growth last year that we would get an oversight or more relevant portion of the growth this year and that s what you re seeing with the two new factories that came online chip dillon vertical research analyst okay all right got you and then just to be clear on the two new lines in north america the nichols third line and the one in weston i would imagine those would be considered specialty lines and i guess if you read them on one or two basic sizes you could get up to what a 1 billion can rate a year is that ballpark correct timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director yes i would say the nichols line clearly could go to about a 1 02 billion the western line think more than the 750 to 900 range i would they have the ability to make a variety of sizes but chip let s be clear there is we keep throwing this term specialty around there is nothing special about making a can other than the 12 ounce standard can we and others make them all around the world and in some markets the 12 ounce to a 11 diameter can doesn t exist anymore it s only sleek can so these are it s a changing marketplace in which the marketers consumer product marketers of the consumer product companies are always trying to find ways to invigorate their brands and we re fortunate that we have the flexibility and the engineering know how in the industry to be able to accomplish that and so while you may refer them as specialty we just think they are alternative sizes chip dillon vertical research analyst got you and then the last one just looking at the european food can business it looks like as you mentioned the volumes will be much better this year but there won t be an income increase and could you talk about the cost issue is it really just a different in the matching of the purchases of metal is that the main factor that last year maybe you had favorable variances and this year you have unfavorable when you look at the price cost on that timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director yes so as we look at the second quarter in the back half of the year volumes will be up compared to last year but nowhere near what we had expected given how poor last year s harvest was so volume up but down versus expectations so that s clearly that s disappointing and then we did get positive price this year but steel costs went up significantly and other costs are always rising whether it s labor or utilities so when you put all of your costs into the cost to manufacture a container bucket we didn t get enough price to fully recover that and that s also disappointing but we ll endeavor to reduce our cost overall and next year is a new year and we ll have to do better next year chip dillon vertical research analyst understood okay thank you timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director thank you operator thank you so much our next question on queue is from tyler langton of jpmorgan chase your line is now open tyler j langton jp morgan chase co analyst yes good morning thank you tim some of that last comment that you made in your european food and i guess you ve lot of visibility at this point that you can kind of overcome this cost inflation for next year or just and as any color there would be helpful timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director yes i think we have the opportunity to adjust price we adjusted price this year in the market and clearly that wasn t enough to offset the inflation so we ll see what the inflationary pressures are going in the next year and under contract we have the ability to do that some of the we had a number of contracts reset this year so that s why it was a little bit more painful but they do have escalators in them and then we do need we ll need to run better and we need to be a bit more accurate with our volume forecast but overall the market is healthy right the demand is there for the cans although it s a little lower this year than volume will be a little lower one of the issues is volumes are little lower than we expected more or less the harvest look like they re going to be ok and when i say ok i mean let s say 90 to 95 of what we expected which is about 105 of last year but last year was down there are some markets where the whether was extremely rough so for example eastern europe the weather was extremely rough that s a very small market for us 90 to 95 of our businesses in western europe italy spain so these are all items around the edge which in a tight margin business items around the edge have an impact but we ll do better on price realization versus cost next year and we ll see where brings us but i this year has been disappointing but again not a it s still a business we re making i think in the third quarter margins were 13 the margin i think in the quarter last year was probably 15 or 16 it was a pretty strong quarter last year and the second quarter but notwithstanding that we are disappointed as we said tyler j langton jp morgan chase co analyst okay that s helpful and then just with transit i think you had talked in the past about maybe doing smaller deals that didn t increase your leverage as you re paying down debt over the next couple of years i mean i guess is that more strategy maybe more on whole now just given sort of weaker volumes you re seeing in transit and caution in that space or would you sort of still consider looking at a timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director well i think we say smaller deals everybody gets nervous when we say this right i think you probably should if we did anything you wouldn t expect us to do total purchase price of more than 20 million this year so we re talking at multiples that are 5x or 6x so the multiples are right it doesn t increase but you re talking extremely low numbers across the balance sheet like ours so but that presupposes we find the right deal and it s in a market that s a growing part of the various markets in that they provide so all of the as i ve said the business that transit serves is extremely diverse across end markets and products and we would be looking at those products and end markets that are more stable and have growth compared to other markets so i wouldn t get overly concerned about anything we re going to do there if we do anything it s going to be extremely small along the lines of the size i just described tyler j langton jp morgan chase co analyst great thanks so much timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director you re welcome operator thank you so much our next question is from the line of neel kumar of morgan stanley your line is now open neel kumar morgan stanley analyst hi good morning timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director good morning neel kumar morgan stanley analyst in brazil what do you think is driving the strong can volume growth that you re seeing there would you say that s due to glass essentially being sold out timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director well glass is sold out currently but underneath that there has to be demand growth coming from the consumer so i think the after a very tumultuous period with the last administration they had they ve had some a little bit of stability here politically and economically they re doing a little better so consumer confidence much better this year than over the last couple of years driving continuing consumer demand for growth you do have a size change proliferation occurring from what you would describe as a standard 12 ounce can to the sleek 9 1 ounce can so when you think about consumed ounces four 9 ounce cans are now and ends are now required to meet the same equivalent of three 12 ounce cans so a variety of things happening and but again the can well positioned to continue to grow share in brazil and if we re right around 50 of the beer market and if north america is 65 to 70 of the beer market still considerable growth yet to come in brazil in our opinion neel kumar morgan stanley analyst great that s helpful and then in asia pacific can you just talk about what drove those 180 basis points improvement in operating margins for the quarter and is that level sustainable for the second half of the year timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director well it s country mix right we closed two plants in china at the end of last year so our chinese business is now roughly 60 of what it was before and the southeast asian business continues to grow and you have heard crown and others talk about challenging conditions in china for years and so as you move away from china and you move back toward southeast asia with those firm growth you get that improvement in percentage margin i think our you know the asians have done well through the first half they ve actually exceeded their own expectations and we ll see how they do in the second half they are traditionally pretty conservative in their forecast so i m hopeful that we continue to outperform their forecasts neel kumar morgan stanley analyst great thanks timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director thank you operator thank you so much our next question is from the line of arun viswanathan timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director viswanathan operator capital markets i m sorry viswanathan your line is now open arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst great thank you so it sounds like the additions that you ve described in north america would bring another 1 to 2 into the industry on a can size base if you look about 90 billion cans i guess is that right and would you see any footprint optimization opportunities elsewhere in your portfolio that would be necessary thanks timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director so the market i think the market is more like 94 billion units to 95 billion units but you re right it s on the order of 1 5 to 2 addition to the market although these are sizes that are different than the standard 12 ounce size and sizes that are required in the market by our customers by our contract customers i do not see any necessary portfolio adjustments or downsizing in our footprint arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst and then as a follow up if we look out over the next couple of years then does this position you i guess to capture numbers that for example in q1 that would have been closer to what the industry saw would have put you in a position to have some extra flex capacity in case growth continues at such a robust base what are your sense on future plans thanks timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director so it s a part of your question is a great question and i m glad you asked because i we oftentimes talk about here and we forget to talk about it so it will allow us to grow our non standard non traditional 12 ounce volume and so if were 16 or 16 5 now and the market is 22 to 24 or we can i don t want to say rapidly but we can responsibly approach industry levels for non standard 12 ounce over the next couple of years but importantly as you point out we ve been in a sold out position in north america for several years we are operating extremely tight and for us not to miss or to not properly serve customers that requires us to sometimes be too perfect so this will give us a little bit of flex so that we re not having to be so perfect and that as customers have short term volume spike needs we can meet those needs yes arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst and just lastly on this issue where do you characterize nichols i guess in general from a start up standpoint do you feel that the learning curve is you wouldn t face any issues going forward and what is what are the existing lines kind of running at these days if you could help timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director yes so we you know it s a good question we like some others from time to time not all start ups are equal we have very good experience in a lot of places to start nichols is a little slower than we like but i wouldn t say it was poor but the lines now are fully through learning curve and we are above 90 efficiency as we measure it so we re quite pleased with where we re at right now at nichols and i would expect the third line to have a much smoother start up than the first two given that we have an experienced workforce and plant management and plant supervisory personnel on the ground and they understand how to make cans now arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst great and i m sorry just one last quick one just to clarify the comment you made on the guidance it sounds like about a 40 million or so cut on the free cash flow at the midpoint i mean if you go through the eps guidance that accounts for maybe about two thirds of that and the rest is capex is that right it sounded like that timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director well i would say that at the midpoint 40 million you re probably right that s right i would say about 30 million of that is capital because we ve gone from about 410 to 440 or 420 to 450 whatever the numbers are on the two lines so we ve moved some things around in capital so we could accomplish this at a 30 million bump and the balance would be the shortfall in ebitda that you mentioned offset by some working capital initiatives so arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst thank you timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director non capex related about 10 million arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst okay thanks timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director you re welcome operator thank you so much mr viswanathan again i do apologize if i say your last name incorrectly earlier arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst that s ok operator our next question is from the thank you our next question is from the line of mr mark wilde of bank of montreal your line is now open mark wilde bank of montreal analyst good morning tim good morning tom thomas a kelly senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director hi mark mark wilde bank of montreal analyst tim is it possible to give us any sense of sort of the benefit that you re getting in 19 from just contractual changes in any perspective on what you might pick up in 2020 timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director it s possible but you re not going to give me to say it mark wilde bank of montreal analyst okay i thought i d try timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director i d say a lot of crazy things mark but i m not that crazy mark wilde bank of montreal analyst yes ok timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director now listen we are look i mean well you ve asked a question so you deserve some kind of answer and i don t mean to be cheeky but there are some things we re not going to talk about but you heard me say in april after a very long time of the can industry doing many great things for its customer base we make cans at speeds now that were unheard of 10 15 20 years ago the industry is supplying relatively the same number of cans to its customer base that it supplied 15 years ago with 40 fewer lines so the engineering and the manpower and the efficiencies that we ve all gain that we ve worked so hard to do we deserve to keep some of that and we ve given far too much although and more away to the customer base as an industry which in short terms means we haven t been properly compensated for all we ve done for the customer base and so the conditions are right for us to have a little bit of strength to try to recover some of that but i ll be quite honest we re going to recover a lot of that over the next couple of years it s still not enough in my opinion because we re here to make money for our constituent base not just for the constituents that own the customer base so we are going to do better some of that will come from price some of that will come from terms but it always requires us to meet the customer needs with service and quality and we continue to endeavor to do that mark wilde bank of montreal analyst okay good answer i wondered just turning to capital allocation you ve talked about both share repurchase activity and a dividend in the past and i wondered if you could just update us on your thinking there after you reach an appropriate level of leverage timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director so we ve continued to state to you that we believe will be a 3 5x leverage by the end of 20 which is where we were before the signode acquisition so two years and nine months we re back to the same leverage level and i think at that time that s an appropriate time for our board to consider capital returns to shareholders as you ve described mark wilde bank of montreal analyst okay and tim just thinking about sort of this shift that we are all talking about between kind of plastic bottles and aluminum cans do you worry at all about the perception of a lot of growth actually growing in not only new capacity but really new competitors into the market timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director well mark i worry about lot of things right you can imagine you worry about a lot of things there are some things you worry about because they re firmly in the control of the management and the teams within the company and there are some things that are not in your control whether it s legislative or what other companies do but we ve endeavored to make offerings to numerous customers and service those customers over decades and they entrust with us the ability to provide them quality and service and a product and meet their needs and so we will spend money as necessary to meet those customers needs where we have contracts and as i said before i can t worry about what others are going to do what they might do or what they might not do but i would say that the capacity we ve announced is under contract it is necessary for us to supply and service our customers but as you ve heard me say we are being somewhat cautious in all of the markets on sustainability because until we see concrete evidence of a much larger conversion then we re seeing now that it would be inappropriate for us or others to get too far ahead of ourselves mark wilde bank of montreal analyst yes ok the last one i had just in terms of this view that the market is going to accelerate in terms of growth and we ve got the all of these kind of foreign trade issues out there what are you seeing your suppliers in the can sheet market do where do you see kind of capacity moving there both in north america and abroad timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director i think in north america there are essentially three can sheet manufacturing locations across four suppliers two of them share one location or four locations maybe there s four locations i would say that for the guys that are still in can sheet in north america they are committed to can sheet they understand that is a very stable business they understand that stable business especially in their environment they can budget more appropriately i have taken the opportunity to remind them all that if they want to convert to auto sheet and they want to be an auto supplier they should keep in mind that most of the suppliers of the auto industry are bankrupt or have been bankrupt so there are far better off supplying the can business and the auto business long term but they ve got visions of a volume growth with auto and trucks moving to aluminum sheets so they ll continue to look at that but i think they are committed to they are committed to can sheet and there is a lot of can sheet capacity around the world especially in china now we have some trade issues going on there but the chinese have brand new facilities high quality facilities high quality can sheet so there is can sheet available mark wilde bank of montreal analyst okay very good i ll turn it over thanks tim timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director thank you operator thank you so much our next question is from the line of george staphos of bank of america your line is now open george staphos bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi everyone good morning thanks for the details timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director hi george george staphos bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi tim how are you doing i know what i heard on food europe but i just wanted to go over this again i think you parsed out 12 million in mix and 8 million from price cost i heard you correctly to toward your earlier questions now pricing is set more or less annually usually by april so what else went wrong in terms of your view on pricing and its ability to recover cost relative to what your expectations would have been back in april and then in mix again this is a relatively stable business you called out dairy called out fish maybe the fish didn t swim in the second quarter but and we know that that happens sometimes in terms of the cash but can you give us a bit more detail because 20 million i don t remember a quarter in a long time in food europe that was off that much versus the prior year and versus expectations timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director it s down the line george because you ve asked a couple of questions here so remind me the first question again george staphos bank of america merrill lynch analyst well i mean the first question pricing is usually set by april right and so timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director yes so as i at one point i described you ve got comparisons versus the prior year and comparisons versus expectations so the big challenge for us pricing was set and while volume was up a 0 5 in the second quarter versus the prior year it was far below what we expected in the second quarter and will below be below what we expected in the third quarter considering how poor the harvest was last year george staphos bank of america merrill lynch analyst yes timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director so with lower volume george you get lower recovery right compared to expectations george staphos bank of america merrill lynch analyst i understand i mean if you had mentioned it earlier i missed it where volumes versus your expectations for 2q and as we sit here today 3q and food europe timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director so up a 0 5 compared to prior year and probably down about 8 compared to expectations and in the third quarter will be up as you know mid single digits i believe in the third quarter but that will still be down mid single digits compared to expectations just it did not it will be some recovery this year compared to last year but nowhere near what we thought we are going to get george staphos bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay and did your contract negotiations give you any issues in terms of setting price or and not really relative to what you were budgeting timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director no i think and we might have touched upon this in february or april i you know the there are several smaller competitors and so they may have been on the edges because they only compete on the edges but they can hamper issues they coming out of a very poor volume year last year everybody including the small guys was trying to ensure they had as much volume this year so it probably was a bit more competitive than we would have liked george staphos bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay i know it s getting late in the call and maybe some others dialing in so i ll try to ask my remaining question just kind of in one shot to expedite it minority interest was up a lot i m assuming that s a high class problem related to good volume around the rest of world in beverage but could you confirm that or give us what the source of that was and then with signode you gave us guidance for the second half of the year what is embedded in that guidance is it the current july rate which you said was i think quite firm or something below that level so if you carry july into the back half of the year there is upside to the guidance there timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director so on the minority tom will correct me if i m wrong but very quickly on the minority net minority operating minority is about the same year on year the difference we had a large tax settlement in brazil george staphos bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director so the brazilian partner gets after that but that s scheduled out in the not the reconciliation table that was just the capital item george staphos bank of america merrill lynch analyst yes i thought it just whether your minority was up even with that but i ll verify that timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director 14 million or 15 million of the minority thomas a kelly senior vice president and chief financial officer it is still up george but for the full year if you take that out you re running about 23 million in the third second quarter which is about what we would expect and the full year will be low 90s george staphos bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director and then on transit we did the reforecast right at the beginning of july based on activity that occurred in the second quarter and as i mentioned everything is going pretty well into the last 10 days of june so i don t know how conservative the guys were and when i say activity is firm in july it s firm to the forecast they presented so they could be a little cautious but we ll see i think all in all as i said it s a 1 2 billion business in the last half of the year and if we re all 8 to 10 million it s off a little bit we are all you guys are sitting with your economic activity glass is on it s not going to be off as much as you guys are worried about it s fairly firm george staphos bank of america merrill lynch analyst and last one for me recognizing you re going to get ultimately more earnings out of the beverage line conversion in weston what is that conversion to take out of if you will the food and non reportable segment on an annualized basis thank you guys timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director we did announced it but we will replace that food can capacity in another location so might you know at the beginning of next year maybe a 1 million or 2 million per quarter in the first couple of quarters but after that we ll be back in line george staphos bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay thank you guys timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director you re welcome operator thank you so much our next question is from the line of kyle white of deutsche bank your line is now open kyle white deutsche bank analyst hey guys thanks for taking the question just curious on brazil i think called out volumes up 4 in latin america i was just wondering how that compared to the overall market in the industry it sounded like maybe had to leave some sales on table just being capacity constrained there timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director you are absolutely correct so we were up 6 in brazil in the quarter the market was up firmly in double digits but as you rightly point out and as we said we were capacity constrained and we couldn t go any further kyle white deutsche bank analyst thank you that s helpful and then on the new competitor in colombia i know they ve added some capacity in brazil as well before i m just trying to get a sense of your view of this competitor you can be with them over in europe and just how discipline that you found them to be and just trying to get the sense of what kind of risk there is that there is more moves or more investments to kind of take share from this competitor going forward timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director no listen they are a competitor like any other competitor and they have designs on running a global beverage can business and they had an opportunity to come to brazil i m assuming i ll just say i m assuming that s a safe way to put it i m assuming that the deal they made to get the brazil was tied to the colombian business we kind of knew that a year ago or a little more than that and we ll see where they go but they are competitor like any other competitor they re a good competitor kyle white deutsche bank analyst okay that s helpful i ll turn it over good luck in the quarter timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director thank you operator thank you so much our last question on queue is from the line of adam josephson of keybanc your line is now open adam josephson keybanc capital markets analyst tim and tom good morning timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director good morning thomas a kelly senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning adam josephson keybanc capital markets analyst tom a couple for you to start just on capex i know so 19 guidance now is 440 just given the north american bev can projects do you expect next year to be similar up down can you give us any sort of perspective i appreciate and it s still early days thomas a kelly senior vice president and chief financial officer well we came into the year saying 400 to 425 we re essentially i mean 440 is not that much offset number so similar let s say at this point adam josephson keybanc capital markets analyst for next year okay thomas a kelly senior vice president and chief financial officer yes adam josephson keybanc capital markets analyst and then on working cap for this year any change compared to your previous expectations and same pertains to dividends and minorities on the cash flow statement thomas a kelly senior vice president and chief financial officer yes so working capital we said we thought we were going to be about flat at this point i d say we re expecting some contribution from working capital on real significant but some contribution and on the minority dividends in response to george s question a minute ago we were talking about the gain we had in brazil from the tax because of that gain we have the capacity to pay a bigger dividend for the minority dividend whereas previously we are saying about 75 million perhaps that number is up 10 million or so adam josephson keybanc capital markets analyst and is that 85 then is that a sustainable number tom timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director could be back to 75 or 80 thomas a kelly senior vice president and chief financial officer yes timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director it s a adam it s a the tax settlement was a one time settlement this year so the get the money out of the country so pay dividend adam josephson keybanc capital markets analyst got it ok and tim just one on signode so obviously when you announced signode i think part of the rationale correct me if i m wrong was that beverage can growth was limited at that time and have been for a long time for that matter and now you re ramping up spending on beverage cans obviously because of the recent pick up we ve seen in the north american market so since the time you announced signode have your expectations pertaining signode and beverage cans for that matter changed fairly significantly just seems like you go from moving away from bev cans and now you re kind of moving back to bev cans at a time with signode is slowing so i m just wondering how your thoughts on those two businesses have changed since that time timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director so i would say on beverage cans you re the thoughts over the last 12 months to 18 months are everything significantly more optimistic just given the sustainability environment we re in and but it will require capital and cash to build out more capacity in various regions around the world but that s all the positive thing that s going to generate future value for everybody on signode nothing is changed i think as i said nine of the last 10 quarters you re describing the business declining nine of the last 10 quarters the ebitda is in the 90 million to 95 million range and last year s second quarter for a variety of reasons was far beyond anything they ve ever done before and we talked about that last year some of the reasons why so i don t think our view on transit has changed at all it s remarkably consistent on an ebitda basis in 19 compared to 18 and 17 even in the face of some currencies so really generating a lot of high cash flow increases the cash flow yield and provides a lot of necessary cash flow to continue to build out the beverage can business analyst just last question tim on signode at the analyst day you talked about signode s ebitda going back a decade or more i forget exactly what but obviously in 19 ebitda was down a lot and then it was up similarly in 10 do you think the economic the sense the volatility in signode s ebitda is diminished at all from where it was call it a decade ago so in other words in the event we go into what meaningful downturn do you have any reason to think that ebitda would be at least somewhat stable in that business timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director so i think two things are different i think the global financial crisis of 2008 2009 was not a what you would describe as a normal downturn we re the operating recession so i think everybody needs to remember that right that was something far different but i do think and as we have described signode while it was still owned by itw and then while it was owned by the private equity firm made incredible strides to try to change the business profile of the end markets they were serving they became much bigger in the protected space less reliant on strap much bigger than food and beverage less reliant on the steel industry so the business is far more stable today or let s say it s while it is cyclical it s less cyclical than it was then yes adam josephson keybanc capital markets analyst okay thanks a lot tim timothy j donahue president chief executive officer and director you re welcome maisy i think you said that was the last call so thank you very much and that concludes the call today thank all of you for joining us and we ll speak to

investors are selling us dollars and we d like to explain why all of the major currencies traded higher against the greenback on thursday with the exception of the canadian dollars there are no fewer than 5 reasons for the greenback s weakness over the last 24 hours 5 reasons why traders are selling us dollars 1 federal reserve poised to cut rates this month 2 iran seized a foreign tanker 3 us treasury secretary mnuchin teases possible change in dollar policy 4 earnings disappointments drive stocks lower 5 usd jpy closes in on 1 month lows the backdrop should be one of us dollar weakness because the federal reserve is poised to lower interest rates this month although they may only grant us one rate cut in 2019 the mere fact that they are easing at all after raising interest rates in december marks a significant shift in monetary policy and the outlook for the economy investors are also worried about tensions in the middle east after iran seized a foreign oil tanker if you recall the us was close to striking iran in june after an american drone was shot done over the strait of hormuz treasury secretary mnuchin teased the possible of a change in dollar policy this morning he said there was no change in the country s currency policy for now which suggests that they could alter the government s support for a strong dollar in the future as another way to tip the trade scales in the country s favor earnings season is also in full swing and the results have been mediocre stocks are down 4 days in a row and its taking a toll on usd jpy japan s trade surplus didn t help and leaves usd jpy trading near its monthly low looking ahead we expect further losses with a possible test of june lows near 106 78 the british pound and australian dollar were the best performers uk retail sales completely blew expectations rising 1 in the month of june against a forecast for 0 3 decline spending excluding auto fuel was also very strong which means that underlying demand is robust this increase sufficiently covered the declines in april and may and will ease concerns about the impact of lower business investment sterling traders were also encouraged by reports that the european union may be open to an alternative backstop which has been a pressure point for the two leading candidates for uk prime minister the australian dollar was driven higher after the most recent labor market numbers although a mere 0 5k jobs were created in the month of june the miss was due entirely to part time work full time jobs increased 21k a solid rise that left the unemployment rate unchanged at 5 2 the data could have been worse according to the pmis so investors were relieved aud usd is hovering just under 3 month highs and could break higher in the coming days last but not least the canadian dollar failed to participate in today s rally because oil prices fell for the sixth day in a row the price of crude tumbled towards 55 a barrel its lowest level in nearly a month canadian retail sales are due for release tomorrow and investors are worried that given the bank of canada s dovishness we could see softer spending numbers if the data is weak it could finally mark a bottom for usd cad
running the international monetary fund is clearly one of the most important jobs in global finance the imf played a key role in steering the world out of financial crisis was central to the bailout of crisis hit eurozone nations and is engaged in rescue operations from the ukraine to argentina plainly the next managing director following the desertion of christine lagarde to the european central bank should be the best person for the job the imf played a key role in steering the world out of financial crisis was central to the bail out of crisis hit eurozone nations and is engaged in rescue operations from ukraine to argentina if the will of the g20 of the world s most influential countries were heeded the old carve up which ceded the top job at the world bank to the united states and the equivalent at the imf to a european would have been replaced by an open process that does not seem very likely it may be just as well given that the trump white house no natural admirer of multilateral institutions would likely push for one of its own populist clones at the top but even if the historic settlement remains the same the idea that stewardship of the imf should be a franco german carve up to be decided in the same smoked salmon filled rooms as posts within the european union is outrageous it is extraordinary that 75 years after bretton woods where britain s most esteemed economist john maynard keynes played a leading role there has never been a anglo saxon managing director this in spite of the fact that some of the europeans most notably dominique strauss kahn and spaniard rodrigo rato have brought nothing but disgrace on the reputation of the institution if reports of brussels thinking are to be believed the eu nations are planning to throw their weight behind former eurogroup boss jeroen dijsselbloem who played a role in the bailout of greece given that since the euro crisis greece has suffered a loss of 25 per cent of output that might not be an unalloyed triumph in the light of the brexit stand off between london and brussels the possibility of an anglo saxon boss for the imf was always an outside bet few could argue with bank of england governor mark carney who has irish as well as his british and canadian background played a critical role in rebuilding the global banking system after the crash through the financial stability board securing the big bretton woods jobs has always been about brutal power with his irish ancestry carney s best hope might be getting north americans seeking to avoid a eurozone stitch up on side but as admirable as the flexible low tax irish economic model has proved post euro crisis dublin lacks firepower to impose its will even it wanted to what a shambles last call doubtless the 3billion offer for britain s largest pubs group ei formerly enterprise inns by private equity outfit stonegate is a good price but we should never forget that pubs hold a special place in communities up and down the land and being hidden from view under private ownership with a domicile which leads to the cayman islands may not be the best ownership under its current leadership ei has done a good job in strengthening the share price of an indebted company which was struggling and moving to a better way of operating it has so far converted 400 of its 4 000 tenanted pubs into more modern managed houses more capable of offering the real home brew ales that the hipster generation prefers it has been a slow burn of around 100 pubs a year but the direction has been clear the promise is that under a new ownership structure the pace of change will be increased and stonegate has experience through running the slug lettuce maybe but private equity ownership has a bad record in the uk poorly run and indebted enterprises coming out of private equity include the care homes group southern cross which ended up in administration saga and the aa where value has been hollowed out and debenhams now in the hands of creditors the model is to load the acquisitions up with more debt and separate operating companies from valuable property squeezing the tenants for higher rents dividends are siphoned off to tax havens for unknown and unseen investors it would be terrific if long holders of ei shares which include standard aberdeen and m g would bear with the turnaround plan and public shareholders and communities continued to benefit from transparent ownership
1 fed releases more doves the fed doves cooed overnight and that lifted spirits in the us stock market two influential voices from the fed spoke during wall street trading hours with each suggesting that interest rates ought to move lower and that the central bank would not wait for a deterioration in economic data to do this the marginally improved prospect of looser financial conditions immediately fed through to share prices and the statements managed to turn around what was an otherwise slack if not slightly negative day in global markets following a selldown in asian and european equities as well as news of an escalation in us iran tensions 2 stocks up yields down lower us dollar boosts aussie the reassuring language from fed speakers put a fire under wall street stocks and led to a fall in global bond yields the s p500 challenged the 3000 mark once again adding around 0 4 per cent for the session the fed sensitive yield on us 2 year treasury notes fell 6 basis points as markets increased their bets of a double rate cut from the fed at their july 31st meeting the us dollar plunged half a per cent as a result pushing the aussie dollar above 70 70 us cents falling global interest rates also set of a flurry in gold prices and concurrently bitcoin with the yellow metal registering a fresh 6 year high 3 sustained bullishness less than guaranteed after its selloff on thursday the asx ought to add about 12 points at the open this morning the australian stock market is being guided by global forces right now us earnings season has got off to a very slack start and fresh belligerence from the trump administration towards the chinese has unsettled the post g20 trade war optimism really markets are probably still overall in the process of a much needed pullback share prices in the us and australia are looking stretched while technical indicators have suggested an overbought market for a little while an improved earnings outlook is still required to sustain this bull run 4 aussie jobs data mixed if not slightly positive the australian labour market dominated the local economic calendar on thursday on the surface the results were mixed the unemployment rate held steady at 5 2 per cent while the australian economy only added a paltry 500 jobs overall in june but digging into the detail and some positive information emerged though the jobs change number came in well below expectations the economy did manage to increase full time jobs by 21 100 at the expense of 20 600 part time jobs furthermore the underemployment rate managed to fall to 8 2 per cent in seasonally adjusted terms and the participation rate managed to hold steady at its historical high of 66 per cent 5 the spare capacity question those small details were the catalyst of the very mild bullishness witnessed in the australian dollar and interest rate markets yesterday a reminder the australian economy s malaise and the rba s justification for recent interest rate cuts can be tied back to spare capacity in the labour market although the headline unemployment rate is the best barometer of the extent of this spare capacity the participation rate underemployment rate and full time employment are key indicators of whether the existing stock labour is being fully utilised improvements in these metrics suggest that maybe over time the unemployment rate will decrease and soak up the spare capacity
but this is where the conversation drifts into waters that policymakers in the us have thus far left uncharted and that s what mchenry was trying to point out with his questioning what facebook is proposing is obviously much different from conventional digital payment services like paypal or venmo the most important distinction is that in theory no single organization will be in charge of libra facebook has created a nonprofit organization called the libra association to lead the development of the platform and has signed up 27 organizations as participants including visa mastercard paypal uber and spotify some of the biggest questions about libra that facebook has left unanswered pertain to this organization particularly how it will be governed countless times this week marcus reiterated what facebook been trumpeting all along that it will not be in charge that it will be only one of 28 votes and that it plans to increase the number of organizations to 100 by next year if we are to believe facebook the libra association will be a new kind of organization one with no central authority blockchain technology is what makes it possible the company says but there s a problem with this the business of taking care of people s money is heavily regulated in the us during the two hearings several members of congress said something similar to what president trump tweeted recently that what facebook is proposing is actually a bank and should be regulated as such banks must follow strict rules meant to combat money laundering they are also required to protect consumers against theft and depositors are insured in case the bank loses their money should libra users have those protections too but if no single entity is really in charge of libra who do you regulate how could it comply with banking style rules each time this came up marcus pushed back facebook had no plans to engage in banking activities he said what seemed to matter more to congress however was not whether the project meets the technical definition of a bank but the significance of facebook s massive scale and potential to drive adoption of its currency if billions of people start using it libra could have a profound effect on the global financial system which makes government oversight imperative said representative maxine waters of california who chairs the financial services committee ultimately if facebook s plans come to fruition the company and its partners will wield immense economic power that could destabilize currencies and governments said waters who has also called for a moratorium on the project so that congress can study it wednesday s house hearing focused heavily on practical concerns about how libra will work whereas the prevailing tone of the senate s go round the day before reflected many senators distrust of facebook and its motives the company s track record on privacy suggests that it is dangerous said senator sherrod brown of ohio adding that it showed breathtaking arrogance that it now wants to run its own global bank we d be crazy to give a chance to experiment with people s bank accounts and to use powerful tools they don t understand like monetary policy to jeopardize hardworking americans ability to provide for their families he said but this isn t just about facebook big tech is coming for financial services we already see it in china where wechat and alibaba s digital payment services are ubiquitous the bank of international settlements which is known as the central bank for central banks has warned that these firms and others including google and amazon could become dominant in the area thanks to network effects in the face of this seemingly inevitable wave of change policymakers will have to strike the right balance between fostering innovation and protecting consumers facebook has just given them a place to start what is a libra

majority of the exploration drilling was close to existing development and infrastructure thereby expanding the structural understanding of the orebody and in turn supporting increased mine life potential all four lm90 rigs were utilised drilling 13 661 metres in q2 outstanding results were delivered throughout the quarter unlocking more resource and reserve growth potential from underground high grade structures within the porphyry also of significance was the drilling into the horus deeps that is currently 400 metres below the existing reported resources these results continue to expand on the resource potential at depth a total of 1 615 metres were budgeted for longer term exploratory drilling into the horus deeps a further 2 000 metres of deep drilling is budgeted for horus deeps

the stabilizing economic conditions in egypt almost three years after allowing its currency to float serves as a clear reminder to nigeria that egypt made the right decision today when comparing the two nations side by side egypt stands tall while nigeria continues to nurse wounds inflicted from depreciating oil prices while inflation in egypt has slowed to single digits with growth projected to hit 5 5 in 2019 nigeria s inflation was 11 2 in june with growth expected to expand by 2 1 according to the international monetary fund imf a free floating naira will certainly sting the nigerian economy via capital flight and sharp depreciation in the naira this will impact consumers as inflationary pressures skyrockets with naira weakness felt across all four corners of the nation advertisement however a free floating exchange rate removes an element of uncertainty over multiple exchanges ultimately stimulating foreign direct investment although a free floating naira could have positive impacts on the nigerian economy in the long term the real question is whether the nation is strong enough to weather the initial storm created from runaway inflation and a weaker local currency dollar s throne under threat as fed flags interest rate cut advertisement attraction towards the us dollar is set to fade during the second half of 2019 as expectations mount over the federal reserve cutting interest rates for the first time in more than 10 years persistent us china trade tensions concerns over slowing global growth and instances of disappointing economic data from the united states have left the federal reserve cautious and ready to make a move lower interest rates in the largest economy in the world is bad news for the greenback as foreign investors flock to countries with higher returns with the imf recently stating that the us dollar was overvalued by 6 12 further pain is in the cards for the currency advertisement the dollar s safe haven status will be challenged during h2 especially if trade tensions impact us economic growth and fuel speculation of more us interest rate cuts by the federal reserve oil prices dragged lower by demand concerns the outlook on global growth and direction of us china trade talks will heavily influence where oil concludes this year fears over slowing global growth negatively impacting demand for crude oil have put a lid on wti and brent prices although opec have agreed to extend production cuts till march 2020 oil markets are more concerned with the demand side of the equation and whether appetite for oil will improve this year advertisement for as long as these fears remain present wti and brent as positioned to weaken further in the short to medium term there is no place like gold in a low interest rate environment advertisement gold is set to shine with extreme intensity thanks to a weaker dollar fears revolving around slowing global growth and most importantly lower interest rates across the globe the precious metal tends to perform well in a low interest rates environment given how it is a zero yielding asset rising expectations over the federal reserve cutting interest rates this year should ensure a solid foundation for the precious metal to appreciate advertisement gold prices are trading comfortably above 1400 as of writing and are positioned to sprint towards 1450 when the federal reserve cuts interest rates for the first time since 2008

the seal of the international monetary fund imf is seen outside of the headquarters building in washington dc on april 8 2019 the international monetary fund on wednesday said that the u s dollar was overvalued by 6 to 12 based on near term economic fundamentals while the euro japan s yen and china s yuan were seen as broadly in line with fundamentals the imf has been at odds with u s president donald trump over his use of tariffs to resolve trade imbalances but its assessment that the dollar is overvalued is likely to give trump more fodder for his frequent complaints that dollar strength is hampering u s exports trump has railed against european and chinese policies that lead to what he calls devaluation of the euro and other currencies against the dollar the fund s external sector report an annual assessment of currencies and external surpluses and deficits of major economies showed that current account surpluses remained centred in the euro area and other advanced economies such as singapore while deficits remained persistent in the united states britain and some emerging market economies the report said net creditor positions had increased again and were now at a historical peak of about 20 percent of global gross domestic product or about four times the level seen in the early 1990s net debtor positions were at a similar level the fund which has warned that the u s china trade war could cost the global economy about 455 billion next year said recent trade policy actions were weighing on global trade flows eroding confidence and disrupting investment but they had done nothing to reverse external imbalances thus far instead of tit for tat tariffs surplus and deficit countries should work to revive liberalization efforts and strengthen the rules based multilateral trading system that has been in effect for the past 75 years the imf said it said short term financing risks were generally contained since debtor positions were concentrated in reserve currency issuing economies but risks remained for the global economy an intensification of trade tensions or a disorderly brexit outcome with further repercussions for global growth and risk aversion could affect other economies that are highly dependent on foreign demand and external financing it said over the medium term trade tensions could become entrenched and further divergence of external stock positions could trigger costly disruptive adjustments in key debtor economies that could spill over to the rest of the world it said countries with deficits like the united states and britain should pare back spending in a growth friendly manner while those with big surpluses like germany the netherlands and korea should boost public infrastructure investment and discourage excessive saving while the report assessed the euro s valuation as appropriate for the eurozone as a whole it said the euro s real effective exchange rate was 8 to 18 too low for germany s fundamentals given its high current account surplus the report said that while china s yuan was broadly in line with its fundamentals imf models showed wide divergences with desired policies from an 11 5 undervaluation to an 8 5 percent overvaluation due to uncertainties over beijing s policy outlook

millennium challenges economic issues and international politics in sr lanka part 1 by edward theophilus recent political analysis of mr c a chandraprema in sunday island on 14 07 2019 allowed understanding the truth about the achievement of millennium goals in sri lanka as it has been quite closed information that most of the population in the country including politicians have no idea about this test performance i associated with university students in pacific countries to discuss un millennium goals after the year 2000 however i didn t know that sri lanka also was a country covered by un millennium goals as the official statistics published by the central bank of sri lanka showed that it should not include achieving millennium goals as the economic status of the country was in above level than the targeted level of the united nation i critically discussed economic issues and related social cultural and education issues with students and understood that skills development was a key factor in achieving millennium goals in developing countries of the pacific region i believed that sri lanka was a country with reasonably economic achievements and a country where was not expecting economic supports from developed nations to get out of poverty the analysis of mr chandraprema changed my assumption and encouraged to rethink about the original discussion as un focus on the millennium goals and the views of millennium corporation seem to be contradicting or different from the original un goals the un discussions on the millennium goals strongly focused on debt reduction in third world countries and did millennium challenge corporation support to debt reduction or to write off sri lanka s debt to international financial organizations is not clear inflation in sri lanka theoretically inflation is defined and explained as cost push or demand pull and in early 1950s prof milton freedman added monetarists view on inflation that the increase in money supply m1 m2 would impact on the increase in inflation the traditional instruments of the monetary regulator and the authority the central bank of sri lanka is to use interest rate as a controlling measure of inflation with other controls such as open market operations and reserve ratio however they are not effective in sri lanka as they are working well in developed countries where have a higher level of access to formal financial markets sri lanka is not such a developed financial market with information and information management other credit control measures such as selective controls used in sri lanka but deregulation of financial markets had to put them away since the late 1980s printing money for fiscal purposes badly affected on inflation because treasury bonds issued to find funds for budget purposes were invested by the central bank of sri lanka printing money i don t really know whether sri lanka had passed the test for inflation but ordinary people especially rural poor states that they are facing economic predicaments because prices of goods and services are increasing day by day it is seen that the government has failed to control inflation and the general price level going up and up every day inflation is a highly argumentative economic issue in developed countries as well as in developing countries when we were learning macroeconomics in universities it said that one person s spending today would be a revenue of another in tomorrow and spending would be supported to increase in aggregate demand and inflation is good for a certain extent theoretically it may be true or false but need to ask poor people as they are practically suffered day by day and engage in never ending hard work to cope with inflation in this situation it is quite difficult to believe that the millennium challenge corporation s view that sri lanka has passed the test for inflation in developed countries also produce prices have gone up and the prices of many electronic items have gone down when consider the average situation economists conclude that inflation is lower and successful in the management of the economy about to sri lanka also it is a truth that from the point of views of economists sri lanka may have passed the test of inflation however practically ordinary people cannot enjoy the pass of the test they cannot see any benefit when talking about inflation it needs keep in mind that declining the exchange value of the monetary unit in sri lanka has been contributed to increase in price level of sri lanka the government has failed to control the declining rupee value it is an internationally concerned issue and sri lanka has no economic power to control it regulatory quality deregulation was the popular idea since late 1980s and the idea has been accepted by sri lanka since the beginning of market economic system in 1978 however it is questionable whether sri lanka has been maintaining a purely deregulated economy or an economic environment with regulatory quality the assessment of the quality of regulation management is a difficult task and the way of regulation management is also not acceptable to everybody sri lanka has appointed authorities for regulation management in various market areas such as health education finance agriculture technology and many others the current problem is whether the regulatory authorities discharge the functions prudently and independently without political influences there is clear weakness in many areas and it seems that regulators have become market operators in sri lanka for example central bank of sri lanka is the regulatory authority of the financial markets but it is performing market operations about to superannuation and rural credit management i informed the president of sri lanka this late 1990s the president acknowledged my points so far nothing has been done the central bank allowed to market economic system and operations without quality regulations in various markets and it was the major reason for people to make negative criticism on the market economic system which created many problems in the economic system of the country as well as benefits to poor people finding a right price for their produce the main purpose of the regulator is to protect consumers in the trade or market operations i have a reasonable question has regulatory authorities in various trade areas in sri lanka are successful in protecting consumers when i talk with ordinary people in the country the answer of them was that regulatory authorities have been unable to protect consumers and market operators have taken the power to their hand and consumers became slavers of market operators in this situation how can say sri lanka has a regulatory quality in market operations this is a macro style issue and the response of public is that regulatory quality is not up to the expected level trade policy trade policy concerns with domestic trade policy and international trade policy sri lanka has no power to successfully make policies for international trade consistent to trends but it can make or adapt to trade trends developing responsive trade policies when developing trade policies sri lanka has not totalitarian style power like america or china has and it should act within the authoritative framework many people and politicians in the country have no idea about this and they think that the country can change trade policy overnight domestic trade policies are also not open and the country needs a concrete domestic trade policy which means that what should do i haven t seen a trade policy manuals and procedures manuals to pass a test for trade policy in sri lanka what should be the trade policy for the country should be determined by practical outcomes and for this purpose it needs continuous research on trade policy matters business start up this is also a quite complicated area as an investor has many loop holes to go through to investment decision and corruptions are main constraints to business start up from the side of sri lanka allowing for investments should be made after careful consideration of investment projects especially after 9 11 and the easter sunday attacks sri lanka must consider allowing for investment either domestic or foreign investments should be after intelligence analysis and sometimes consultation with several countries investments in modern era concern with many issues not just the returns honestly speaking i have no personal experience in business start up but i heard various complaints from potential investors a significant constraint is investors or business people must go from one place to other compile to regulation and they must face with crooks it is indicated that sri lanka has failed the test on fiscal policy land right and access to credit these are highly complicated issues as they are involved in politics the confabulation on three items is vital for policy makers in the country and they are broader area cannot discuss in a short paper there may be thousands of papers written on these matters including thesis of university students
people who get a kick out of watching children at play must love the spectacle staged in washington every time the issue of the federal debt ceiling comes up but they re the only ones by michael hiltzik los angeles times people who get a kick out of watching children at play must love the spectacle staged in washington every time the issue of the federal debt ceiling comes up but they re the only ones for most responsible onlookers the spectacle is nerve racking taxpayers face higher government costs and suspended programs people who provide services to the government for pay including public employees get stiffed investors fret over the possibility that a federal default on its debt will produce a surge in interest rates and a stock market crash and a long term crisis of confidence in the safety of u s government securities economists worry about potentially cataclysmic effects on global financial systems most politicians wish in their hearts that the debt ceiling would just go away yet it s still with us despite universal judgment that it s useless and a perennial waste of everyone s time even president trump displaying shockingly wise economic judgment has dissed the debt ceiling for many years people have been talking about getting rid of the debt ceiling altogether he said in june 2017 there are lots of good reasons to do that trump hasn t repeated that sentiment since then as far as we can tell that s too bad because the debt ceiling is back after a suspension of roughly 13 months enacted as part of a bipartisan budget bill in february 2018 the debt ceiling went back into effect on march 9 at the level of government debt in the marketplace at that moment 22 trillion in other words the government instantly hit the ceiling since then the treasury has kept the government going through what are known as temporary extraordinary measures and what managers of household budgets know as moving money around these include deferring payments to government funds that would otherwise require issuing government debt thus leaving some borrowing headroom for other purposes the funds include the government employee retirement fund and a thrift savings plan investment fund which holds retirement investments made by government workers the funds will be made whole once the debt ceiling crisis passes but at a cost to taxpayers that could run into the hundreds of millions of dollars the extraordinary measures can work only for a short period after which they run out by the treasury s current reckoning that point comes in mid september in other words that s the drop dead date for raising the debt ceiling adding to nervousness about the date is that it s been creeping closer the treasury originally said it would have enough options to keep the debt ceiling from being breached until november then it revised its projection to the end of october and again to september the changes result chiefly from shortfalls in government tax collections because of the tax cut bill republicans enacted in december 2017 on the promise that it would pay for itself it hasn t let s be clear that the consequences of breaching the debt ceiling would be dire if the government defaults on its bonds by missing a payment its cost of borrowing would instantly rise placing a further burden on the budget and cratering the value of treasury securities held by individuals pension funds and sovereign nations the safe haven stature of t bonds and the dollar would be deeply impaired interest rates would rise for all forms of debt mortgages credit cards state and local borrowing government output of social security checks tax refunds medicare reimbursements military salaries and more would be reduced or halted before we get into the substance of the current discussions which involve house speaker nancy pelosi and treasury secretary steve mnuchin let s canter through the historical background of this stupid government rule the debt ceiling originally was enacted to give the treasury more freedom to issue debt not less that was in 1917 at that time congress was required to vote on every bond issue which the members rightly considered a pain in the rear they decided that it would be better to give treasury blanket authority to issue bonds but not unlimited authority so it imposed an aggregate limit by the 1960s the limit became a hindrance to fiscal policy raising it turned into a routine since 1962 congress has raised the limit roughly 100 times on average more than once a year more recently unfortunately the debt ceiling acquired the image of a brake on fiscal irresponsibility on capitol hill the idea being that if the government were forbidden to borrow it would have to live within its means this was a gift to tea party types and other conservatives whose goal was to shrink federal programs typically those that served the working class and the poor they could proclaim themselves guardians of public resources with the debt ceiling serving as their line in the sand this was always mere posturing spending decisions are made by congress almost always without regard to the debt ceiling which comes into play later when the treasury is tasked with finding the money for congressional mandates the government accountability office delivered a reality dose about this as bluntly as possible in a report in february 2011 the debt limit does not control or limit the ability of the federal government to run deficits or incur obligations the agency wrote rather it is a limit on the ability to pay obligations already incurred politicians who never stop jabbering about the need for individuals to accept personal responsibility for their finances always seem to forget that when the topic turns to the need for government to make good on its borrowing the government has always managed to avoid default but sometimes it has been a close call in 2011 congress passed an increase only hours before the ultimate deadline averting default but prompting standard and poor s to downgrade the creditworthiness of u s government debt for the first time ever in 2013 the ceiling was raised with a day to spare in 2017 weeks and in 2018 a month producing the suspension that expired on march 9 serious economic policy thinkers aren t comforted by this sort of brinkmanship in 2003 when the debt limit kicked in for three months the government had to call in bonds held by a civil service retirement fund early costing the fund and its members more than 1 billion in lost interest former reagan economic advisor bruce bartlett accurately called the debt ceiling fight in 2009 a uniquely american political crisis with its roots in political theater the danger always is that the children in whose hands this weapon rests can t be trusted to understand its potency in 2010 for instance a republican congressman from south carolina airily dismissed concerns about the consequences of a default on u s government debt i have heard people say that if we don t do it it will be the end of the world he said then i have yet to meet someone who can articulate the negative consequences that was mick mulvaney who is now director of the office of management and budget fortunately treasury secretary mnuchin like all his predecessors is fully alive to the negative consequences he has been urging action on the debt ceiling since the spring but progress has been stalled by discord on broader budget issues on monday pelosi turned down his proposal for a short term rise in the debt ceiling to be enacted next week before congress leaves for its summer recess pelosi and her house democratic caucus want an agreement that protects nonmilitary spending from cuts which the trump white house so far has refused to accept pelosi isn t asking enough she should demand abolition of the debt ceiling as the price of lifting it now almost every deal to raise the debt ceiling in recent years has produced bad policy one way or another the consequences of breaching the ceiling are just too serious for this weapon to remain in partisan arsenals on either side of the aisle it does nothing but get in the way of intelligent fiscal management get rid of it already
by heather long sommer johnson thought everything was finally coming together for her last year she was engaged working full time and doing well in online college classes when her fiance s mother died a week before their wedding day triggering a series of large and unexpected expenses that left her struggling to pay her bills and brought her to the verge of bankruptcy i keep hearing this is one of the best economies we ve ever had and unemployment is down especially among african americans which i am said johnson 39 who lives in douglasville ga an atlanta suburb i m looking around going where is this boom from where i sit this doesn t look like the best economy ever the economic expansion this week became the longest in u s history surpassing the 1990s boom which lasted exactly a decade the stock market is at record levels with the dow jones industrial average closing at a new high wednesday ahead of the july 4 holiday and president trump has made the economy s strong performance a centerpiece of his reelection campaign but this expansion has been weaker and its benefits distributed far more unevenly than in previous growth cycles leaving many americans in a vulnerable position this is a two tier recovery said matthew mish head of credit strategy at the investment bank ubs about 60 percent of americans have benefited financially he said while 40 percent have not the 40 percent which mish calls the lower tier have seen paltry or volatile wage growth rising expenses for housing health care and education and increased levels of personal debt they tend not to own homes or many stocks in discussions with 30 americans unable to pay all of their bills a clear pattern emerged most were able to eke by until they faced an unexpected crisis such as a job loss cancer car trouble or storm damage the extra expense caused them to get behind on their bills and they never fully rebounded economists fear such precarious financial situations put many americans at risk if there is even a mild setback in the economy potentially setting up the next recession to be worse than anything in recent history except the great recession so many americans are living paycheck to paycheck said signe mary mckernan vice president of the center on labor human services and population at the urban institute we are headed toward a political crisis if not an economic one their vulnerability is due to a confluence of factors first the average american family has yet to recover fully from the 2008 financial crisis the federal reserve found leaving half the nation with a diminished cushion to handle surprise expenses or the next downturn the bottom half has less wealth today after adjusting for inflation than it did in 1989 according to fed data through march of this year while wage growth has accelerated in recent months especially for the lowest paid workers families who have struggled for years have a ways to go to return to solid footing sommer johnson works a full time job takes online classes toward a degree in business administration and is a mom to two teenagers and an infant elijah nouvelage for the washington post half of u s jobs pay less than 18 58 an hour and more than a third pay less than 15 which makes it difficult to save or invest for a better future trump and his team argue that a strong economy is lifting more and more americans up financially including blue collar workers the formerly incarcerated and minorities in contrast democrats are calling for major expansions of government programs to address inequality how to help the economically vulnerable is likely to be a key debate in the 2020 race just because folks on wall street think things are fine doesn t mean most americans feel like things are fine said ray boshara director of the center for household financial stability at the federal reserve bank of st louis when every day is a rainy day for millions of families things are not fine to get by americans have borrowed heavily in recent years total u s household debt is now 13 7 trillion surpassing the 2008 peak in dollar terms according to the federal reserve bank of new york the surge in debt this time around is for cars and college not mortgages johnson knows these issues all too well her family of five including two teenagers and an infant daughter was making it on her 31 000 salary as an insurance underwriting assistant and her husband s part time job as a clerk but it took longer to sell her mother in law s house than the couple expected the modest life insurance policy the couple collected on her death soon ran out but the bills for the funeral carrying the extra house rent health insurance and the new baby kept coming johnson s husband carl dunlap has applied repeatedly for full time jobs but has not been able to get one he picked up as many extra hours as he could at work but it wasn t enough already in debt for college and a used volkswagen passat she bought in 2017 johnson turned to friends and family for help but she eventually had to choose between paying for day care and the 350 a month auto loan she picked day care and her family lost a vehicle she recalls the exact moment it happened 10 p m on a thursday night in early march she saw the red flashing lights of the repo men through her living room window and ran outside barefoot i just stood there and watched it go which was tough johnson said that was the first car i ever bought for myself and we needed it johnson shops with her daughter harmonii in douglasville elijah nouvelage for the washington post the couple carpool to work now trying to save money to pay the thousands of dollars they still owe on the vw that is no longer in their possession older and wealthier and usually white americans typically take on debt to buy homes or make investments that are likely to make them richer in the years to come most in this category have recovered the wealth they lost in the great recession as home prices and stocks have soared in contrast data from the fed and the credit score company equifax show that families of color americans born after 1970 and households earning less than 60 000 are the least likely to have recovered the wealth they lost in the crisis and they tend to carry heavy debt loads often taking out loans for college which they cannot get rid of in bankruptcy or loans to pay bills which can put them further behind the prevailing view among wall street investors and washington policymakers is that there is little to worry about because student loans are backed by the government and delinquency rates for other kinds of debt are fairly low meaning most people can make their monthly payments credit quality is about as good as i ve ever seen it said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics there is nothing that suggests inordinate stress on low income households certainly nothing compared to times past but boshara of the st louis fed pointed out that credit card and auto loan delinquencies have risen this year the opposite of what wall street expected in good economic times four in 10 americans say they still struggle to pay their bills despite the strong economy according to a quarterly survey by ubs that has shown no improvement since 2014 and looking at how households are doing by class race or age reveals a concerning picture for maddy

washington cnn one of president donald trump s picks for a seat on the federal reserve board once praised undocumented immigrants to the united states as economic heroes and entrepreneurs a position at odds with much of the president s rhetoric on immigration judy shelton a conservative economist and 2016 trump campaign adviser said in a september 2016 interview on the exchange a reuters podcast that she spent years teaching at a business school in monterrey mexico and found that those who migrate to the us are not the least educated instead describing migrants as venture capitalists they are risk takers and admirable for that shelton said at the time they are also the venture capitalists for their own country because they send all of that money back home and then they have relatives buying real estate improving housing so they re truly the economic heroes her comments stand in contrast to trump s position then and now on migrants from mexico and elsewhere in central america who he s described repeatedly as criminals including in a cabinet meeting this week shelton has long advocated positions at odds with trump s on the border and free trade a cnn kfile review of her record found she once criticized opponents of nafta as shortsighted nationalists and called tariff proposals from candidate trump misplaced the washington post reported in early july shelton wrote an article titled north america doesn t need borders in the wall street journal supporting the notion of the freer flow of goods and people between the us and mexico in a 2000 op ed in another op ed in 2001 in the wall street journal shelton argued for immigration reform partially because foreign workers from mexico diffuses wage pressures trump said last month he plans to nominate shelton to the federal reserve board along with christopher waller the research director and executive vice president for the fed s regional bank in st louis neither has yet been formally nominated the picks come after trump s two controversial previous choices commentator stephen moore and former republican presidential contender herman cain withdrew earlier this year amid opposition from republican senators shelton told cnn this week that her views align with the president s demands for increased border enforcement combined with changes to immigration law having grown up in southern california i had no doubts about the family values and work ethics of many mexicans who were performing manual labor with diligence and developed skills shelton told cnn when asked about her earlier comments i admire such people but there need to be legal procedures to permit foreign people wishing to enter the united states in pursuit of work in strict compliance with well defined rules shelton is not the only trump adviser to have differed strongly on immigration and trade from the president another trump campaign economic adviser larry kudlow who now serves as white house s chief economic adviser previously harshly criticized the president s rhetoric on trade and immigration in 2015 at one point comparing his calls for the deportation of undocumented immigrants to the worst parts of world war ii in an apparent reference to the holocaust kudlow told cnn s kfile he should ve never said it because it was never true a white house spokesman did not respond to a request for comment experience in mexico in her 2016 reuters interview shelton said she spent six years in mexico teaching at the duxx graduate school of business leadership in monterrey in the late 1990s and early 2000s she described her students as very well to do students and the sons and daughters of local ultra wealthy families she said during her time there she frequently met with then mexican president vicente fox on the topic of immigration and trade with the united states in the interview she described a conversation in which fox asked why conservatives dislike immigration and immigrants from mexico shelton faulted the mexican government for not creating conditions to keep immigrants at home on many occasions when fox would personally upbraid me shelton told reuters i guess i was a barometer of conservative opinion in the u s and said why don t you let our people come because they help your economy so much and they re such wonderful people and they re hard working and they have great values i said they are so hardworking great values they are truly wonderful people in fact the ones who do make the dangerous journey to the united states studies by my own students showed these are not the least educated people these are actually the entrepreneurs these are the ones willing to take a risk added shelton she further accused fox as casting the us as the villain on matters of immigration when the goal is to have both countries work together i think immigration is very much in mexico s interest and the us is not a villain here the idea working for mutually agreeable and desirable goals shelton said you know it s not fault finding except with encouraging criminal elements because you have a lawless situation on our border i think that needs to be corrected in her comments to cnn shelton said i remember my conversation with president fox very clearly he was indeed berating the united states for not welcoming the hard working mexicans seeking entry into the united states in search of work insinuating that it was somehow the fault of an unfeeling u s government and citing horrific instances of people drowning in the rio grande she added i asked him very directly why are they all swimming north why can t these brave hard working people be successful in their own country why are they forced to seek a decent living by having to leave their families their homes and being subjected to danger and indignities whose fault is that it is the fault of the mexican government sir which you will soon head push for immigration reform but shelton has also said the influx of foreign labor from mexico was good for the us economy writing it diffused wage pressure in the wall street journal in 2001 shelton wrote that fox and then president george w bush should push immigration reform because it would benefit both countries the irony is that immigrant workers from across our southern border have never had a stronger champion than mr fox who hails them as heroes who incur great risk and hardship to improve the economic prospects of their families back home shelton wrote such thoughts are echoed by mr bush with his observation that people who are willing to walk across miles of desert to do work that some americans won t do should be treated with respect if the moral factor weren t enough there are also economic reasons for both presidents to forge meaningful immigration reform as the centerpiece of this week s summit she continued for the us the inflow of foreign labor diffuses wage pressures for mexico the inflow of capital from workers who remit home some 8 billion annually raises living standards and provides the nation with its third largest source of income shelton told cnn that she stands by her call for immigration reform but said american citizens should be given priority in hiring over non citizen workers where demand for certain types of labor cannot be adequately met domestically it might be reasonable to have a visa or special work permit system in place to offer employment opportunities through a legally validated and well regulated program shelton said priority should always be given to us citizens who should always be the primary beneficiaries of expanded employment opportunities facilitated by the impact of pro growth economic policies support for nafta shelton also previously supported the 1994 north american free trade agreement which trump is moving to replace writing in 1994 in her book money meltdown shelton slammed the rhetoric of critics of nafta and called those who opposed it engaging in shortsighted nationalism and protectionism u s approval of nafta carries a strong symbolic message concerning the future of democratic capitalism not only in mexico but throughout latin america contradicting that message however have been cries of concern in the united states over the prospect of losing jobs to mexican workers who are willing to work for lower wages shelton wrote references by presidential aspirant ross perot to a giant sucking sound as u s jobs are drawn south play on the fears of american workers already hit hard by recession and gloomy economic forecasts in tragic irony just as mexico seems ready to shed its resentment toward the long hated yanquis and begin working together to achieve mutually beneficial economic rewards the united states is leaning toward protectionism and displaying signs of shortsighted nationalism when rhetoric goes beyond arguments about the economic impact of removing tariffs and crosses the line into thinly veiled insults about the aspirations of whole populations national sensibilities are deeply offended and real political damage is done she added shelton told cnn that the collapse of the value of the peso in relation to the dollar had shifted the terms of trade between the united states and mexico the exchange rate value of the mexican peso to the u s dollar was 3 5 after the peso collapse in december of 1994 the exchange rate went to 7 pesos to the dollar and today it is roughly 19 pesos to the dollar shelton told cnn when i insist as i have for more than 25 years that exchange rate shifts fundamentally change the terms of trade this is a very clear example

trying to make progress toward a budget deal but an agreement which would also lift the debt ceiling removing a major threat to global financial markets is far from done a senior administration official speaking on the condition of anonymity to the washington post on wednesday threw cold water on the work speaker nancy pelosi d calif has done with treasury secretary steven mnuchin saying the two sides have a way to go to resolve their differences mnuchin for his part told cnbc on thursday morning the two sides have reached an agreement on top line budget numbers and are working on offsetting new spending he said markets shouldn t be concerned about the debt limit see him here i don t think the markets should be concerned about the debt limit treasury secretary mnuchin tells beckyquick pic twitter com bz5ckndopw squawk box squawkcnbc july 18 2019 pelosi said wednesday she wants to reach an agreement by the end of this week in time to put it to a vote in her chamber by next thursday a day before lawmakers quit town for the six week august recess advertisement the administration official said that timeline sounds like happy talk from the speaker who has been absent from talks for the last three months and now is trying to create momentum after a bad couple weeks president trump who has demonstrated his willingness to blow up a budget agreement at the last minute remains a wild card considering the toxicity of broader relations between house democrats and the administration the apparently productive negotiations between pelosi and mnuchin toward a deal should come as a happy surprise it may be cold comfort however for business leaders investors and others starting to sweat the prospect of a federal debt default the government bond market is already beginning to register nervousness and the administration s rejection to pelosi s cautious optimism wednesday raises new questions about whether the clashes between the two camps on other matters are bleeding into consideration of must pass items both parties want to avoid a crisis that could result in a technical default if the treasury was unable to pay interest on its debt capital economics wrote in a wednesday note but given the dysfunctional relationship between trump and the house democrats we can t rule out a failure to reach an agreement the president after all threatened two months ago to quit working on legislative business with house democrats if they didn t stop investigating him pelosi and company haven t heeded that demand to the contrary house democrats voted wednesday to hold attorney general william barr and commerce secretary wilbur ross in criminal contempt for withholding documents related to their push to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census former

tuesday night capped an unusually turbulent two days over trump s racist tweets about four freshman democratic lawmakers by voting to condemn his remarks in heated floor debate over the measure pelosi set off a controversy within the controversy by calling trump s twitter attack disgraceful and disgusting and those comments are racist the house parliamentarian concluded the speaker s criticism violated the chamber s rules of decorum but democrats voted to overrule the judgment nevertheless throughout the firestorm pelosi has continued negotiations with mnuchin conducted over a series of phone calls that people with knowledge of the talks describe as professional and isolated from the party s latest clash with trump the two spoke again wednesday with senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y joining in and mnuchin connecting from paris where he s attending a global summit of finance ministers per the post s erica werner and damian paletta pelosi and the white house remain divided over 150 billion in spending cuts the administration wants to accompany spending hikes a goal that could be out of reach without slashing domestic programs that democrats want to protect advertisement in addition the administration wants a guarantee from pelosi that she won t seek to add policy riders to future spending bills both of those demands could jeopardize chances for a deal and they are just two of a handful of areas where agreement has yet to be reached between pelosi and the trump administration as time grows short erica and damian write behind the scenes the more important differences may not be those between pelosi and mnuchin but between mnuchin and white house acting chief of staff mick mulvaney that s one of the biggest hangups right now has mnuchin worked this with mulvaney g william hoagland a former top senate budget aide now a senior vice president at the bipartisan policy center tells me the real risk here is the president and mulvaney bull their

a twitter thread by the economist middle east correspondent gregg carlstrom provided all the needed context on bahrain s workshop which was supposedly intended to focus on palestine but without the palestinians themselves attending alas the balfour declaration anew there s a lot of money in this room was a comment by u s secretary of treasury steven mnuchin adding i m confident we ll get the first 4 billion fast and that it will be like a hot ipo correctly carlstrom observed it s like they ve all agreed to just pretend the conflict is already over president donald trump and jared kushner s peace to prosperity workshop held in bahrain on june 25 26 was a 50 billion dollar ipo or auction the purpose of which is setting up a golden cage for the palestinians the plan or more accurately the auction is framed as a necessary precondition to resolving the previously unsolvable political issues which was billed by trump and kushner as the opportunity of the century for the palestinians the palestinians did not bother sending a delegation since the workshop was intended to bypass the key issues that prevent development and prosperity such as the israeli settler colonial occupation right of return jerusalem and sovereignty normalizing expansion more or less the u s sponsored bahrain workshop is another piece in the long puzzle to normalizing israel and zionism in the arab and muslim world without arriving at a peace treaty ending settler colonialism or accepting palestinian sovereignty over their land the zionist delegates included rabbis marvin hier and abraham cooper from the simon wiesenthal center rabbi marc schneier an adviser for interfaith affairs to the king of bahrain montreal based rabbi mayer gniwisch the owner of a venture capital fund that invests in israel yitzhak kreiss head of the sheba medical center in central israel and one rabbi who requested to remain unnamed additionally they included arab finance ministers investors the presidents of the world bank and fifa and a host of other self appointed diplomats with no role other than to barter away palestine and palestinian rights trump and kushner s palestine ipo is a 50 billion roadshow a wall street mid cap size company for sure not a large one but enough to make a few wealthy men women need not apply under occupation the palestinians will have 28 billion and 9 billion is reserved for egypt while jordan and lebanon get 7 5 billion and 6 billion respectively the kicker in kushner s plan is that the arab world will be responsible for funding this financial hoax as well as the expectation for the palestinians to take on debt and loans to fund specific tourism projects israel and zionism will have a first class settler colonial project and they will get others to pay for it here israel not only gets to continue to steal palestinian lands expel the indigenous population take their homes cities and farms and rob natural resources it also gets rewarded for it and has arab states assist in cementing the trans generational dispossession one must be alive to have outrage over such a plan and more so when an arab capital hosts the meeting thus adding insult to injury blaming the victims of settler colonialism is the favorite past time for israeli american and increasingly arab politicians who never miss an opportunity to heave insults on the palestinians for their ongoing dispossession while israeli and american politicians have been at it for a long time the arrival of a whole bunch of arab political figures that are willing and ready to blame attack and scheme against the palestinians in the hope of securing their seats of power is a new fad arab and muslim zionists are running all over the region and their favorite pastime is to blame the palestinians for their ongoing predicament palestinians being occupied and facing colonization is not a shame but standing against them while they are facing and resisting zionist settler colonialism is the highest form of cowardice and is the real dishonor mocking the palestinians kushner s palestine ipo calls for unleashing economic potential though developing property and contract rights the rule of law anti corruption measures capital markets a pro growth tax structure and a low tariff scheme with reduced trade barriers this initiative envisions policy reforms coupled with strategic infrastructure investments that will improve the business environment and stimulate private sector growth this ipo sounds great until we consider the critical missing issue the ongoing occupation and israel s view that the west bank is a disputed territory which translates to supporting settlements and uprooting palestinians from their own homes and land property and contract rights are meaningless in the face of an occupation and settler colonialism and the need first to affirm sovereignty before the mirage of development and prosperity kushner s plan uses the euphemism of empower the palestinian people without addressing the reasons why we are speaking of the need for empowerment in the first place the nakba and the ongoing occupation here referencing data driven outcomes

variety of programs that directly improve the well being of the palestinian people is an insult to intelligence the framing by kushner and his team implies that the palestinians have not been attempting to work on all these fronts but are always facing israel checkpoints attacks on educational institutions and constant violence by settlers it will strengthen the palestinian educational system and ensure that students can fulfill their academic goals and be prepared for the workforce was the plan s framing of the outcome but it completely disregards the monumental accomplishment of the palestinians under the most severe israeli strangulation it is the occupation and settler colonialism that undermines palestinian empowerment enhance palestinian governance was the peace to prosperity plan s third aspect which calls for improving the public sector s ability to serve its citizens and enable private sector growth now if this idea is not laughable then nothing else will be for anyone that knows of the birth of the palestinian authority and the involvement of the u s israel and arab countries in fostering and rewarding corruption by design where was all this concern for upholding property rights improving the legal and regulatory framework for businesses adopting a growth oriented enforceable tax structure and developing robust capital markets since the signing of the oslo agreement in 1993 and the outright theft of palestinian lands by israel and its settlers maybe kushner and u s ambassador david friedman could help palestinians uphold property rights by apologizing first for funding and empowering the building of settlements in total disregard for international law and second for insulting our collective intelligence that this plan represents anything other than netanyahu s dream of revoking palestinian sovereignty more offensive is kushner s call for a fair and independent judicial branch without defending palestinian rights under occupation instead to ensure this pro growth environment is protected and that civil society flourishes at the expense of sovereignty and political rights this envisages international partners assigned the task of eliminating the palestinian public sector s donor dependency and put the palestinians on a trajectory to achieve long term fiscal sustainability but nowhere in the plan is the cause of this reliance addressed as if looking at palestine from mars kushner asserts that this initiative can usher in a new era of freedom and opportunity for the palestinian people and institutionalize the policies required for successful economic transformation but again misses the existing dichotomy between occupation and freedom the plan is an economic engine envisaged by benjamin netanyahu to replace sovereignty political rights and freedom from occupation and settler colonialism which for palestinians is dead on arrival offering nothing the plan reads like a freshman paper with a powerpoint presentation filled with buzz words intended to dazzle the eyes while making sure everyone suspends the thinking process a big list of buzz words includes unleashing economic potential opening the west bank and gaza constructing essential infrastructure promoting private sector growth and strengthening regional development and integration which are meaningless if the occupation and the stateless nature of palestinian society remain unaddressed at the root of kushner s plan like many others like it is the attempt to bypass and prevent palestinian political empowerment and self determination capital raised through this international effort will be placed into a new fund administered by an established multilateral development bank is the new version of the british mandate which made sure then to never permit palestinian self determination from taking hold while all along empowering zionism in historical palestine the idea that palestinians are not ready to govern themselves is the highest form of colonial discourse and embedded in it is the arrogance and racism of colonizers and all their enablers palestinian self determination freedom and dignity will not come through kushner s hot ipo or arab and israeli machinations to build a new war on iran but it will for sure manifest itself as a sustained anti colonial struggle that will usher a new horizon sooner than later if the world is looking for a secure and social justice based investment and prosperity then make sure to ask everyone to put their trust in palestinians and their journey toward decolonization all are welcome on the path

sims were elected as the new cpusa co chairs monopolization and the crisis of wealth extremes we must make our choice we may have democracy or we may have wealth concentrated in the hands of a few but we can t have both u s supreme court justice louis brandeis trump and the gop trumpet what they claim is a record economic expansion creating a historically low unemployment rate it s never been better brags trump indeed it has never been better for the rich we live in the wealthiest country in the world and the wealth produced by the exploited working class has flowed to the top 1 working class americans live in a starkly different world we are working harder and longer and falling further behind we along with our families and communities face fear and insecurity battered by austerity 40 years of wage stagnation deindustrialization union busting and the growth of low wage service jobs without benefits and retirement security most wage growth is the result of states and municipalities raising the minimum wage in 1980 the top 1 earned on average 27 times more than the bottom 50 today they make 81 times more institutionalized racism and sexism compound income and wealth inequality black workers receive roughly 75 of what white workers receive women earn 80 of what men receive while african american women receive 61 of what white men receive the difference is reaped by the boss in super profits the official unemployment figures obscure the actual state of joblessness nearly 95 million americans don t participate in the production process a labor participation rate of 62 5 the real unemployment or underemployed rate is 37 millions have given up looking or work part time and can t find full time jobs unemployment among black workers is twice that of white workers some native american reservations report unemployment at 85 most working families haven t recovered from the great recession millions lost their life savings and homes an aclu study shows by 2031 white household wealth will be 31 below what it would ve been had the recession never happened for black households wealth will be 40 lower millions live by a thread many working two or three jobs to put food on the table and a roof overhead 60 can t come up with 1 000 in an emergency and half of older americans have zero retirement savings workers are working harder and are more productive but household debt is 21 higher than it was in 2013 following the great recession due to auto loan debt the 1 5 trillion student loan burden mortgages and credit card debt gig and part time work are growing approximately 40 of the workforce is composed of contingent workers i e temp agencies on call contract workers independent contractors self employed and involuntary part time 6 6 million poverty rates unchanged since the 1960s forty one million americans officially live in poverty and 18 million live in extreme poverty poverty rates have barely changed since the 1960s due to institutionalized racism 25 of native americans 26 of latinx people and 27 7 of african americans live in poverty thirty percent of african american children and 33 of native american children live in poverty about one third of the 13 million children in poverty are white areas of deep poverty also exist among white workers mainly rural areas most who live in poverty work including at wal mart and amazon and many receive government assistance public school teachers in gop dominated states often visit food banks most cities and towns have a vast and growing shortage of affordable housing over 500 000 people are homeless on any given night you don t have to travel far to see homeless tent communities under highway viaducts millions are being priced out of their homes and apartments because of rising property taxes and gentrification of working class neighborhoods the communist party usa demands a national guaranteed living wage massive construction of publicly and cooperatively owned affordable housing and federal rent protection laws health care crisis the affordable care act aca reduced the number of uninsured americans from 44 million to 27 million americans but the aca is under constant assault by the trump administration and the gop and the uninsured population is increasing seventy million people are either uninsured or underinsured with high deductibles and co payments life expectancy is on the decline including death by despair for middle age whites by suicide alcohol and drugs maternal deaths are rising african american native american and alaskan native women suffer three times the maternal death rates as white women reflecting institutionalized racism and sexism infant mortality among african american babies is near twice the rate for white babies overall infant mortality is nearly double that of cuba working class communities are being inundated by an opioid crisis destroying families leaving grieving parents and children in its wake over 700 000 people died from drug overdoses between 1999 and 2017 70 from opioids however the pharmaceutical companies that peddle the opioids are reaping huge profits while health care services are slashed the cpusa demands medicare for all and placing the pharmaceutical industry under public authority the rich get much much richer these conditions are rooted in much deeper systemic processes taking place in global capitalism resulting in a crisis of wealth extremes imbalances instability and crisis nodes concentrated wealth is connected to wage stagnation which despite rising productivity has been flat or declined in the past 40 years as economist thomas piketty says the rise of the top 1 mirrors the fall of the bottom 50 monopolization or the formation of oligopolies and extreme wealth concentration are accelerating this process is intrinsic to the system of capitalism and its drive for maximum profits the system is incapable of reversing it the world s eight richest people own wealth equal to the poorest half of the world s population 80 of the world s population subsists on 2 a day in the u s the top 0 1 of americans our oligopoly held 20 of the nation s wealth in 2016 up from 7 in 1979 and owned as much wealth as the bottom 90 the nation s three wealthiest individuals bill gates warren buffett and jeff bezos collectively hold more wealth than the bottom 50 of the u s population roughly a fifth of americans has zero or negative net worth according to piketty wealth accumulation is accelerating because the 1 control more of the economy witness the results of the 2017 trump tax cuts for the rich wealth accumulation is exceeding economic growth and in the long term will lead to growing instability the erosion of capitalist democracy and economic insecurity at least 60 of the nation s biggest corporations paid no federal income taxes in 2018 on a collective 79 billion in profits the institute on taxation and economic policy says besides corporations receive public subsidies worth at least 110 billion a year costing u s families about 6 000 each wealth concentration is a threat to democracy under capitalism especially with citizens united billionaire patrons of candidates and the flood of alec inspired legislation this state of affairs led supreme court justice louis brandeis to remark we must make our choice we may have democracy or we may have wealth concentrated in the hands of a few but we can t have both looming crisis and disruption from robotics and ai a feature of capitalism is the constant revolutionizing of the means of production and the introduction of new technology resulting in economic and social disruption the scientific and technological revolution has facilitated capitalist globalization and massive increases in productivity while causing economic dislocation and crises of under consumption it has revolutionized everything giving rise to just in time production and the gig economy unjust trade agreements shifting transnational corporate investments and outsourcing to global low wage zones have harshly impacted u s manufacturing employment and devasted working class communities and entire regions however corporate authored trade pacts don t tell the whole story obscured in all this including by trump s economic nationalism and racist scapegoating is the impact of automation in the past 25 years a span that includes nafta and china s entrance into the wto u s manufacturing output has increased 40 u s workers are being exploited more than ever america has lost more than 7 million factory jobs since manufacturing employment peaked in 1979 yet american factory production more than doubled from 1979 to 2015 reported the new haven register one study found the vast majority of the lost jobs 88 were taken by robots and other homegrown factors that reduce labor the obama administration projected 47 of all jobs in the u s would be at risk of elimination due to automation by 2025 if these forecasts are accurate automation will create economic dislocation disruption and loss of jobs on an enormous scale including 5 1 million over the next five years transportation sales customer service medical healthcare and legal fields will be most impacted similarly loss of coal mining jobs is due not to a war on coal but to greater automation between 1980 and 2015 the coal industry shed 59 of mining jobs but production grew 8 since 1997 42 of jobs in the steel and metals industry has been eliminated and production has grown by 38 five hundred thousand construction jobs will be lost in the next five years due to automation outsourced industries like the textile industry are beginning to return to the u s but they are globally competitive because of automation the debate is ongoing whether this newest round of automation will have a significant impact on job loss in the past technological advances have also given rise to new industries created millions of new jobs and changed the composition of the workforce what s different this time is artificial intelligence ai which is being applied to visual and voice recognition computers can now think and learn without humans while this is a crisis for capitalism automation creates the material conditions and abundance for socialism and allows society to deal with disruptions without placing any burdens on the working class a green transition with large scale infrastructure works and the reorganization of production is necessary to address the crises of climate change wealth inequality and automation and ai the green new deal would create millions of new jobs to realize it will require a massive wealth redistribution including funding a transition wage free education and healthcare a shorter work week with substantial wage increases sizeable public investment and a massive transfer of funds from the military budget but it starts with a defeat of trump the gop and extreme right in the 2020 elections continued in part 4 the political and democratic crisis

one of president donald trump s picks for a seat on the federal reserve board once praised undocumented immigrants to the united states as economic heroes and entrepreneurs a position at odds with much of the president s rhetoric on immigration judy shelton a conservative economist and 2016 trump campaign adviser said in a september 2016 interview on the exchange a reuters podcast that she spent years teaching at a business school in monterrey mexico and found that those who migrate to the us are not the least educated instead describing migrants as venture capitalists they are risk takers and admirable for that shelton said at the time they are also the venture capitalists for their own country because they send all of that money back home and then they have relatives buying real estate improving housing so they re truly the economic heroes her comments stand in contrast to trump s position then and now on migrants from mexico and elsewhere in central america who he s described repeatedly as criminals including in a cabinet meeting this week shelton has long advocated positions at odds with trump s on the border and free trade a cnn kfile review of her record found she once criticized opponents of nafta as shortsighted nationalists and called tariff proposals from candidate trump misplaced the washington post reported in early july shelton wrote an article titled north america doesn t need borders in the wall street journal supporting the notion of the freer flow of goods and people between the us and mexico in a 2000 op ed in another op ed in 2001 in the wall street journal shelton argued for immigration reform partially because foreign workers from mexico diffuses wage pressures trump said last month he plans to nominate shelton to the federal reserve board along with christopher waller the research director and executive vice president for the fed s regional bank in st louis neither has yet been formally nominated the picks come after trump s two controversial previous choices commentator stephen moore and former republican presidential contender herman cain withdrew earlier this year amid opposition from republican senators shelton told cnn this week that her views align with the president s demands for increased border enforcement combined with changes to immigration law having grown up in southern california i had no doubts about the family values and work ethics of many mexicans who were performing manual labor with diligence and developed skills shelton told cnn when asked about her earlier comments i admire such people but there need to be legal procedures to permit foreign people wishing to enter the united states in pursuit of work in strict compliance with well defined rules shelton is not the only trump adviser to have differed strongly on immigration and trade from the president another trump campaign economic adviser larry kudlow who now serves as white house s chief economic adviser previously harshly criticized the president s rhetoric on trade and immigration in 2015 at one point comparing his calls for the deportation of undocumented immigrants to the worst parts of world war ii in an apparent reference to the holocaust kudlow told cnn s kfile he should ve never said it because it was never true a white house spokesman did not respond to a request for comment experience in mexico in her 2016 reuters interview shelton said she spent six years in mexico teaching at the duxx graduate school of business leadership in monterrey in the late 1990s and early 2000s she described her students as very well to do students and the sons and daughters of local ultra wealthy families she said during her time there she frequently met with then mexican president vicente fox on the topic of immigration and trade with the united states in the interview she described a conversation in which fox asked why conservatives dislike immigration and immigrants from mexico shelton faulted the mexican government for not creating conditions to keep immigrants at home on many occasions when fox would personally upbraid me shelton told reuters i guess i was a barometer of conservative opinion in the u s and said why don t you let our people come because they help your economy so much and they re such wonderful people and they re hard working and they have great values i said they are so hardworking great values they are truly wonderful people in fact the ones who do make the dangerous journey to the united states studies by my own students showed these are not the least educated people these are actually the entrepreneurs these are the ones willing to take a risk added shelton she further accused fox as casting the us as the villain on matters of immigration when the goal is to have both countries work together i think immigration is very much in mexico s interest and the us is not a villain here the idea working for mutually agreeable and desirable goals shelton said you know it s not fault finding except with encouraging criminal elements because you have a lawless situation on our border i think that needs to be corrected in her comments to cnn shelton said i remember my conversation with president fox very clearly he was indeed berating the united states for not welcoming the hard working mexicans seeking entry into the united states in search of work insinuating that it was somehow the fault of an unfeeling u s government and citing horrific instances of people drowning in the rio grande she added i asked him very directly why are they all swimming north why can t these brave hard working people be successful in their own country why are they forced to seek a decent living by having to leave their families their homes and being subjected to danger and indignities whose fault is that it is the fault of the mexican government sir which you will soon head push for immigration reform but shelton has also said the influx of foreign labor from mexico was good for the us economy writing it diffused wage pressure in the wall street journal in 2001 shelton wrote that fox and then president george w bush should push immigration reform because it would benefit both countries the irony is that immigrant workers from across our southern border have never had a stronger champion than mr fox who hails them as heroes who incur great risk and hardship to improve the economic prospects of their families back home shelton wrote such thoughts are echoed by mr bush with his observation that people who are willing to walk across miles of desert to do work that some americans won t do should be treated with respect if the moral factor weren t enough there are also economic reasons for both presidents to forge meaningful immigration reform as the centerpiece of this week s summit she continued for the us the inflow of foreign labor diffuses wage pressures for mexico the inflow of capital from workers who remit home some 8 billion annually raises living standards and provides the nation with its third largest source of income shelton told cnn that she stands by her call for immigration reform but said american citizens should be given priority in hiring over non citizen workers where demand for certain types of labor cannot be adequately met domestically it might be reasonable to have a visa or special work permit system in place to offer employment opportunities through a legally validated and well regulated program shelton said priority should always be given to us citizens who should always be the primary beneficiaries of expanded employment opportunities facilitated by the impact of pro growth economic policies support for nafta shelton also previously supported the 1994 north american free trade agreement which trump is moving to replace writing in 1994in her book money meltdown shelton slammed the rhetoric of critics of nafta and called those who opposed it engaging in shortsighted nationalism and protectionism u s approval of nafta carries a strong symbolic message concerning the future of democratic capitalism not only in mexico but throughout latin america contradicting that message however have been cries of concern in the united states over the prospect of losing jobs to mexican workers who are willing to work for lower wages shelton wrote references by presidential aspirant ross perot to a giant sucking sound as u s jobs are drawn south play on the fears of american workers already hit hard by recession and gloomy economic forecasts in tragic irony just as mexico seems ready to shed its resentment toward the long hated yanquis and begin working together to achieve mutually beneficial economic rewards the united states is leaning toward protectionism and displaying signs of shortsighted nationalism when rhetoric goes beyond arguments about the economic impact of removing tariffs and crosses the line into thinly veiled insults about the aspirations of whole populations national sensibilities are deeply offended and real political damage is done she added shelton told cnn that the collapse of the value of the peso in relation to the dollar had shifted the terms of trade between the united states and mexico the exchange rate value of the mexican peso to the u s dollar was 3 5 after the peso collapse in december of 1994 the exchange rate went to 7 pesos to the dollar and today it is roughly 19 pesos to the dollar shelton told cnn when i insist as i have for more than 25 years that exchange rate shifts fundamentally change the terms of trade this is a very clear example

a version of this article was originally published by the foreign service journal for its july august 2019 edition the rapid rise of china to the status of economic powerhouse has roiled marketplaces all over the world and caused serious disruptions in the global trading system part of this was inevitable in economics as in many things size matters and china is the proverbial 800 pound gorilla once it emerged from its largely self imposed economic cocoon it was bound to leave a very large footprint but that footprint has proved heavier than expected in large part because of the policies china has chosen to pursue having watched the rapid development of japan the original capitalist developmental state a term coined by chalmers johnson and then the asian tigers south korea hong kong singapore and taiwan china has developed its own blend of state control and market policies with the emphasis on the former it did not start out that way however when china sought to join the world trade organization wto its premier at the time zhu rongzhi made clear that his government saw wto accession and the obligations it required as a means of bringing china into the western trading system and forcing internal reforms that was then now the current chinese leader xi jinping strongly favors state owned enterprises over private companies and uses a mix of tactics that are creating consternation in developed economies beginning with the united states these changes and the negative consequences they have for china s own economy are well documented in the latest book by nick lardy of the peterson institute the state strikes back 2019 the past several u s administrations have all complained about chinese theft of u s intellectual property unfair and discriminatory treatment of u s companies operating in china forced technology transfer channeling of resources to state owned enterprises and massive subsidies but they soft pedaled such criticism to obtain cooperation on other foreign policy goals such as iran north korea and climate change in contrast the trump administration decided to tackle these practices head on in the summer of 2017 u s trade representative robert lighthizer began an investigation of chinese policies and practices under section 301 of the trade act of 1974 that section authorizes retaliation against acts policies or practices that are unreasonable or discriminatory and that restrict or burden u s commerce emphasis added the cost of doing business with china on march 22 2018 the office of the u s trade representative ustr released its report findings of the investigation into china s acts policies and practices related to technology transfer intellectual property and innovation under section 301 of the trade act of 1974 the report focused on four practices unfair technology transfer regime for u s companies in china the chinese government uses formal and informal joint venture requirements to prohibit u s companies from operating in certain industries without a chinese partner often requiring the chinese partner to be the majority shareholder the government uses licensing processes to force u s companies to transfer technologies to their chinese joint venture partner provisions in licensing and review processes are vaguely worded giving chinese authorities wide discretion on which rules to apply foreign companies either comply or risk being shut out of the chinese market discriminatory licensing restrictions china s technology regulatory regime forces u s companies to conduct technology transfer on non market based terms and prohibits them from negotiating their own terms with chinese partners china applies different rules for technology transfer between domestic firms than between a chinese and a foreign firm regulations for the latter are burdensome and discriminatory mandating that licensees can use the technology in perpetuity even after licensing contracts expire outbound investment and subsidies the chinese government encourages outbound foreign direct investment particularly in the tech sector to advance its military and economic strategic goals chinese companies have established presences in silicon valley with the objective of acquiring technologies investments are often driven by state owned enterprises or financed by government backed banks which gives chinese companies an unfair competitive advantage when investing in technology because they are not constrained by risks in addition chinese government subsidies artificially inflate acquisition costs which allows chinese companies to expand global market share at the expense of u s companies unauthorized intrusions into u s commercial computer networks and cyber enabled theft of intellectual property and sensitive commercial information china has used cyber intrusions into u s commercial networks to gain access to trade secrets technical data negotiating positions and sensitive proprietary internal communications cyber intrusions target a wide range of industries but are most pervasive in high tech sectors the report identified several other issues including chinese measures purportedly related to national security or cybersecurity inadequate intellectual property protection in china including widespread trade secret theft counterfeiting and bad faith trademarking china s anti monopoly law china s standardization law and china s talent acquisition strategy experts estimate that the united states incurred annual damages of 50 billion due to unfair chinese practices and policies on november 20 2018 ustr released an update to the report stating that chinese unfair technology policies persist while some elements of chinese policy are similar to those japan employed in the 1980s there are some important differences ironically one is that china is more open to imports than japan was at 32 67 billion china had a global trade surplus its exports are 15 percent greater than its imports in march 2019 by comparison japan had 26 percent more exports than imports in 1985 china has bilateral deficits with many countries including south korea 55 6 billion australia 26 8 billion and brazil 7 4 billion and as its gross domestic product gdp growth is expected to slow down its global trade balance may begin to shift toward deficit as well the more significant differences however have been china s willingness to use extra legal tactics to obtain technology from advanced countries and its growing direct and indirect control over its economy not to mention chinese society a stark contrast to japan s ministry of international trade and industry s now the ministry of economy trade and industry guidance to japanese companies on where and how they should compete the trump administration s response the trump administration s determination to deal with these issues led first to the imposition of tariffs on a broad base of 250 billion worth of chinese exports to the united states if the purpose of the tariffs was to get china s attention it succeeded the two governments have for nearly a year now engaged in protracted negotiations that first languished then picked up speed after the trump xi jinping dinner in buenos aires on december 2 2018 where the two presidents agreed on a 90 day time frame for finishing the talks that deadline came and went amid a flurry of good faith and making progress statements from both sides and there was continuing optimism that the two would reach agreement the mood shifted in mid may when the united states accused the chinese of backing off commitments they had made and president donald trump increased the third tranche of tariffs from 10 to 25 percent and threatened to impose new tariffs on virtually all remaining chinese imports as of mid may it appears that the impasse may continue for some time although an agreement remains the most likely ultimate outcome if an agreement is reached it will likely have three components along with the resolution of a number of specific bilateral trade irritants that have been pending for some time the first part is the easiest chinese commitments to buy more u s goods that is not difficult for china to do and it scratches the president s itch for a visible concession that he can boast about and which will reduce our bilateral trade deficit ironically however the real issues here may be the united states ability to manufacture as much stuff as the chinese have agreed to buy and the wisdom of putting too many trade eggs in a chinese basket at the expense of other markets in the long run that would create a dependence on the chinese market that would make us more rather than less vulnerable the second component of an agreement will address the structural reforms that go to the core of our dispute the most likely outcome is that the chinese give us some but not all of what we have been asking for by making commitments on intellectual property theft forced technology transfers and opening investment in china and agreeing to do away with various forms of discrimination against foreign companies one particular change doing away with joint venture requirements would go a long way toward reducing the threat of forced technology requirements which often occurs as a consequence of negotiations between the u s company and the required chinese partner missing from this will be unequivocal promises to turn away from a state dominated economy subsidies support for state owned enterprises and implementation of made in china 2025 the chinese government s guidebook for developing national champions in 14 critical technologies and move in the direction of a genuine market economy while doing that would make sense the chinese communist party s primary goal has always been maintaining control and the past few years have made it abundantly clear that for xi jinping that includes maintaining the government s heavy hand in directing the economy at the same time pursuing that policy poses the risk of further slowing growth which would increase grumbling within both the party and the public xi s dilemma is that such an outcome may in the long run prove a greater risk to party control than shifting to a market economy the third element of any agreement will be an enforcement package and that has proved to be the most contentious part of the debate the united states insists that china give it the unilateral right to determine compliance and to act unilaterally if washington believes it is necessary the chinese view that as a violation of their sovereignty and argue for a consultative process which is not sufficient for the administration that issue as well as the disposition of the existing tariffs will likely end up in the laps of the two presidents the importance of building coalitions a trade agreement with china will be good news in the short term because it will produce a positive bump in the financial markets but the path to lasting improvement in the relationship as well as political success for president trump is a narrow one it requires a strong agreement that the chinese actually implement if the agreement is only about buying more stuff with a few intellectual property concessions thrown in it will be heavily criticized as both a policy failure and a failure of the president s self proclaimed negotiating skills even if it is better than that the likelihood of full chinese compliance is low so what might look like and will certainly be touted as a great success when it occurs may not look so great a year later if it becomes clear that very little has changed or the united states has restarted the trade war with new tariffs due to chinese noncompliance president trump who does not have a history of looking ahead to the possible consequences of his actions should do so very carefully in this case as the negative outcome that is possible next year will be a lot closer to the election than the success of an agreement announced this year sadly that may be the most likely outcome even though it does not serve either country s long term interests one important piece missing in this equation is the role of other countries president trump who is a noted skeptic of multilateralism prefers to approach issues bilaterally in the belief that u s dominance is so great we can leverage the behavior we want from the other party that worked with south korea worked up to a point with mexico and canada and may well work with japan but it does not appear to be working with either the european union or china both of which are bigger than we are size matters in the global economy and the u s footprint continues to shrink in the case of china this is a particularly important missed opportunity historically china has been uncomfortable being the outlier and joint efforts by western nations have generally been more successful in changing chinese behavior than individual ones that makes even more sense now since other nations notably in the european union have begun to show higher levels of concern about china s policies suggesting they are ripe for coalition building however aside from a useful effort to develop a trilateral u s eu japan paper on redefining subsidies in the wto there has been little effort so far to bring other nations together to act in concert in the end that may prove a fatal mistake building a coalition does not simply mean persuading others to make the same demarches to the chinese government that we have made it also means building or strengthening institutions that give meaning to the open rules based trading system that western nations have supported since the 1944 bretton woods agreement that is what the trans pacific partnership and the trans atlantic trade and investment partnership were really about creating structures that would stand for and enforce common rules based on openness transparency and sound science which other nations would have to respect if they wanted access to the markets covered by those agreements since both sets of signatories represent large consumer markets china would have a significant incentive to adhere to their rules and perhaps ultimately join the agreements coalition building also implies a recognition that the real commercial battleground with china is neither here nor there but in third countries where the playing field is more level pursuing more open markets in china is a noble exercise that deserves to be undertaken but governments doing it need to be realistic about the prospects for success particularly in the short term they also need to focus more of their resources on competing in other countries that are more open to their efforts the reality of modern competition is that if one is in a race there are only two ways to win run faster or trip the opponent the trump administration s policy as well as much of the ensuing congressional and public debate has focused on the latter but the surer path to success is the former william reinsch holds the scholl chair in international business at the center for strategic and international

just under three decades ago nelson mandela addressed 300 business executives at a conference convened by the consultative business forum in johannesburg on the theme options for building an economic future he touched on issues that south africa still grapples with including nationalisation privitisation land reform inequality public finances unions and capital flight a transcript of the address still timely and relevant is published on sa history online in honour of 10 years of mandela day an edited version is reproduced here mandela delivered it on may 23 1990 just months after being released form victor verster prison we would like to thank the consultative business movement most sincerely for taking the initiative to convene what is for us a truly historic conference the mere fact that it is taking place sends an important signal about the need for all south africans to get together to determine the destiny of our common fatherland recently i had occasion to read an advertisement inserted in the british press by the anglo american corporation it begins by quoting various clauses of the freedom charter which have to do with job creation and the provision of food housing and education it then poses the very important and correct question if the south african economy doesn t deliver how can any politician hope to that in a sense encapsulates the significance of this conference both of us you representing the business world and we a political movement must deliver the critical questions are whether we can in fact act together and whether it is possible for either one of us to deliver if we cannot and will not cooperate we hope that the fact that we are meeting here signifies that there is a common acceptance among us that we necessarily must cooperate to ensure that the people do indeed enjoy a decent standard of living in conditions of freedom to establish a system of cooperation requires that we should at least share some common objectives but it also means that we have to overcome the mutual mistrust that to some degree undoubtedly exists between us we do not have to elaborate the reasons for that mistrust as south africans we all know that they emanate from the fact that on one side of the street are the haves and on the other the have nots on one side the whites and on the other the blacks the interaction that is taking place among us today and hopefully in other encounters in future should help in the process of identifying the common objectives which should become part of a national consensus that will help to bridge the enormous gulfs that separate the different communities in this country as we discuss we hope that some of the mistrust will fall away but of course it will be in the process of the honest implementation of what would have been agreed that this mistrust would finally disappear roots of bitterness you will i am certain remember the nursery rhyme baa baa black sheep have you any wool yes sir yes sir three bags full one for the master one for the dame one for the little boy who lives down the lane could it be that when the children composed this simple verse they understood that it was only the figurative black sheep that would because it was itself excluded have sufficient sense of justice and compassion to remember the little boy down the lane was it because they had seen in practice that the white sheep apportioned only a tenth of its wool or none at all to the little boy down the lane many a time the martingales and deprived people whom we represent have posed the same bitter questions that shylock posed in shakespeare s merchant of venice hath not a jew eyes hath not a jew hands organs dimensions senses affections passions fed with the same food hurt with the same weapons subject to the same diseases healed by the same means warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as a christian is if you prick us do we not bleed if you tickle us do we not laugh if you poison us do we not die and if you wrong us shall we not revenge if we are like you in the rest we will resemble you in that the villainy you teach me i will execute and it shall be so hard but i will better the instruction questions such as these whether about black sheep or the universal nature of human pain and suffering can only be posed by people who are discriminated against in a society that condemns them to persistent deprivation of the material artefacts and the dignity that are due to them as human beings we pose them for the same reasons the bitterness of a shylock who threatens to execute and even better the villainy which his persecutors have taught him by their example is a feeling that comes naturally to those who are hurt by systematic and systemic abuse it should come as no surprise that it lurks in the breasts of many whom this society has considered and treated as disposable cyphers the issue we are addressing is the one of power and the uses and abuses of power those among us who are white come from that section of our population that has power and in a sense total power over the lives of the black people nothing within the sphere of human endeavour is excepted be it political economic military educational or any other indeed this even extends to the right to decide who shall live and who shall die these may sound like harsh words but the reality that is unseen inside the boardrooms by those who exercise power across the length and breadth of this country is harsher still the anger in the heart of shylock is abroad in our society this is a fact to which we should be very sensitive without any attempt at self deception deracialisation of economic power but then what about economic power this obviously is one of the thorniest issues that must be addressed it is said that less than ten corporate conglomerates control almost 90 of the shares listed on the johannesburg stock exchange if somebody did any arithmetical calculation he or she would probably find that the total number of people who sit on the boards of these companies as directors is far less than one thousand these will almost exclusively be white males if you add to this the fact that 87 of the land is by law white owned and is in fact occupied by a minority even among the whites then the iniquity of the system we have all inherited becomes even more plain if we are genuinely interested in ending the old social order and bringing in a new one characterised by the notions of justice and equity it is quite obvious that the economic power relations represented by the reality of the excessive concentration of power in a few white hands have to change we make this demand not as a result of any imperative that might be said to derive from ideological convictions we make it because we cannot see how it would be possible to pull our country out of the economic crisis in part caused and exemplified by white control of economic power while at the same time we perpetuate this power structure it might be said that international experience shows it is wisest not to tamper with this power structure the argument is made that the sanctity of private property and the incentive and dynamism that derive from private ownership should convince all of us to accept if not welcome this economic power structure as a fact of life what we would like to say is that while we look at economic models and study the experiences of other countries we should not forget that we are dealing with south africa with its own history its own reality and its own imperatives one of these imperatives is to end white domination in all its forms to deracialise the exercise of economic power if we are agreed about this objective as it affects the economy then i trust we can begin a serious discussion about how it should be achieved it would seem to me necessary that this discussion vigorous though it has to be should not be conducted in a manner which makes healthy debate impossible we would therefore have to avoid throwing epithets at one another questioning one another s capacity to think or challenging one another s good faith issues to be addressed i am not going to present any argument about nationalisation i would however like to share a secret with you the view that the only words in the economic vocabulary that the anc knows are nationalisation and redistribution is mistaken there are many issues we shall have to consider as we discuss the question of democratisation and deracialisation of economic power one of these is whether we should not draw on such lessons as we might learn from the anti trust laws of the united states or the work of the monopolies commission in great britain to address the issue of how to ensure that there is no unhealthy over concentration of economic power the application of those lessons would of course have to take into account the economic realities of our own country which might dictate various optimal sizes for different firms the factors that would have to be considered would include the necessity to achieve economies of scale the capacity to generate the necessary critical mass of investible funds the strength to compete successfully on the international markets the ability to participate in serious research and development and so on another issue we might have to consider is the advisability or otherwise of the placement on the boards of privately owned companies of directors appointed by the government to see whether it is possible to balance the pursuit of private gain with the need to promote the common good i would also like to stress that we do not want to have everything done by the new government a healthy relationship between employers and trade unions is crucial to the country s future we agree with the view that progressive labour legislation allowing strong unions to carry out centralised bargaining will help to solve many important issues the question of a living wage job security and industrial restructuring must be dealt with in the bargaining process yet another question we might consider is whether there are no areas in which it would benefit society at large if the state established public corporations or strengthened existing ones one of these areas might be housing where it seems clear that there is an urgent need for vigorous state intervention rapidly to expand the country s stock of habitable accommodation another area is suggested by the need for state encouragement of small and medium business as well as the cooperative sector especially as there is a crying need for the multiplication of economic activities that will lead to the creation of new jobs we might mention at this point that we are firmly opposed to the process of privatisation on which the government has embarked it seems to us eminently wrong for the government to engage in this important restructuring exercise precisely at the moment when the whole country and the world expect that fundamental political change is in the offing it would seem only reasonable that so important a question as the disposal of public property should be held over until a truly representative government is in place additionally and inevitably the process of privatisation cannot but reinforce the economic power relations which we assert have to be changed source unisa as we have said the land question must also be addressed within the context of the restructuring of the old economic power relations recent state actions to sell state land and to evict people from white farms are entirely unhelpful to these purposes before anything else is done the racist and discriminatory land acts have to be repealed furthermore serious discussions and planning must take place involving the rural people and their representatives the democratic government those who own land and the country as a whole so that we can all address the related issues of making land available to the land hungry masses while ensuring the necessary increases in the production of food and agricultural raw materials we still believe that there must be further discussion of the issue of nationalisation of assets that might at the moment be privately owned the anc has no blueprint that decrees that these or other assets will be nationalised or that such nationalisation would take this or the other form but we do say that this option should also be part of the ongoing debate subject to critical analysis as any other and viewed in the context of the realities of south african society it should not be ruled out of the court of discussion simply because of previous bad experience or because of a theological commitment to the principle of private property we are very conscious of the critical importance of such matters as the confidence in the future of both the national and the international business communities and investors we accept that both these sectors are very important to the process of the further development of our economy we can therefore have no desire to go out of our way to bash them and to undermine or weaken their confidence in the safety of their property and the assurance of a fair return on their investment but we believe that they too must be sensitive to the fact that any democratic government will have to respond to the justified popular concern about the grossly unequal distribution of economic power there should be no debate among us about the centrality of the issue of ensuring a rapidly growing economy to ensure a rising standard of living the gross domestic product must grow at rates that are higher than the rate of growth of the population various figures have been thrown around about the possible and desirable rates of growth this conference will obviously not have the possibility to look at these figures and to study their macro economic implications economic growth and equity but of course the issues about which i am sure we are agreed of the need to generate significant domestic savings to attract substantial foreign investment and to keep the rate of inflation reasonably low are central to the discussion of the question of economic growth perhaps there are only three or four points we should raise at this stage one of these is that we are concerned at persistent reports that some of our own domestic companies have been and are involved in a process of exporting capital from this country we cannot sit here verbally welcome the prospect of democratic transformation talk of the need rapidly to develop the economy and at the same time reduce the means that would make such development actually possible the second point is that it is important that we should stop propagating the gloomy picture of a south africa that as it is said will inevitably sink into the economic crisis that afflicts many african countries the third is that it seems obvious that the democratic parliament together with the public at large should elaborate a macro economic indicative national plan to provide a framework within which to determine the directions of growth policy we are saying in other words that the process of growth cannot be left to develop spontaneously because it would ineluctably result in the structural distortions and imbalances which have to be corrected in this connection we should all accept the reality that growth by itself will not ensure equity a situation could develop in which in terms of levels of income we continue to have a persistent gap between the haves and have nots despite any increase that may take place in the standard of living of the other i am therefore raising the question that the matter of the redistribution of wealth in conditions of a genuine economy is one that must be faced squarely and addressed firmly i am sure it is common cause among us that the very fact of an expanding market resulting from the process of wealth reaching those who were formerly deprived is itself a condition for and an engine of economic growth nelson mandela afp we are of course all concerned about the need generally to raise the level of education of all our people and in particular rapidly to increase the numbers of black engineers technicians artisans and other skilled persons this would of course make a decisive contribution to the critical issue of the level of productivity in the economy as a whole it would also place the issue of the relative and absolute increase of income accruing to the black section of our population within the context of expanding national wealth in whose expansion they would have played an important part the penultimate issue we wish to raise is the matter of public spending there can be no doubt that the public finances will come under enormous pressure for increased spending on education housing health unemployment benefits pensions and so on it should be commonly agreed among us that the democratic state must indeed have a responsibility to provide this material cushion at least to protect the most disadvantaged certainly the present day apartheid absurdity must be addressed whereby public per capita social spending on the whites is at least six times higher than on africans however complicated the economics of bridging this gap and instituting a rational system of social welfare which actually increases social welfare something will have to be done in this area as a matter of urgency indeed we could say that even now as we enter a period of transition it might be necessary to establish mechanisms by which those who have been excluded from power play a role in determining the disbursement of public funds the concerns that have been raised with regard to the capacity of the tax base to carry a vastly increased state budget are of course important and legitimate but in a situation of rapid economic growth such as we have spoken of it would be necessary to review the system of taxation the aim would be to reduce the burden of direct and indirect taxation on sections of the community least capable of looking after themselves and to shift more of the load on to the corporate sector without of course producing a situation of diminishing returns but obviously enormous savings will be made as a result of the abolition of the multi headed hydra represented by the various apartheid administrative structures defence spending will also have to be reduced radically as a result of the thinning down of the defence establishment a process which must also lead to the conversion of military production facilities to civilian needs we would also be of the view that we should build a state system which does not seek to administer the lives of people as though they were wards of the state the situation should therefore be fought against in which there would be a bloated and unproductive civil service think about future in new terms we need the same transformation in the economic sphere you as businessmen and women have the obligation to engage in this process i hope that you are able to abandon old ideas and think about the future in new terms once such ideas are born we know that you will have the courage to act on them in this manner we could begin to shape our economic and political destiny in the interest of justice peace and progress we trust that you will consider this carefully and reflect on the question what are you prepared to do for your country rather than what your country can do for you we hope that what we have said might assist in the process of building a national consensus on the direction we have to choose in order to end the agony of apartheid and racism of poverty and deprivation of internal conflict and international isolation all of us present here have an obligation to use the levers of power and influence we hold in our hands to ensure that the new day dawns now

july 19 2019 12 05 am updated december 04 2021 10 37 pm ist the recently released economic survey either glosses over or ignores many acute challenges faced by the indian economy like the severe agrarian crisis the troubles of loss making and debt ridden public sector units and the issues plaguing public sector banks while the survey is not incorrect in highlighting the importance of incorporating insights from psychology into economics it is odd that this has been done so late in the day many other countries like the u k australia and singapore have for long being applying such points to policy design and implementation areas and the issue has been discussed in india over the last few years as well it is unclear what added value the report truly has to offer here one issue that the survey rightly underlines is the need for india to revive private investment if it is to achieve the magical 5 trillion economy status by 2024 25 however what is odd here is that to stress this the document invokes the age old comparison between india and east asian countries it is rather strange that the survey brings up something that has been taught in economic development classes over the last two decades how the nies prospered here a question that arises is can the east asian model help revive india s floundering investment rates some crucial reminders are worth underlining the east asian model was largely a story driven by the newly industrialised economies nies of singapore hong kong south korea and taiwan and japan earlier specifically the prime goal in various nies from 1960s through to the 1990s prior to the asian financial crisis was to raise gross savings rates while the rise in household savings was partly due to the positive demographic dividend a variety of other factors including macroeconomic stability low inflation lack of social safety nets inability to leverage due to a highly regulated banking system and forced savings fully funded provident funds also played a role state owned enterprises had to operate with budget constraints this coupled with the fiscal discipline practised by the economies ensured that the public sector did not crowd out private savings and in some cases actually added to national savings another goal was to ensure that the private savings were actually intermediated into the formal financial system failing which the cost of capital would remain high and the availability of capital for investment would be low to achieve this importance was given to the establishment of a safe and secure public sector banking system usually in the form of postal savings networks where deposits were guaranteed by the central bank and interest incomes was taxed lightly if at all the state owned banks were tightly regulated as financial stability was the cornerstone of overall macroeconomic stability financial inclusion was encouraged though the focus was on actual use of the deposit accounts rather than just their opening while the manufacturing sector was viewed as a growth engine and open to export competition the banking sector in all economies apart from hong kong remained tightly regulated and closed to foreign banks even singapore initially adopted a dual banking structure that sheltered the domestic economy largely from significant short term bank flows it resorted to a calibrated policy to allow fully licensed foreign banks only in the late 1990s tight financial oversight so while these economies were generally successful in encouraging savings the cost of capital was rather high not unlike the problem in india today to tackle this the east asian economies undertook financial repression conventionally understood as a ceiling price keeping lending rates lower than market equilibrium this in normal circumstances would have led to disintermediation from the formal financial system a consequent reduction in the quantity of financing and the creation of a shadow banking system however central banks of these economies maintained tight oversight and selective capital controls ensured that the low yielding savings did not leave their countries of origin while limited financial development forestalled the possibility of people looking for savings alternatives along with these the governments undertook sophisticated industrial policies to promote domestic investment much of which was export led though not necessarily free market based the governments understood that a vertical industrial policy of picking winners would not work without a sound horizontal industrial policy dealing with labour and land reforms bringing about basic literacy and raising women s participation in the labour force besides incentives also had clear guidelines and sunset clauses and mechanisms were in place to phase out support thus winners prospered while losers were allowed to fail in addition the bureaucracies of these east asian economies had what berkeley sociologist peter evans referred to as embedded autonomy this allowed the state to be autonomous yet embedded within the private sector and enabled the two to work together to develop policies or change course if the policies did not work this made industrial policy operate as a process of self discovery as emphasised by harvard economist dani rodrik it is the lack of this embedded autonomy in the next tier nies of malaysia thailand and indonesia that has been partly responsible for them being stuck in the middle income trap heterodox policies reforms thus much of the investment and export acceleration in east asian countries was due to heterodox policies and reforms that were carefully calibrated well sequenced and implemented at a time when the external environment was far less hostile than it is today these measures allowed the nations to benefit from their demographic dividends and transform themselves into developed economies in record time in contrast due to political and other compulsions india s reforms since 1991 have been rather haphazard and of a stop and go nature with perverse consequences all of which has made it much more challenging for the country to take full advantage of its demographic dividend successive governments have neither had the tool sets and the policy space nor the embedded autonomy needed to drive the industrial transformation as in the east asian countries though measures like reducing policy uncertainty ensuring that the fiscal expenditures do not crowd out private savings and investment enhancing the efficiency of financial intermediation and dealing with land acquisition and environment clearances are all essential to reignite investment we do not need to invoke the east asian example to understand the importance of these ramkishen s

china s gdp expanded 6 3 year on year in the first half of 2019 according to the data released by the national bureau of statistics nbs on monday that was a good performance considering the country is changing its growth drivers and adjusting its overall economic structure amid the ongoing china u s trade dispute despite these trade tensions china s trade surplus continues to increase foreign trade in goods rose 3 9 year on year to reach 14 7 trillion yuan 2 1 trillion the total value of exports was 7 9521 trillion yuan up 6 1 and the imports 6 7155 trillion yuan up 1 4 this left a surplus of 1 2366 trillion yuan in surplus up 41 6 year on year showing the trade dispute is not having much impact on china as had been feared however it has increased the costs of american companies and pushed up u s inflation china s export growth rate in the first half exceeded expectations though it was less than the same period last year for the remainder of the year consumption and investment will determine china s overall growth in the first half consumption contributed for 60 1 to the gdp the net export of goods and services contributed 20 7 compared to minus 10 7 last year while capital formation contributed 19 2 investment showed stable growth with spending on fixed assets growing by 5 8 and this should continue in the second half investment in real estate grew by 10 9 maintaining the double digit growth rate seen from last year this also had big impact on the investment and growth of another 50 to 60 industrial sectors compared with developed countries china s urbanization rate still lags so real estate investment will continue to play an important role in maintaining future economic growth the growth of manufacturing investment has increased slightly in the past two months the industry is in a transition period from old to new growth drivers as china seeks to increase high quality manufacturing investment the best way to achieve high quality economic development infrastructure investment is also accelerating in the first half highway transport investment increased by 8 1 and railway transport investment 14 1 with the rapid development of china s modern logistics industry and continuous promotion of the belt and road initiative infrastructure investment still has much room for further growth also significant is the growth of investment in high tech industry and the manufacturing technology transformation despite tax cuts this year a total of 2 15 trillion yuan of local government special bonds continues to provide strong financial support for these areas in june local governments bond issues totaled 183 worth nearly 900 billion yuan with the faster opening up of the financial industry and the entry of foreign financial institutions more investment is expected in the second half as mentioned already consumption is playing a key role in maintaining good gdp growth total retail sales of consumer goods increased by 8 4 in the first half sales in june increased by 9 8 or 1 2 percentage points faster than may helped by wage increases and the accelerated quality upgrading it is precisely because china s economic growth now depends more on consumption and investment than on exports that china has been able to transform itself from an export driven to a domestic consumption oriented one the figures clearly show china s economic growth is now increasingly dependent on the driving force of domestic demand and consumption and this trend can only continue to expand presently the middle income population in china has reached around 400 million with the continued economic growth and the improvement of personal incomes china has become a consumer market with the best potential in the world domestic demand has increasingly become the key to promote economic growth in addition to the continuous optimization of demand structure supply side structural reform is promoting the continuous optimization of the economic structure in the first half the added value of the tertiary industry accounted for 54 9 of gdp 0 5 percentage points higher year on year and 15 percentage points higher than the secondary industry the contribution rate of tertiary industrial growth to gdp growth was 60 3 23 2 percentage points higher than the second industry the service industry has maintained a good momentum of development information transmission software and information technology services leasing and business services transportation warehousing and postal industries have increased their added value component by 20 6 7 8 7 3 and 7 3 year on year respectively in the first half of the year the added value of the high tech manufacturing industry increased by 9 or three percentage points faster than that of all enterprises above designated size the proportion of added value of high tech manufacturing industry in all the enterprises above designated size increased by 0 8 percentage points year on year the regional structure is constantly being optimized with the opening up achieving a higher level and the high quality development of the belt and road initiative being strongly maintained there is great potential for the development of china s central and western regions these have accelerated the transformation and upgrading of their industrial structure while the eastern coastal region has accelerated its innovative and technological progress thus complementing each other from the statistics of the first half of the year we can see that no matter how china u s trade develops and whatever the outcome of the bilateral economic and trade negotiations will be china s economic growth will remain steady china will continue to firmly deepen its reform and opening up at a higher level whether the trade friction escalates or not we have reason to expect a sound economic performance in the second half of the year ensuring achievement of the overall economic growth target of more than 6 the author is a

kwan rbc capital markets robert catellier cibc capital markets operator welcome to the quarterly earnings conference call at this time all participants are in a listen only mode at the end of today s presentation we will conduct the question and answer session today s conference is being recorded if you have any objections you may disconnect at this time i would now like to turn the call over to mr rich kinder executive chairman of kinder morgan sir you may begin rich kinder thank you brendon before we begin as usual i d like to remind you that today s earnings releases by kmi and kml and this call includes forward looking and financial outlook statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 the securities and exchange act of 1934 and applicable canadian provincial and territorial securities laws as well as certain non gaap financial measures before making any investment decisions we strongly encourage you to read our full disclosures on forward looking and financial outlook statements and use of non gaap financial measure set forth at the end of kmi s and kml s earnings releases and to review our latest filings with the sec and canadian provincial and territorial securities commissions for a list of important material assumptions expectations and risk factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated and described in such forward looking and financial outlook statements before turning the call over to steve and the management team i usually begin these quarterly earnings calls with a few words about our financial strategy at kinder morgan i hope by now we ve made it very clear that we are managing our assets and the substantial cash flow they generate in a financially responsible way that maximizes returns to our shareholders that said it s important to understand and appreciate what underpins that cash flow and whether that business will continue to generate strong and growing returns with the opportunity to expand our asset base as you know majority of our segment earnings before dd a comes from our natural gas segment and through our 70 000 plus miles of natural gas pipelines we handle about 40 of all the gas consumed in this country in addition the bulk of our current and projected capital expansion dollars are also devoted to the natural gas segment we are very bullish on the future of natural gas from both a supply and demand perspective natural gas is critical to our american economy to satisfy the growing energy needs around the world and very importantly to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions in a cost effective manner our optimism is borne out by actual results over the last few years and by the consensus estimate of those firms and governmental agencies which follow the energy field most closely sometimes we lose sight of the actual facts involved so looking first through the rearview mirror u s demand in 2018 was up 12 from 2017 and 44 above the demand of a decade earlier 2019 is shaping up to be another strong year looking forward as we previously said u s demand is projected to grow by over 30 between now and 2030 that demand growth is being driven by l g power and industrial demand and by exports to mexico turning to the supply side the u s is projected by 2025 to be producing one quarter of all the natural gas in the world and accounting for over 50 of the growth in supply in global supply by that year now look iâ m aware of mark twain saying that making predictions is very difficult particularly when they concern the future but i believe that under almost any scenario natural gas is a winner for years to come connecting these vast supplies these vast u s supplies to growing demand markets will drive new infrastructure and higher utilization of existing assets kmi is very well positioned to take advantage of these opportunities especially in texas and louisiana where our extensive network of pipelines is very well situated to serve the rapidly growing lng export and petrochemical facilities that s a big reason why we feel good about the long term future of this company with that i ll turn it over to steve steve kean all right thanks rich we will be updating you on both kmi and kml this after afternoon i am going to start with kmi and turn it over to our president kim dang to give you the update on our segment performance our cfo david michels will take you through the numbers dax sanders will update you on kml number and then weâ ll take your questions the summary on kmi is this weâ ve been adhering and continue to adhere to the principles that we ve laid out for you we have a strong balance sheet having met our approximately 4 5 times debt to ebitda target and with rating upgrades now from all three ratings agencies we re maintaining our capital discipline through our return criteria a good track record of execution and by self funding our investments we re returning value to shareholders with the 25 year over year dividend increase and we continue to find attractive growth opportunities we have a strong balance sheet capital discipline returning value to our shareholders and finding additional growth opportunities those are the principles we operate by our performances this year so far has been solid and we project it to be solid weâ ve had headwinds on commodity prices in our co2 segment and weâ ve had a delay in the in service of our elba lng facility also as we said at the beginning of the year we did not budget for rate case settlements resulting from the 501 g process but we are pleased with the settlements we were able to obtain now we had tailwinds in terms of lower interest rates and good performance in our west north and midstream gas groups helping to offset these negatives putting it all together as we said last quarter we expect to be slightly under plan on an ebitda basis but on plan from a dcs standpoint so here are some updates on a few key projects starting with our permian natural gas pipeline projects our customers are anxious to have us get their gas out of the permian so they can get their oil and ngls out as well we got two projects to get the gas out gulf coast express and permian highway and we are in discussions on a possible third pipeline which were calling permian pass gcx and permian highway are each about 2 bcf a day of capacity both are secured by long term contracts and both are in the execution stage gcx is expected to be in service slightly ahead of schedule the original schedule was october 1 of this year we now expect to be at the full 2 bcf a day the in service level in the last week to 10 days of september the pipe is in the ground there is still commissioning work going on on the compressor and meter stations but our expectation is for a slightly early in service date permian highway is receiving pipe and acquiring right of way we hired our pipeline and construction firms and we are on schedule for a completion in october 2020 we had a significant court decision last month which essentially affirms the existing eminent domain process that has been used in use for four decades in the state of texas felt confident in our legal position but is nevertheless a good thing to have prevailed in the case so both of our current projects are on schedule both projects are at attractive returns and both projects bring us additional opportunities in our downstream pipelines combined they bring 4 bcf a day of incremental gas to a system that moves about 5 bcf a day today those projects bring opportunities for downstream expansion and optimization as we find homes for all that incremental gas through our connectivity with lng facilities texas gulf coast power industrial and petchem demand we are working with customers on a third 2 bcf a day pipeline the permian pass pipeline this is a work in progress it s not in the backlog at this point certainly but it is moving along these permian projects show us taking advantage of a very positive situation there s large supply growth in texas and large demand growth in texas we can bridge the two and connect to our premier texas intrastate pipeline network and stay entirely within the state of texas where we have more commercial flexibility as we pointed out at the conference this year 70 of natural demand natural gas demand growth between now and 2030 is expected to be in louisiana and texas and our systems are well positioned to benefit from that on another key project elba our elba liquefaction facility we are closing in on in service we are now mechanically complete on 4 of the 10 mmls units the cold box on the first unit is now uniformly cold at cryogenic temperatures and we are ramping up the volume we are producing lng unevenness in the temperatures between the bottom and the top of the cold box had been plaguing our startup over the last several weeks we are now past that and ramping up to full service we expect to be in service on unit one soon and that unit represents 70 of project revenue i d like to be more definitive about the exact in service date but it is a function of whether we have to suspend the production of lng for additional troubleshooting the delay we ve experienced is certainly unwelcome but the risk allocation between us and our contractor and our customer provides significant protection and mitigates the impact to our internal rate of return the impact of the delay is expected to be approximately 100 basis points unlevered after tax on a still attractive return we ll make a separate announcement when we have the first unit in service also of note we added 400 million worth of projects to the backlog this quarter partially offsetting 800 million worth of projects that are placed into service or removed from the backlog most of what we removed from the backlog was in co2 segment we remain our team in co2 remains very disciplined here and we reduced capital spend when we find the economics do not justify the expenditure the backlog now stands at 5 7 billion and most of the new capital investment is in natural gas which now makes up nearly 80 of our total backlog and with that i ll turn it over to kim kim dang hey thanks steve natural gas had another outstanding quarter it was up 7 and the underlying market fundamentals remain very strong between 2018 and 2019 natural gas demand is expected to increase by over 5 bcf a day almost 60 of kmi segment earnings before dd a come from our natural gas business and of the natural gas consumed in the u s we move about 40 on our pipeline so the fundamentals underlying our largest business are very strong transport volumes on our transmission pipes increased approximately 3 1 bcf a day second quarter versus the second quarter of 2018 are about 10 this is the sixth quarter in a row in which volumes exceeded the comparable period by 10 or more if you look at where these volume showed up in our transmission pipe png volumes were up 760 million cubic feet a day due to increased permian volumes and increased california demand kmla volumes were up 670 million cubic feet a day due to lng exports and overall for kinder morgan s deliveries to lng export plants increased approximately 1 4 bcf a day cig volumes were approximately 500 million a day due to increased dj basin production and colder weather ruby volumes were up 370 million cubic feet a day due to colder west coast weather and outages in the pacific northwest and rig volumes were up 370 a day due to increased dj production on gathering assets volumes were up approximately 16 or 450 million cubic feet a day and that was primarily due to higher volumes on our haynesville and our eagle ford gathering system overall natural gas wellhead volumes out of the key basins that we serve continue to increase permian natural gas wellhead volumes increased approximately 30 versus the second quarter of 2018 haynesville increased approximately 27 bakken increased approximately 27 and eagle ford increased approximately 5 overall the higher utilization on our systems a lot of which came without the need to spend significant capital resulted in nice bottom line growth for the segment in the quarter and longer term will drive expansion opportunities as the market continues to grow in our capacity our product segment was down in the quarter slightly here increased contributions from our southeast refined products terminal our central florida pipeline our double eagle pipeline and our condensate splitter were more than offset by the lower contribution from kmcc and sfpp volumes on kmcc were actually up 12 but that was more than offset by lower rates sfpp was impacted by higher operating expenses overall crude and condensate volumes were up 2 refined product volumes were flat in the quarter and eia refined products volume the estimate is that they were down approximately 0 9 is a little bit better than the national average terminals business was down in the quarter the liquids business which accounts for about 80 of the segment had nice increases from expansion projects the largest of which was our baseline thermal expansion projects in edmonton we also saw higher throughput and ancillary charges in our houston ship channel facility however these increases were more than offset by the lease expense in our edmonton south terminal which became a third party obligation posts our trans mountain sale and impact from historically high water levels on the mississippi river that resulted in reduced volumes and contributed to off hire time on our jones act tankers we added approximately 1 2 million barrels of tankage in the quarter versus the second quarter of 2018 now it s primarily results with a baseline project and that brings our total leasable capacity to around 89 million barrels the bulk business was also down in the quarter due to lower volume bulk volumes were down approximately 11 due to lower coal pet coke and steel our co2 segment was down in the quarter and that was primarily due to lower crude and ngl prices our net realized crude oil price was down about 8 a barrel for the quarter and that s largely driven by our mid cush basis hedges ngl prices were down approximately 9 per barrel on the crude oil production side volumes were down approximately 2 primarily due to lower production at katz and goldsmith while cotton production increased 8 versus the second quarter of 2018 but offset substantially below our plan the reservoir is processing slower than we expected and until we can determine how to address this issue starting to reduce 2019 capital expenditures associated with this asset largely as a result of this decision free cash flow from our co2 business has increased by approximately 80 million for 2019 as almost all the production associated with these investments benefited future years in co2 as with all our assets we diligently monitor our investments to make sure that they re going to achieve our projected return to the extent that we think there s a material risks with its return either take steps to mitigate our downside or we do not move forward with those investments as we did here at sacroc which accounts for almost two thirds of our current production production was up 1 in the quarter and we expect to be above budgeted volumes for the year so nice current performance in sacroc when you look at the longer term the story has also improved in our mid year reserve review sacroc proved reserves increased by about 5 5 million barrels which represents approximately 33 increase improved reserves this was driven primarily by increased recovery factors as a result of increased performance on our co2 sales and transport business it was up slightly in the quarter and that was driven by an 11 increase in co2 volumes which more than offset a 4 decrease in the price with that i ll turn it over to dave michels david michels thanks kim today we are declaring a dividend of 0 25 per share same as last quarter and in line with the budget 1 per share for the fourth 25 increase over dividends 2018 kmiâ s adjusted earnings in dcf grew from last yearâ s second quarter generated dcf per share 0 50 two times or approximately 560 million in excess of the declared dividends revenues were down 6 this quarter compared to the second quarter in 2018 but a decline in cost of sales more than offset our lower revenues that our gross margin was up relative to the prior period some of that came from the benefit of non cash losses on derivative contracts during the second quarter of 2018 we treat as certain items and exclude from our non gaap metric including certain items gross margin was in line period over period net income available to common stockholders was 518 million were 388 better than the second quarter of 2018 largely to impairments taken during the second quarter of 2018 which we treat as certain items before certain items net income available to common stockholders was up 34 million or approximately 7 that includes the benefit of zero preferred dividend payments down from 39 million as a result of the conversion of our preferred equity securities in october of last year adjusted earnings per share was 0 22 for the quarter up 0 01 or 5 from the prior period moving on to distributable cash flow performance our natural gas business which you ve already heard was up nicely 73 million or 7 we saw greater performance versus last year across multiple assets epng was up driven by permian supply growth more than offsetting the impacts that that asset received related to our 501 g settlement we had increased contribution from multiple expansion projects placed in service kinderhawk and south texas gmp assets were up driven by increased volume kinder morgan louisiana pipeline was up due to our sabine pass and kim provided the main drivers for our products terminal and co2 segments moving on to our kinder morgan canada segment that was down 100 as a result of our sale of the trans mountain pipeline g a expense was lower by 8 million due to greater overhead capitalized growth projects as well as lower g a from the tran mountain sale partially offsetting those was higher pension expenses relative to last year those pension expenses that hit g a or non cash can we add them back to our dcf and replace those with our actual cash contribution to our pension fund interest expense was 22 million lower and that was driven by lower debt balance and greater interest capitalized to projects as well those are partially offset by a higher libor rate versus last year would impact our interest rate swaps preferred stock dividends are down 39 million as a result of the conversion of our preferred securities cash taxes were higher by 18 million and thatâ s related to payments at citrus greater taxable income there versus last year and higher taxes at kml which dax will walk through those impacts were expected and our cash tax forecast is actually slightly favorable to our budget for the full year sustaining capital was 26 million higher versus the second quarter of 2018 mainly due to pipeline integrity work in our natural gas segments again we have budgeted for greater expenditure in fact our full year forecast is slightly favorable budget total dcf of 1 128 billion was up 1 million or 1 to summarize the main drivers greater contributions from our natural gas segments lower interest expense preferred stock dividend mostly offset by our sale of trans mountain lower commodity prices impacting our co2 segments higher sustaining capex and higher cash tax payments dcf per share 0 50 per share was in line last quarter same drivers as dcf but it includes the impact from the incremental shares that were issued as a result of our preferred security conversion moving on to the balance sheet we ended the quarter at 4 6 times debt to ebitda which is consistent with our budget and slightly higher than where we were at year end at 4 5 times at the end of the year leverage is forecasted to be 4 6 times which is just slightly unfavorable to our budget of 4 5 and is consistent with our long term leverage target of approximately 4 5 times as we said last quarter forecast for that full year ebitda to be slightly lowered than budget or a little less than 2 below budget drivers there include the first 501 g impacts the elba delay lower commodity prices impacting co2 higher pension expenses partially offset by the very strong permian supply growth all of those impact dcf as well but dcf includes the benefit of favorable interest expenses expected for the year and it also adds backs the non cash pension expense as a result we expect our full year dcf to be in line with budget items to note on the balance sheet with regard to some of the larger changes from year end cash has 3 1 billion use driven by a 1 3 billion pay down of bonds which happen in the first quarter 800 million distribution to the public aml shareholders and 340 million of canadian cash taxes related to the sale of trans mountain other current liabilities this is where we booked payable for the public shareholders distribution for the quarter also includes movements in accrued interest and taxes long term debt was down mainly due to us paying off 1 3 billion of bond adjusted net debt ended the quarter at 34 8 billion or about flat with last quarter and an increase of 689 million from year end reconcile the quarter change the 1 128 billion of dcf had growth capital and contributions to jvs 770 million paid dividends of 570 million we have a working capital source of 200 million mainly interest expense accrual that gets us to about flat net debt for the quarter to reconcile from year end we had about 2 5 billion of dcf paid 1 52 billion out in growth capex and contributions to paid dividends of 1 20 billion paid 340 million of taxes and working capital use of approximately 300 million which were mainly interest payments bonus payroll and tax very close to year to date finally weâ re posting or we have posted to our website supplemental earnings information that include an alternative format for our financial presentation it also includes some commodity hedging information for your modeling beginning in the third quarter we plan to use that new format in our earnings release it represent an enhanced presentation of our financial for now it just been provided an addition to our standard format so you can of our implementation with that i will turn it back to steve steve kean all right thank you so turning now to kml in kml we had strong performance during the quarter we continue to advance our expansion projects at our vancouver works facility we have a good business here good midstream assets and a good team and we will continue to manage it and look for opportunities to grow it for the benefit of all of our shareholders dax will give you an update on our financial and commercial performance for the quarter dax sanders thanks steve before i get into the results i want to update you on a couple of general business items first as we announced the kml board purpose stock repurchase plan that will allow us to repurchase up to 2 million restricted voting shares over the next 12 months we will use selectively and opportunistically this is the maximum number of shares allowed under the canadian normal course issuer bid rules taking into account 10 on our announced diesel export project we received material permits and had commenced construction activity consistent with previous statements this is an approximately 43 million project that contemplates two distillate tanks with combined storage capacity of 200 000 barrels underpinned by a 20 year take or pay contract that we expect to put in service during the first half of 2021 on the shed six reactivation projects that we have discussed which as a reminder is an 8 million expansion project at vancouver works we continue to expect to have that in service in now moving forward to the results today the kml board declared a dividend for the second quarter of 0 1625 per restricted voting share and 0 65 annual earnings per restricted voting share from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2019 are 0 12 and thatâ s derived from approximately 22 million income from continuing operations which is same as net income income from continuing operation was down approximately 2 million versus the same quarter in 2018 looking at the largest drivers of that variance revenue increased across most of kmlâ s assets and was led by the contribution from the baseline tank and terminal assets coming online but the increase in revenues was more than offset by the non recurrence of a gain on the sale of small edmonton area pipeline asset in 2018 than the other income expense line and treated as a certain item on the dcf dcf from continuing operations for the quarter is 28 3 million down approximately 7 8 million comparable period in 2018 that reflects coverage of 2 8 million and reflects the dcf payout ratio of approximately cash taxes of unfavorable 9 million as we discussed previously we were not required to make cash tax payments in 2018 for 2018 operations but rather weâ re able to differ them until the first quarter of however we re now required to make installments for this year which is driving that year to year as a relevant our ultimate cash tax obligation for 2018 was lower than we expected and as such we expect to refile later in this year form looking at the other significant component of the dcf variants segment ebitda before certain items is up 7 6 million terminal segment up 6 5 million and the pipeline segment up 1 million terminal segment was higher due primarily to baseline coming online which accounted for about 5 4 the pipeline segment was higher primarily due to higher revenue on as a result of the index adjusted rate and timing on volumes finally sustaining capital was negative 3 9 million due to several plant tank inspections that we did in the second quarter that was looking forward as we said in the release we expect to meet our budget of approximately 213 million of ebitda and approximately 109 million of with that just a couple of quick comments on the balance sheet around liquidity situation we ended the quarter with approximately 33 million cash and significant available liquidity as we only have 35 million drawn out of the 500 million revolving our debt the last 12 months adjusted ebitda ratio of approximately 1 3 times however as we said in the past given potential rating agency adjustments on operating leases and other items this ratio is not necessarily indicative of our debt raising capacity at our current ratings with that i will turn it back to steve steve kean okay brandon if you come back on we will take questions question and answer session operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session our first question is from jeremy tonet with j p morgan your line is open steve kean good afternoon jeremy tonet hi good afternoon good news there with gcx it sounds like coming online early just want to touch on a little bit more and see is that pipe able to flow gas even before the compressors are online could there be line fill where just the force from the plant kind of pushes a certain level of gas through and could you guys get paid on that or how should i think about that line fill that startup process steve kean so this is an over 500 mile pipeline weâ re starting the process of packing it now the pipe is in the ground as i said the compressor stations are the part that really causes the ramp up to occur and look commissioning compressor stations can be dicey we are pretty comfortable with these units and think will be able to get them going and get them ramping up and but it s a process it takes time and as we look out over the period itâ s going to take us to pack the line ramp up all the compression and get to the 2 bcf we think will be done that a week to 10 days early thatâ s kind of what we re looking at in the meantime we will be buying gas we will be delivering what gas we can deliver there is some value in that but we re in a hurry to get this on for our customers and we are moving with all deliberate speed to get it up to full service jeremy tonet got you thatâ s helpful thanks and realize that permian pass being early stages here probably don t want to talk too much about it but just see what i can gather here and want to see if you could comment on end markets that this would target if this leverage your footprint and you lifted i think the capex spend 200 million there is this kind of in there part of that spend what type of product developmental expenses would you be incurring at this point steve kean i ll start with the last first weâ re not incurring a lot of developmental expenses weâ re doing a lot of research on the routing and making sure that weâ ve got a good route and we think we do have a very good route i think the easiest way to think about this is gcx kind of it hits agua dulce which serves corpus and serves the mexican market and some industrial demand down in that part of the state php kind of comes into the middle of our system and weâ ll serve iâ m not talking about shippers here i m talking about markets okay the gas will end up in freeport and at the lng facility there as well as industrial demand that s in that area and the third pipe well the fourth pipe if you count whistler the fourth pipe will go around to east texas and serve lng demand around sabine operator our next question is from shneur gershuni with ubs your line is open shneur gershuni good afternoon everyone maybe just to follow up on the last question on permian pass a little bit here do you expect to have partners on this project similar to how you have it with gcx and sort of benefit from the operating leverage once it hits the eastern part of your system and i was wondering as part of it can you also talk about the analysis that you re doing i mean you did note the three other pipes about whether there s enough gas demand or need for a fourth pipe steve kean okay so like the previous projects i think it s reasonable to expect a similar pattern which is that very large shippers will want to participate in the ownership of the pipeline and we welcome that to a certain extent while we would like to own more of these projects it s good to have your shippers in there with you i think so i would expect the same we would expect that same pattern is going to hold on permian pass and yes the proof of the demand is in the shipper sign up and expect again kind of another producer push sort of pipeline here people are looking for opportunities to get that growing associated gas supply out of the permian so that they can produce their oil and their ngls too and the proof will be in the from our standpoint the proof will be in the sign ups now the projections are a need for a 2 bcf a day pipeline really essentially every year all the way through this fourth pipeline and then there s some expectation that there will be another one needed beyond that that s all very very early but the supply growth out of the permian and the expected demand growth primarily a function of lng demand is still very robust and it should translate itself into for a long term commitment shneur gershuni okay great and as a follow up just wanted to sort of chat about the capex in your backlog for a second here you re taking down co2 capex i think kim said in her prepared remarks that created an 80 million positive on free cash flow can we assume that that 80 million is the reduction in capex and then i was wondering if you can comment on the project that you re evaluating with tallgrass the language in your press release was kind of a little interesting as this will evaluate perceived indications trying to understand are you saying that it s likely moving forward or you re kind of sort of noodling it a little further steve kean okay let s start with co2 yes primarily the source of the additional free cash flow is associated with the dialing back of the capital expenditures so that 80 million is primarily a result of that on the tallgrass project so there are two things to think about here one is that we have an existing pipeline system the hh pipeline and then that flows into it serves some other markets too but it primarily flows into tallgrassâ s pony express pipeline system we announced in open season we and tallgrass announced in open season including the potential for an expansion there but really certainly from our perspective the right way to think about that on hh is we ve signed up some customers on a firm basis and in order to firm those commitments up and be able to provide firm service to those customers we need to make it available to everybody so we re doing an open season to make the capacity available to all customers but we re going through that process in order to firm up the commitments we ve already made the second piece is the potential to use our existing natural gas underutilized natural gas assets in our western region and use them for crude takeaway out of the bakken and dj and that s still something that we are exploring the opportunity for but we don t really have any kind of definitive update for you on operator our next question is from jean ann salisbury with bernstein your line is open jean ann salisbury hey i just wanted to follow up on the tallgrass project it seems like with liberty and both going forward it might be tough to get other people to sign up for another bakken expansion to cushing a while ago i think maybe at your analysts day last year you d mentioned looking into the possibility of converting hh to ngl service can you provide any color on why you ultimately decided not to go that way and is there any chance for it still steve kean yes so we didn t ultimately get the commitments that we would require there and a competing project was announced in fid and so it kind of soaked up that opportunity that demand jean ann salisbury okay got it and just as a quick follow up when gulf coast express starts up are you concerned about any near term cannibalization of your existing gas pipelines out of the permian or itâ s pretty much everything that you have already on take or pay steve kean well we have a lot thatâ s under take or pay i think what we would expect is we ve generated a lot of incremental opportunity out of our west gas pipelines this year associated with very short term transaction parks and loans and things like that and there will be some relief which will reduce those opportunities for us for some period after gcx comes online but i think it s a reduction not an elimination and i think we re expecting for what it s worth we re expecting that gcx is going to when you look at how much gas is being flared in the permian 700 a day or something and the gas that s available to be brought online we expect gcx to fill up very quickly and we ll find a constraint out of the permian burning but it does have reduction of the opportunity that we re experiencing today on short term transactions out of the west operator our next question is from spiro dounis with credit suisse your line is open spiro dounis hey good afternoon everyone just a follow up on gcx looks like you re now investing about 250 million downstream there to facilitate a lot of the influx of gas thatâ s coming i guess just give us a little bit color in terms of what s the timing on that and i asked because i we can see your concerns that once the gas serve initially hits agua dulce in september has nowhere to go so just how youâ re thinking about problem solving for that steve kean so it s about 250 million we re going to get about 1 4 bcf out of additional take away there which is a very capital efficient capacity expansion and i think so that s we talk about that as our crossover two projects we ve already done one crossover projects i think we re evaluating other additional the need for other additional debottlenecking projects on our texas intrastate as we continue to see the waves of gas coming in from the permian and so that s the current investment and that s what we get for it and it takes that gas and enables us to distribute it throughout the industrial areas downstream of really toward the coast and there are probably more of those to come in terms of the timing time on the completion of crossover two next year spiro dounis great appreciate that just thinking about capex from a higher level when you consider growth over the next two years is it right at this point in the market to get more aggressive here and try and capture more market share or does the commodity tape and slowdown in producer activity tell you to be maybe slightly more defensive here in the near term how you guys thinking about that generally speaking steve kean i think we re thinking about it the way we always do which is that we look for our shippers to come forward when they need the capacity sign up for firm commitments to justify the capital on reasonable assumptions including terminal value assumptions et cetera and i think we re just going to keep doing things that way conservatively rich kinder again we re living within our means so to speak and so we anticipate our capex expenditures will stay in the range we ve previously gone over with you namely in the 2 range operator our next question is from colton bean with tph your line is open colton bean good afternoon just to switch over to crude side of this i just wanted to touch on the kmcc and gray oak jvs given the varying diameters there between the halene lateral and then chunk lines houston do you have a plan for specifically where that interconnect would be steve kean yes thatâ s going to be really at the station colton bean into the 30 okay and so in terms of thinking about ultimate capacity there i mean is it right to think about if are tying a 30 inch pipe into the 30 inch kmcc thatâ s ultimately you could match capacities steve kean possibly could but right now the expansion project where we barrels a day colton bean okay and with the main consideration just the incremental horsepower steve kean yes thatâ s right colton bean perfect i guess just as a segue on that would there be any consideration here in terms of double eagle and maybe looping double eagle to give you ultimately if you went through with that 30 inch connection maybe you could get more barrels up from corpus as well and have a little bit of bidirectional header there steve kean double eagle was a joint venture so weâ d have to kind of explore it with our joint venture partner colton bean understood i guess just a quick one on the haynesville i do think you guys have called out pretty strong volume growth there with the reduction in counterparty rig count there just to execute two has that outlook shifted at all for the back half of 2019 or statuesque steve kean we are still seeing very strong volumes there we have had the benefit of being able to ramp up without substantial additional capital investment we re probably going to have to invest some capital to debottleneck that system further to accommodate what we see as continued growth in that area but still very very attractive return projects but our volumes remains strong operator our next question is from tristan richardson with suntrust your line is open tristan richardson hey good afternoon just thinking would love to hear your views on strategic opportunities and priorities for capital looking forward i think with gcx and php rolling off over the next 18 months and combined with the dividend growth next year at your planned rate both of those combined to suggest that there is a real opportunity for free cash flow in the out years and again just thinking about priorities and what that could be used for steve kean yes we will continue to obviously the first priority is maintain the balance sheet at the investment grade level weâ ve gotten there weâ ll make sure that we stay there and we ve laid out our dividend plan and we will adhere to that and then in terms of the free cash flow thatâ s available from there we will put it towards the highest return use for our shareholders we think when we look ahead in our shadow backlog and other things that are on the horizon as rich said we think the 2 billion to 3 billion range is probably thatâ s been the range for quite a while we think that s a reasonable range of opportunities for us as we build off of our network but to the extent that those opportunities are not there we always have the option to buy back shares tristan richardson helpful thank you guys very much operator our next question is from keith stanley with wolfe research your line is now open keith stanley hi good afternoon i just wanted to talk you got your ferc approval recently on the gulf lng export project just any update on commercial discussions there and potential timeline and viability of the project steve kean not really and i would say it so itâ s quite a ways off you re right we did we had applied for and we did receive our ferc approval on that asset thatâ s a nice step but there is nothing eminent there keith stanley thank you operator our next question is from christine cho with barclays your line is open christine cho good evening i wanted to actually maybe start on permian highway with just all of the challenges with right of way permitting can we get an update on how thatâ s tracking relative to budget rich kinder we re still on schedule so the piece of this pipeline is going through the hill country which we knew was going to be a challenge and so we allowed for extra time in the acquisition of right of way and we had a good victory and expected victory but we had a good victory in the attempt to challenge the project and our use of imminent domain and our discussions with landowners in the area are continuing and i think continuing at a decent pace so we expect that with the extra time that we allowed to get through this process that we will on schedule christine cho what about on the cost side rich kinder on the cost side we still look very good we expect to be on budget as well christine cho okay and then with the philadelphia refinery closing down would just be curious as to your thoughts on how we should think about the impact for your products pipeline in your new york harbor business if any rich kinder go ahead john john schlosser we think it will be positive in the long run because we expect to see more imports coming in in new york harbor it will have a momentary short term impact we do have 210 000 to be exact barrels with them in new york right now but we expect to be able to release that they do supply are important three but we expect the additional volumes off the quality there so maybe have an impact for the next month or so negative and in the long run we think it ll be positive for us coming into new york christine cho and then just last one for me quick one for the kmcc project what s the cost of that project i m guessing it s not that much because it s just pumps but the term of the contracts and should we think that the benefit will offset the re contracting headwinds that you talked about in recent quarters david michels yes so the initial cost of the project right now we re going to spend about 10 million this year and so with that we ll be able to get 100 million i m sorry 100 000 barrels a day in and get some initial agreements that really kick us off at 75 000 steve kean and for the term of up to three years on the term and it ll be a partial offset but not a complete offset the real objective here is we wanted to find a way to get permian barrels into kmcc and that s what this interconnect accomplishes operator our next question is from dennis coleman with bank of america merrill lynch your line is open dennis coleman hi everyone thank you i want to go back to the permian pass project if i can you talked a little bit about this being mostly it sounds like a producer push project but given where you talked about the target or the target area you deliver a lot of gas already there for lng wonder if there is sort of lng pull demand and if it relies on any particular projects above and beyond what s happened or been announced steve kean i mean clearly it s serving the lng projects are going forward on the side of texas east gulf coast of texas golden pass where we won potential customer port arthur lng and other that is not fid just pretty promising but there s also connectivity back into our intrastate network proportion of this volume so we would expect that volume to go and serve industrial customers on the side of our system then we will be crossing several interstate pipelines farther east and so that will also be an alternative market dennis coleman okay and then maybe just if you can give a couple quick comments on how you think about returns versus the two projects that you ve already have under development just it s becoming harder and harder to build these pipelines i think we can we can all agree on that we just talked about some of the issues with permian highway is there as a time where you as a pipeline developer are able to capture higher return from producers or demand it because of the greater sort of project risk that you face steve kean the returns are in line with what we ve been experiencing on the previous projects and they re good returns we ve got competition so we don t talk about them in specifics but they re good double digit levered after tax returns with long term contracts securing or underpinning those cash flows in terms of and those are pretty good returns i mean and we re glad to be able to get them and we try to manage our project risk to the other part of your question by making sure that we adequately account for what we are seeing in the environment in which we are building these projects and so that factors into how we schedule the permitting process and the right of way acquisitions process it goes into how we select the route goes into all of those things so we think we manage the risk by costing it right scheduling it right and the returns that we re getting compensate us for the risk operator our next question is from michael lapides with goldman sachs your line is open michael lapides hey guys just a question on the gas pipeline business where do you stand or what remains left in terms of the 501 g process for you and does that 100 million number you put out at the analysts day still hold and then how are you thinking about traditional weak and tracking risk for the projects that have negotiated rates kind of back half of this year and going into 2020 steve kean okay so what we talked about on the 501 g which is an exposure that we believe we have behind us are largely behind this we have two remaining pipes with the smaller amounts at issue that we re waiting on final decisions on but with the ones that we ve done it was 50 million for this year growing to 100 million next year for the full year effect of both of those settlements and so as we said we didn t budget they re very hard to predict we didn t budget for them but we were happy to get them because we believe they resolved a longer term risk and a headwind to the company so it s 50 million this year and 100 million next year in terms of your contract roll off question i think where that risk is really concentrated is in our fep fayetteville express pipeline and the ruby pipeline and the time frame there is 2021 2022 michael lapides got it and then a question i noticed the contract with con edison had a little bit of capacity via compression in the northeast obviously it s borderline impossible to get new pipelines built into the northeast how much incremental opportunity do you see to do similar type of projects to help add incremental capacity into the region steve kean okay i think this is the second one so we ve got one our line 261 project in massachusetts that s the first one and then this one and what we re trying to do is find those opportunities where we canâ t get pipelines permitted and we think these are very formidable pipelines where we can get them permitted to build debottlenecking expansions to help our customers for example lift moratoria that they have in place on signing up new customers these are very valuable projects are very much in the public interest and we think that the way we ve been very careful and thoughtful about how we re putting them together because of the permitting risk in the northeast so we ll continue to look for those we ve already had two michael lapides got it thanks steve much appreciate it operator our next question is from becca followill with u s capital advisors your line is open becca followill thank you good afternoon how much of the 800 million delta in the backlog is due to taking out the co2 projects steve kean yes 500 million becca followill and then second on the ferc noi and roe you guys put up some comments here which were very thoughtful any thoughts on timing of the process with the ferc steve kean nothing sort of proprietary they ve gone through a similar kind of macro evaluation like this on the certificates policy and i think we re still waiting to see if there s anything final that s going to come out of that and on this it s a little hard to project exactly i think from the comments that we and others filed i think hope it s apparent to the commission there are a lot of differences in circumstances there s not really a one size fits all i think that they would probably i m guessing that that s what they would come away from looking at the record that s in front of us and i would hope also that they would find there s a pretty clear distinction between the electric side and the natural gas side in terms of the competitive environment that we operate in in the natural gas sector so we made those points other people made those points too i think it s hard to craft from the circumstances that have been laid out a one size fits all policy so we wouldnâ t expect one becca followill thanks operator our next question is from robert kwan with rbc capital markets your line is open robert kwan good afternoon just looking at the kml share buyback first mechanically is there going to be a prorata buyback of the kmi share steve kean no this is the buyback program that applies to the public flow robert kwan okay and then you cited it as an attractive opportunity i m just wondering what types of things and metrics are you looking at is it kind of dcf accretion on an absolute basis or do you also look at the mcib versus potential new projects acquisitions or other growth initiatives steve kean yeah i mean we will certainly be evaluating what other opportunities there are to for that capital we do look at dcf accretion as being kind of the primary thing that we focus our attention on but we don t have anything formulaic here robert we re going to be very opportunistic about the use of the program but we thought that it was good to put in place certainly the board agreed and it was thing to have in place for our kml shareholders and we will did it the right but we use the right time economically for our shareholders robert kwan got it and i guess just that kind of selectively an opportunistic language i assume that the board also examines something larger like a substantial issuer bid but decided technically the mcib is kind of the right thing at this point steve kean i think that s a fair conclusion robert kwan okay that s great thank you operator our next question is from rob catellier with cibc capital markets your line is open robert catellier thank you just answered my question i was curious about the evaluation of a substantial issuer bid thank you steve kean thank you operator our next question is from spiro dounis with capital suisse your line is open spiro dounis hey guys thanks for squeezing me back in just had one follow up so the answer this might be a bit obvious but just given the rapid pace of buying this year still kind of compelled to ask rich can you just comment a little bit on the uptick that youâ re buying so far this year the stock maybe what changed since last year and how you re thinking about valuation at this point just given the nice run up year to date rich kinder i don t really have much to say on that obviously i m a huge believer in the upside opportunities for this company and the kind of dividend policy we have makes it even more attractive so i am interested shareholder and will continue to be spiro dounis fair enough pretty good color operator our next question is from jeremy tonet with jpmorgan your line is open jeremy tonet hi thanks for squeezing in as well just want to come back to elba i think you had touched on it briefly there but i was wondering if you could dive in a little bit more as far as what was causing the issues with the cryogenic temperatures there what do you learn to get that solved is there going to be any issues with subsequent trains and i guess what gives you confidence that everything is good at this point steve kean yes so as i mentioned the issue that we had was making sure that we had a uniformly cold box where we make the lng and we had some mechanical issues associated with having lng at actually too low of a temperature and solidifying it and so we needed to get the top of the box cool uniformly with the bottom and what that required was a slower startup so i would say essentially we were trying to start it too fast and so as we gradually stepped into it and we re making very very good progress now with the uniformly cold box it s about turning it up and weâ re turning it up as we speak and then we have an eight day performance test and then in service i think as we ve gone through this we ve observed where we had issues like with the valve or a seal and those sorts of things and so we re working ahead on the other units to make sure that those are all addressed and so we ve got kind of one final operational issue that we re dealing with and it seems to be our approach to so itâ s working fine and so if that s the case will be up very soon if we have to slow down for a bit to fix a problem it could cause a little bit further delay but the way weâ ve narrowed down the problems now we re confident in its startups that that startup will be soon and that it will be operable once up and running and that the lessons from the startup on the first unit which is the critical unit as weâ ve said commercially for the contract that the lessons that we ve learned from the startup with the first unit are being applied to the remaining unit as i said for including the first one for mechanically complete all of the units are on the elba island and we re going through the assembly and then the commission process as well over the course of this year with maybe a slight maybe one of them drifting into that jeremy tonet that s very helpful thanks and with the eor just wanted to come to that real quick is there more that that could be reduced that pricing and economic just as far as the capex spend there or is there a certain level of kind of base spend where you don t want to fall below because that could lead to kind of a decline curves picking up or anything like that where you not able to maintain production at the levels you want steve kean as always we look at every one of these projects on a return basis so we invest this we can identify the incremental oil that s associated with investing this and at reasonable range of prices that will produce an economic return at our hurdle rate thatâ s higher than our other remaining businesses that s how we do it and so there s not a base level of capital that we feel we have to spend for some operational or other reasons we do it each project on a project by project basis and on a return basis and i think the team there the co2 team has done a really fine job of knowing when capital is not going to be effectively deployed and finding other places to deploy it that provide attractive returns or if we can t find that then we don t spend it and that s the way we re going to proceed we have a lot of discipline i believe around here on the capital that we deploy and the confidence that we have to have in the returns being adequate to our investors and i think the co2 group demonstrates that operator at this time i m showing no further questions rich kinder all right well thank you all very much have a good evening operator thank you for participating in today s conference all lines may disconnect at this time
worsening economic inequality in recent years is largely the result of policy choices that reflect the political influence and lobbying power of the rich there is now a self reinforcing pattern of high profits low investment and rising inequality posing a threat not only to economic growth but also to democracy since reducing inequality became an official goal of the international community income disparities have widened this trend typically blamed on trade liberalization and technological advances that have weakened the bargaining power of labor vis à vis capital has generated a political backlash in many countries with voters blaming their economic plight on others rather than on national policies and such sentiments of course merely aggravate social tensions without addressing the root causes of worsening inequality but in an important new article university of cambridge economist josé gabriel palma argues that national income distributions are the result not of impersonal global forces but rather of policy choices that reflect the control and lobbying power of the rich in particular palma describes the significant recent increase in inequality in oecd countries the former socialist economies of central and eastern europe and china and india as a process of reverse catching up these countries palma says increasingly resemble many unequal latin american economies with rent oriented elites grabbing most of the fruits of growth in his earlier work palma showed how middle and upper middle income groups share of total income has remained remarkably stable in most countries over time at about one half changes in aggregate income distribution therefore resulted largely from changes in the respective shares of the top 10 and the bottom 40 of the population the ratio between these shares is now called the palma ratio in other words the huge variation in inequality across countries and particularly between middle income economies is essentially the outcome of a fight for around one half of national income involving one half of the population only in cases of extreme inequality such as south africa did the top 10 also manage to encroach on the income share of the middle it is misleading therefore to view rising per capita incomes in middle income countries as indicating a general improvement in the standard of living in unequal middle income economies such as those in latin america the incomes of the top 10 are already on par with those of their rich country counterparts the incomes of the bottom 40 are closer to the sub saharan african average the driving force behind these trends is market inequality meaning the income distribution before taxes and government transfers most oecd countries continually attempt to mitigate this through the tax and transfer system resulting in much lower levels of inequality in terms of disposable income but fiscal policy is a complicated and increasingly inefficient way to reduce inequality because today it relies less on progressive taxation and more on transfers that increase public debt for example european union governments spending on social protection health care and education now accounts for two thirds of public expenditure but this is funded by tax policies that let off the rich and big corporations while heavily burdening the middle classes and by adding to the stock of government debt as palma puts it in their new tax status corporations and the very rich now prefer to part pay part lend their taxes and part pay part lend their wages in rich countries middle income groups have largely maintained their share of national income but their living standards have fallen owing to the rising costs of essential goods and services such as housing health care and education falling real pensions regressive taxation and rising personal debt most emerging economy governments meanwhile are not implementing significant fiscal measures to reduce market inequality the dramatic increase in market inequality reflects the ability of the top 10 to extract more value created by others and to profit from existing assets including those that should be public property such as natural resources specifically this increase in value extraction is the result of policies for which the rich have actively lobbied privatization deregulation of share buybacks that artificially inflate stock prices patent laws that make drugs much more expensive reduction or elimination of top marginal tax rates and much else giving the rich all this additional income has not resulted in higher investment rates in the oecd or in unequal middle income countries instead the rich are content to pluck the low hanging fruit of rent extraction market manipulation and lobbying power high profits therefore coexist with low investment and increasing market inequality in a self reinforcing pattern this trend not only magnifies the risk of economic stagnation and market failures political changes around the world suggest that it has also become a profound threat to democracy 1 addressing this dangerous state of affairs will require that governments use their power to tax and regulate to channel more private capital into productive spending and increase the amount of public investment financed by progressive taxation along the lines of a global green new deal if policymakers fail to mount a response that is proportionate to the problem the rich will continue to get richer and the poor to get poorer faster than ever who will address the problem then

lawmakers said in a house hearing wednesday that facebook s plan to enter the world of cryptocurrency and global finance could threaten sovereign currencies or even destabilize governments a day after a similarly critical senate hearing it was the house financial services committee s turn david marcus a facebook executive faced over four hours of questions about facebook s plans for a cryptocurrency called libra as was the case tuesday marcus was dogged by his company s controversial reputation as well as skepticism of the legal uses of cryptocurrencies this is the biggest thing this committee will deal with this decade said rep brad sherman d calif this is a godsend to drug dealers and tax evaders when facebook announced libra in june it said it wanted to create a new global financial system the initiative if successful could put digital wallets in the hands of the more than 2 billion people who use messenger and whatsapp the messaging platforms owned by facebook the antagonism toward facebook s libra effort is part of a broader escalation of criticism of tech giants in washington which was on full display in a series of hearings tuesday even before facebook announced its intentions to move into the financial system the company had battled concerns that it had grown too powerful i think before you move on to libra you ought to clean up the messes of the past rep madeleine dean d pa said at the hearing libra also faces doubts from regulators around the world on wednesday the chief economist of the international monetary fund gita gopinath told reporters that she was concerned that libra could unfairly increase the influence of the dollar in the global economy while also making money laundering easier according to a reuters report while the senate hearing about libra on tuesday focused on the widespread mistrust of facebook house committee members showed more interest in the many practical hurdles that are likely to confront facebook if it wants to release libra next year as it has said it wants to do facebook s plans raise serious privacy trading and monetary policy concerns said rep maxine waters d calif chairwoman of the committee the system will yield immense economic power that could destabilize government waters said she was working on new legislation that would make it illegal for big tech companies to get involved in the financial industry which could stop libra in its tracks marcus the executive overseeing calibra the facebook subsidiary working on the project struck a conciliatory tone for a second day and said facebook was listening to its critics i believe we are owning these mistakes and working to remedy them he said republicans on the committee were more eager to talk about the benefits that might come from libra but they also expressed their concern about facebook s plan quite frankly i don t care for facebook said rep barry loudermilk r ga but i do appreciate anyone who challenges the status quo several republicans asked if facebook could stop people from using libra in the way that it has closed the accounts of controversial political figures like conservative commentator milo yiannopoulos i don t know marcus said emphasizing the basic uncertainties that still face the currency facebook has designed libra so it can be governed by dozens of big corporate partners organized through a swiss nonprofit this is supposed to reduce facebook s power over the currency but it led to questions wednesday about how much power u s regulators would have if governance of the system was not taking place in the united states facebook has said that libra would be backed by several different traditional currencies held in bank accounts house committee members expressed concern that this could expose consumers to the risks of currency fluctuations and might reduce the power of the dollar tell me how libra will not undermine sovereign currencies and central banks or is the very point to undermine central bankers and to provide a greater freedom away from central banking asked rep andy barr r ky marcus argued that libra was not an attempt to take on traditional currencies or the fed i want to be very clear we do not want to compete with the dollar or sovereign currencies marcus said at the hearing but marcus also did not back down on libra s big ambitions we would like for libra to be a digital global currency and to be one unit of digital currency for the whole world 2019 new york times news service
kathy lien managing director of fx strategy for bk asset management daily fx market roundup july 17 2019 the traded lower against all of the major currencies on wednesday as treasury yields resumed their slide the benefitted the most from the decline rising to its strongest level in 3 months which had fallen to a year to date low versus the greenback during the european session recovered steadily into the ny close ending the day in positive territory and dropped more than expected but the sell off in the dollar really didn t begin until the ny equity market open stocks started to fall and along followed the u s dollar the federal reserve s didn t hurt as the fed districts reported a modest expansion with little change from the previous month most of their assessments were positive they said manufacturing was flat but a few districts reported a modest pickup employment growth slowed slightly but their outlook is positive and they expect continued modest growth ahead the problem is the widespread concern created by trade uncertainty this outlook is consistent with the central bank s broader views and did not have a meaningful impact on the greenback instead the dollar took its cues from yields and stocks which should remain the case for the rest of the week thursday s philadelphia fed survey should be stronger given the uptick in activity in the ny region there hasn t been any meaningful progress in u s china trade talks and president trump isn t pleased on tuesday he said there s a long way to go on trade talks before an agreement can be reached and if china isn t serious he could unfreeze the final round of tariffs while china wants the tariffs rolled back it is not clear how far they will bend for this to happen their commerce minister was added to the negotiating team last week and many see an agreement more difficult with his hard line stance according to commerce minister zhong shang the us has started this economic and trade dispute with us in violation of the principles of the world trade organisation a classic example of unilateralism and protectionism we must make the best of the spirit of struggle and stand firm in defending the interests of our country and the people as well as the multilateral trading system and took the news in stride with the latter rising to its strongest level in 3 months but if it becomes more apparent that trade talks turn sour both currencies could suffer in the meantime nzd is outperforming its neighbor thanks to better than expected and higher australian were scheduled for release wednesday night there s a good chance that job growth slowed because according to the pmis employment growth in the and sectors slowed in june is at the cusp of a turn and weak labor market numbers could take it down to 6950 easily the continues to rise despite benign data although declined less than expected in june the 0 2 decrease was still the first drop in inflation this year it drove the rate down to 2 from 2 4 and the details of the report showed a decline in prices and internet services lower inflation is one of the main reasons why the central bank turned dovish this month but none of that seems to matter to the canadian dollar with oil falling for the fifth day in a row it should only be a matter of time before bottoms as it is currently only being pressured lowered by the rebounded on the back of stronger but uk data was mixed stagnated in june leaving the rate unchanged at 2 as noted by our colleague overall inflation readings in uk remain steady providing no impetus for boe to move either way for now the focus in cable remains squarely on politics but after all the harsh rhetoric from torries regarding a hard brexit the markets appear to have settled down with traders now looking to see the next moves from london and brussels once the leadership transition in both places is completed

nobody can know with any degree of certainty whether we are headed soon to a destructive world currency war in which countries compete with to weaken their exchange rates to gain an unfair competitive advantage however what we can be sure about is that there is an increasing cause for concern that we may be sleepwalking toward such an eventuality this is particularly the case at a time that the benefits of globalization are being increasingly questioned it is also the case at a time that the united states is abrogating its leadership role in maintaining an open international economic order a principal reason for concern is that the trump administration s economic policy actions appear to be in serious conflict with its external policy objectives the clear and present danger is that when its external policy objectives are not met the administration might double down on its protectionist america first trade policy and might respond in kind to what it perceives to be chinese and european exchange rate manipulation while the trump administration would like to eliminate the trade deficit and weaken the dollar its pursuit of an expansionary budget policy at this late stage in the economic cycle highly complicates the attainment of those objectives by reducing national savings higher budget deficits are leading to the re emergence of a twin budget deficit and trade deficit problem at the same time the higher u s budget deficit is putting upward pressure on the dollar by forcing the federal reserve to maintain interest rates at a higher level than would otherwise be the case an american first trade policy is also exerting unwanted upward pressure on the u s dollar it is doing so by heightening economic uncertainty abroad which is forcing foreign central banks to loosen their monetary policy stance it is also doing so by unsettling global financial markets thereby increasing the u s dollar s safe haven demand it has to be of concern that both the u s trade deficit and the u s dollar are already moving in the opposite direction than that desired by the trump administration while president trump repeatedly promises to eliminate the u s trade deficit that deficit has increased by around 25 percent since he assumed office at the same time while trump keeps arguing in favor of a weak dollar the dollar has kept increasing in value over the past year further heightening the chances of a world currency war is the very real risk that boris johnson who will soon become the united kingdom s prime minister might carry through on his threat to have the united kingdom crash out of europe on october 31 without a deal were that to occur the pound would almost certainly suffer a sharp depreciation that in turn must be expected to drag down the euro and in the process further heighten economic tensions between europe and the united states a more serious though less imminent risk for world currency stability would be a recurrence of the italian sovereign debt crisis in the context of a weakening european economy being 10 times the size of the greek economy and having a public debt 10 times that of greece italy would put considerable strain on the european banking system it would also pose an existential threat to the euro that would almost certainly propel the u s dollar higher needless to add it does not help matters that the united states now views china more as a strategic rival rather than as a trustworthy economic partner that is inducing the united states to intensify trade restrictions on china which leaves chinese policymakers little alternative but to resort to monetary policy easing and currency weakness to support their flagging economy that in turn only reinforces the u s perception that china is resorting to currency manipulation to obtain an unfair competitive advantage with all of these risks to the global economic order there has seldom been as much need as there is today for responsible u s international economic leadership to prevent a destructive currency war however on the basis of the trump administration s international economic policies to date i am not holding my breath for that to happen

an article from reuters discussing the position of the international monetary fund imf is interesting essentially the imf is warning that global economies will contract by 455 billion next year due to the ongoing trade conflict between the u s china the eu and to a lesser extent japan yes alice there are hundreds of billions at stake there s really no reason to doubt the amount estimated though i think it s on the short side but the yearly value seems in line i have no doubt president trump will cost the global economy 455 billion because that money will be transferring back to the america first economy that s what happens as maganomics reverses the imf trade wealth distribution model the imf is correct in part the effect incorrect in part the cause and mostly hypocritical the euro minded imf rails against the high value of the u s dollar but simultaneously ignores the motives behind the intentional devaluation of currencies that are pegged against the dollar washington reuters the international monetary fund said on wednesday the u s dollar was overvalued by 6 to 12 based on near term economic fundamentals while the euro the japanese yen and china s yuan were seen as broadly in line with fundamentals the imf has been at odds with u s president donald trump over his use of tariffs to resolve trade imbalances but its assessment that the dollar is overvalued is likely to give trump more fodder for his frequent complaints that dollar strength is hampering u s exports trump has railed against european and chinese policies that lead to what he calls a devaluation of the euro and other currencies against the dollar the fund which has warned that the u s china trade war could cost the global economy about 455 billion next year said recent trade policy actions were weighing on global trade flows eroding confidence and disrupting investment but they had done nothing to reverse external imbalances thus far read more china and the eu have devalued their currency in an effort to block the impacts from president trump and the america first trade policy because those currencies are pegged against the dollar the resulting effect is a rising dollar value in essence the globalist imf is now blaming president trump for having a strong economy that forces international competition to devalue their currency that s the stupid hypocrisy of global banking outlooks they make a decision to devalue their currency which causes the dollar value to rise and then turn around and blame the u s dollar for being overvalued the root cause of the devaluation is unaddressed in their argument the eu and china are trying to retain their global manufacturing position and offset the impact of president trump s tariffs by lowering the end value of their exports in the bigger picture this is why president trump is the most transformative economic president in the last 75 years the post wwii marshall plan was set up to allow europe and asia to place tariffs on exported american industrial products those tariffs were used by the eu and japan to rebuild their infrastructure after a devastating war however there was never a built in mechanism to end the tariffs until president trump came along and said it s over after about 20 years say 1970 to be fair the eu and japan received enough money to rebuild but instead of ending the one way payment system asia and the eu sought to keep going and build their economies larger than the u s additionally the u s was carrying the cost of protecting the eu via nato and japan with our military the eu and japan didn t need to spend a dime on defense because the u s essentially took over that role but that military role just like the tariffs never ended again until trump the u s economy was the host for around 50 years of parasitic wealth exfiltration or as most would say distribution president trump is the first and only president who said enough and prior politicians who didn t stop the process were stupid etc etc obviously he is 100 correct for the past 30 years the u s was a sucker to keep letting the process remain in place while we lost our manufacturing base to overseas incentives the investment process from wall street removal of glass stegal only made the process much more severe and faster wall street was now investing in companies whose best bet higher profit return was to pour money overseas this process created the rust belt and damn near destroyed the aggregate manufacturing industry fast forward to 2017 through today and president trump is now engaged in a massive and multidimensional effort to re balance the entire global wealth dynamic by putting tariffs on foreign imports he has counterbalanced the never ending marshal plan trade program and demanded renegotiation s trump s goal is reciprocity however the eu and asia specifically china don t want to give up a decades long multi generational advantage this is part of the fight one could argue that china s rise happened inside this period and as a consequence they have no comprehension of an economic history without the institutional advantages they ve never competed with the u s under any terms of equivelence or fairness they ve only ever known the advantages combine that with the chinese communist mindset and you get the extreme severity of their position so yeah there s going to be pain for them massive economic pain as the process of reestablishing a fair trading system is rebuilt this dynamic is the essence of reciprocity that benefits main street usa unfortunately putting america first is now also against the interests of the multinationals on wall street so president trump has to fight adverse economic opponents on multiple fronts and their purchased mercenary army we know as dc politicians no one ever could take on all these interests think about it the eu asia world bank international monetary fund china russia u s chamber of commerce iran u s congress democrats u s senate wall street the big club lobbyists hollywood corporate media foreign and domestic and the ankle biters in never trump all of these financial interests are aligned against main street usa and against president trump name one individual who could take them on simultaneously and still be winning bigly they say he s one man they say they have him outnumbered yet somehow as unreal as it seems he s the one who appears to have them surrounded incredible lord knows we can t spare this man he fights
picture depositphotos com maxxyustas but in an important new article university of cambridge economist josé gabriel palma argues that national income distributions are the result not of impersonal global forces but rather of policy choices that reflect the control and lobbying power of the rich in particular palma describes the significant recent increase in inequality in oecd countries the former socialist economies of central and eastern europe and china and india as a process of reverse catching up these countries palma says increasingly resemble many unequal latin american economies with rent oriented elites grabbing most of the fruits of growth in his earlier work palma showed how middle and upper middle income groups share of total income has remained remarkably stable in most countries over time at about one half changes in aggregate income distribution therefore resulted largely from changes in the respective shares of the top 10 and the bottom 40 of the population the ratio between these shares is now called the palma ratio in other words the huge variation in inequality across countries and particularly between middle income economies is essentially the outcome of a fight for around one half of national income involving one half of the population only in cases of extreme inequality such as south africa did the top 10 also manage to encroach on the income share of the middle it is misleading therefore to view rising per capita incomes in middle income countries as indicating a general improvement in standard of living in unequal middle income economies such as those in latin america the incomes of the top 10 are already on par with those of their rich country counterparts the incomes of the bottom 40 are closer to the sub saharan african average the driving force behind these trends is market inequality meaning the income distribution before taxes and government transfers most oecd countries continually attempt to mitigate this through the tax and transfer system resulting in much lower levels of inequality in terms of disposable income but fiscal policy is a complicated and increasingly inefficient way to reduce inequality because today it relies less on progressive taxation and more on transfers that increase public debt for example european union governments spending on social protection health care and education now accounts for two thirds of public expenditure but this is funded by tax policies that let off the rich and big corporations while heavily burdening the middle classes and by adding to the stock of government debt as palma puts it in their new tax status corporations and the very rich now prefer to part pay part lend their taxes and part pay part lend their wages in rich countries middle income groups have largely maintained their share of national income but their living standards have fallen owing to the rising costs of essential goods and services such as housing health care and education falling real pensions regressive taxation and rising personal debt most emerging economy governments meanwhile are not implementing significant fiscal measures to reduce market inequality the dramatic increase in market inequality reflects the ability of the top 10 to extract more value created by others and to profit from existing assets including those that should be public property such as natural resources specifically this increase in value extraction is the result of policies for which the rich have actively lobbied privatization deregulation of share buybacks that artificially inflate stock prices patent laws that make drugs much more expensive reduction or elimination of top marginal tax rates and much else giving the rich all this additional income has not resulted in higher investment rates in the oecd or in unequal middle income countries instead the rich are content to pluck the low hanging fruit of rent extraction market manipulation and lobbying power high profits therefore coexist with low investment and increasing market inequality in a self reinforcing pattern this trend not only magnifies the risk of economic stagnation and market failures political changes around the world suggest that it has also become a profound threat to democracy addressing this dangerous state of affairs will require that governments use their power to tax and regulate to channel more private capital into productive spending and increase the amount of public investment financed by progressive taxation along the lines of a global green new deal if policymakers fail to mount a response that is proportionate to the problem the rich will continue to get richer and the poor to get poorer faster than ever who will address the problem then project syndicate 1995 2019

estimated effective tax rate to the pretax amount unless the nature of the item and or the tax jurisdiction in which the item has been recorded requires application of a specific tax rate or tax treatment in which case the tax effect of such item is estimated by applying such specific tax rate or tax treatment the mcps dividends are not tax deductible and therefore the tax effect of the adjustments does not include any tax impact of the mcps dividends h discrete tax adjustments and other tax related adjustments for the three month period ended june 28 2019 includes the impact of net discrete tax gains of 15 million or 0 02 per diluted share discrete tax adjustments and other tax related adjustments for the six month period ended june 28 2019 includes the impact of net discrete tax charges of 227 million or 0 31 per diluted share the discrete tax matters relate primarily to changes in estimates associated with prior period uncertain tax positions and audit settlements net of the release of valuation allowances associated with certain foreign tax credits and tax benefits resulting from a change in law and excess tax benefits from stock based compensation realized in the three month and six month periods ended june 28 2019 in excess of anticipated levels the company anticipates excess tax benefits from stock compensation of approximately 7 million per quarter and therefore excludes benefits in excess of this amount in the calculation of adjusted diluted net earnings per share i in march 2019 the company issued 1 65 billion in aggregate liquidation preference of our 4 75 mcps dividends on the mcps are payable on a cumulative basis at an annual rate of 4 75 on the liquidation preference of 1 000 per share unless earlier converted each share of mcps will automatically convert on april 15 2022 into between 6 6373 and 8 1306 shares of danaher s common stock subject to further anti dilution adjustments the number of shares of danaher s common stock issuable on conversion of the mcps will be determined based on the vwap per share of our common stock over the 20 consecutive trading day period beginning on and including the 21st scheduled trading day immediately before april 15 2022 for the purposes of calculating adjusted earnings per share the company has excluded the anticipated mcps dividends and assumed the if converted method of share dilution the incremental shares of common stock deemed outstanding applying the if converted method of calculating share dilution are referred to as the converted shares the company believes that using the if converted method provides additional insight to investors on the anticipated impact of the mcps once they are converted into common stock no later than april 15 2022 statement regarding non gaap measures each of the non gaap measures set forth above should be considered in addition to and not as a replacement for or superior to the comparable gaap measure and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies management believes that these measures provide useful information to investors by offering additional ways of viewing danaher corporation s danaher or the company results that when reconciled to the corresponding gaap measure help our investors to with respect to adjusted diluted net earnings per share understand the long term profitability trends of our business and compare our profitability to prior and future periods and to our peers with respect to core revenue identify underlying growth trends in our business and compare our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers and with respect to free cash flow the fcf measure understand danaher s ability to generate cash without external financings strengthen its balance sheet invest in its business and grow its business through acquisitions and other strategic opportunities although a limitation of free cash flow is that it does not take into account the company s debt service requirements and other non discretionary expenditures and as a result the entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures management uses these non gaap measures to measure the company s operating and financial performance and uses core revenue and non gaap measures similar to adjusted diluted net earnings per share and the fcf measure in the company s executive compensation program the items excluded from the non gaap measures set forth above have been excluded for the following reasons with respect to adjusted diluted net earnings per share we exclude the amortization of acquisition related intangible assets because the amount and timing of such charges are significantly impacted by the timing size number and nature of the acquisitions we consummate while we have a history of significant acquisition activity we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle and the amount of an acquisition s purchase price allocated to intangible assets and related amortization term are unique to each acquisition and can vary significantly from acquisition to acquisition exclusion of this amortization expense facilitates more consistent comparisons of operating results over time between our newly acquired and long held businesses and with both acquisitive and non acquisitive peer companies we believe however that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets contribute to revenue generation and that intangible asset amortization related to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized we exclude costs incurred pursuant to discrete restructuring plans that are fundamentally different in terms of the size strategic nature and planning requirements as well as the inconsistent frequency of such plans from the ongoing productivity improvements that result from application of the danaher business system because these restructuring plans are incremental to the core activities that arise in the ordinary course of our business and we believe are not indicative of danaher s ongoing operating costs in a given period we exclude these costs from the calculation of adjusted diluted net earnings per share to facilitate a more consistent comparison of operating results over time with respect to the other items excluded from adjusted diluted net earnings per share we exclude these items because they are of a nature and or size that occur with inconsistent frequency occur for reasons that may be unrelated to danaher s commercial performance during the period and or we believe that such items may obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long term performance difficult for example the first quarter 2019 legal contingency charges excluded from adjusted earnings per share were excluded because legal contingencies of this nature and amount are atypical for our businesses infrequent and not representative of a trend in our underlying business with respect to core revenue 1 we exclude the impact of currency translation because it is not under management s control is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends and 2 we exclude the effect of acquisitions and divested product lines because the timing size number and nature of such transactions can vary significantly from period to period and between us and our peers which we believe may obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long term performance difficult with respect to the fcf measure we exclude payments for additions to property plant and equipment net of the proceeds from capital disposals to demonstrate the amount of operating cash flow for the period that remains after accounting for the company s capital expenditure requirements view original content source danaher corporation

effect of such item is estimated by applying such specific tax rate or tax treatment the mcps dividends are not tax deductible and therefore the tax effect of the adjustments does not include any tax impact of the mcps dividends h discrete tax adjustments and other tax related adjustments for the three month period ended june 28 2019 includes the impact of net discrete tax gains of 15 million or 0 02 per diluted share discrete tax adjustments and other tax related adjustments for the six month period ended june 28 2019 includes the impact of net discrete tax charges of 227 million or 0 31 per diluted share the discrete tax matters relate primarily to changes in estimates associated with prior period uncertain tax positions and audit settlements net of the release of valuation allowances associated with certain foreign tax credits and tax benefits resulting from a change in law and excess tax benefits from stock based compensation realized in the three month and six month periods ended june 28 2019 in excess of anticipated levels the company anticipates excess tax benefits from stock compensation of approximately 7 million per quarter and therefore excludes benefits in excess of this amount in the calculation of adjusted diluted net earnings per share i in march 2019 the company issued 1 65 billion in aggregate liquidation preference of our 4 75 mcps dividends on the mcps are payable on a cumulative basis at an annual rate of 4 75 on the liquidation preference of 1 000 per share unless earlier converted each share of mcps will automatically convert on april 15 2022 into between 6 6373 and 8 1306 shares of danaher s common stock subject to further anti dilution adjustments the number of shares of danaher s common stock issuable on conversion of the mcps will be determined based on the vwap per share of our common stock over the 20 consecutive trading day period beginning on and including the 21st scheduled trading day immediately before april 15 2022 for the purposes of calculating adjusted earnings per share the company has excluded the anticipated mcps dividends and assumed the if converted method of share dilution the incremental shares of common stock deemed outstanding applying the if converted method of calculating share dilution are referred to as the converted shares the company believes that using the if converted method provides additional insight to investors on the anticipated impact of the mcps once they are converted into common stock no later than april 15 2022 statement regarding non gaap measures each of the non gaap measures set forth above should be considered in addition to and not as a replacement for or superior to the comparable gaap measure and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies management believes that these measures provide useful information to investors by offering additional ways of viewing danaher corporation s danaher or the company results that when reconciled to the corresponding gaap measure help our investors to with respect to adjusted diluted net earnings per share understand the long term profitability trends of our business and compare our profitability to prior and future periods and to our peers with respect to core revenue identify underlying growth trends in our business and compare our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers and with respect to free cash flow the fcf measure understand danaher s ability to generate cash without external financings strengthen its balance sheet invest in its business and grow its business through acquisitions and other strategic opportunities although a limitation of free cash flow is that it does not take into account the company s debt service requirements and other non discretionary expenditures and as a result the entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures management uses these non gaap measures to measure the company s operating and financial performance and uses core revenue and non gaap measures similar to adjusted diluted net earnings per share and the fcf measure in the company s executive compensation program the items excluded from the non gaap measures set forth above have been excluded for the following reasons with respect to adjusted diluted net earnings per share we exclude the amortization of acquisition related intangible assets because the amount and timing of such charges are significantly impacted by the timing size number and nature of the acquisitions we consummate while we have a history of significant acquisition activity we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle and the amount of an acquisition s purchase price allocated to intangible assets and related amortization term are unique to each acquisition and can vary significantly from acquisition to acquisition exclusion of this amortization expense facilitates more consistent comparisons of operating results over time between our newly acquired and long held businesses and with both acquisitive and non acquisitive peer companies we believe however that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets contribute to revenue generation and that intangible asset amortization related to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized we exclude costs incurred pursuant to discrete restructuring plans that are fundamentally different in terms of the size strategic nature and planning requirements as well as the inconsistent frequency of such plans from the ongoing productivity improvements that result from application of the danaher business system because these restructuring plans are incremental to the core activities that arise in the ordinary course of our business and we believe are not indicative of danaher s ongoing operating costs in a given period we exclude these costs from the calculation of adjusted diluted net earnings per share to facilitate a more consistent comparison of operating results over time with respect to the other items excluded from adjusted diluted net earnings per share we exclude these items because they are of a nature and or size that occur with inconsistent frequency occur for reasons that may be unrelated to danaher s commercial performance during the period and or we believe that such items may obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long term performance difficult for example the first quarter 2019 legal contingency charges excluded from adjusted earnings per share were excluded because legal contingencies of this nature and amount are atypical for our businesses infrequent and not representative of a trend in our underlying business with respect to core revenue 1 we exclude the impact of currency translation because it is not under management s control is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends and 2 we exclude the effect of acquisitions and divested product lines because the timing size number and nature of such transactions can vary significantly from period to period and between us and our peers which we believe may obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long term performance difficult with respect to the fcf measure we exclude payments for additions to property plant and equipment net of the proceeds from capital disposals to demonstrate the amount of operating cash flow for the period that remains after accounting for the company s capital expenditure requirements source danaher corporation related links
reserve bank of australia board members agreed back to back cash rate cuts were necessary to eat into spare labour market capacity but a high participation rate and an expanding working age population means it will take some time to achieve the ideal jobless rate minutes from the rba s july 2 meeting show members agreed a consecutive 25 basis point cut to a record low 1 0 per cent would help deliver a lower exchange rate and reduce interest payments on borrowing this members agreed would hopefully free up more cash for households and businesses and stimulate the economy but economists noted the central bank had inserted some conditionality into its outlook pointing out that the board will continue to monitor developments in the labour market closely and adjust monetary policy if needed markets have already priced in a rate cut to 0 75 per cent by the end of the year with some forecasting a reduction to 0 5 per cent by mid 2020 notably while board members agreed the global outlook remained reasonable in july they refrained from using that term to describe the local economy following another month of mixed economic data underwhelming retail figures and continued wage stagnation weighed against improved business and consumer sentiment over the preceding month while the may unemployment rate remained stubborn at 5 2 per cent the minutes released on tuesday also showed most of the strength in labour demand over preceding months had been met by an increase in participation which had risen to a record high level rather than a decline in the unemployment rate although there had been a modest pick up in wages growth in the private sector wages growth had remained low overall in combination these factors suggested that spare capacity was likely to remain in the labour market for some time the minutes read the central bank is targeting an unemployment rate of 4 5 per cent and has already called on the federal government to play its role in achieving this rba members said this month they would continue to monitor the jobs market as it mulls the timing of any further cuts having already flagged another move before christmas rbc capital markets australia economist su lin ong said the minutes reaffirmed the rba s easing bias but also appeared hopeful that both rate cuts and fiscal stimulus would lend support and help deliver stronger growth and incomes to eventually lift inflation growth and employment will need to be much stronger for a sustained period to absorb this slack and eventually lift inflation ms ong said and the risk is that further monetary and fiscal stimulus will be needed to achieve this rba members said they were no longer worried low rates will prompt an unwelcome material pick up in borrowing by households that would add to medium term risks in the economy but it did note the impact a cut would have on savings rates many older australians rely on interest income which would decline with lower interest rates the minutes read but the overall net effect of lower interest rates was nevertheless expected to boost aggregate household disposable income and thus spending capacity members also noted that the federal government s low and middle income tax offset would boost household disposable income and could support household consumption in the second half of 2019 a significant change in the anticipated path of monetary policy around the world was also touched upon particularly an expected easing in the united states both the trade related downside risks to global growth and ongoing subdued inflation had spurred an increased expectation that major central banks would ease monetary policy the rba s minutes read this had reinforced already very accommodative conditions in global financial markets jp morgan australia economist sally auld said ultimately more easing will be needed from the rba given the magnitude of the task at hand

good morning everyone we are very pleased with our strong second quarter performance we delivered 5 5 core revenue growth with continued investments in innovation and commercial initiatives contributing to share gains across many of our businesses this marks the seventh straight quarter of 5 or better core growth which combined with solid operating margin expansion and strong free cash flow is a testament to our team s focused execution and the power of the danaher business system we also continue to make progress on our anticipated acquisition of ge biopharma and the planned ipo of our dental business as both transactions remain on track relative to our previously communicated expectations as we move into the second half of 2019 we re excited about these important portfolio moves and the opportunities that lie ahead for danaher so now let s turn to our second quarter results sales grew 3 5 to 5 2 billion with core revenue growth of 5 5 acquisitions increased revenues by 1 while the impact of foreign currency translation decreased revenues by 3 geographically high growth markets grew high single digits led by double digit growth in india and approximately 10 growth in china we saw mid single digit growth across the developed markets with both the us and western europe growing in that range gross margin for the first quarter was 55 8 and operating profit margin was 17 1 down 30 basis points year over year however core operating margin increased 15 basis points despite a meaningful foreign currency headwind from a stronger us dollar year on year we generated 1 billion of free cash flow in the second quarter resulting in double digit growth year on year and a free cash flow to net income conversion ratio of 137 so now let s take a more detailed look at our second quarter results across the portfolio in life sciences reported revenue increased 6 5 with 7 5 core revenue growth this is the fifth consecutive quarter of high single digit or better core revenue growth in the segment reported operating profit margin was up 190 basis points to 20 1 with core operating margins increasing 170 basis points this terrific margin performance was a result of the team s outstanding dbs driven execution across the segment beckman life sciences core revenue growth was up high single digits as performance was led by double digit growth in both flow cytometry and particle counting and characterization the strength in particle counting was led by the vi cell product line which is primarily used to analyze cell viability in biopharmaceutical applications in addition beckman closed the bolt on acquisition of cytobank a software solution that pairs with our flow cytometry platform to help biopharma and clinical research customers analyze complex datasets more quickly and efficiently core revenue at sciex grew at a mid single digit rate good results across the pharmaceutical and applied end markets were partially offset by the continued impact of a tough comparison in our north american clinical business we ve made significant investments to improve the cadence of innovation at sciex since we acquired the business nearly 10 years ago the team highlighted several new products last month at asms including echo ms a non contact liquid handling solution with very high analytical throughput this first of its kind technology enables mass spectrometry s rich data generation to be used in new applications within the drug development workflow helping customers in their pursuit of breakthrough disease treatments at pall high single digit core revenue growth was driven by broad based strength across most major geographies and end markets pall industrial was up mid single digits with strong results in our aerospace and process and industrial businesses this was partially offset by microelectronics which declined due to a tough prior year comparison and softer end markets double digit growth in pall life sciences was led by our biotech business where we saw broad based demand across product lines an important highlight during the quarter with the us fda s approval of a pediatric gene therapy which is manufactured using pall s icellis bioreactor zolgensma is the first gene therapy to treat spinal muscular atrophy or sma in children under the age of two sma is the number one genetic cause of death for infants and pall is proud to contribute to the breakthrough treatment for this devastating disease second quarter marked the one year anniversary of our acquisition of idt and we couldn t be happier with the progress the team has made so far idt delivered another quarter of double digit core revenue growth driven by broad based strength across all major product lines and geographies moving now to diagnostics reported revenue was up 4 5 with core revenue growth of 7 5 reported operating margin was 17 5 with reported and core margins down 20 basis points this decline is predominantly attributable to the impact of foreign currency headwinds related to the stronger us dollar and tariff related costs at beckman diagnostics mid single digit core revenue growth was driven by high growth markets particularly china by product line immunoassay and automation led the way momentum from recent product launches is benefiting beckman in a number of key product areas enhancing the business competitive position and accelerating its growth trajectory we are particularly encouraged by ongoing improvements in our hematology business where we continue to see strong global demand for our new dxh 900 high volume analyzer radiometer achieved high single digit core revenue growth with strength across the developed markets and china our blood gas and aqt product lines both performed well with key competitive wins contributing to market share gains leica biosystems core revenue was up mid single digits good results across advanced staining and core histology were driven by demand for recently introduced products and we believe lbs continued to take share relative to the market finally at cepheid core revenue was up more than 20 on continued momentum in north america and strong results across high growth markets cepheid s embrace of dbs growth tools and processes like transformative marketing and funnel management has enabled the team to make meaningful progress penetrating new accounts were particular success at integrated delivery networks in north america turning to our dental segment reported revenue declined 3 and core revenue was down 50 basis points reported operating profit margin declined to 11 2 with core and reported margins down 310 basis points this decline primarily reflects the impact of lower volume foreign exchange rate movements and ongoing investment spend focused on new product development low single digit declines in our traditional consumables and equipment business were partially offset by low single digit core growth in our specialty businesses geographically double digit growth in china was more than offset by continued softness in western europe and latin america as part of our expansion into clear aligners our orthodontics business ormco highlighted spark at the american association of orthodontists trade show in may spark is made using trugen a proprietary material with exceptional flexibility and clarity which provides a highly aesthetic and comfortable aligner capable of treating complex cases following a successful initial launch in australia we are previewing spark with a group of leading orthodontists in the us as part of our targeted expansion and expect to build on this good early traction going forward we continue to make good progress toward the intended ipo of our dental business we recently announced the new company s name envista and have identified its key senior leaders and future operating structure we remain on track to establish envista as a separate publicly traded company in the second half of this year moving to our environmental applied solutions segment reported revenue increased 2 and core revenue was up 4 reported operating margin increased 40 basis points to 23 4 with 45 basis points of core margin expansion in product identification core revenue increased at a low single digit rate videojet s core revenue was up low single digits versus a high single digit prior year comparison results were led by growth in western europe and high growth markets with solid underlying end market demand worldwide in our packaging business which includes esko and x rite we were encouraged by better sequential performance and ongoing improvements in order trends a few weeks ago esko hosted more than 200 customers at the eskoworld user group meeting in nashville the event brings together brand owners and suppliers from across the packaging workflow to showcase esko s solutions and provides a unique forum for esko to gather industry insight to guide impactful product innovation finally turning to water quality core revenue growth for the platform was up mid single digits at trojan double digit core revenue growth was driven by strength across the developed markets and china we saw solid demand in the municipal and industrial end markets and the team sustained its strong customer win rate with good commercial execution and new product differentiation chemtreat delivered high single digit core revenue growth the north american and latin american markets continued to lead the way with strong results in food and beverage commercial facilities and oil and gas lastly at hach core revenue grew at a low single digit rate versus a double digit prior year comparison good performance in north america and western europe benefited from demand across the municipal and industrial end markets this was partially offset by declines in china which was up meaningfully last year as a result of government initiatives around surface water monitoring which generated significant demand for hach s unique offering 2019 marks hach s 20th year as part of danaher making it one of the longest tenured operating companies in our portfolio today and a tremendous example of how we grow businesses and build platforms at danaher through a combination of organic execution and strategic m a with the commitment of dbs and a foundation of continuous improvement hach has evolved from a 130 million business in 1999 to what is now the cornerstone of our 2 5 billion water quality platform during that time the platform has increased gross and operating profit margins by over 1 500 basis points and completed more than 25 acquisitions to augment growth and add adjacencies in water treatment by trojan and chemtreat this combination of organic and inorganic initiatives has helped drive consistent share gains and build sustainable long term value with the platforms return on invested capital now in excess of 20 you get to hear more about the success story at our upcoming water quality investor day in september and we hope that many of you will be able to join us for the event on at hach s headquarters in loveland colorado so to wrap up we feel good about the momentum we generated in the first half of 2019 the remainder of this year will be transformational for danaher with the anticipated ipo of envista and welcoming ge biopharma to our life science platform both incredibly important portfolio moves that we expect to maximize value for our shareholders customers and associates we believe the combination of our differentiated portfolio the danaher team s dbs driven execution and our commitment to build long term value uniquely positions us for strong performance through 2019 and beyond we are initiating third quarter adjusted diluted net eps guidance between 1 12 and 1 15 which assumes core growth of approximately 4 5 we now expect full year 2019 adjusted diluted net eps to be in the range of 4 75 to 4 80 matt gugino vice president of investor relations thanks tom that concludes our formal comments laurie we re now ready for questions questions and answers operator thank you our first question comes from the line of tycho peterson of jpmorgan tycho peterson jpmorgan analyst hey thanks and congrats on another solid quarter tom on the more industrial focused market it doesn t sound like you re flagging any sort of softness or issues there i know you had the tougher videojet comp but you did mention i think better quarter over quarter in order trends in packaging so can you just talk on the outlook for pall industrial product id packaging some of these more industrial focused markets given some of the macro data points thomas p joyce president and chief executive officer sure tycho happy to you know as i think you probably know well we don t have a lot of truly industrial exposure left in the portfolio today call it 10 or less of the overall portfolio so and barely we re perhaps not a great read but i m happy to share with you some of the details behind some of the specific businesses that you asked about in terms of the trends we re seeing broadly defined across these businesses in general they are still pretty solid let s call it low single digit mid single digit growth rates across these businesses that i ll tell you about in a little bit more detail so maybe let s start with say with a portion of hach so hach has some industrial exposure that the industrial side of hach was up mid single digits in the quarter the order trends remain pretty solid across both the us and europe overall hach was low single digits in the second quarter but again that was against that big double digit comp last year that impacted us in china so again just look at the industrial side pretty solid you mentioned pall industrial again another portion that maybe is worth a little bit of a read pall industrial up mid single digits in the quarter so pretty good performance where we saw a little bit of softness was certainly in micro e microelectronics that was expected we clearly have some difficult comps there two years of double digit growth and that market has clearly softened up based on a lot that s going on in terms of the trade dynamics and that market is probably not likely to improve much in the second half of the year but so that s a little bit of a soft spot there but at pall industrial that was more than offset by our aerospace business and what we call ftap which is fluid technologies and asset protection both aerospace and ftap were up double digits in the quarter so again put that altogether mid single digit growth at pall industrial pretty solid vj you mentioned vj again a little bit of exposure there at vj that was up again depending on the sub segment low single digit to mid single digit pretty small numbers at vj but again the order trends were pretty solid and vj s overall comp was although low single digits in the quarter was against the high single digit prior year so net net we keep a very close eye on what s going on in these sub markets we do think they can be indicative of maybe some broader trends but our order trends remain pretty steady and again we don t have a ton of exposure but happy to keep bringing those indicators forward for everybody sort of broader sense of the macro tycho peterson jpmorgan analyst that s helpful and maybe similar line of question on china i mean you had 10 growth double digit in dental you re under indexed to maybe food and four plus seven generic headwinds but as we think about the back half of the year and the china picture any reason that that couldn t continue at double digit levels for you guys thomas p joyce president and chief executive officer yeah thanks we feel very good about where we are in china obviously that starts with the nature of our platform positions there when you think about life sciences diagnostics water quality the concerns around the environment certainly even our dental business which continues to be really well positioned there and growing strongly starting in the broad sense of the platform position we love where those businesses and how that platform is positioned for the secular growth drivers in china and despite the headlines which clearly indicate that there is some slowing in china we continue to see pretty good underlying conditions and i think just to go through a few of the specifics diagnostics was very strong we re talking mid teens kind of growth there especially at cepheid which is again off a small base but continue to grow nicely beckman doing well there another strong quarter at life sciences up high single digits and of course dental demand continuing a double digit growth so good performance there product id again a smaller position in china but pretty solid mid single digit growth but as i mentioned there is again probably a couple of more puts and takes there in china than we might normally have seen water quality being one of those against this federal mandate that existed last year around service monitoring so that s a little bit of an impact and again what i mentioned about micro e down and even our even that ftf ph business is probably a touch lighter so a few little pockets there but again if we step back broadly i think we re in good shape there as we look forward i think we ll continue to see mid single digit to high single digit growth in q3 but again that s only because of really this tougher comp where we had high teens growth in q3 of 18 largely driven by the water quality business so we don t really see a meaningful slowdown in our businesses at this point but clearly given the headlines and the data that s been put out more recently the ongoing trade tensions where we re watching these businesses very very closely and we ll continue to update as we see things tycho peterson jpmorgan analyst okay and then just one last clarification you got guidance for dental margins to be flat i know they re down 300 basis points how much of that was incremental investment and how should we think about dental margins for 3q and 4q thomas p joyce president and chief executive officer we re clearly continuing to invest around new products in that business but the lower volumes i think are meaningful here tycho it s certainly the investment is a function there and that we think it s important to set this business up effectively for the growth to come and you ve seen us lift r d spending by 100 basis points over the last couple of years and so that portion of it we think is really essential to the future growth trajectory of the business but the volume trend is really what we need to get those new product innovations to begin to turn along with some some just tailwind in that market i think as we see that volume come back a bit that s going to be the incremental jump that we re going to need in terms of the omx so i think it s really a combination of those things that we d be looking for certainly as we turn the corner into next year i think as we look at the balance of this year we re going to continue to drive some of those investments we re still going to have some challenges in terms of the overall growth in this market but i think we remain very very bullish about the prospects for this business to improve both the growth trajectory and the operating margins as we head into 2020 and beyond matt gugino vice president of investor relations yeah tycho it s matt i mean some of the some of the volume there too is on if you think about specialty in the quarter was kind of low single digits that typically in some of our better margin business and so i think from a mixed perspective like tom said that lower volume and kind of where it happened here in the quarter was a big piece of it tycho peterson jpmorgan analyst okay thank you thomas p joyce president and chief executive officer thanks tycho operator your next question comes from the line of ross muken of evercore isi thomas p joyce president and chief executive officer good morning ross ross muken evercore isi analyst good morning guys congrats so maybe i just want to go back to diagnostics i mean it felt like cepheid it s probably north of 20 in the quarter i mean obviously q1 you had you had some tough flu comps so i guess that s a pretty remarkable growth where it feels even above sort of trailing 12 months level so i guess help us understand whether it s sort of new product or some of the genexpert or just placements or new menu like or geographic where is that upside sort of coming from and we sort of at that sort of key stages of the dbs flywheel sort of getting this business kind of churning at the rate it may be should get too thomas p joyce president and chief executive officer sure thanks ross your termed the flywheel is one where we love a lot and obviously from that standpoint of turning to flywheel i would say it s still early days at cepheid and yet we ve begun to turn that flywheel at a pretty good rate but there is still opportunities to continue to enhance that the rpms if you will so let me take you through a few of the details as i mentioned in the prepared remarks we were up north of 20 in the second quarter and some of that continues to come from our what we call our hbdc market or high burden developing country growth but if you even backed out of the high burden developing countries where we continue to see good growth cepheid continued to be up mid teens in many of the core areas and core assays so that growth continues to be really broad based infectious disease led the way flu rsv strep all strong sexual health also very good the flu season and normally by the time we get into july here we re not usually talking about flu but just to go back a second it did last it lingered a little bit longer into april which probably on the margin helped growth a bit as well so i think the combination of things with very good performance in the core assays and the developed markets and then continued good performance in hbdc from a dbs perspective a number of key things going on from an innovation and commercial execution perspective that are helping us to continue to drive share gains we ve netted over 300 new customers since acquisition which is really meaningful in terms of not only the installed base that is built but obviously the annuity stream that s associated with those captive consumables so that market leading installed base is now north of 20 000 instruments we closed as i mentioned in the prepared remarks i mentioned idns we ve closed a number of major health systems or idns and that is again continuing to drive the installed base with strong annuity streams the anchor assays like flu and strep a are key to develop to driving those wins and i think over time we re going to we re going to see some penetration in the physician office labs in an even deeper way with our clia waived xpress offerings and because i think those will be an important part of it so overall i think the team is in great shape i was with the team at cepheid in the early part of the year and they continue to perform exceptionally well but i think it s still early days i think one way to think about the early days is in terms of geographic penetration we re still coming off a relatively small base in china but the molecular diagnostics opportunity in china is really strong today china is still probably sub 5 of cepheid and it s going to be significantly bigger than that as years go on we re working on getting beyond the initial test that we have approved in china which are really around mtb and c diff hiv viral load etc and we continue to build the sales force it s up by 3x times where we started and we got 4x or 5x the revenue so again small base early days but i think plenty of room to go ross muken evercore isi analyst and maybe just on the pharma side i know you called out biotech at least relative to pall but more broadly i guess how would you kind of characterize small versus large molecule demand across the portfolio and specifically to tycho s point before in china any sort of anecdotal things and when we were there it seemed quite like biologics and bio manufacturing was on absolute fire so just any color would be helpful thomas p joyce president and chief executive officer sure i think in terms of small versus large i think we continue to see solid growth from the segment of market that s more oriented toward small molecule you know well ross that that s sort of our legacy if we looked at the sciex business as an example of that continued solid performance across the small molecule business large molecule biologics is where the faster growth is and we see that in our pall numbers the pall life science business up double digits the biotech part of that was really led by our single use technologies and that s those are those single use technologies are significantly oriented it s not exclusively oriented to the biologic side of the house icellis i mentioned icellis and the icellis bioreactor continues to be a big source of growth for us we look at the areas of cell and gene therapy as huge opportunities and again it s still early days in those markets so i d say coming through at all small molecule solid pretty consistent large molecule continued strong growth you asked specifically about china thanks thanks for your recent visit that market is going quite well but again i think that s still a market that is in development a lot of the history there began in the small molecule area some of what s going on there around biosimilars is clearly a source of growth but that market will continue to evolve over time there is a tremendous amount of government investments that s going on as you also probably found when you were there and so we re very bullish about how our business in life science is not just on by the way that the process technologies you might say around filtration and ultimately around chromatography but i think our tools business as well whether we re talking about sciex and the evolution of the use of mass spectrometry in large molecules or the use of our other life science tools around biologic drug development and discovery those businesses are all tracking well ross muken evercore isi analyst super helpful thanks tom thomas p joyce president and chief executive officer you bet ross operator your next question comes from the line of derik de bruin of bank of america merrill lynch thomas p joyce president and chief executive officer derik good morning derik de bruin bank of america merrill lynch analyst good morning how are you all doing thomas p joyce president and chief executive officer great thanks nice to hear from you derik de bruin bank of america merrill lynch analyst thank you yeah a couple of questions so i guess the first one would be you mentioned in your comments about like a bio that you were receiving some share gains there and given you generally have a couple of real competitors of that market i m just sort of curious about the additional color on what s driving the share gains and just some any information on that would be good to start good place to start thomas p joyce president and chief executive officer sure yeah you bet happy to you know first of all we have a terrific team on that business today melissa aquino who i have worked with for a long time actually came out of our water quality business ran our dbs office prior to this role is leading that business today and just doing a wonderful job both in terms of driving new product execution as well as the commercial side of the house one of the things that i ve been particularly impressed with is i was with that business earlier this year derik they ve got the new product engines now working in that business we struggled a bit three four five years ago with getting products out of r d on time they were great products they ultimately were targeted at the right market we are now getting those out faster the rate of new product introduction is higher than it s ever been before and we re seeing the impact of that in the growth rates both in histology the core microtome tissue processor what you might think of is kind of the more stuff is at the front end of anatomical pathology as well as better growth rates and more product innovation around advanced staining we still have work to do around path imaging you recall years ago we did the acquisition of aperio we think there s tremendous opportunities around the evolution of digital pathology we have i think many of much of the tool set that it takes to move pathology imaging into the mainstream if you will of anatomical pathology but we ve got some product development that continues to need to be done and frankly it s a market that s slow to adapt to those technologies and we will need to be a little bit patient as those transitions take place within the community of pathologists but a lot of good things going on there but i would point primarily to product development engine now running far more smoothly and efficiently derik de bruin bank of america merrill lynch analyst great and then just two related questions one can you just give us any update on sort of ge and timing on that whole process and also just sort of a follow up on ross question when you think about small molecules and large molecules in cell and gene therapies can you compare sort of like the profitability for some of those markets the question i m getting to is like as you move into providing products zolgensma and just some of these other ones that are out there i m just curious is those are going to be a higher margin higher products for you more profitable products for you going and then doing genomic supplying columns or supplying resins and filters for the biologics business thomas p joyce president and chief executive officer sure let s take in there but let me give it a shot so let s have a key you know first of all we continue to be really impressed with the ge team we mentioned that when we announced the deal that we found that coming through due diligence but you know as we normally do with large acquisitions we put a transition team together we acquired the soon to be acquired business has a transition team and so we continue to get some exposure to that team and we remain really impressed by them it s a highly passionate and talented group with great industry experience as you saw in q1 from them the business is off to a great start in 2019 what we ve heard a little bit is just sort of very anecdotally that things continue to track quite well their first quarter was at core growth above where they ve been in the last couple of years so all indications are the business is in wonderful shape from a transaction standpoint you know we issued the equity in q1 clearly the debt financing ought to be helped by what we re seeing now in lower rates assuming those kind of hold in both the us and europe and that s just in comparison to when we announced the deal so overall we feel very good about where we are no change to our expectations we ve had good and constructive dialog with the regulators and we re working with them like we would on any other deal and so we re continuing to drive toward a fourth quarter close and feel good about that relative to your second question which was around small molecule versus large molecule cell and gene therapy and profitability and then you made specific reference to zolgensma and the recent introduction of that breakthrough product by the division of novartis your question was really around profitability i guess first of all going back to the core we ve always seen good profitability in our business around small molecule related applications and large molecule i would say no difference obviously as we continue to develop breakthrough new products associated with the evolution of biological drug discovery development and processes we continue to focus on enhancing gross margins as we drive new product development and so obviously the value that we deliver to shareholders is directly associated back to the gross margin that we re able to achieve and so we continue to really keep the long horizon in mind in terms of what the market needs are and continue to drive products that will help to enhance gross margin which they ve done and so we feel good about that now when it comes to cell and gene therapy it s so early in the evolution of that market today that it s hard to say anything that s particularly material or quantitative around overall profitability even our icellis product line which is doing exceptionally well it s still early days and its market penetration as fast as that pickup has been and as unique of that product is in the market so more to come over time but in general our outlook is profitability looks very solid across this market zolgensma as you mentioned you probably know from what s been publicized is a unique therapy is a breakthrough it s incredibly impactful to children under the age of two and it s a very costly therapy and you know that s a challenge in healthcare today is the cost of developing therapies and so on but that s a dynamic that where quite a number of steps removed from when it comes to drug pricing and the relationship with the payers and so i think the continued evolution of the technologies associated with these breakthroughs is going to be imperative for our customers today and we re proud to be a part of it but we certainly recognize the challenges that are associated with how costly these have become just one last point that many of you have probably heard me say that at danaher we have a what we call our shared purpose and it s four simple words helping realize life s potential whether that s the potential for our associates or our customers our shareholders ultimately in many respect patients and there s probably no better example of how we help realize life s potential when it comes to healthcare than when a tool of ours can play a role in really impacting the quality of life for patients so we re proud to be a part of that and there is more to come and it s still early days derik de bruin bank of america merrill lynch analyst great thanks thomas p joyce president and chief executive officer thanks derik operator your next question comes from the line of doug schenkel of cowen thomas p joyce president and chief executive officer hey doug doug schenkel cowen company analyst hey good morning guys i wanted to touch base to start on a few loose ends on pall how would you characterize win rates for pall biotech especially in the gene therapy space i guess the second part is i believe it was last quarter you mentioned some building backlog for icellis what s the status of that and i guess the third part is i m curious if customer anticipation of the ge bio acquisition is having any impact on pall demand clearly you re doing well there and you have been for a while but just wondering if there is any attribution to anticipation of the ge bio deal as customers think about the possibilities associated with you having a broader portfolio and whether or not that is impacting demand at all thomas p joyce president and chief executive officer sure thanks doug so first of all on pall around win rates in gene therapy and you mentioned specifically icellis and that s a good place to start when it comes to gene therapy you know icellis is a unique product not to suggest that there is only one way to affect what icellis affects in terms of bioreactor but its capabilities are particularly unique in the market and as a result of that the leaders in that market segment associated with the projection steps in gene therapy have chosen icellis at a pretty consistent rate and so while i won t begin to quote right now a specific win rate percentage i would tell you it s just it s very high and that has to do with the unique capabilities that icellis delivers in this market that is it s difficult to do with the quality and the efficiency and the cost effectiveness that icellis allows for so we feel very good about that but again it s still because the gene and cell therapy market is still nascent today we can feel great about that but the materiality of that is something that will only build over time it will build at a reasonably rapid rate but again a nascent market today your question specifically about the customer reaction or anticipation i guess as you framed it for the ge deal and impacting of pall demand i don t know today that we would point to anything specific in that regard doug i would tell you quick sort of an anecdote you know i was in china a couple of months ago and was it was with a significant pall customer they happen to be a ge customer as well as most large customers that i might meet with either in china or any high growth market or even in the us or europe but in this particular case it was there was an appreciation for the fact that the combination of those two businesses in terms of the type of service and support that that customer would expect the fact that we become more meaningful to one another in a positive and constructive way was something that they feel very good about and so those are just anecdotes i don t know if there s anything we would point to today that is a demand impact today that we could see into relative to the top line doug schenkel cowen company analyst okay thank you for that pivoting to beckman diagnostics where you guys grew mid single digits for the third consecutive quarter do you think this is the new norm and specifically in north america there s clearly been some improvement there over the last couple of quarters how did that fare in north america this quarter for beckman dx thomas p joyce president and chief executive officer sure doug and we obviously as that s an important battleground we paid a good deal of attention to that as you said third straight quarter of mid single digit growth we feel very good about that some of the things that led the way are we continue to see very good growth in our immunoassay business in the core central lab you ll recall that we had we ve developed and launched a new automation system the dxh system which has taken our competitive advantage in particularly high volume accounts to a new level and so we feel very good about that but probably one of the key things that is a difference today is our hematology business and for those you doug and others who follow us for a number of years you know that even going back to the acquisition of beckman to begin with hematology with the headwind and so we made a significant amount of investment in new product development we have transformed that product line those new products specifically around of both high and mid volume specifically in the high volume the dxh 900 as well as the early sepsis indicator capabilities that we have now launched are contributing together to turn the tide we continually look at retention and win rates and we have seen those increment upward consistently over the last particularly over the last two years and those new products around automation and hematology have clearly been a big part of it china continues to be a strong driver for us at north of 10 and so that s a plus as well so the combination still work to do there is still minute gaps that we re working on that we couple of critical ones that we will look to close more likely in 2020 and so i think we re continuing to see good performance i think if you step back just for one second and think about the impact this has had on the diagnostic platform if you think about the improvement in beck dx now at mid single digits with the addition of cepheid now with its terrific performance we now have a diagnostic platform with core growth at 7 5 that we think will as the comps come out will stack up reasonably well and now a platform that s been solidly mid single digits for eight straight quarters so i think beckman is important certainly with the combination of beckman with solid performance at radiometer like the biosystems and the high growth rate at cepheid is really what solidified that stronger overall platform position and it s really the platform together when we look at clinical chemistry immunoassay hematology urinalysis microbiology and across the other modalities in anatomical pathology in acute care that really is the right comp against some pretty good competitors doug schenkel cowen company analyst okay sorry to try to sneak in one more and then i ll like fall back to the queue no this is all me i ve got a handful of investors ask me for updates on timing of the debt financing and if there is any real change and i think by extension upside what you guys embedded into your original deal model for interest expense assumptions could you speak to timing and whether there is any change in how you re thinking about maybe upside associated with interest expense thank you matt mcgrew executive vice president and chief financial officer sure yeah i mean from a timing perspective i still think we ve kind of talked about trying to be in the market a little bit closer to when we closed i mean i think we re still talking about a q4 close here so i think that the timing will be a little bit closer to that but as tom kind of said we talked about the ge update we issued the equity in q1 and the debt financing here is clearly going to be held by the lower rates there is no question about that i mean we re probably not going to update any of our guidance that we kind of provide to you earlier but i think the combination of the tailwinds that the businesses the ge business is off to a pretty good start and where the rates are right now like we will have some sort of benefit but i think from a timing perspective still sort of tbd but a little bit closer to when we bring the kind of when we get to close here doug schenkel cowen company analyst okay thanks again operator your next question comes from the line of steve beuchaw of wolfe research thomas p joyce president and chief executive officer good morning steve steve beuchaw wolfe research analyst good morning thanks so much for the time here just a couple from me i mean a couple of clarifications for matt and then one on the commercial side for tom matt it sounds like the thinking for the core growth of the total company level is going higher relative to what we had before is it fair to say that that well fair to say that first of all and second of all is that a reflection of a fairly balanced view across environmental applied diagnostics life sciences second clarification for matt is has anything meaningfully changed in terms of non op or tax rate outlook for the full year that you would flag here and then i have one for tom matt mcgrew executive vice president and chief financial officer sure so from guide perspective i think for the full year we had talked about at the beginning of the year kind of in december we had talked about approximately 4 core for the whole year obviously a pretty good start here with in the first half and what we are our guide here of approximately 4 5 in q3 so i think from a full year perspective our thoughts now are that we are probably approximately 5 here for the full year from a core guide as far as balance on that yeah i think where we ve seen in the first half as you see life sciences and diagnostics have been much better and eas i think eas would be the one piece in the second half given the water comp and the comp at pid they are both here in q3 going to be comping kind of their toughest comps in the quarter but other than that i suspect that it s been pretty balanced i don t think we see a vast difference here in the first half or the second half i think we just have had a little bit better start than we may have thought in december as far as non op stuff in tax i don t think there s anything that i would call out steve that would be different here in the second half steve beuchaw wolfe research analyst okay thanks matt and then tom i wonder if you could reflect a little bit more on idt and now that business in isolation but what idt in the broader life science portfolio is doing in terms of cross selling opportunities there s probably some synergy between idt and beck ls just to pick one example and just would be interested to hear about where you think you might be doing better in terms of share gains not just as a function of the commercial investments you ve made but in terms of product synergies whether it s around idt or may be phenomenex as we ve been hearing more about phenomenex on checks here of late thanks so much thomas p joyce president and chief executive officer sure steve it probably will come across as somewhat surprising that despite what you might think across a broad set of analytical modalities that we provide in life sciences that there aren t a really significant number of cross selling situations that we would point to that where there s real materiality and the reason for that and i ll come back to idt in a second but the reason for that is that our operating company centric model that we have maintained for virtually the entirety of danaher s history is one that puts an extremely high value on an individual operating company and its commercial organizations being uniquely focused on the specific needs of that customer set and we ve seen a number of situations looking across different industries where businesses have hoped for commercial synergies by bringing sales organizations together and creating heavier bags for their commercial organizations thinking that customers actually were looking to buy a broader suite of instrumentation from the same sales team when the reality is that only serve to dilute the focus the technical capability the level of service and support and so we ve actually maintained much more focus within our individual operating companies on the unique needs of that end market s customers and really i think continue to maintain that even in particular with newly acquired businesses going back to idt that approach to maintaining a unique focus of a commercial organization on their unique customers is particularly important for newly acquired businesses for us because it s so easy to get the commercial organization confused by adding additional products to their bags from another operating company that ultimately dilutes that sales force s effectiveness and so we look clearly for situations where we can deliver higher value i think you mentioned phenomenex phenomenex and sciex are clearly a closer opportunity where the synergy between chromatography column obviously and the sample preparation associated with mass spectrometry is much more technically and workflow oriented synergistic and so that s probably a better example of where we see that and then in certain cases in high growth markets i think i would point for example to our dental business where having a unified sales organization bringing a consolidated set of products to a single end market meaning the dental market in china which has structured a little bit differently than the end markets in the developed countries that s really delivered value and that s actually one of the things that has helped drive that double digit sales growth in china but again those are unique situations that we only do that where there is clarity around how we bring real value to customers steve beuchaw wolfe research analyst well that s great color i really appreciate the time here this morning thomas p joyce president and chief executive officer thank steve operator thank you i will now

tokyo expectations have risen sharply that the bank of japan s boj next policy move will be to ease further a reuters poll of economists found as the us federal reserve looks set to cut interest rates this month for the first time in over a decade three quarters of economists said the boj s next move would be to expand stimulus up from about half last month and 38 just two months ago almost two thirds of those who predicted easing expect it within the year and some as early as this month speculation had already been growing for further easing as the us china trade war and weakening global demand threaten japan s export reliant economy fed rate cuts could inflict further damage by boosting the yen against the dollar making japanese exports less competitive and eroding profits when repatriated to japan a major effect of the boj s massive stimulus since 2013 has been a weaker yen the pace of the yen s appreciation against the dollar when the fed starts cutting rates will definitely help decide whether the boj needs to adopt more easing said yasunari ueno chief market economist at mizuho securities if the gap in interest rates between japan and the united states shrinks and us shares tumble at the same time the yen could try 100 yen per dollar then the boj will have to ease further knowing there would be side effects the japanese currency last strengthened beyond 100 to the dollar in august 2016 it traded around 107 90 on thursday us federal reserve policy makers moving toward their first interest rate reduction in a decade later this month on tuesday sketched out arguments for whether rates should be cut by a quarter or a half a percentage point thirty of 40 economists predicted the boj s next move would be to loosen policy further while 10 said the bank would tighten the july 3 16 poll found seven of the economists who forecast more easing said the central bank would ease this month six predicted september five selected october and two said december among possible steps 25 economists expected the boj to tweak its forward guidance the boj pledges to keep very low interest rates at least through around the spring of 2020 and economists predicted the central bank would extend this period eight economists said the boj would increase its buying of exchange traded funds and japanese real estate investment trusts three predicted the bank would deepen its negative interest rates only while two forecast that it could cut both its negative interest rates and the 10 year bond yield target this question allowed multiple answers under a policy dubbed yield curve control the boj guides short term rates at 0 1 and the 10 year bond yield around 0 at last month s policy review the boj kept policy steady but governor haruhiko kuroda signaled its readiness to ramp up stimulus as global risks cloud the economic outlook joining us and european central banks in dropping hints of additional easing japan south korea feud tokyo and seoul are in an escalating row after japan recently announced tighter controls on exports to south korea of some materials used to make smartphone displays and chips asked about the japanese government s decision 15 of 23 economists said they did not support the move while eight responded they did the poll found asked how the move would affect japan s economy 15 economists saw little impact and two said no impact while 12 projected a moderate impact the direct impact will be limited said kazuma maeda economist at barclays securities japan but we need to watch for an indirect impact on japanese production of things like electronic parts and devices if the export curbs have an unforeseen impact on the global supply chain for the semiconductor industry the poll also found japan s economy would expand 0 5 in the fiscal year to march 2020 having contracting an annualized 1 8 in the fourth quarter when growth is hit by a scheduled sales tax hike in october it is projected to grow at the same rate of 0 5 in the next fiscal year we expect japan will avoid falling into recession thanks to solid domestic demand such as public investment and capital expenditure said yosuke yasui senior economist at japan research institute the nation s core consumer price index which includes oil products but not fresh foods will rise 0 7 this fiscal year and 0 6 the following year the poll showed reuters

good morning everyone we are very pleased with our strong second quarter performance we delivered 5 5 core revenue growth with continued investments in innovation and commercial initiatives contributing to share gains across many of our businesses this marks the seventh straight quarter of 5 or better core growth which combined with solid operating margin expansion and strong free cash flow is a testament to our team s focused execution and the power of the danaher business system we also continue to make progress on our anticipated acquisition of ge biopharma and the planned ipo of our dental business as both transactions remain on track relative to our previously communicated expectations as we move into the second half of 2019 we re excited about these important portfolio moves and the opportunities that lie ahead for danaher so now let s turn to our second quarter results sales grew 3 5 to 5 2 billion with core revenue growth of 5 5 acquisitions increased revenues by 1 while the impact of foreign currency translation decreased revenues by 3 geographically high growth markets grew high single digits led by double digit growth in india and approximately 10 growth in china we saw mid single digit growth across the developed markets with both the us and western europe growing in that range gross margin for the first quarter was 55 8 and operating profit margin was 17 1 down 30 basis points year over year however core operating margin increased 15 basis points despite a meaningful foreign currency headwind from a stronger us dollar year on year we generated 1 billion of free cash flow in the second quarter resulting in double digit growth year on year and a free cash flow to net income conversion ratio of 137 so now let s take a more detailed look at our second quarter results across the portfolio in life sciences reported revenue increased 6 5 with 7 5 core revenue growth this is the fifth consecutive quarter of high single digit or better core revenue growth in the segment reported operating profit margin was up 190 basis points to 20 1 with core operating margins increasing 170 basis points this terrific margin performance was a result of the team s outstanding dbs driven execution across the segment beckman life sciences core revenue growth was up high single digits as performance was led by double digit growth in both flow cytometry and particle counting and characterization the strength in particle counting was led by the vi cell product line which is primarily used to analyze cell viability in biopharmaceutical applications in addition beckman closed the bolt on acquisition of cytobank a software solution that pairs with our flow cytometry platform to help biopharma and clinical research customers analyze complex datasets more quickly and efficiently core revenue at sciex grew at a mid single digit rate good results across the pharmaceutical and applied end markets were partially offset by the continued impact of a tough comparison in our north american clinical business we ve made significant investments to improve the cadence of innovation at sciex since we acquired the business nearly 10 years ago the team highlighted several new products last month at asms including echo ms a non contact liquid handling solution with very high analytical throughput this first of its kind technology enables mass spectrometry s rich data generation to be used in new applications within the drug development workflow helping customers in their pursuit of breakthrough disease treatments at pall high single digit core revenue growth was driven by broad based strength across most major geographies and end markets pall industrial was up mid single digits with strong results in our aerospace and process and industrial businesses this was partially offset by microelectronics which declined due to a tough prior year comparison and softer end markets double digit growth in pall life sciences was led by our biotech business where we saw broad based demand across product lines an important highlight during the quarter with the us fda s approval of a pediatric gene therapy which is manufactured using pall s icellis bioreactor zolgensma is the first gene therapy to treat spinal muscular atrophy or sma in children under the age of two sma is the number one genetic cause of death for infants and pall is proud to contribute to the breakthrough treatment for this devastating disease second quarter marked the one year anniversary of our acquisition of idt and we couldn t be happier with the progress the team has made so far idt delivered another quarter of double digit core revenue growth driven by broad based strength across all major product lines and geographies moving now to diagnostics reported revenue was up 4 5 with core revenue growth of 7 5 reported operating margin was 17 5 with reported and core margins down 20 basis points this decline is predominantly attributable to the impact of foreign currency headwinds related to the stronger us dollar and tariff related costs at beckman diagnostics mid single digit core revenue growth was driven by high growth markets particularly china by product line immunoassay and automation led the way momentum from recent product launches is benefiting beckman in a number of key product areas enhancing the business competitive position and accelerating its growth trajectory we are particularly encouraged by ongoing improvements in our hematology business where we continue to see strong global demand for our new dxh 900 high volume analyzer radiometer achieved high single digit core revenue growth with strength across the developed markets and china our blood gas and aqt product lines both performed well with key competitive wins contributing to market share gains leica biosystems core revenue was up mid single digits good results across advanced staining and core histology were driven by demand for recently introduced products and we believe lbs continued to take share relative to the market finally at cepheid core revenue was up more than 20 on continued momentum in north america and strong results across high growth markets cepheid s embrace of dbs growth tools and processes like transformative marketing and funnel management has enabled the team to make meaningful progress penetrating new accounts were particular success at integrated delivery networks in north america turning to our dental segment reported revenue declined 3 and core revenue was down 50 basis points reported operating profit margin declined to 11 2 with core and reported margins down 310 basis points this decline primarily reflects the impact of lower volume foreign exchange rate movements and ongoing investment spend focused on new product development low single digit declines in our traditional consumables and equipment business were partially offset by low single digit core growth in our specialty businesses geographically double digit growth in china was more than offset by continued softness in western europe and latin america as part of our expansion into clear aligners our orthodontics business ormco highlighted spark at the american association of orthodontists trade show in may spark is made using trugen a proprietary material with exceptional flexibility and clarity which provides a highly aesthetic and comfortable aligner capable of treating complex cases following a successful initial launch in australia we are previewing spark with a group of leading orthodontists in the us as part of our targeted expansion and expect to build on this good early traction going forward we continue to make good progress toward the intended ipo of our dental business we recently announced the new company s name envista and have identified its key senior leaders and future operating structure we remain on track to establish envista as a separate publicly traded company in the second half of this year moving to our environmental applied solutions segment reported revenue increased 2 and core revenue was up 4 reported operating margin increased 40 basis points to 23 4 with 45 basis points of core margin expansion in product identification core revenue increased at a low single digit rate videojet s core revenue was up low single digits versus a high single digit prior year comparison results were led by growth in western europe and high growth markets with solid underlying end market demand worldwide in our packaging business which includes esko and x rite we were encouraged by better sequential performance and ongoing improvements in order trends a few weeks ago esko hosted more than 200 customers at the eskoworld user group meeting in nashville the event brings together brand owners and suppliers from across the packaging workflow to showcase esko s solutions and provides a unique forum for esko to gather industry insight to guide impactful product innovation finally turning to water quality core revenue growth for the platform was up mid single digits at trojan double digit core revenue growth was driven by strength across the developed markets and china we saw solid demand in the municipal and industrial end markets and the team sustained its strong customer win rate with good commercial execution and new product differentiation chemtreat delivered high single digit core revenue growth the north american and latin american markets continued to lead the way with strong results in food and beverage commercial facilities and oil and gas lastly at hach core revenue grew at a low single digit rate versus a double digit prior year comparison good performance in north america and western europe benefited from demand across the municipal and industrial end markets this was partially offset by declines in china which was up meaningfully last year as a result of government initiatives around surface water monitoring which generated significant demand for hach s unique offering 2019 marks hach s 20th year as part of danaher making it one of the longest tenured operating companies in our portfolio today and a tremendous example of how we grow businesses and build platforms at danaher through a combination of organic execution and strategic m a with the commitment of dbs and a foundation of continuous improvement hach has evolved from a 130 million business in 1999 to what is now the cornerstone of our 2 5 billion water quality platform during that time the platform has increased gross and operating profit margins by over 1 500 basis points and completed more than 25 acquisitions to augment growth and add adjacencies in water treatment by trojan and chemtreat this combination of organic and inorganic initiatives has helped drive consistent share gains and build sustainable long term value with the platforms return on invested capital now in excess of 20 you get to hear more about the success story at our upcoming water quality investor day in september and we hope that many of you will be able to join us for the event on at hach s headquarters in loveland colorado so to wrap up we feel good about the momentum we generated in the first half of 2019 the remainder of this year will be transformational for danaher with the anticipated ipo of envista and welcoming ge biopharma to our life science platform both incredibly important portfolio moves that we expect to maximize value for our shareholders customers and associates we believe the combination of our differentiated portfolio the danaher team s dbs driven execution and our commitment to build long term value uniquely positions us for strong performance through 2019 and beyond we are initiating third quarter adjusted diluted net eps guidance between 1 12 and 1 15 which assumes core growth of approximately 4 5 we now expect full year 2019 adjusted diluted net eps to be in the range of 4 75 to 4 80 matt gugino vice president of investor relations thanks tom that concludes our formal comments laurie we re now ready for questions questions and answers operator thank you our first question comes from the line of tycho peterson of jpmorgan tycho peterson jpmorgan analyst hey thanks and congrats on another solid quarter tom on the more industrial focused market it doesn t sound like you re flagging any sort of softness or issues there i know you had the tougher videojet comp but you did mention i think better quarter over quarter in order trends in packaging so can you just talk on the outlook for pall industrial product id packaging some of these more industrial focused markets given some of the macro data points thomas p joyce president and chief executive officer sure tycho happy to you know as i think you probably know well we don t have a lot of truly industrial exposure left in the portfolio today call it 10 or less of the overall portfolio so and barely we re perhaps not a great read but i m happy to share with you some of the details behind some of the specific businesses that you asked about in terms of the trends we re seeing broadly defined across these businesses in general they are still pretty solid let s call it low single digit mid single digit growth rates across these businesses that i ll tell you about in a little bit more detail so maybe let s start with say with a portion of hach so hach has some industrial exposure that the industrial side of hach was up mid single digits in the quarter the order trends remain pretty solid across both the us and europe overall hach was low single digits in the second quarter but again that was against that big double digit comp last year that impacted us in china so again just look at the industrial side pretty solid you mentioned pall industrial again another portion that maybe is worth a little bit of a read pall industrial up mid single digits in the quarter so pretty good performance where we saw a little bit of softness was certainly in micro e microelectronics that was expected we clearly have some difficult comps there two years of double digit growth and that market has clearly softened up based on a lot that s going on in terms of the trade dynamics and that market is probably not likely to improve much in the second half of the year but so that s a little bit of a soft spot there but at pall industrial that was more than offset by our aerospace business and what we call ftap which is fluid technologies and asset protection both aerospace and ftap were up double digits in the quarter so again put that altogether mid single digit growth at pall industrial pretty solid vj you mentioned vj again a little bit of exposure there at vj that was up again depending on the sub segment low single digit to mid single digit pretty small numbers at vj but again the order trends were pretty solid and vj s overall comp was although low single digits in the quarter was against the high single digit prior year so net net we keep a very close eye on what s going on in these sub markets we do think they can be indicative of maybe some broader trends but our order trends remain pretty steady and again we don t have a ton of exposure but happy to keep bringing those indicators forward for everybody sort of broader sense of the macro tycho peterson jpmorgan analyst that s helpful and maybe similar line of question on china i mean you had 10 growth double digit in dental you re under indexed to maybe food and four plus seven generic headwinds but as we think about the back half of the year and the china picture any reason that that couldn t continue at double digit levels for you guys thomas p joyce president and chief executive officer yeah thanks we feel very good about where we are in china obviously that starts with the nature of our platform positions there when you think about life sciences diagnostics water quality the concerns around the environment certainly even our dental business which continues to be really well positioned there and growing strongly starting in the broad sense of the platform position we love where those businesses and how that platform is positioned for the secular growth drivers in china and despite the headlines which clearly indicate that there is some slowing in china we continue to see pretty good underlying conditions and i think just to go through a few of the specifics diagnostics was very strong we re talking mid teens kind of growth there especially at cepheid which is again off a small base but continue to grow nicely beckman doing well there another strong quarter at life sciences up high single digits and of course dental demand continuing a double digit growth so good performance there product id again a smaller position in china but pretty solid mid single digit growth but as i mentioned there is again probably a couple of more puts and takes there in china than we might normally have seen water quality being one of those against this federal mandate that existed last year around service monitoring so that s a little bit of an impact and again what i mentioned about micro e down and even our even that ftf ph business is probably a touch lighter so a few little pockets there but again if we step back broadly i think we re in good shape there as we look forward i think we ll continue to see mid single digit to high single digit growth in q3 but again that s only because of really this tougher comp where we had high teens growth in q3 of 18 largely driven by the water quality business so we don t really see a meaningful slowdown in our businesses at this point but clearly given the headlines and the data that s been put out more recently the ongoing trade tensions where we re watching these businesses very very closely and we ll continue to update as we see things tycho peterson jpmorgan analyst okay and then just one last clarification you got guidance for dental margins to be flat i know they re down 300 basis points how much of that was incremental investment and how should we think about dental margins for 3q and 4q thomas p joyce president and chief executive officer we re clearly continuing to invest around new products in that business but the lower volumes i think are meaningful here tycho it s certainly the investment is a function there and that we think it s important to set this business up effectively for the growth to come and you ve seen us lift r d spending by 100 basis points over the last couple of years and so that portion of it we think is really essential to the future growth trajectory of the business but the volume trend is really what we need to get those new product innovations to begin to turn along with some some just tailwind in that market i think as we see that volume come back a bit that s going to be the incremental jump that we re going to need in terms of the omx so i think it s really a combination of those things that we d be looking for certainly as we turn the corner into next year i think as we look at the balance of this year we re going to continue to drive some of those investments we re still going to have some challenges in terms of the overall growth in this market but i think we remain very very bullish about the prospects for this business to improve both the growth trajectory and the operating margins as we head into 2020 and beyond matt gugino vice president of investor relations yeah tycho it s matt i mean some of the some of the volume there too is on if you think about specialty in the quarter was kind of low single digits that typically in some of our better margin business and so i think from a mixed perspective like tom said that lower volume and kind of where it happened here in the quarter was a big piece of it tycho peterson jpmorgan analyst okay thank you thomas p joyce president and chief executive officer thanks tycho operator your next question comes from the line of ross muken of evercore isi thomas p joyce president and chief executive officer good morning ross ross muken evercore isi analyst good morning guys congrats so maybe i just want to go back to diagnostics i mean it felt like cepheid it s probably north of 20 in the quarter i mean obviously q1 you had you had some tough flu comps so i guess that s a pretty remarkable growth where it feels even above sort of trailing 12 months level so i guess help us understand whether it s sort of new product or some of the genexpert or just placements or new menu like or geographic where is that upside sort of coming from and we sort of at that sort of key stages of the dbs flywheel sort of getting this business kind of churning at the rate it may be should get too thomas p joyce president and chief executive officer sure thanks ross your termed the flywheel is one where we love a lot and obviously from that standpoint of turning to flywheel i would say it s still early days at cepheid and yet we ve begun to turn that flywheel at a pretty good rate but there is still opportunities to continue to enhance that the rpms if you will so let me take you through a few of the details as i mentioned in the prepared remarks we were up north of 20 in the second quarter and some of that continues to come from our what we call our hbdc market or high burden developing country growth but if you even backed out of the high burden developing countries where we continue to see good growth cepheid continued to be up mid teens in many of the core areas and core assays so that growth continues to be really broad based infectious disease led the way flu rsv strep all strong sexual health also very good the flu season and normally by the time we get into july here we re not usually talking about flu but just to go back a second it did last it lingered a little bit longer into april which probably on the margin helped growth a bit as well so i think the combination of things with very good performance in the core assays and the developed markets and then continued good performance in hbdc from a dbs perspective a number of key things going on from an innovation and commercial execution perspective that are helping us to continue to drive share gains we ve netted over 300 new customers since acquisition which is really meaningful in terms of not only the installed base that is built but obviously the annuity stream that s associated with those captive consumables so that market leading installed base is now north of 20 000 instruments we closed as i mentioned in the prepared remarks i mentioned idns we ve closed a number of major health systems or idns and that is again continuing to drive the installed base with strong annuity streams the anchor assays like flu and strep a are key to develop to driving those wins and i think over time we re going to we re going to see some penetration in the physician office labs in an even deeper way with our clia waived xpress offerings and because i think those will be an important part of it so overall i think the team is in great shape i was with the team at cepheid in the early part of the year and they continue to perform exceptionally well but i think it s still early days i think one way to think about the early days is in terms of geographic penetration we re still coming off a relatively small base in china but the molecular diagnostics opportunity in china is really strong today china is still probably sub 5 of cepheid and it s going to be significantly bigger than that as years go on we re working on getting beyond the initial test that we have approved in china which are really around mtb and c diff hiv viral load etc and we continue to build the sales force it s up by 3x times where we started and we got 4x or 5x the revenue so again small base early days but i think plenty of room to go ross muken evercore isi analyst and maybe just on the pharma side i know you called out biotech at least relative to pall but more broadly i guess how would you kind of characterize small versus large molecule demand across the portfolio and specifically to tycho s point before in china any sort of anecdotal things and when we were there it seemed quite like biologics and bio manufacturing was on absolute fire so just any color would be helpful thomas p joyce president and chief executive officer sure i think in terms of small versus large i think we continue to see solid growth from the segment of market that s more oriented toward small molecule you know well ross that that s sort of our legacy if we looked at the sciex business as an example of that continued solid performance across the small molecule business large molecule biologics is where the faster growth is and we see that in our pall numbers the pall life science business up double digits the biotech part of that was really led by our single use technologies and that s those are those single use technologies are significantly oriented it s not exclusively oriented to the biologic side of the house icellis i mentioned icellis and the icellis bioreactor continues to be a big source of growth for us we look at the areas of cell and gene therapy as huge opportunities and again it s still early days in those markets so i d say coming through at all small molecule solid pretty consistent large molecule continued strong growth you asked specifically about china thanks thanks for your recent visit that market is going quite well but again i think that s still a market that is in development a lot of the history there began in the small molecule area some of what s going on there around biosimilars is clearly a source of growth but that market will continue to evolve over time there is a tremendous amount of government investments that s going on as you also probably found when you were there and so we re very bullish about how our business in life science is not just on by the way that the process technologies you might say around filtration and ultimately around chromatography but i think our tools business as well whether we re talking about sciex and the evolution of the use of mass spectrometry in large molecules or the use of our other life science tools around biologic drug development and discovery those businesses are all tracking well ross muken evercore isi analyst super helpful thanks tom thomas p joyce president and chief executive officer you bet ross operator your next question comes from the line of derik de bruin of bank of america merrill lynch thomas p joyce president and chief executive officer derik good morning derik de bruin bank of america merrill lynch analyst good morning how are you all doing thomas p joyce president and chief executive officer great thanks nice to hear from you derik de bruin bank of america merrill lynch analyst thank you yeah a couple of questions so i guess the first one would be you mentioned in your comments about like a bio that you were receiving some share gains there and given you generally have a couple of real competitors of that market i m just sort of curious about the additional color on what s driving the share gains and just some any information on that would be good to start good place to start thomas p joyce president and chief executive officer sure yeah you bet happy to you know first of all we have a terrific team on that business today melissa aquino who i have worked with for a long time actually came out of our water quality business ran our dbs office prior to this role is leading that business today and just doing a wonderful job both in terms of driving new product execution as well as the commercial side of the house one of the things that i ve been particularly impressed with is i was with that business earlier this year derik they ve got the new product engines now working in that business we struggled a bit three four five years ago with getting products out of r d on time they were great products they ultimately were targeted at the right market we are now getting those out faster the rate of new product introduction is higher than it s ever been before and we re seeing the impact of that in the growth rates both in histology the core microtome tissue processor what you might think of is kind of the more stuff is at the front end of anatomical pathology as well as better growth rates and more product innovation around advanced staining we still have work to do around path imaging you recall years ago we did the acquisition of aperio we think there s tremendous opportunities around the evolution of digital pathology we have i think many of much of the tool set that it takes to move pathology imaging into the mainstream if you will of anatomical pathology but we ve got some product development that continues to need to be done and frankly it s a market that s slow to adapt to those technologies and we will need to be a little bit patient as those transitions take place within the community of pathologists but a lot of good things going on there but i would point primarily to product development engine now running far more smoothly and efficiently derik de bruin bank of america merrill lynch analyst great and then just two related questions one can you just give us any update on sort of ge and timing on that whole process and also just sort of a follow up on ross question when you think about small molecules and large molecules in cell and gene therapies can you compare sort of like the profitability for some of those markets the question i m getting to is like as you move into providing products zolgensma and just some of these other ones that are out there i m just curious is those are going to be a higher margin higher products for you more profitable products for you going and then doing genomic supplying columns or supplying resins and filters for the biologics business thomas p joyce president and chief executive officer sure let s take in there but let me give it a shot so let s have a key you know first of all we continue to be really impressed with the ge team we mentioned that when we announced the deal that we found that coming through due diligence but you know as we normally do with large acquisitions we put a transition team together we acquired the soon to be acquired business has a transition team and so we continue to get some exposure to that team and we remain really impressed by them it s a highly passionate and talented group with great industry experience as you saw in q1 from them the business is off to a great start in 2019 what we ve heard a little bit is just sort of very anecdotally that things continue to track quite well their first quarter was at core growth above where they ve been in the last couple of years so all indications are the business is in wonderful shape from a transaction standpoint you know we issued the equity in q1 clearly the debt financing ought to be helped by what we re seeing now in lower rates assuming those kind of hold in both the us and europe and that s just in comparison to when we announced the deal so overall we feel very good about where we are no change to our expectations we ve had good and constructive dialog with the regulators and we re working with them like we would on any other deal and so we re continuing to drive toward a fourth quarter close and feel good about that relative to your second question which was around small molecule versus large molecule cell and gene therapy and profitability and then you made specific reference to zolgensma and the recent introduction of that breakthrough product by the division of novartis your question was really around profitability i guess first of all going back to the core we ve always seen good profitability in our business around small molecule related applications and large molecule i would say no difference obviously as we continue to develop breakthrough new products associated with the evolution of biological drug discovery development and processes we continue to focus on enhancing gross margins as we drive new product development and so obviously the value that we deliver to shareholders is directly associated back to the gross margin that we re able to achieve and so we continue to really keep the long horizon in mind in terms of what the market needs are and continue to drive products that will help to enhance gross margin which they ve done and so we feel good about that now when it comes to cell and gene therapy it s so early in the evolution of that market today that it s hard to say anything that s particularly material or quantitative around overall profitability even our icellis product line which is doing exceptionally well it s still early days and its market penetration as fast as that pickup has been and as unique of that product is in the market so more to come over time but in general our outlook is profitability looks very solid across this market zolgensma as you mentioned you probably know from what s been publicized is a unique therapy is a breakthrough it s incredibly impactful to children under the age of two and it s a very costly therapy and you know that s a challenge in healthcare today is the cost of developing therapies and so on but that s a dynamic that where quite a number of steps removed from when it comes to drug pricing and the relationship with the payers and so i think the continued evolution of the technologies associated with these breakthroughs is going to be imperative for our customers today and we re proud to be a part of it but we certainly recognize the challenges that are associated with how costly these have become just one last point that many of you have probably heard me say that at danaher we have a what we call our shared purpose and it s four simple words helping realize life s potential whether that s the potential for our associates or our customers our shareholders ultimately in many respect patients and there s probably no better example of how we help realize life s potential when it comes to healthcare than when a tool of ours can play a role in really impacting the quality of life for patients so we re proud to be a part of that and there is more to come and it s still early days derik de bruin bank of america merrill lynch analyst great thanks thomas p joyce president and chief executive officer thanks derik operator your next question comes from the line of doug schenkel of cowen thomas p joyce president and chief executive officer hey doug doug schenkel cowen company analyst hey good morning guys i wanted to touch base to start on a few loose ends on pall how would you characterize win rates for pall biotech especially in the gene therapy space i guess the second part is i believe it was last quarter you mentioned some building backlog for icellis what s the status of that and i guess the third part is i m curious if customer anticipation of the ge bio acquisition is having any impact on pall demand clearly you re doing well there and you have been for a while but just wondering if there is any attribution to anticipation of the ge bio deal as customers think about the possibilities associated with you having a broader portfolio and whether or not that is impacting demand at all thomas p joyce president and chief executive officer sure thanks doug so first of all on pall around win rates in gene therapy and you mentioned specifically icellis and that s a good place to start when it comes to gene therapy you know icellis is a unique product not to suggest that there is only one way to affect what icellis affects in terms of bioreactor but its capabilities are particularly unique in the market and as a result of that the leaders in that market segment associated with the projection steps in gene therapy have chosen icellis at a pretty consistent rate and so while i won t begin to quote right now a specific win rate percentage i would tell you it s just it s very high and that has to do with the unique capabilities that icellis delivers in this market that is it s difficult to do with the quality and the efficiency and the cost effectiveness that icellis allows for so we feel very good about that but again it s still because the gene and cell therapy market is still nascent today we can feel great about that but the materiality of that is something that will only build over time it will build at a reasonably rapid rate but again a nascent market today your question specifically about the customer reaction or anticipation i guess as you framed it for the ge deal and impacting of pall demand i don t know today that we would point to anything specific in that regard doug i would tell you quick sort of an anecdote you know i was in china a couple of months ago and was it was with a significant pall customer they happen to be a ge customer as well as most large customers that i might meet with either in china or any high growth market or even in the us or europe but in this particular case it was there was an appreciation for the fact that the combination of those two businesses in terms of the type of service and support that that customer would expect the fact that we become more meaningful to one another in a positive and constructive way was something that they feel very good about and so those are just anecdotes i don t know if there s anything we would point to today that is a demand impact today that we could see into relative to the top line doug schenkel cowen company analyst okay thank you for that pivoting to beckman diagnostics where you guys grew mid single digits for the third consecutive quarter do you think this is the new norm and specifically in north america there s clearly been some improvement there over the last couple of quarters how did that fare in north america this quarter for beckman dx thomas p joyce president and chief executive officer sure doug and we obviously as that s an important battleground we paid a good deal of attention to that as you said third straight quarter of mid single digit growth we feel very good about that some of the things that led the way are we continue to see very good growth in our immunoassay business in the core central lab you ll recall that we had we ve developed and launched a new automation system the dxh system which has taken our competitive advantage in particularly high volume accounts to a new level and so we feel very good about that but probably one of the key things that is a difference today is our hematology business and for those you doug and others who follow us for a number of years you know that even going back to the acquisition of beckman to begin with hematology with the headwind and so we made a significant amount of investment in new product development we have transformed that product line those new products specifically around of both high and mid volume specifically in the high volume the dxh 900 as well as the early sepsis indicator capabilities that we have now launched are contributing together to turn the tide we continually look at retention and win rates and we have seen those increment upward consistently over the last particularly over the last two years and those new products around automation and hematology have clearly been a big part of it china continues to be a strong driver for us at north of 10 and so that s a plus as well so the combination still work to do there is still minute gaps that we re working on that we couple of critical ones that we will look to close more likely in 2020 and so i think we re continuing to see good performance i think if you step back just for one second and think about the impact this has had on the diagnostic platform if you think about the improvement in beck dx now at mid single digits with the addition of cepheid now with its terrific performance we now have a diagnostic platform with core growth at 7 5 that we think will as the comps come out will stack up reasonably well and now a platform that s been solidly mid single digits for eight straight quarters so i think beckman is important certainly with the combination of beckman with solid performance at radiometer like the biosystems and the high growth rate at cepheid is really what solidified that stronger overall platform position and it s really the platform together when we look at clinical chemistry immunoassay hematology urinalysis microbiology and across the other modalities in anatomical pathology in acute care that really is the right comp against some pretty good competitors doug schenkel cowen company analyst okay sorry to try to sneak in one more and then i ll like fall back to the queue no this is all me i ve got a handful of investors ask me for updates on timing of the debt financing and if there is any real change and i think by extension upside what you guys embedded into your original deal model for interest expense assumptions could you speak to timing and whether there is any change in how you re thinking about maybe upside associated with interest expense thank you matt mcgrew executive vice president and chief financial officer sure yeah i mean from a timing perspective i still think we ve kind of talked about trying to be in the market a little bit closer to when we closed i mean i think we re still talking about a q4 close here so i think that the timing will be a little bit closer to that but as tom kind of said we talked about the ge update we issued the equity in q1 and the debt financing here is clearly going to be held by the lower rates there is no question about that i mean we re probably not going to update any of our guidance that we kind of provide to you earlier but i think the combination of the tailwinds that the businesses the ge business is off to a pretty good start and where the rates are right now like we will have some sort of benefit but i think from a timing perspective still sort of tbd but a little bit closer to when we bring the kind of when we get to close here doug schenkel cowen company analyst okay thanks again operator your next question comes from the line of steve beuchaw of wolfe research thomas p joyce president and chief executive officer good morning steve steve beuchaw wolfe research analyst good morning thanks so much for the time here just a couple from me i mean a couple of clarifications for matt and then one on the commercial side for tom matt it sounds like the thinking for the core growth of the total company level is going higher relative to what we had before is it fair to say that that well fair to say that first of all and second of all is that a reflection of a fairly balanced view across environmental applied diagnostics life sciences second clarification for matt is has anything meaningfully changed in terms of non op or tax rate outlook for the full year that you would flag here and then i have one for tom matt mcgrew executive vice president and chief financial officer sure so from guide perspective i think for the full year we had talked about at the beginning of the year kind of in december we had talked about approximately 4 core for the whole year obviously a pretty good start here with in the first half and what we are our guide here of approximately 4 5 in q3 so i think from a full year perspective our thoughts now are that we are probably approximately 5 here for the full year from a core guide as far as balance on that yeah i think where we ve seen in the first half as you see life sciences and diagnostics have been much better and eas i think eas would be the one piece in the second half given the water comp and the comp at pid they are both here in q3 going to be comping kind of their toughest comps in the quarter but other than that i suspect that it s been pretty balanced i don t think we see a vast difference here in the first half or the second half i think we just have had a little bit better start than we may have thought in december as far as non op stuff in tax i don t think there s anything that i would call out steve that would be different here in the second half steve beuchaw wolfe research analyst okay thanks matt and then tom i wonder if you could reflect a little bit more on idt and now that business in isolation but what idt in the broader life science portfolio is doing in terms of cross selling opportunities there s probably some synergy between idt and beck ls just to pick one example and just would be interested to hear about where you think you might be doing better in terms of share gains not just as a function of the commercial investments you ve made but in terms of product synergies whether it s around idt or may be phenomenex as we ve been hearing more about phenomenex on checks here of late thanks so much thomas p joyce president and chief executive officer sure steve it probably will come across as somewhat surprising that despite what you might think across a broad set of analytical modalities that we provide in life sciences that there aren t a really significant number of cross selling situations that we would point to that where there s real materiality and the reason for that and i ll come back to idt in a second but the reason for that is that our operating company centric model that we have maintained for virtually the entirety of danaher s history is one that puts an extremely high value on an individual operating company and its commercial organizations being uniquely focused on the specific needs of that customer set and we ve seen a number of situations looking across different industries where businesses have hoped for commercial synergies by bringing sales organizations together and creating heavier bags for their commercial organizations thinking that customers actually were looking to buy a broader suite of instrumentation from the same sales team when the reality is that only serve to dilute the focus the technical capability the level of service and support and so we ve actually maintained much more focus within our individual operating companies on the unique needs of that end market s customers and really i think continue to maintain that even in particular with newly acquired businesses going back to idt that approach to maintaining a unique focus of a commercial organization on their unique customers is particularly important for newly acquired businesses for us because it s so easy to get the commercial organization confused by adding additional products to their bags from another operating company that ultimately dilutes that sales force s effectiveness and so we look clearly for situations where we can deliver higher value i think you mentioned phenomenex phenomenex and sciex are clearly a closer opportunity where the synergy between chromatography column obviously and the sample preparation associated with mass spectrometry is much more technically and workflow oriented synergistic and so that s probably a better example of where we see that and then in certain cases in high growth markets i think i would point for example to our dental business where having a unified sales organization bringing a consolidated set of products to a single end market meaning the dental market in china which has structured a little bit differently than the end markets in the developed countries that s really delivered value and that s actually one of the things that has helped drive that double digit sales growth in china but again those are unique situations that we only do that where there is clarity around how we bring real value to customers steve beuchaw wolfe research analyst well that s great color i really appreciate the time here this morning thomas p joyce president and chief executive officer thank steve operator thank you i will now

grew in double digits as software license overall was good even with the minor headwinds in asia due to trade uncertainties which did postpone some deals and specifically we didn t get everything we wanted in asia i m going to expand on that in a minute but don t worry about it let me start off with that the clear headline for q2 is that sap continued to grow fast in the cloud and it was driven by experienced management as the real real catalyst ivc and other analysts have said xm is the new frontier and we actually agree with that xm is also the new front end to every segment in the enterprise application software industry including hdm crm erp and beyond the concept of category creation is actually worth discussing here since 2000 there were 4 500 companies in the it industry that were founded and took a series a investment only 75 of them made it to an ipo only 36 became the dominant category winners those winners now own 76 of the entire addressable market in their respective categories so when it comes to experienced management you re going to hear plenty of noise out there who d like to catch this wave the question is who created the category and the answer of course is qualtrics which is why we couldn t be happier to have the sap global distribution channel behind their xm platform in its second quarter qualtrics has proven to be the growth catalyst we expected and more ryan smith and his team are already making a huge positive impact and we re only getting started advertisement advertisement if you look at our hdm business as one example success factors is an early adopter of the xm vision with employee experience by combining the qualtrics and success factor s offerings we have differentiated against legacy hdm that s why our success factors portfolio had a strong quarter growing bookings in high double digit year on year with multiple wins against workday and oracle market leading companies like merck in germany are shifting away from old hdm in favor of employee experience in the quarters to come we will use all aspects of xm as the differentiator for the intelligent enterprise including employee customer product and brand experience experience management has superseded stand alone digital transformation talk i personally shared this message with ceos around the world the reaction is unanimous every one of them wants xm balancing our healthy top line operating profit was also up double digits for the company this quarter you re seeing a dip in the ifrs operating profit this reflects updated estimates from our restructuring program which was actually more subscribed than anticipated due to more volunteers in germany than planned luka will take you through the one time effects in a few minutes including m a tax and share based compensation the non ifrs operating profit was up a healthy 11 year over year which is another significant feature in this double digit growth quarter on an organic basis there s actually a margin improvement in the core underlying business when you back out the dilutive effects that luka will discuss we also saw a 3 point improvement in our share of predictable revenue in the quarter which continue to signal the broader success of the company s business model transformation so overall we feel strongly about our top line and increasingly confident about the bottom line trajectory for the company our best run sap review is designed to accelerate this operational track record advertisement advertisement we now have support from a highly regarded external partner who is helping us identify opportunities across all corporate functions even as we re in the early stages the initial indications strongly reinforce our stated aspirations for example the underlying cloud gross margins improved 4 percentage points in the current quarter reflecting the success of our off oracle converged cloud initiative and accelerating partnerships with hyperscalers we look forward to the capital markets day in november where we will unveil the comprehensive roadmap to deliver on the approximate 500 basis point margin improvement we fully expect by 2023 in terms of the challenges in the quarter on the software revenue the macro environment related to global trade especially in asia was a factor what you see here is large multi national companies carefully recalibrating their operations and global supply chains in some cases this causes a short term delay on technology purchasing decisions in our case you actually see a net positive impact on the pipeline of sap many of our market units in asia for example have higher pipeline forecasts at this time in 2019 than they did one year ago and the forecasts across the company are in good shape i triple checked every detail this is because the companies that decide to make changes due to trade uncertainty look to sap to support their plans to reroute channels or invest in new geographic markets so overall while we ve noticed the trade effect our customers demand more from us as they adapt to it in other words the bill of materials is getting bigger on the deals one more note on this the temptation here might be to lessen the focus on china which we believe to be a mistake i was just in beijing for meetings with premier li a few weeks ago while the short term uncertainty over trade negotiations is having an impact in many industries everyone recognizes these are the natural effects of globalization i can tell you that the long term health of the economy in china is obviously secure and keep in mind there are more than 70 million enterprises operating in that country so it s a pretty good business opportunity in terms of sap s vibrant china business while some transactions were delayed past q2 that s a fact our pipeline in china remains ever robust and we have a very good prognosis for q3 and q4 advertisement advertisement another theme embedded in the quarter is in our cloud business where we initiated our strategy to embrace our public cloud infrastructure partners as a result some workloads on certain sap hana enterprise cloud deals moved in favor of joint engagements with our cloud infrastructure partners this strategy will pay dividends for us in the quarters and the years to come and significantly it will help us continue improving cloud gross margins which we have committed to do through 2023 and beyond when you exclude the infrastructure as a service hec business our cloud bookings grew 27 year on year in q2 which again reflects the overall health of our solutions portfolio and i m not even discussing network and consumption based cloud revenue which you never see so big picture for years the belief has been businesses have the data they need they just can t access it what you re seeing in this experience economy is this data assumption is wrong businesses don t have all the data they need because nearly all of their existing data was created by the business itself we call this operational data today s imperative is to go out and create a new data set experience data that comes directly from the consumers and employees themselves only when you layer the two data sets together the operational data from the business and the experience data from the people can you deliver true experience management this is the catalyst of our intelligent enterprise strategy this is a message and a strategy that only sap is delivering experience management is a paradigm shift for how cxos run companies from the legacy inside out to the visionary outside in and armed with the right mix of experience data and operational data intelligent enterprises will always know the next action to better serve their customers and their employees this ladies and gentlemen is the future of business and our ambition is not only to lead the xm movement it is to help our customers win it this is the growth elixir that will uplift every solution in our portfolio as you saw with hcm in q2 advertisement advertisement overall sap continues to be the rarity in the industry with s 4hana adoption up to 11 500 customers globally our core business is rock solid with solutions like concur continuing to grow in double digits on a global scale our cloud portfolio couldn t be stronger our technology assets sap hana in the cloud sap cloud platform sap leonardo and sap analytics cloud have the strongest pipeline we ve ever seen and if you look at brands like burger king brazil hitachi kawasaki nh hotel group delivery hero and many others it s clear that sap s entire solution portfolio is resonating strongly on a global basis add marque partnerships and the story gets even stronger intel a great company and sap have entered into a partnership to optimize the features and technologies in sap hana for intel xeon scalable processors and intel optane dc persistent memory this will deliver customers industry leading performance and tco advantage for sap s 4hana we will also jointly establish a center of excellence so customers can evaluate innovate and adopt intel and sap jointly developed technologies that power intelligent enterprises i d like to give my good friend bob swan a big salute for his outstanding friendship and cooperation sap is also partnering with infosys to help clients invest in purposeful innovation to become an intelligent enterprise innov8 for embraced leverages infosys industry knowledge this is a platform delivered on a cloud hyperscale environment with sap digital solutions delivering end to end business outcomes at an accelerated pace there are new multi year partnerships we couldn t be more excited about these are ones that we re counting on and that will deliver upside bigtime in closing even in the seasonally smaller q2 the fundamentals of the company are rock solid we re poised to continue fast growth in the cloud we re focused on expanding our margin profile promises made will be promises kept our xm intelligent enterprise strategy is winning big time our partner echo system is fired up our employee morale is very high our brand value is higher than ever when you think about sap s customers the will inside our company to do what s right for them has never been stronger the best do run sap and our commitment is to run this company at its very best so we can continue to power a new generation of economic growth environmental sustainability and societal progress that s what sap is about helping the world run better and improving people s lives i thank you for your time and attention today i look forward to taking your questions after luka completes his remarks luka over to you luka mucic chief financial officer advertisement advertisement yeah thank you very much bill let me start by echoing bill s comment that the fundamentals of sap are very strong just look at our cloud momentum we have now grown our cloud revenue at 40 or higher in the last four quarters that s impressive for a company at our scale i m also pleased that our operational excellence measures have allowed us to achieve double digit non ifrs operating profit growth this is also remarkable considering our second quarter revenue in software was impacted by the recent short term term trade related uncertainty in asia let me now provide you with some background on the key drivers behind this quarter first both cloud and software revenue as well as total revenue grew 11 this quarter cloud revenue was obviously again a big driver of this our cloud revenue surged 40 and as bill said we saw an amazing performance of our qualtrics experience management solutions new cloud bookings were up 17 to 494 million euros and up 27 excluding our infrastructure as a service business our customers are doing more infrastructure as a service business directly with our hyperscaler partners this is a good trend for sap as it is positive for the margin profile of our cloud business and you can already see that immediate positive effect on our cloud gross margin this quarter which i ll talk about in a few minutes in addition as bill mentioned our success factors offerings had strong double digit bookings growth driven by rapid early adoption of qualtrics and employee experience software license and support revenue continues to grow at a solid 2 in the second quarter even with the well publicized global trade effect if you look to the half year numbers we had a great 4 growth performance in our rock solid core business our business is also becoming increasingly resilient as bill said in q2 the share of more predictable revenue had a strong 3 percentage points uptick and is now already approaching 70 advertisement advertisement now to the regions we had a solid performance in the emea region with cloud and software revenue increasing 9 cloud revenue increased by 46 with germany and spain being highlights in addition germany had another solid quarter in software license revenue france and italy had a strong quarter in software license revenue in the americas region we had a strong performance cloud and software revenue increased by 16 cloud revenue increased by 37 with the united states canada and brazil being highlights in addition the us also had a solid quarter in software license revenue and canada had a strong quarter in the apj region we had a solid performance despite the trade related macro headwinds cloud and software revenue was up by 8 cloud revenue increased by 41 with japan being a highlight for software license revenue australia and india had a strong quarter now let s look at profitability and gross margins in the second quarter first of all we re very happy to report that all our individual cloud gross margins were again up year over year leading to an overall cloud gross margin of 68 which is up 2 percentage points sequentially and up sharply 4 percentage points year over year our most profitable cloud business the intelligence spend group formerly business network the gross margin increased by 1 percentage point year over year and reached 78 the gross margin of our other sas pas business expanded massively by 8 percentage points year over year reaching 69 more importantly this gross margin improved sequentially by 5 percentage points as we saw in the first full quarter of success factors running solely on the converged cloud hana based platform this is a crucial milestone as it gives us the ability to embed real time predictive capabilities and cutting edge future innovations by providing expense relief as we retire duplicate infrastructure reduce third party support fees and rationalize resources while hana enterprise cloud which is our infrastructure as a service offering the cloud gross margin improved by 11 percentage points to 22 year over year as we said we expect to reach a level of 30 to 35 in 2020 we see infrastructure as a service becoming a smaller share of the cloud mix going forward as we continue to accelerate our hyperscaler partnerships overall our cloud and software gross margin was a solid 81 for the quarter our services gross margin was down 2 percentage points to 24 as we hired more consultants to specifically address the strong s4 implementations backlog overall operating profit was up 11 year over year driven by a combination of a strong top line more focused hiring and continued efficiency gains in our cloud business this led to a stable operating margin in q2 even with an acquisition headwind of approximately 40 basis points in the quarter for the first half we were able to expand our operating margin by 20 basis points now turning to ifrs operating profit as well as eps in texas q2 ifrs operating profit and eps were both down 21 impacted by higher acquisition related charges as expected in addition ifrs operating profit was impacted by higher share based compensation both due to the qualtrics acquisition but also particularly the strong sap share price increase over the second quarter as well as additional restructuring charges mainly due to the higher than expected estimated participation rate in the voluntary redundancy and early retirement programs in germany since these are very significant effects this year let me put some numbers to it if we compare the first half of 2018 to the first half this year we now have close to 100 million euro of higher acquisition related charges and revenue adjustments mainly from the acquisition of qualtrics we also have more than 600 million euro higher share based compensation expenses and approximately 1 billion euro higher restructuring charges to be clear as a consequence we obviously expect ifrs operating profit to be sharply up in 2020 and even significantly higher growth rates than on a non ifrs basis as there will be no meaningful restructuring expenses and the gentle downward trend of acquisition related charges moving on to eps we saw a strong 11 increase year over year for the second quarter and 17 for the half year on a non ifrs basis year over year our ifrs and non ifrs effective tax rates decreased slightly the ifrs rate decreased by 0 9 percentage points to 28 6 while the non ifrs rate decreased by 0 5 percentage points to 27 our operating cash flow was 2 7 billion euros down 10 in the first six months as explained at our capital markets day we expected our 2019 operating cash flow to be impacted by several items i d like to provide you with an update for the first half 2019 first operating cash flow experienced a year over year benefit of roughly 185 million euros from the application of ifrs six team which we neutralized in an adapted definition for our free cash flow just to remind also compared to the prior year we had higher restructuring payouts of close to 200 million euros higher share based compensation payouts of around 230 million euros and higher tax payouts of more than 400 million euros for the total year 2019 again as compared to the prior year we currently expect higher restructuring payouts of somewhere between 550 to 750 million euros higher share based compensation payouts of around 400 million euro and higher tax payouts of around 600 million euro due to the adverse impact of the items just mentioned we now expect 2019 operating cash flow to be slightly lower than in 2018 similar to ifrs operating profit we expect a steep increase in operating cash flow in 2020 as restructuring and tax payouts will sharply recede and we also do not expect significant increases of payouts for share based compensation free cash flow for the first half also decreased by 10 to 2 billion euros reflecting the lower operating cash flow but partially offset by capex which came in 279 million euros lower we expect that this trend toward lower capex will also continue in the second half before i conclude i would like to give you an update on our non financial performance and sustainability highlights as well our co2 emissions remain flat year over year at 75 kilotons despite the addition of qualtrics our goal remains to be carbon neutral by 2025 for our sustainability policies we have been able to achieve cost avoidance of 238 million euros over the last three years further we have now updated our global environmental policy and introduced a new target to phase out single use plastic completely by 2020 we continue to make progress on the social front as well as we continue to work to achieve gender equality we are now at 26 2 women in management on track to achieving our goal of 30 by 2022 so to summarize q2 was a solid quarter as we continue our journey toward an sap that is leaner more agile and even more customer oriented than before we are very confident that the opportunities for operational improvements will continue we remain as confident in our 2019 outlook as we are in our midterm ambition and like we have said before we will provide additional details on our operational excellence initiatives and capital allocation policy at our special capital markets day on november 12th in new york city thank you and we will now be happy to take your questions questions and answers operator if you would like to ask a question please signal by pressing 1 on your telephone keypad if you are using a speakerphone please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment again that is 1 to ask a question we will take our first question from walter pritchard with citi please go ahead walter pritchard citi analyst hi thanks i think everybody understands the impact from the hyperscalers qualitatively could you help us understand as we look forward in the year how much on the ias side we expect to see the hyperscalers impact the cloud business and does it impact at all your longer term goals around cloud bill mcdermott chief executive officer yeah just to net it out the hyperscalers will be a growth opportunity for sap the sap cloud platform is at a mature phase now where it can grow into the hyperscaler environment that will lead the customer to many more of the cloud based solutions that sap offers and that is the factor that probably no one out there is counting on but it s coming secondly the hana enterprise cloud now is being run by some real pros so instead of a low margin business that was uninteresting financially it s now improving steadily and you re already over 22 with the margin performance of hec and it ll get into the mid 30s and it s actually performing at a quality standard commensurate with the hyperscalers now it wasn t always it is now we have turned back on the valve many of our customers want the white glove treatment that comes along with their complete portfolio of sap solutions and they want the hec and they are going to get it the hec is a hana enterprise cloud similarly many of our customers have migrated and will migrate to the hyperscalers and we re very well positioned and i think what you re not counting on is just how much cloud revenue will come sap s way by leaning into those strategic partnerships so to be very clear the booking scenario in the company is ever strong the pipelines are entirely commensurate with what you would expect and what we guided for and count on the cloud to come through in the bookings and the revenue in the back end of the year command performance in the cloud on its way stefan gruber head of investor relations thank you let s take the next question please operator we will take our next question from charles brennan with credit suisse please go ahead charles brennan credit suisse analyst great thanks very much for taking the question thank you thank you for taking the question can we just drill into what feels like has been a bit of revenue weakness during the quarter i know you called out the trade wars in asia but can you just remind us are the asian customers primarily on premise or does that also impact the clouds and if it s not the asian customers who are impacting the current bookings what s the bottleneck that s holding the current bookings back to high teens on an organic basis thank you bill mcdermott chief executive officer yeah a couple things first of all the asian market is fine china in this particular quarter wasn t as strong as we re used to seeing china china usually grows steeply in both the on premise and the cloud and there was postponed decisions in china so we did see that what you re seeing in this environment is there are a lot of companies that were manufacturing things in china that are actually moving supply chains and manufacturing facilities to alternative locations those locations include places like malaysia vietnam and even mexico so while that dislocation takes place it does impact asia to some extent china specifically so that s the scenario and then what you do is you go in and you look at ok well what did the pipeline do post quarter because don t forget we ended the quarter on a sunday on june 30th and the g20 discussion was happening at the end of that week in japan so there was a lot of people hovering for the outcome of g20 in terms of some of their strategic calls most of those deals that were hanging out there have either closed or the bill of materials has expanded because when you change a supply chain you open up a new manufacturing facility you start operations in a new geography even if it s in the similar region you have governance you have compliance you have many things to consider and i think that s one of the reasons why our digital supply chain cloud business grew in triple digits because many of the customers are now counting on sap to help them so that s the big picture and as i look at q3 on a pipeline and a forecasted level in that region right now and i have adair sitting next to me if she d like to make some color commentary she s more than welcome everything looks very strong the coverage that we have in the pipeline is as good if not better than it s been all year long adair adair fox martin president global customer operations yeah thanks bill certainly as we enter q3 we re entering it with a multiple of coverage but also more importantly with a conversion history in this quarter and that will ensure a good outcome for us in terms of our business in asia and i think when i look at sap s position there of course the supply chain impact was significant on our china business but we ve got to remember we ve been in asia pacific japan for 30 years now we have very strong teams and very strong businesses across the region which allows us to support our customers as they move these manufacturing capabilities into other regions and we are now working with those customers who delayed some of those decisions to provide both commercial flexibility and certainty and from an sap perspective in the face of what is political and economic uncertainty so we are very comfortable as we move into q3 that we will be able to manage those transactions that did not happen in q2 but also deliver a very strong q3 from asia for the company charles brennan credit suisse analyst are you able to give us a quantification of the revenue slippage from q2 into q3 bill mcdermott chief executive officer you can basically look at the the only thing you can point out right is the license you were negative 5 or negative 6 depending on what currency you want to look at it instead of flat or up or down 2 and you can attribute it to that region primarily so that s why we re talking about asia today but you got to remember these are a few percentage points if you look at q2 last year put the global trade thing on the shelf for a second our license in q2 last year was down 5 it s a very similar thing to this year so you ve got a lot of things going on in sap s q2 you got sapphire you got a sunday quarter close on june 30th you got the g20 you got the asia supply chain and manufacturing dislocation so i wouldn t react to this because we are reiterating the guidance the pipeline in asia is the highest coverage in terms of the pipe to the conversion of the license in the company so whatever didn t happen will happen and it will happen at a larger scale bill of material we re also very well positioned politically and i think it s very important in these trying times that companies and their brands and their leadership is highly regarded at the top government offices around the world sap is positioned positively whether it s europe the united states or asia and specifically china very very well our brand is very highly thought of there and we ll be in good shape charles brennan credit suisse analyst okay thanks stefan gruber head of investor relations great thank you let s take the next question please operator and we will take our next question from phil winslow with wells fargo please go ahead phil winslow wells fargo analyst hey thanks guys for taking my question obviously we ve spent a lot of time on asia on the call this quarter but i want to focus on europe and germany in particular and some trends that you re seeing there obviously industrial production data points have not been great for germany for several quarters but sap keeps delivering this high single digit 10 growth rates bill and adair too for that matter when you re talking to ceos and customers what continues to drive that performance in europe but also particularly germany bill mcdermott chief executive officer phil thank you for the question i think it s pretty well known that the sap brand is so highly regarded in europe digital transformation sap is at the epicenter of changing business processes whether it s the s 4hana flagship platform or it s the line of business business network and now xm cloud solutions if you look at germany we grew double digits in germany in our business and i don t know too many companies in tech that are growing double digits in germany and our core business is rock solid in germany and our cloud business is doing extremely well again i m on the european roundtable i think i might be the only american on the european roundtable running a substantially sized company i also enjoy that in the business roundtable in the united states and i can tell you that sap is revered in europe and one of the examples i gave on the experience management side was merck you can t talk to a ceo in germany france the uk or anywhere else that isn t talking about sap hana s 4hana the cloud connections and now especially experience management don t forget we re in a big omnichannel in the e commerce world it s mass personalization at scale europe is very concerned with the privacy of consumers we are the british standard institute platinum example of a company that protects the data of the customer and the consumer and in europe especially germany since you mentioned it that s a really big deal so again sap pristine reputation and will continue to do very well and double digit is absolutely where we need to be in europe and we ll stay there adair fox martin president global customer operations i feel very comfortable and very positive about our business in europe and in germany in particular we have a very strong installed base in the german market and a number of our larger transactions this quarter were transactions that were transformational in nature transactions that were moving our customers to the next generation of sap software and transactions that were taking into consideration how experience management could add to the business outcomes of those consumers we have a strong team right across europe with tenure and we have deep relationships with many of our customers so we re looking forward to the ongoing migration of our customers in europe to the next generation technology and next generation experiences for their customers in the market phil winslow wells fargo analyst thanks for the color guys stefan gruber head of investor relations thank you let s take the next question please bill mcdermott chief executive officer thank you phil operator and we will take our next question from stacy pollard with jp morgan please go ahead stacy pollard jp morgan analyst hi thank you very much just looking at networks slowed to 17 constant currency growth in q2 can you give some product trends there maybe say where the weakness is coming from or relative weakness and then is teen a sustainable range or do you think it could get back up to above 20 jennifer morgan president cloud business group this is jennifer so in our business i feel really good about the intelligence spend i don t think that there is anything to be concerned about a couple of the arriba deals slipped into the first second week of july but we feel really good about where we re going with the network business we ve got some great innovation under way and we ll be talking about that a little bit more at our capital markets day so feel very good about the direction of that and the growth bill mcdermott chief executive officer and stacy one thing that s very important feel glass is doing great and concur is the bellwether of all cloud assets in the network and it s doing very very well so there is no reason to think that this thing is slowing down it s going to be ever steady and i think you re going to actually see the growth rate tick up in the q3 and q4 timeframe as well jennifer morgan president cloud business group yeah especially over here in asia concur really blew it out in q2 over here in japan i m in singapore right now and we re doing some pretty interesting partnerships with some of the banks that we re working with so we re excited to share more or that at the capital markets day with what we re doing with the network stefan gruber head of investor relations thank you very much stacy pollard jp morgan analyst very useful thank you stefan gruber head of investor relations thank you let s take the next question please operator and our next question comes from adam wood with morgan stanley please go ahead adam wood morgan stanley analyst hi bill hi luka thanks for taking the question i ve got two if i could just first of all on margins margins are flat on a constant currency basis in the first half i think if i look at the implied guidance we re looking for maybe a 60 basis points improvement for the year luka could you just maybe talk a little bit how you feel about that and maybe help us with the phasing of how restructuring benefits start to flow through to p l did we see most of that already in the second quarter do we see more of that through the full year and maybe the same on the cloud side do we have most of the benefits already in the p l or is there more to come so could you just help us on the linearity and how you feel about where you are this year versus the full year guide on margins that would be great and kind of linked that bill obviously you ve got some fantastic opportunities around cloud and particularly bringing qualtrics into the business and broadening that out could you just talk a little bit as a ceo how you balance driving the efficiency in the business and driving margins higher while making sure you re not cutting things that important to take advantage of the opportunity s things like qualtrics bring thank you bill mcdermott chief executive officer why don t i go first adam then we ll finish up on the important financial questions with luka because i think it s a really important question that you ask very clearly sap is a growth company and we are going to remain a growth company and the way i look at growth i look at hana as the biggest best kept secret of all time we re going after the database market with all we have i look at s 4hana as the flagship platform we ve got lots more growth coming with s 4hana especially as more and more of it comes in the cloud we have a new release in q4 we ll start marketing it in q3 we re going after the upper market and the large enterprise and that hasn t even taken off yet and meanwhile we get 50 of our customers as net new when i think about the line of business the network experience management we ve only scratched the surface with qualtrics as the front end to employee to customer to this whole idea of brand and erp it s going to set the world on fire it s a sensational breakthrough in the way companies can now think of the world from the outside in instead of the inside out and we have the fundamental tools to enable business model innovation at mass scale for companies and individual consumers alike huge growth story now blending that with efficiency we will not be hiring people that do not develop software in sap they have to develop software they do not necessarily have to be domiciled in germany or the united states for that matter we can develop software with the greatest minds in the world and we can do that where the work needs to be done where the best people are and often that s in lower cost locations i might add as well as it relates to sales customer facing assets whether you re selling a customer pre selling a customer putting together the composition of the perfect enterprise and the way we design the experience management and how we engineer that value for a customer and how we implement our software particularly the multifaceted nature of our business we will invest in those kinds of people but the things in the middle hana can do it and the erp system that we run the company on called s 4hana can do it we don t need people now what i will do and i have the complete backing of the cfo and the entire executive board we will manage headcount with an iron fist meaning what we hire into the company falls into what i just told you and they have to be evaluated by several different people before we hire them we have to have the best people in the world in the company so that s the deal where you get not only the growth but you also gain the efficiency now i ll tell you another thing i feel for you watching the restructuring and the over subscription of it and all that but i will also say look that s what gives us the bright horizon we cleaned up the business model we consumed a great company in qualtrics and we gave ourselves some room to make sure that the margin can step up 1 percentage points per year between now and 2023 and even on the cash flow basis the bad news is out the window and all the good stuff is coming your way in 2020 so i ll let luka give his color on it did i answer your question adam adam wood morgan stanley analyst yeah that s great thank you bill bill mcdermott chief executive officer yeah my pleasure luka mucic chief financial officer then let me complete the answer with the margin progression and let s be clear first of all we have very confidently reiterated our guidance for the full year for you can absolutely take it for granted that we will see the implied margin increases that are implied in this guidance we are getting started right now and in the first half year we still had to fight a couple of headwinds from the acquisition front while at the same time the benefits from our restructuring program are really only now starting to trickle in actually the lion s share of the improvements will come to us the far end of the year and then going into 2020 we always believed that the margin uptick in 2019 would be more pronounced in the second half year first of all because of the operation of excellence initiatives needing some time to kick in but equally importantly because the bar is getting lower in the second half year as well if you remember in the second half of 2018 we didn t necessarily have the best progress and best growth rates from a profit and margin perspective now we have set up our cost basis in particular in the cloud we have focused our hiring in those areas where we can really add value we have been extremely disciplined and therefore entering the second half year with much better opportunity coupled also with the relatively lower comparisons on the software license figure in particular in q3 to really outperform and therefore grow the margin similarly on the cloud no of course we are not seeing the end of the journey in terms of our efficiency improvement potential actually it s the beginning as well we have been extremely successful through centralizing cloud delivery and our infrastructure portfolio management including the purchase of hardware to bring own the capex inside the company that was one of the sources that allowed us to expand the cloud margin this is something that we can continue to piggy back on and further drive down the change in the depreciation of hardware that we were able to achieve due to the successful renegotiation of maintenance contracts with our hardware providers it s going to benefit us all the way through the year and we had in q2 the very first quarter of getting the benefits from success factors just to give you an idea in q2 alone due to this move we saved already almost 20 million 18 million to be precise so we are perfectly in line to harvest those roundabout mid double digits that we originally projected for the first year and then the low triple digits going into 2020 from that measure alone and there are still two quarters to come that will see this benefit so from that perspective we are on a very strong trajectory toward the 75 cloud gross margin target for 2023 in fact when we started to talk about this one year ago and also our targets for 2020 when we were hovering around 62 i think i ve been hearing a lot of concerns and question marks about our ability to pull this off well fast forward one year later we have already made half of the way to these 2023 targets that should give everybody a lot of confidence adam wood morgan stanley analyst thank you very much the detail is appreciated luka mucic chief financial officer thank you bill mcdermott chief executive officer thank you adam stefan gruber head of investor relations thank you let s move to the next question please operator and our next question is from mohammed moawalla with goldman sachs please go ahead mohammed moawalla goldman sachs analyst great thank you very much firstly bill can you just give us an update on the cross selling of qualtrics where you are in terms of pipelines and how quickly should we start to see this getting unlocked and where you see this for the biggest opportunities in the near term second point was just to clarify what you said regarding the infrastructure revenue in the cloud that was for go away just to clarify you will be able to fully offset with incremental revenue from the hana cloud platform sales could you clarify that and then thirdly for luka just are we still on track in terms of the migration of arriba off of oracle and i assume that the bulk of that benefit is still ahead of us in terms of gross margin in 2020 but when do you expect that migration to happen and the first quarterly benefit of that to come through thank you bill mcdermott chief executive officer thank you very much for the question mohammed what i ll try to do is try and give you the big picture on qualtrics jennifer morgan can build on that i also will start off answering your question on the infrastructure side by saying very clearly the bookings and the cloud growth trajectory of sap will continue at the robust clip you are accustomed to you can say in certain cases the law of large numbers but i can also say there are very large geographies that are still unconquered with solutions already in our portfolio and don t forget s 4hana we re driving an organic growth strategy in this company and we will take the s 4hana roadshow in the cloud all over the world and that is going to be big don t forget also hana as a service will be hitting hyperscale clouds near you and it s a whole new vector of growth along with analytics and on the sap cloud platform there will be a tremendous opportunity with the sap cloud platform between that and the upselling opportunity of experience management yes any dilutive effect to moving the infrastructure as a service in the embrace program will be compensated for and i want to also be clear i think q2 is a little of an anomaly on the hec business in general because we had new management in there who s doing a great job on making sure the operational excellence of the performance is at the standard of the hyperscalers at least and also to make sure that the business we put into the hana enterprise cloud was at a margin rate commensurate with our commitment to the mid 70s gross margin that luka just talked about in the cloud gross margin so we re just being a little bit more thoughtful when you get a little bit more thoughtful what happens people say what does this mean and it does slow things down in the hec business a little bit but that we re going to reinforce with all hands at the company the white glove business is wide open for business the embrace is wide open for business the fcp component of that and then also turning on the hyperscalers to illuminate the various solutions in the enterprise of sap is open for business and i gave you some color on our flagship products and how we intend to take them to the cloud and rotate them around the global economy to drive the growth machine so don t be nervous about sap s cloud ambition it could not possibly be more resilient perseverant and committed on the part of this management team i think jen might want to add some color on qualtrics and then i think luka s got you on a couple of financial points jennifer morgan president cloud business group thanks bill so we re really pleased with the talent and the momentum there are three areas where we really see the focus no 1 is qualtrics has done a fantastic job just continuing on their own pipeline building sales execution and conversion of their pipeline so that s been a great source of continued growth second is we ve put a real strong focus of enablement and execution with our success factor sales team and they have exceeded all expectations we had of that business in q2 we had great growth and success factors and i really think much of that was driven by the broader conversation from simply talking about hr systems to really employee experience so that was fantastic and then obviously with our cx sales team so those two sales motions through those specialist teams have been really great and we exceeded our expectations quite significantly with the synergies of those teams and then finally just the overall curiosity and excitement from our entire customer base with our global sales team and really talking about what experience management means how o is the what x is they why this past week ryan smith and i were in both korea and japan at our sap select events and those are our ceo events we had several hundred ceos in both countries and this was the focus and i can tell you this plays very very well in asia when you think about just the asian brands have already on understanding experience we had a great week the pipeline s off the charts now we closed our first deals in korea last week and i think we re off to a really great start state department closed as bill said merck closed we closed chalhoub group in uae so i feel really good that we re continuing to execute individually with qualtrics as they continue their growth and get great synergies working together with our team and we ll continue that focus luka mucic chief financial officer yeah and then finally mo just a very quick update on arriba so on arriba all of the applications both on the sourcing and on the procurement side have been migrated successfully by now to hana the same for all of the arriba analytics we are in the process of finalizing the migration for the network element of arriba this will also be done this year and this will set us up then for the significant gross margin increase that we also expect through the migration of arriba of oracle similar to what you are seeing now from success factors as you know our target for the intelligence spend group cloud gross margins is to exceed 80 by 2020 currently we are at around 78 and that full year benefit from being off oracle and on hana in arriba will be a big component of achieving this gain mohammed moawalla goldman sachs analyst great thank you very much stefan gruber head of investor relations thank you we have time for two more questions please operator and our next question will come from michael griest with ubs please go ahead michael griest ubs analyst yes thank you good afternoon and i ll start by congratulating you on the cloud market performance luka i think at the 2017 cmd you said that sap would engage in debt finance buybacks and at sapphire this year you said that capital returns would be paid for from the higher profitability in the business are you ruling out using debt to do further buybacks from here luka mucic chief financial officer as you know we will update on the capital markets on our capital allocation policy thoughts and i will give also a clear picture on how we see the cash flow progression for the company for the next few years so i don t really want to spend at this point of time any thoughts on taking the thunder away from the special capital markets day on november 12th so you will get a full update there and we are preparing for this properly at this point in time we are still under consideration michael griest ubs analyst okay well maybe i could ask on the maintenance it grew 2 which is at the low end of the historical range are you seeing more of a shift now from maintenance customers into the cloud and specifically on s 4 public cloud maybe jennifer could talk about the adoption there either from net new or from install based customers thank you luka mucic chief financial officer yeah let me handle the first part with the maintenance growth rates and then i will actually hand over to christian who is running the s 4 business for some color commentary on the pickup of s 4hana cloud so on the maintenance side there is absolutely no change in paradigms our maintenance at risk rates including the extensions toward cloud or other on premise solutions are actually below the level that we are internally planning for so we are still seeing a very high stickiness in the maintenance offering why is the growth rate smaller in q2 well you need to look back one year to q2 in 2018 where we had an exceptional 7 growth in support revenues that came from the fact that back then we had a very very steep drop in sales allowances due again to a very healthy development of our customer relationships and adoption of our solutions this level of sales allowance has kept at this low level but of course therefore the growth that we are seeing sequentially as well as year over year is smaller so our support fundamentals are in great shape and we continue to be right where we wanted to be and you can see also for the half year with 3 growth this is very robust and you absolutely should expect a similar performance for the full year so nothing more to add on that except for handing over to christian christian klein chief operating officer thank you luka i guess first of all let me outline q2 was definitely one of the best quarters ever for our s 4hana business on the on premise side we have seen double digit growth we already surpassed after half year 1 the 1 billion euro license number and this also of course will have a very positive impact on the correlating support revenue so this also clearly shows that the hybrid strategy we are following is clearly the right one because also we see a very decent business together with adair for the upcoming quarters so s 4hana cloud this is not anymore a small business when we look at the bookings number clearly this solution contributed the most new cloud bookings after concur in q2 the cloud revenue number already doubled year over year and for 2020 we will generate significant revenue one way for sap s cloud subscription revenue stream it s a high shelf new customers coming and also just to outline to give you an example how broad the solution in the meantime is we are still serving in the meantime over 17 industries so 17 industries and the install basis growing and growing on the product side we will deliver this year over 2000 new features across 21 end to end policies so this will be clearly the most comprehensive year peak by the end of the year on the ai side this was always our target to also deliver an innovative cloud suite we are more than confident that we also can increase the productivity for our s 4 cloud customers in their corporations by at least 20 and then in q4 the analytics cloud end equation comes so the real time end equation and then with that a real time steering across the company and qualtrics will be natively integrated to our s 4 core as well also by q4 so net we are very confident also for the half year 2 outlook luka mucic chief financial officer yeah and perhaps just to conclude what christian essentially said now is that by now the combination of digital supply chain management and s 4 is actually already representing more than 60 of our on premise license revenues and that is actually very good news because it is stabilizing use this part of the portfolio still grows on premise and it will continue to grow while the rest has already to a large extent migrated to the cloud and that will also stabilize our on premise performance in the quarters and years to come quite nicely so our midterm projections in terms of negative growth are certainly still prudent michael griest ubs analyst great thank you very much stefan gruber head of investor relations thank you now we move to the last question please operator and our final question will come from stefan slowinski with exane bnp please go ahead stefan slowinski exane bnp analyst hi thanks thanks for taking my question just two related ones one on growth one on hiring on cloud sales growth you mentioned the efficiencies in terms of headcount going forward that could create headwinds in terms of your ability to drive growth so i m just wondering what kind of organization or other sales adjustments you re making that on their own can help you to continue cloud growth and associated to that outside of the hiring discipline that you ve outlined can you give us other examples of steps that are already being taken or already in place as part of the operational excellence program thank you bill mcdermott chief executive officer i ll comment on the overall cloud sales growth and then i ll let luka comment on the efficiency piece of your question stefan a couple things we are hiring salespeople all over the world every day i get a new string of emails on welcoming the next 50 great associates into the company with their pictures and their linkedin accounts and just how happy they are to be here so don t take anything away from the impression of growth in sales headcount we will continue to grow s what we will cut back on is gna because we have hana and we have s 4hana and i think christian gave you a good account of how great that product is so it does the work of thousands of people so gna down s up and that s where we re going as a growth company i also want to make it clear the members of the executive board are accountable for organic growth so we have jennifer morgan now running the cloud business group we built some things and we bought some things and the things that we bought she s accountable for making them even better and growing them around the world and she has a very specific sales force and pre sales force that works in conjunction with adair fox martin on the global customer operation and this way we can be best of breed and best of suite in the manner in which we manage the customer relationship so the customer gets the best of both worlds from sap and the coordination between jen and adair has been long standing as they both managed global customer operations together and have been friends for a long time the other piece is christian klein is accountable for the organic development of the s 4hana flagship and obviously he s giving you great feedback that it s going extremely well and juergen mueller has hana this whole movement of database as a service in the cloud as well as analytics and leonardo and all of these solutions will be front ended by experience management as we compose the intelligent enterprise for our customers so what s different i ll tell you what s different is lots of focus on s lots of focus on organic innovation a very disciplined capital allocation strategy a very brisk pace in our pursuit of 1 point of margin improvement on a per annum basis and holding people accountable for doing a great job and i do mean accountable so that s the environment we re working in and what i want to do is start talking about revenue per employee and how that metric is going to start growing so that gives you an indication of how the place is being steered luka yeah thanks and just to complement this of course just hiring discipline is not a holistic strategy so we have multiple pillars of operational excellence initiatives that we are currently working on again i don t want to go into too much detail here but just to give you a couple of examples we re just currently going through the portfolio round and as i have also talked about at sapphire we have various areas of portfolio overlap that we re currently in process of rationalizing which will benefit the r d efficiency will allow us to continue to invest into developers but invest that not in a duplicative sense the cloud efficiency is very very important and there next to the off oracle initiatives we have the cloud infrastructure centralization the benefits and gains that we get from there we have an excellent prospectus example with qualtrics at the moment they are running their cloud margins at around 90 so we are looking deep into architecturally from an operations perspective from an elasticity perspective what can we learn and adopt and bring over to the rest of the portfolio which is a great opportunity for us as only we can really now as deeply inspect this and then also we have great opportunities on the gna side that we are starting to tap into obviously gna at the beginning of the year got a headwinds because of the acquisition of qualtrics and there is plenty of opportunities to bring that down over time but we are taking for example also steps such as lifting and shifting one complete service center in the finance area into manila in the philippines in a very low cost location therefore you see in gna a little bit more hiring than you would expect at the moment but this is low cost hiring that once the work is handed over will reside in reductions elsewhere and will benefit us on the gna side and again there are many more examples that are already under way but even more importantly new ones that we re just in the process of starting that we will be able to talk more about on november 12th stefan slowinski exane bnp analyst great thank you very much for the information and the color guys bill mcdermott chief
