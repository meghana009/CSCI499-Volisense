january and 9 95 tonnes in december thus bringing overall holdings to 1 874 tonnes or 60 26 million ounces before china went on a gold buying spree in december as part of the country s strategy to shift away from the us dollar the pboc hadn t reported an uptick in its holdings for over two years the official figures persisted from october 2016 and november 2018 china s move towards stockpiling comes amid similar efforts by world central banks to move away from the greenback in january china had the sixth largest gold reserves in the world slightly lagging behind russia russia has also been increasing its gold reserves see russia buys 300 000 ounces of gold in march nears 2 000 tons in gold reserves russia and china continue to work to be in a position to help dethrone the usa dollar they and many other nations are looking into ways to bypass the us dollar last year turkey s president proposed the use of gold instead of the usa dollar to the international monetary fund see turkey repatriates gold and denounces us dollar dominance the populous and economic powerhouse china has also taken various financial and other steps watch also us dollar being challenged by gold petro yuan there is also movement towards the euro part of the intent of the euro was to become the world s dominant reserve currency and while it is not ready for that yet the europeans still expect that to happen speaking of europe romania has proposed repatriating its gold notice the following according to international reports romania is the latest nation that wants its gold back romania s social democrat party psd leader liviu dragnea and psd senator serban nicolae have proposed legislation that requires the national bank of romania bnr to hold most of its gold reserves domestically a description of the bill posted on the senate s website said the national bank of romania can deposit gold from the established reserve abroad exclusively for the purpose of obtaining income through trading and other specific operations the gold deposited by the national bank of romania abroad cannot exceed 5 of the total gold reserve while the central bank does keep some gold in its vaults in bucharest the majority of gold is held in the united kingdom with the bank of england the proposed legislation has been filed for debate in the senate under urgent procedure notice something also from last march march 13 2018 hungarian national bank mnb to repatriate 100 000 ounces gold from bank of england follows trend of netherlands germany austria and belgium each looking to bring gold back to home soil this is not an unusual move in recent years we have seen the likes of germany venezuela and the netherlands each repatriate their gold from various locations gold gives each of these countries independence from the us dollar amid financial sanctions trade wars and ongoing posturing by the west whilst many in the west are dismissive about gold the behaviour of central banks suggests quite a different mindset gold cannot be devalued as the euro dollar sterling and all fiat currencies currently are by adding gold to their reserves they are gaining equal footing with western banks who have so far tried to dominate under a us centric financial system partially because of nationalism partially because of brexit partially because of sanctions threats and partially because of moves to not be as dependent upon the us dollar various nations have been repatriating and or increasing gold reserves while the bible does not show that china or russia will be the premier trading nations during the great tribulation the bible does show that gold will have value during that time 40 at the time of the end 43 he shall have power over the treasures of gold and silver daniel 11 40 43 14 and the wealth of all the surrounding nations shall be gathered together gold silver and apparel in great abundance zechariah 14 14 12 merchandise of gold and silver precious stones and pearls 16 alas alas that great city that was clothed in fine linen purple and scarlet and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls revelation 18 12 16 4 the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls revelation 17 4 there are no similar statements backing up the future value of paper items like the us dollar or the british pound scripture indirectly teaches their elimination for details see anglo america in prophecy the lost tribes of israel daniel 11 24 shows that the european leader mentioned in daniel 11 40 43 the king of the north will somehow also be accumulating wealth prior to this time and that may involve gold accumulation cf daniel 11 38 perhaps to back up a european supported currency he also may end up with personal and or national gold reserves and or wealth from the vatican the vatican has a vast amount of wealth and is prophesied to be improperly involved with the kings of the earth in the end times per revelation 17 the bible teaches that in the end time the highly indebted nation will be taken over habakkuk 2 2 8 no nation is more indebted than the usa and on a per capita basis the uk is one of the most indebted they will be taken over and conquered during the great tribulation matthew 24 21 daniel 11 39 watch also do these 7 prophesies point to the end of the usa increased usa debt combined with gold accumulation by various nations points to economic disaster in the usa s future cf habakkuk 2 6 8 the usa dollar instead of being the world s premier currency will be worth no more than the scrap sentimental value of the cotton paper its notes are printed on china russia and europe are taking steps we are getting closer to the start of the great tribulation see also when will the great

people walk past a foreign exchange outlet in buenos aires argentina agence france presse argentina has a new debt worry the country s pile of short term leliq notes has broken through 1 trillion pesos around 24 billion a potential strain on the central bank s coffers and a fresh headache for the government in an election year the leliq debt denominated in pesos and auctioned daily to mostly domestic banks helps the central bank mop up funds in the market to bolster a weak currency and bring down stubborn inflation but with sky high interest rates it is also raising concerns that it could become unsustainable the spike in the short term government debt instrument is significant in a country where a tumbling peso stalling growth and problems repaying debt last year led to an emergency 56 billion deal with the international monetary fund if investors start thinking that this is a problem then it could become a self fulfilling prophecy said carlos de sousa senior latin america economist at oxford economics banks could be discouraged from holding leliqs the interest will go up further and that may end up in the bcra central bank having to rethink its monetary policy framework once again a central bank spokesman said when inflation was taken into account the rise in leliq volumes was considerably more moderate monthly inflation in january was 2 9 per cent and is expected to rise around 32 per cent this year the central bank auctioned around 200 billion pesos in leliq notes on wednesday at a four month high average interest rate of 63 328 per cent with net leliq debt rising above the trillion peso mark for the first time this week according to official bank data and traders in theory if rates remained elevated that could put the government on the line for annual interest of around 600 billion pesos or more considering compound interest most analysts expect rates to drop though they have spiked again recently rates peaked at over 70 per cent in october before easing to just above 40 per cent last month as economic fears abated however higher than expected inflation and renewed fears about the peso have forced rates back up sharply over the last month the issue would arise if high rates created a snowball effect with leliq notes some analysts said as the central bank issued more of the instrument to repay the debt leliqs set the benchmark lending rate and are a main tool to control inflation the face value of leliqs is really high now so we need to watch it closely said juan lezica a buenos aires based economist with consultancy acm it starts to get a bit dangerous if it continues to grow at this rate rating agency moody s said on wednesday the high rates were negative for the country s banks because they increased loan delinquencies and stymied economic activity the sharp ramp up of high interest leliq debt underscores how argentina s central bank is having to fire on all cylinders to defend the peso which lost half its value against the dollar last year and draw down inflation running at nearly 50 per cent high interest peso debt encourages banks to keep their money in the currency rather than moving it into safer dollars a trend which last year pummeled the peso argentine president mauricio macri also wants to avoid a flight from the peso at all costs which would destabilize an already fragile economic situation and derail his plans to seek re election when the country heads to the polls in october eric ritondale buenos aires based economist at consultancy econviews said if markets remained stable then the central bank should be able to turn over the rising leliq debt but that rates up twenty points in the last month were the issue the amount of leliq itself doesn t worry me so much he said what worries me is that rates have gained so much again after their lows earlier this year meanwhile most latin american currencies rose against a softer dollar on wednesday after data supported hopes the us federal reserve would be patient about raising borrowing costs in the world s top economy us producer prices barely rose in february reinforcing the fed s wait and see approach on further rate raises this year the data aided broad risk appetite in emerging markets which were battered in 2018 as the dollar strengthened on multiple rate hikes a weaker us dollar would ease global funding conditions and may work in favor of prolonging the global economic expansion morgan stanley strategists wrote in a note mexico s peso rose 0 3 per cent half the gain local stocks saw data showed industrial activity in latin america s second largest economy rose 0 6 per cent in january from the previous month further supporting sentiment reuters
overview the brexit drama continues to play out and the withdrawal bill that has been twice defeated is ironically not dead yet today s vote in fact is predicated on another meaningful vote before seeking an extension sterling remains firm near yesterday s highs which were the best levels since last june poor chinese data was a drag on asian equities where the shanghai composite fell by more than 1 for the second consecutive session european shares are holding in better with around a 0 25 gain through the morning led by energy the disruption of supply from venezuela talk opec may extend output cuts and a large drawdown in the us inventories have lifted oil prices to new highs for the year 68 a barrel for brent and about 58 5 a barrel of wti front month futures after falling every day last week the s p 500 is taking a three day rally into today s session core benchmark 10 year yields are a little firmer though the yield on 10 year gilts jumped more than four basis points peripheral yields are a little softer the dollar is firmer against all the major currencies near midday in europe the yen is experiencing its biggest loss in a couple of weeks 0 45 ahead of what is expected to be a dovish hold by the boj tomorrow the weak chinese data weighed on the antipodean currencies asia pacific the weakness of the chinese economy which has prompted a government campaign to reverse it and the distortions caused by the lunar new year make it difficult to read too much into the latest data industrial output slows to 5 3 from 6 0 in january economists expected a 5 6 gain retail sales slowed to an 8 2 gain the slowest since 2012 it was in line with expectations but contrasts with the 9 0 rise in january registered unemployment rose to a two year high of 5 3 from 4 9 investment was the exception it sequentially improved fixed asset investment rose to 6 1 from 5 9 and property investment rose 11 6 after a 9 5 rise in january the bank of japan s meeting concludes tomorrow the focus has been on the central bank s economic assessment recall that the japanese economy contracted 0 7 in q3 and expanded by 0 3 in q4 the first quarter is off to a weak start the boj may downgrade its assessment of output and exports however it is unlikely to announce fresh policy initiatives the hike in the sales tax set for october 1 and prime minister abe ran his last campaign defending it against an opposition that wanted to postpone it again or cancel it outright the political hurdles are high the indian rupee is slightly softer today but it is stronger for the fifth consecutive week late yesterday the central bank announced plans to hold a three year auction for 5 bln swaps the ostensible goal is to provide longer term liquidity to the banks but some suspect it is also a preemptive move as inflows into india may be expected around the election that begins next month inflows into indian stocks so far here in q1 are running a little over 4 bln surpassing both south korea and taiwan the dollar which was testing jpy111 00 yesterday is near jpy111 70 session highs near midday in europe the intraday technicals are stretched suggesting that north american dealers may not be inclined to push it much higher the dollar has traded above jpy112 a couple of times earlier this month but has been unable to close above it since december 19 the australian dollar is being turned back from 0 7100 which also houses the 20 day moving average initial support is seen in the 0 7040 0 7050 area but the 0 7000 that was approached last week and may have benefitted from an option defense is critical to the medium term outlook the us dollar initially tested the cny6 70 level before bouncing to cny6 7180 which corresponds to the 20 day moving average this week and last week s highs were seen closer to cny6 7270 which at the time also matched the 20 day moving average this area may continue to cap the dollar s upside europe there are three numbers from the uk yesterday that may help capture this surreal moment first 278 members of the house of commons voted to leave the eu yesterday without a deal and without assurances of a delay second 164 members voted to malthouse amendment that would have sought a two month delay to prepare for leaving without a deal third despite the mess of things the latest poll of voter intentions show the main opposition party cannot get out of its own way the tories are at 41 and labour at 31 the liberal democrat support is seen at 8 and the greens and ukip are polling around 6 prime minister may has argued that only three options the negotiated plan no deal and no exit her brinkmanship strategy is still playing out despite how it may appear after the votes of the past two days all three options remain the perceived reduced chance of leaving without an agreement has helped lift sterling the bill today assumes that there will be at least another vote on the twice defeated withdrawal bill next week if it passes may is prepared to ask for a short extension to pass the appropriate legislation if it does not pass by the eve of the eu summit on march 20 the eu would determine the length of the delay eu president tusk is pressing for a long extension the idea that a delay can turn into a reversal is being played up and those like the mayor of london calling for revoking article 50 provide fodder for such arguments may s brinkmanship tactics are spurring speculation that the democratic unionist party dup and part of the brexiter s erg could be persuaded to endorse the withdrawl bill in exchange for some political chit like the resignation of the prime minister the euro poked through the 61 8 retracement of this month s decline yesterday that was found just above 1 1325 the euro held above it for most of the asian session before easing in the european morning narrow ranges persist as the single currency has been confined to a quarter of a cent there are roughly 740 mln euros struck at 1 1285 that expire today and another 1 1 bln euro option at 1 1250 that rolls off too the euro s four day rally is at risk in contrast sterling s range today is already a cent it is consolidating within yesterday s range yesterday s high was set near 1 3380 today s low has been 1 3240 there is a nearly gbp300 mln option at 1 3250 that gets cut today there is another option for closer to gbp200 mln at 1 3200 for which the intraday technicals do no seem to rule out a test america both the us ppi and cpi reports this week have been soft many say that this reinforces the fed s patience yet the fed and investors appear to be looking past q1 data yes it is soft the combination of the government shutdown the cold weather and what seems to be some sort of seasonal pattern since the great finance crisis of weak q1 growth investors still seem to be impressed with the underlying resilience of the economy today the us reports import export prices weekly jobless claim and new home sales these reports are not what typically moves the foreign exchange market when the stock markets were selling off at the end of 2018 president trump expressed some sense of urgency to strike a deal yesterday he indicated he was not in a hurry it is not clear whether this is part of the negotiations two things do seem clear first the two presidents will not be meeting later this month next month as the soonest but it does not sound close to being a lock second the tariffs remain in place the softer core us inflation readings partly reflect to decline in food prices which had been targeted by retaliatory tariffs the canadian dollar s four day rally may end today before the contrasting employment reports last week the us dollar was near cad1 3450 cad1 3460 it dipped a little below cad1 3290 where bids were found in the european morning initial resistance is seen near cad1 3350 now mexico reported stronger than expected january industrial production yesterday 0 6 vs 0 1 median forecasts the peso did not draw much comfort the us dollar continues to trade at the lower end of tuesday s range where the lower end is seen near mxn19 24 initial resistance is pegged near mxn19 35 the s p 500 reached a four month high yesterday it has advanced for the last three sessions after falling all five last week

economy whose slowdown this year will increase the volatility and the uncertainty in the financial sector says daniel titelman chief of the economic development division of the un economic commission

protracted struggle over political and resource control a silver lining thus far has been the andean economies without which the whole region could look forward to an even slower pace of growth

primary result of 1 of the gdp in 2019 both initiatives are scaring investors given these uncertainties the imf has revised its estimate for mexican gdp growthto 2 from 2 1 last october even that may be erring too far in a positive direction some analysts say the services sector would be a huge source of growth but it has reduced its pace during the last one and a half years says marco oviedo head of latin america economics research at barclays underlining the government s lack of attention to segments with high growth potential the estimate of 2 gdp growth this year is optimistic it is possible that the country will reach only 1 5 an expected drop in oil production threatens additional downward pressure a consequence of the government s failure to invest in pemex and uncertainty regarding approval of the united states mexico canada agreement usmca the rewrite of nafta by the us congress on the positive side mexico can profit from its openness to chinese electronic investors its automobile exports to europe and tourism oviedo adds vigorous bank lending could spur faster growth but to play that role the banking system would require reform right now ovideo says banks are reluctant to boost lending having been spooked by the 1990s banking crisis total outstanding debt in mexico corresponds to 25 of gdp according to oviedo while in chile it equals 50 mexico is open to the entrance of foreign banks but the risk perception is still high with the banks serving only a narrow customer base most borrowers resort to the sofomes mexico s network of some 1 400 multipurpose often unregulated financial lenders which charge higher interest rates yet the new administration is showing no signs of pushing reforms that would give lower income individuals and small businesses greater access to the mainstream banking system oviedo says brazil focusing on pension reform under its new president jair bolsonaro the first far right chief of state since the military dictatorship that ended in 1985 brazil appears set for another year of low gdp growth for 2019 both the imf and eclac estimate expansion of 2 5 better than the 1 3 the country achieved in 2018 but still below potential titelman cites low inflation and rising public and private investments as key factors pointing to improvement in 2019 economists as well as investors are watching closely the progress of pension reform which many regard as key to brazil s economic fortunes reducing pension payouts is an unpopular objective that one government after another has postponed for the last 20 years while public debt and deficits have increased bolsonaro has pledged to support pension reductions but no one can be sure how the new congress fragmented into 27 political parties will vote the imf and eclac growth estimates may come through even if pension austerity doesn t some argue it is not enough for huge optimism but this 2 growth will happen even if pension reform is not approved says titelman the pension reform implementation market openness and a privatization plan all promised by the government can improve the growth rate even more this or next year but they are not yet guaranteed sérgio valle chief economist at mb associados anticipates that if pension reform is approved bolsonaro s administration will have the chance to move on to tax reform which is demanded by industry otherwise this will be difficult a gdp growth above 3 next year depends on pension reform approval with no reform the country is doomed to recession valle says there is no plan b the cost of the pension system to the public account is the highest in the world the new market oriented administration s agenda has its troubling elements bolsonaro s most radical ministers those responsible for foreign affairs education and human rights are promoting policies that could raise uncertainties for powerful productive sectors including agribusiness and lower the country s already poor educational standards nevertheless general motors has announced 10 billion reais 2 73 billion in investments in brazil from 2020 to 2024 to better position it to meet not only the growing demand in brazil but to better serve the entire mercosur customs union argentina wrenching recession brazil s mercosur partner argentina will endure negative growth of 1 6 this year according to imf and eclac projections following a 2 6 retraction in 2018 this second year of wrenching recession is the result in part of the fiscal and monetary austerity adopted under president mauricio macri argentina suffered a huge financial shock last year that has forced it to embrace macroeconomic changes and to ask the imf for help specifically a three year 57 billion bailout lending program titelman notes the country s economic outcome will improve from the second quarter of 2019 when household income should rise influenced by the agricultural harvest

executive summary in the second of a series of reports examining how the fed s framework and toolkit may evolve in the coming years we discuss the potential for the federal open market committee fomc to employ negative interest rate policy nirp in a future downturn the experience of other central banks with nirp in recent years shows that there do not seem to be inordinate costs associated with negative rates but nirp does not appear to be a panacea either we conclude that the fed could potentially add nirp to its toolkit if the next downturn is severe enough but that it may need to employ other policies as well to stimulate the economy never say never as we discussed in the first report in this series the federal reserve is currently undertaking a review of its monetary policy strategy and its policy tools so that it is prepared to combat future downturns 1 we concluded in our first report that the fed may adopt a strategy to help it raise inflationary expectations thereby reducing the time that its policy rates remain near 0 which at one time was widely believed to be their effective lower bound elb but other central banks have discovered in recent years that 0 is not necessarily the elb that is central banks in the eurozone i e the ecb denmark japan sweden and switzerland have all adopted nirp in recent years by taking policy rates below 0 these central banks have been able to guide market determined short term interest rates into negative territory as well in 2016 when the cpi inflation rate in the united states was hovering at only 1 then fed chair janet yellen said that she would not rule out using nirp in the future but she also acknowledged that the fed would need to closely study the pros and cons of negative interest rates before it would employ the tool in the event the fomc never cut its policy rates below 0 but could the fed follow the lead of other major central banks by slashing its own policy rates into negative territory at some point in the future is it even possible for the fed to do so the mechanics of going negative in a previous report we noted that the federal reserve has been using two administered rates to keep the fed funds rate within a 25 bps range figure 1 2 the top of the range has effectively been set by the interest rate that banks receive for the excess reserves they hold at the fed the so called interest on overnight excess reserves ioer 3 government sponsored enterprises e g fannie mae and freddie mac also hold deposits at the fed but these gses are not entitled to receive interest on these deposits if these gses were to flood the fed funds market with deposits the fed funds rate could move below the fomc s target range therefore the fed has introduced a reverse repurchase rate rrp facility by which gses can lend deposits to the fed thereby minimizing their supply in the fed funds market 4 the rate that the fed pays on the rrp facility sets the lower bound of the target range for the fed funds rate in order for the fed to bring about negative market rates it would need to move its target range for the fed funds rate below 0 would american banks be willing to accept negative rates on the excess reserves that they hold at the fed as shown in figure 2 the deposits that banks in the euro area hold at the ecb have mushroomed since 2014 despite the ecb s deposit rate being negative suggesting that american banks could also be willing to accept a negative interest rate although u s banks would be paying interest to the fed it would essentially be for an overnight risk free loan they are making to the fed the alternative would be to make loans to households and businesses that have some degree of inherent risk moreover banks have an incentive to hold excess reserves at the fed as those holdings help banks meet their regulatory liquidity coverage ratio 5 what about at the lower bound would gses and the other financial institutions that have access to the rrp facility be willing to accept negative rates on rrps probably because the alternative for them would be to lend their cash at rates that could be even more negative in sum it seems that the fed could technically take its targeted range for the fed funds rate into negative territory but are there other considerations that could make it leery of going negative do negative rates squeeze banks an oft discussed problem with negative interest rates is their potential adverse effect on the banking system one possible source of concern is a fear that consumers would pull their deposits from commercial banks with the implementation of negative rates however commercial banks in economies with negative interest rates have been reluctant to charge their customers interest on their deposits and deposits have continued to rise in those economies since they implemented nirp the takeaway for the federal reserve is that american banks probably would not experience deposit flight if the fomc cut its policy rates below 0 another issue often discussed in the context of negative rates and the banking sector is bank profitability a negative central bank deposit rate effectively charges commercial banks to hold reserves at the central bank and in theory should suppress banks interest income from lending activity critics often point to europe s banking sector woes as evidence that negative interest rates are a detriment to the profitability of banks however return on equity for euro area banks has generally risen since the ecb implemented negative rates while the same measure for swedish banks has been essentially flat since that country s central bank first cut rates into negative territory figure 3 research conducted at the international monetary fund suggests that faced with negative interest rates banks have typically been able to offset lower interest income with lower funding costs helping to stabilize profitability 6 meanwhile if there is in fact an adverse effect from nirp on bank profitability it does not seem to be hampering bank lending as shown in figure 4 growth in bank lending to non financial corporates in the eurozone and sweden slowed markedly in 2012 2013 likely reflecting stresses from the european sovereign debt crisis however loan growth has generally been positive in the negative rates era in these economies the swiss national bank went negative in january 2015 yet bank lending in switzerland has risen roughly 10 over the past four years to be sure economies that have implemented nirp have not necessarily seen stunning rates of growth in bank lending and lending growth generally remains subdued relative to pre crisis highs however this a phenomenon seen across a wider range of countries that have not implemented nirp including the united states in our view the takeaway for fed policymakers is that negative interest rates do not seem to have a clear detrimental effect on bank profitability or lending activity would money market mutual funds implode adverse effects on money market mutual funds mmmfs from negative interest rates are another area of potential concern mutual fund companies generally buy the short term obligations of governments and financial institutions and then sell shares to the public as such mmmfs provide an important financing vehicle for these sectors if negative rates diminished the attractiveness of mmmfs to the extent that investors were less willing to buy shares the financing of governments and financial institutions could be adversely affected at their peak in early 2009 the value of mmmfs in the eurozone totaled nearly 800 billion figure 5 this outstanding amount fell by roughly 50 by early 2014 but this marked drop largely occurred as the ecb was cutting its deposit rate to 0 00 in july 2012 from 3 25 in november 2008 the value of mmmfs has risen by approximately 100 billion since the ecb first implemented nirp in june 2014 although the value remains well short of the previous peak it is hard to make a convincing argument that negative rates have had a detrimental effect on mmmfs in the eurozone a similar pattern has occurred with mmmfs in the united states that is the value of mmmfs peaked in late 2008 and then subsequently trended lower until 2012 figure 6 although the fed has raised rates 225 bps since december 2014 the value of mmmfs in the united states is not materially higher today than it was when the fed first began to tighten policy in short the level of interest rates does not seem to have a key effect on the value of american mmmfs if the experience of the eurozone is a useful guide then the federal reserve probably does not need to be unduly concerned that negative rates could lead to significant outflows from mmmfs in the united states bubble trouble by depressing market determined interest rates nirp can be stimulative for growth to the extent that it raises prices for real and financial assets in the economy however if rates are negative for too long the policy could potentially lead to excessive risk taking and bubbles in financial markets let s start with the equity market since the ecb adopted nirp in june 2014 the stock market in the eurozone is essentially flat on balance and the swedish stock market is not much higher figure 7 the japanese stock market is up about 25 since the bank of japan cut rates into negative territory in january 2016 but is a 25 gain over a 25 month period really a bubble 7 real estate prices could also be pushed up excessively by negative interest rates in germany real house prices are up more than 15 since the ecb adopted nirp in june 2014 figure 8 that said german house prices are more or less flat on a real basis since the turn of the century so it s difficult to make a convincing case that there is a bubble in the german housing market the same can be said for real house prices in switzerland and japan but real house prices in sweden have risen by 15 since the swedish riksbank implemented nirp in february 2015 and they have climbed by more than 60 since the depths of the global financial crisis when the swedish central bank slashed its policy rates could nirp or more broadly an extraordinary degree of monetary policy accommodation have led to a bubble in the swedish housing market maybe but that does not necessarily mean that the riksbank should have refrained from cutting rates into negative territory economists have long known that it is difficult to successfully target multiple objectives with only one policy instrument the swedish riksbank adopted nirp in an effort to keep cpi inflation at its target rate of 2 the primary mandate that the swedish government has given the central bank in order to achieve this target inflation rate and prevent a house price bubble the central bank would need another policy instrument enter macro prudential policy authorities could make it more difficult for a property bubble to inflate by for example directing banks to reduce loan to value ltv ratios raising capital requirements on mortgage lending etc designing and implementing macro prudential policy brings its own challenges but such policies would likely be an important complement to nirp from a financial stability perspective conclusion so what is the verdict on negative rates on the one hand there do not seem to be inordinate costs associated with nirp deposits have not drained out of banks in economies where negative interest rates are in place bank profitability has held up in those economies and bank lending has not collapsed the mmmf industry has also survived nirp may have contributed to a potential housing bubble in sweden but authorities could adopt macro prudential policies to reduce the potential for bubbles to develop in the real estate market and in financial markets more broadly on the other hand however nirp does not appear to be a panacea either bank lending in economies with negative rates is up but lending growth rates have not been especially strong moreover economic growth rates have generally been lackluster real gdp growth has averaged only 1 9 percent per annum since 2014 in both the eurozone and switzerland and japanese economic growth remains sluggish we conclude that the federal reserve could potentially add nirp to its toolkit if the next downturn is severe enough obviously the fomc would need to cut rates all the way back to 0 before implementing nirp but the mixed results that other central banks have experienced with negative rates in the current cycle suggest that the fed may need to employ other policies in conjunction with nirp to jumpstart the economy for example the fed turned to quantitative easing qe and forward guidance to provide monetary accommodation in the early years of this expansion could the fomc use these tools again we will address that question in our next report 1 see two thine own inflation target be true march 4 2019 2 see getting technical managing the fed funds rate november 29 2018 3 the fed has made two technical adjustments to ioer to help keep the fed funds rate in the middle of the fomc s target range see footnote 2 4 other financial institutions such as asset managers and broker dealers can also participate in the rrp facility although these institutions do not hold deposits at the fed allowing them access to the facility helps

expert observation when i was in my early 20s i thought socialism might be the way to go two things happened one i studied economics which led me to the conclusion that socialism heavy state intervention doesn t lead to the best outcome in terms of living standards for most second i had the benefit of a trip to the ussr before it and the eastern bloc disintegrated it must have been paul mccartney s faux beach boys back in the ussr that got me interested sure the history and scenery were fantastic and i like the fact that i saw it before the wall came down but economically it was a mess and trying to spend excess roubles before we left the ussr was a struggle nothing but off chocolate to spend them on socialism seemed to work a bit better in the deutsche democratic republic but not really and it was a relief to come through checkpoint charlie knowing decent food mcdonald s was waiting so i ended up gravitating to the centre with the view that the best approach is to allow a market economy with the government providing a good safety net education and intervening where there are market failures but a wise man told me when i was young that it s best to start off on the left when you are young otherwise you will end being like attila the hun as you move to the right as you age given the tendency for the young to start off on the left its no surprise to see younger generations favour a bigger role for government in what the economist magazine has dubbed millennial socialism if the millennials and gen z follow the normal pattern they will shift to the right as they age like their forebears so nothing new well maybe but there is a big difference now compared to the 1980s back in the 1980s the political pendulum or technically the median voter was moving to the right so my ageing was in tune with a big picture political cycle now the pendulum is swinging left we first looked at this three years ago since then it s become more evident this note looks at what s driving it and what it means for investors political cycles beyond elections just as the weather economies and financial markets go in cycles so it is with politics even beyond standard electoral cycles this has been clearly evident over the last century 1930s 1970s the great depression gave rise to a fear of deflation and high unemployment and a scepticism of free markets the political pendulum swung to the left and culminated in the economic disaster of the high tax protectionism growing state intervention and the welfare state of the late 1960s and 1970s that gave rise to stagflation 1980s 2000s stagflation and the failure of heavy government intervention gave rise to popular support for the economic rationalist right of centre policies of the 1980s thatcher reagan and hawke and keating ushered in a period of deregulation freer trade privatisation lower marginal tax rates tougher restrictions on access to welfare measures to reign in budget deficits and other supply side economic reforms designed to boost productivity the middle class didn t support higher taxes on the rich because they aspired to be rich this was all helped along by the collapse of communism and the integration of the old ussr and china into global trade the political pendulum swung to the right and there was talk of the end of history with general agreement that free market democracies were the way to go 2010 but post the global financial crisis gfc it seems the pendulum is swinging to the left again and support for economic rationalist policies seems to be fading if not reversing what s pushing the political pendulum to the left this reflects a range of factors in particular the feeling that the gfc indicated financial de regulation had gone too far constrained and fragile economic growth in recent years stagnant real wages and incomes for median households high household debt levels preventing individuals from taking on more debt as a way to boost living standards rising levels of inequality and perceptions that it s unfair the perceived failure of the baby boomer generation of political leaders to do much about climate change examples of big business doing the wrong thing a backlash against immigration in some countries and a backlash against globalisation of course it s being aided by a dimming of memories of stagflation of the 1970s and its causes and the failures of socialism as highlighted by the ussr although venezuela provides a current example so government related solutions or socialism seem more attractive allied to this are economic theories like modern monetary theory or rather magic mushroom theory that contends governments can borrow and spend freely in the current environment of spare capacity globally spurred along by the crazy argument that quantitative easing did not cause hyper inflation and higher interest rates so why should bigger budget deficits of these rising inequality and perceptions of stagnant living standards are the big ones the next chart shows the gini coefficient which is about the best measure of income inequality calculated on incomes after taxes and transfers it ranges from zero or perfect equality to one indicating perfect inequality with one household individual receiving all income the key point is that there has been a general trend higher in inequality during the past 30 years this is particularly evident in the emerging world but also the us uk and australia rising levels of income inequality also appears to have come with increase in wealth inequality rising inequality may have been more bearable or masked in the 1990s and 2000s as nominal income was rising faster and households took on debt to boost their living standards but in recent times this has become harder and so rising inequality is leading to a backlash the political response in this environment often populist politicians have been able to easily tap into voter anger and argue the case for greater public sector involvement in the economy this was evident in support for self declared socialist bernie sanders and donald trump in the us in 2016 although trump s focus on deregulation and tax cuts look like a temporary deviation right it s now even more evident in the democrats with the green new deal that plans to rid the us of carbon emissions and planes cows in a decade and 2020 democrat presidential aspirants adopting variations of bernie sanders policies with proposals for wealth taxes and a 70 tax rate for income above 10 million which is supported by 59 of americans it s also evident in less us public concern about rising public debt it s been evident in the brexit vote in the uk which represented a backlash against globalisation and the left wing turn in the british labour party under jeremy corbyn in australia we are seeing an intensification of theleft right divide not seen since1970s the alp is far from the economic rationalist policies of hawke and keating policies of higher taxes for the big end of town bringing back the budget repair levy and winding back various tax concessions significantly increased spending on health and education some reregulation of the labour market and talk of raising the minimum wage to become a living wage all suggest a populist focus reflecting a change in voter preferences the same pressures are also evident in some ways in proposed intervention in the energy sector qualifications of course there are various qualifications to this leftward shift first it s most evident in anglo countries because it s here that the swing to the right and economic rationalism was most pronounced in the 1980s and 90s and where inequality is more of an issue europe never fully bought into the supply side revolution of thatcher and reagan and inequality has not risen much in fact france under macron looks to be embarking on its own version of thatcherism with the yellow jacket protests proving nothing more than that macron is actually doing something which should augur well for its long term prospects if macron stays the course second it s arguable that if the democrats are to win the us presidential election next year they have to win the mid west and a socialist presidential candidate may not cut it there third even many on the left are sceptical of ever larger budget deficits eg in australia the alp has been talking of a stronger budgetary position finally there is an argument that a modest move left is necessary to curb the rise in inequality and so save capitalism much as keynesian economics saved it after the great depression but what does it all mean for investors the risk over time is that a more left leaning electorate will mean a tendency towards bigger government bigger budget deficits more regulation higher effective top marginal tax rates less globalisation and tougher rules on immigration in some countries or it may just mean a stalling in economic reforms the risk is that it will act as another constraint on productivity and economic growth and eventually see higher inflation if the supply side of the economy suffers it s worth putting this in context the swing in the political pendulum to the right and the economic rationalist supply side policies of deregulation privatisation smaller government tax cuts low inflation globalisation that followed along with the peace dividend from the collapse of communism and attractively high starting point dividend yields and bond yields created a powerful tail wind that drove strong returns in shares and bonds starting in the early 1980s now the environment is very different starting point investment yields are ultra low for most assets and a reversal of economic rationalist policies in favour re regulation higher taxes and more government risk slowing productivity growth and eventually resulting in higher inflation the key point is that the powerful tailwind from the economic rationalist policies deregulation smaller government and globalisation is now behind us and is contributing along with a range of other factors to a much more constrained return environment for investors our medium term projection for the investment return from a balanced mix of assets have been steadily declining in recent years and is now running around 6 4 pa which is down from over 10 a decade ago in this environment there is a strong case to focus on investment strategies targeting the achievement over time of goals defined in terms of returns investment income or whatever is required and using a flexible approach to do so as opposed to relying solely on set and forget strategies that depend heavily on market based returns there is also a case to look out for assets that may buck the trend of constrained returns as support for economic rationalist policies recede french shares may be worth looking at dr shane oliver is the head of investment strategy and chief economist for amp capital
use the lexology getting the deal through tool to compare the answers in this article with those from other jurisdictions overview policies in general terms what policy has your jurisdiction adopted towards islamic finance are islamic finance products regulated differently from conventional instruments what has been the legislative approach with its population of 30 million and traditional islamic roots uzbekistan is probably one of the most promising markets for islamic financing in central asia but it is fair to say that until recently the banking and financial services sector and business in uzbekistan have had limited exposure to and understanding of islamic finance despite the active presence of the islamic development bank idb and investment albeit limited in scope from islamic countries and investment institutions uzbekistan has not adopted a level playing field approach towards islamic finance islamic finance has become a relatively recent trend across central asia mainly through promotion of ties between central governments in the region islamic development agencies and islamic investment funds uzbekistan has traditionally been selective in its approach to foreign borrowing with very low levels of reliance on world capital markets for funding its domestic economy the state s attitude to islamic finance is consistent with its overarching philosophy of cautious and gradual implementation of reforms natural and growing demand for islamic finance instruments in uzbekistan contrasts with the absence of a regulatory platform to accommodate islamic finance and shariah compliant investments uzbekistan is a secular state with largely islamic population and any legislative reform involving adoption of shariah based principles must be a fine balancing act the key laws such as the civil code the tax code and laws on banking and investment do not refer to islamic finance or to islamic financial instruments it is therefore important that islamic finance and islamic banking instruments are first recognised as a legislative concept before any regulatory mechanisms are put in place in its lending policy the idb employs islamic finance principles and it does so next to donors operating conventional financial instruments in the absence of a specific regulatory regime the idb and islamic investment and finance institutions rely on the use of existing conventional legislation to pursue their agenda in uzbekistan market development how well established is islamic finance in your jurisdiction are islamic windows permitted in your jurisdiction as noted above islamic finance has seen a gradual rise from being an almost non existent concept in the early days of uzbekistan s independence to becoming a popular trend in recent times although the history of uzbekistan s engagement with the idb dates back to 1992 and the financing of pilot infrastructure projects it was not until the government of uzbekistan approved a programme of cooperation between uzbekistan and the idb in 2004 that islamic finance became available for private and public sector development on a large scale in uzbekistan in 2003 uzbekistan joined the idb with full membership in the islamic corporation for the development of the private sector icd from 2004 in accordance with the 2011 2013 cooperation programme approved at the idb s 36th annual board meeting the main focus of the idb s operation is in infrastructure development and financing of structural reforms total financing available under this cooperation programme is us 655 5 million the total amount of credit funds and investments of the bank in 38 projects in uzbekistan s economy is over us 1 billion as an example the idb provided financing to the government of uzbekistan in 2013 for the purchase of two boeing aircraft for the national air carrier a deal worth us 270 million according to the idb press release in may 2017 the idb has approved us 300 million for the construction of rural residential housing and supporting water and transport infrastructure across uzbekistan it is expected that almost 30 000 rural households will benefit from the project the saudi fund for development and kuwait fund for arab economic development are among key islamic lending institutions in the arab world with which uzbekistan has an established track record of cooperation in financing infrastructure development projects typically such projects are assigned to state owned companies or banks with state shareholding analysis of recent trends suggests a steady increase in lending volumes attracted through islamic finance institution private sector initiatives launched by the icd a private sector lending arm of the idb include interventions with private banks and smes its approach to lending is based on shariah compliant principles that are adapted to the requirements of the existing conventional regulatory environment independent shariah advisory and consultancy agencies such as the alhuda centre of islamic banking and economics are also in talks with local non state owned banks to investigate the possibility of these banks offering islamic financial products and services upward trends registered in private sector lending in recent years suggest there is a growing demand for islamic finance and islamic banking products however local banks have not yet been permitted to operate islamic windows given that such a step would require a policy change and adjustments to the regulatory environment meanwhile uzbekistan s banking sector is supported by demand for industrial projects backed by the government the international islamic trade finance corporation itfc is a new actor entering the market in 2018 2019 itfc intends to engage closely with local commercial banks to build partnerships with and reach out to the private sector in uzbekistan the development of the islamic finance sector is at its very early stages in uzbekistan and islamic securities whether listed on the local exchange or as banking instruments are yet to be recognised at policy and legislative level however the intensifying public debate around the matter and recently announced plans to create an infrastructure for islamic banking and finance suggest the authorities are taking a radical u turn towards the sector see update and trends for further details legislation what is the main legislation relevant to islamic banking capital markets and insurance any transactions performed on the basis of or using islamic finance principles shall be subject to conventional laws of uzbekistan islamic finance or islamic banking and similar practices have not yet been afforded a specific treatment or legislative framework in uzbekistan islamic finance based transactions are governed by governmental and presidential decrees and resolutions to the extent such investments or projects are agreed and coordinated by the state and its authorised agencies uzbekistan legislation applicable to the financial services industry is complex and constantly evolving to embrace challenges and to cope with competing development priorities apart from the constitution civil code and tax code which provide the major principles and set the legislative framework the operation of the financial services industry is subject to regulatory requirements and sector specific by laws issued in the form of presidential decrees and government resolutions it must be mentioned that uzbekistan accepted the obligations of article viii of the imf articles of agreement with effect from 15 october 2003 thus becoming the 157th of the imf s 184 members to have accepted those obligations as a result all currency restrictions with respect to the export import of products and services the buying and selling of hard currency valuables precious metals jewellery checks etc interest transfers dividend payments from investments abroad dividends and revenue payments abroad for investments in uzbekistan as well as certain other currency conversion restrictions have been abolished however the country faces certain foreign exchange challenges and pressures to protect its national interests from the effects of the world economic downturn the introduction of the foreign exchange law in 2003 represents the government s effort to outline the rules governing operation of business in uzbekistan under the applicable foreign exchange regime for example under the uzbek foreign exchange regime resident exporters must ensure that 50 per cent of their export sales proceeds in foreign currency is converted to local currency at the prevailing exchange rate fixed by the central bank of the republic of uzbekistan cbu certain operations related to the movement of capital are subject to notice and the procedure prescribed by the cbu in accordance with regulation 2536 issued on 17 december 2013 general guarantees of equal national treatment and further assurances of rights and protections on matters such as expropriation and profits repatriation which are of specific interest to the foreign investor are encapsulated in the law on foreign investments and the law on guarantees and measures for protection of rights of foreign investors the law on foreign borrowings and procedure for provision of sovereign guarantee as approved by the cabinet of ministers of the republic of uzbekistan resolution no 534 dated 28 november 2003 further sets the scene for general lending and sovereign guarantee transactions the 2012 law on private banking and financial institutions and guarantees of their operations provides important safeguards against discrimination and unlawful intervention from state and authorised state agencies in 2004 uzbekistan enacted the law on anti money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism which contained a range of anti money laundering and counter terrorism provisions including record keeping reporting and the establishment of financial intelligence units all financial services sector organisations must comply with a specific anti money laundering checklist approved by the ministry of justice s 2013

contemplating transactions based on islamic finance principles or using islamic banking instruments are not restricted as to their choice of governing law and dispute resolution the choice of arbitration as the form of dispute resolution shall be valid binding and enforceable under the laws of uzbekistan uzbekistan is a party to the united nations convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards of 1958 the new york convention accordingly a foreign arbitral award shall be recognised and enforced by an uzbek court in accordance with the provisions of the new york convention unless such award is not in contravention with public policy considerations arbitration courts under the chamber of commerce and industry provide a cost effective and viable dispute resolution alternative in uzbekistan contracting concepts accommodation of concepts mudarabah profit sharing partnership separating responsibility for capital investment and management the civil code does not expressly prohibit the mudarabah type of arrangement the principle of freedom of contract under article 354 of the civil code allows the parties to choose this arrangement and various provisions of the code allow parties to a transaction to share risks and liabilities for example concepts of joint and secondary liability it is also an observed practice in uzbekistan for banks to share profits and risks with entrepreneurs however this occurs more often in foreign borrowing transactions and by allowing a financing institution to become a shareholder in a business entity no restrictions shall apply in respect of a foreign financing institution in terms of risk levels it can accept in any particular financing transaction however limitations apply to uzbek banks these limitations are introduced by cbu regulation no 557 on maximum risk levels applicable to any one borrower or a group of affiliated borrowers issued on 2 december 1998 in accordance with regulation no 557 commercial banks may not assume risks amounting to 25 per cent of the bank s tier 1 capital equivalent to at least 50 per cent of the bank s authorised capital per one borrower or a group of affiliated borrowers this rule applies in relation to secured loan facilities the maximum level of risks that can be borne by an uzbek commercial bank in unsecured financing arrangements constitutes 5 per cent of the bank s tier 1 capital also the aggregate amount of uzbek bank s large scale loans cannot exceed eight times the bank s tier 1 capital in the case of leasing transactions the value of all leasing services provided by an uzbek bank apart from aircraft lease operations may not exceed 25 per cent of the bank s tier 1 capital murabahah cost plus profit agreement mudarabah transactions are commonly practised by the icd and local commercial banks where such transactions are financed by the icd the local commercial bank issues a guarantee as security for the performance by the borrower of its obligations to the icd mudarabah based transactions are subject to conventional sale and purchase rules specified in the civil code which defines a sale and purchase agreement as an agreement whereby a seller undertakes to transfer a commodity into the ownership of another party buyer and the buyer undertakes to accept such commodity and pay for it in the context of uzbekistan law this type of transaction falls within the above definition of sale and purchase agreement and is therefore legal binding and enforceable while the principle of freedom of contract will govern the contract price and the profit disclosure requirements mudarabah implies that the title to the commodity passes to and remains with the buyer as such mudarabah is in compliance with uzbekistan law regulating conventional sale and purchase in terms of title to a commodity of a transaction under uzbekistan law and unless otherwise provided by the contract the risk of loss passes to the buyer upon delivery by the seller of the goods sold import export rules as set forth in government resolution no 416 require that delivery of goods or services under import contracts occur no later than 180 days following due payment the buyer s deferred payment under mudarabah is in compliance with uzbekistan law namely article 244 of the civil code which allows for deferred performance of a contractual obligation provided this is explicitly agreed by the parties in the contract further articles 421 and 422 of the civil code regulate the issue of deferred and instalment payments in sale and purchase agreements in particular unless otherwise provided in the agreement the seller may terminate the agreement and demand return of the sold item if the buyer fails to make at least one scheduled payment except where the amount already paid by the buyer for the item exceeds two thirds of the contract price in addition under sale and purchase agreements with a deferred payment mechanism an item sold is deemed pledged to the seller to secure the seller s obligation to pay a seller in a mudarabah based transaction shall be subject to applicable customs duties vat and profit tax levied in accordance with the tax code unless granted preferential status and treatment in uzbekistan under relevant treaties the idb s and icd s assets are exempt from generally applicable customs duties when entering uzbekistan we note however that such exemption will only apply where assets are imported for the idb s and icd s personal use we note that the concept of mudarabah is typically used in transactions involving icd lending and idb employs a mixture of islamic finance tools such as mudarabah and ijarah most recent examples of private sector initiatives include mudarabah based facilities to finance working capital and equipment purchase for private production companies leading force llc and magnus industrial group llc musharakah profit sharing joint venture partnership agreement profit sharing joint venture partnership agreements can be entered into in two ways by establishing a separate company that will be treated as a legal entity or by establishing a simple partnership by separate legal entities if a legal company is established all shareholders should have rights and obligations arising from the quantity of shares they hold if a simple partnership is arranged then no new legal entity emerges and all partners must choose one managing partner which will represent the partnership before third parties owing to lack of regulation and excessive taxation simple partnership arrangements have not achieved popularity in uzbekistan as regards floating interest rates the banking laws of uzbekistan do not forbid use of floating rates of return and linking them to the borrower s profits the cbu regulation on requirements for the credit policy of commercial banks no 905 of 2 march 2000 requires that uzbek banks approve an internal credit policy with detailed description of types of loans security issues interests and others cbu regulation no 905 allows uzbek commercial banks to determine their lending policies independently nevertheless this has not become a widespread practice in uzbekistan and all banks tend to issue loans with the interest rated fixed throughout the whole loan period the applicable interest rate must not exceed 20 per cent ijarah lease to own agreement under uzbekistan law an arrangement whereby one party buys a commodity for the sole purpose of leasing it back to a seller cannot be framed into a single contract except for reversionary leasing as discussed below and must be split into two separate agreements sale and purchase and a lease type contract if a commodity is procured from a foreign non uzbek resident company or individual third party supplier then this transaction falls outside the reach of uzbekistan legislation and therefore will not be discussed herein conversely if the commodity is purchased from a resident company then such transaction will be treated as an export of goods and similarly to import contracts see question 16 it will be subject to registration with uzbek customs authorities and the local uzbek bank in uzbekistan all export contracts are subject to a minimum 15 per cent advance payment requirement to be included in the contract in the absence of which the contract would not be registered by the authorities and the bank in addition 50 per cent of export proceeds credited to a resident company from such sale will be subject to mandatory sale conversion into soms at the prevailing exchange rate fixed by the cbu following purchase of commodity from a resident company the foreign entity may lease it back to the resident under a conventional lease agreement in accordance with provisions of the law on leasing and the civil code a lease agreement may provide for an unconditional transfer of ownership to the leased item from the lessor to the lessee upon the expiry of the lease agreement thus avoiding execution of separate undertakings to sell and to buy the law on leasing allows for a lease transaction in which the lessee and the third party that sells the item to the lessor is the same person the lessor purchases an item from the lessee only to lease it back to the lessee on such terms prescribed by the lease agreement and in accordance with applicable laws on leasing one of the advantages of this arrangement is that it does not require execution of separate irrevocable undertakings to buy and to sell which are otherwise not available under uzbekistan law as both such undertakings are implied in addition it is up to the parties to a such a lease to agree on maintenance and insurance obligations ie it can be agreed to be an obligation of either a lessor or lessee thus avoiding execution of an agency service agreement article 590 of the civil code and article 20 of the law on leasing expressly provide that a payment under a lease agreement must comprise the actual price of the leased item and the lessor s profit interest interest payment in other words uzbekistan law prohibits lease agreements without an express reference to the lessor s interest payments the most recent example of an ijarah based lease back transaction includes financing in 2013 by the idb of two aircraft for the national air carrier of uzbekistan this was the idb s first experience of aircraft financing using an islamic finance tool wadiah safekeeping agreement wadiah may be enforceable in uzbekistan only if a financing institution does not sue a debtor in economic courts or arbitration courts taking into account that transfer of title in relation to any type of property requires consent of the owner the debtor shall have quite a strong legitimate protection against seizure by a financial institution of the property including bank accounts real estate movable property and others however entering into wadiah will not protect debtors if a financing institution files a lawsuit with a competent court and receives an enforcement decision in accordance with the law on enforcement of court decisions and decisions of other competent authorities of uzbekistan law enforcement agencies shall be required to execute an enforcement decision and through law enforcement agents a financing institution will be able to recover funds from bank accounts deposits and other property of the debtor in accordance with uzbekistan contract and banking rules gifts cannot be offered to depositors in lieu of interest the banking laws of uzbekistan require banks to pay interest to depositors on all deposits made should a breach of fiduciary duty or misuse of funds occur financing institutions will be entitled to sue corresponding employees for abuse of power in the criminal courts of uzbekistan the burden of proof will rest with the suing party products securities structuring sukuk islamic securities have sukuk or other islamic securities been structured and issued in your jurisdiction to comply with islamic principles such as the prohibition of interest not applicable legal position what is the legal position of sukuk holders in an insolvency or a restructuring are sukuk instruments viewed as equity or debt instruments have there been any court decisions or legislation declaring whether sukuk holders are deemed to own the underlying assets not applicable insurance takaful islamic insurance are there any conventional cooperative or mutual insurance vehicles that are or could be adapted to be shariah compliant the principal law governing the insurance industry in uzbekistan is the law on insurance activities insurance rules are rather strict and in general terms the fundamental principles of uzbekistan s insurance system do not greatly differ from that of takaful however the approach to certain aspects differs to a certain degree the main difference is that under uzbekistan law insurance activities are treated as commercial activities and an insurance company s profits are distributed among its shareholders whereas under takaful insurance is not treated as a commercial activity of its shareholders the following table highlights the differences in approach principle under takaful principle under uzbekistan law policyholders cooperate among themselves for their common good insurance companies are registered by shareholders licensed and operate for the benefit of the insured and shareholders policyholders contributions are treated as donations to the pool insurance premiums are paid by the insured as consideration for insurance of their risks each policyholder pays a subscription to help those who require assistance insurance payments to the insured are paid by insurance company financed by its shareholders and insurance premiums paid by other insured losses and liabilities are shared according to the community pooling system all losses and liabilities are assumed by insurance company uncertainty is eliminated concerning subscription and compensation uncertainty is eliminated by signing a written detailed insurance contract no advantage is gained at the expense of others overall advantage received from insurance activities is paid to insurance company s shareholders in the form of dividends which lines of insurance are currently covered in the takaful market is takaful typically ceded to conventional reinsurers or is retakaful common in practice not applicable miscellaneous regulatory obstacles what are the principal regulatory obstacles facing the islamic finance industry in your jurisdiction from a historical perspective uzbekistan has already made significant steps towards recognition of islamic finance via membership in the idb and icd which it joined in 2003 and 2004 respectively stable relations between these institutions and the government have enabled islamic finance to gain an entry point to the market however for islamic finance to gain an institutional foothold it must be recognised at the legislative level forming an initiative group within parliament to develop a road map with clear milestones towards reform of existing conventional law to create a level playing field for islamic finance might be a starting point alternatively a similar government blueprint would signal a policy shift at top executive level any proposed regulatory reform must include an awareness campaign to promote the perception of islamic finance and islamic banking as an interest free alternative to conventional banking and financial services as the next step amendments would be required to the civil code the tax code and the major banking and investment laws to address the matter systemically whether commercial banks should be allowed to open islamic windows or islamic banking institutes set up independently from conventional banking will inform public and expert debate on the shape and scope of regulatory reform to introduce islamic banking and islamic finance instruments new rules must be formulated or existing ones adapted for islamic book keeping procedures national accounting standards are ifrs based and any reform to introduce shariah principles must include compatibility analysis embedding the success stories of idb and icd project interventions in the regulatory reform will pave the way for islamic banking products and sukuk in fact the launch of sukuk bonds could be a point at which market response and readiness of the domestic stock exchange system will be tested bringing taxation of islamic products into the equation will prove another challenge insurance laws in uzbekistan do not contemplate principles of community insurance typical for takaful potential establishment of takaful governed insurance will require a further reform of insurance laws and regulatory environment as a whole shariah law in what circumstances may shariah law become the governing law for a contract or a dispute have there been any recent notable cases on jurisdictional issues the applicability of shariah or the conflict of shariah and local law relevant to the finance sector uzbekistan law poses no legal restrictions as to the choice of governing law by the parties foreign law including shariah shall be deemed a valid choice of governing law in financing or commercial transactions exceptions are certain areas of law that must be governed by uzbek laws only for example agreements involving incorporation of a company in uzbekistan or agreements to settle insolvency issues etc the experience of the idb s engagement in uzbekistan suggests that the cbu in its regulatory capacity does not oppose shariah compliant lending to uzbek borrowers article 1189 of the civil code reinforces this principle by stating that commercial contracts are governed by the law of a country that has been chosen by the parties unless otherwise provided by law mandatory choice of uzbekistan law shall apply only in very limited occasions such as bankruptcy issues criminal issues employment issues family issues or as referred above in this clause in the case of foundation agreements when disputes are resolved by non governmental arbitration tribunals etc paragraph 2 of article 1189 also states that the parties may choose laws of different countries in relation to different contract terms or the same foreign law for the entire contract the civil code and the contracts law allow the parties to commercial contracts to choose or change applicable law from uzbekistan to foreign law or from a foreign law to another at any stage of the contract term both prior to execution of a contract and at any time thereafter an important issue to bear in mind when choosing shariah law with uzbek debtors is arbitration we note that parties to a commercial contract are not restricted in their choice of foreign arbitration forum to resolve disputes neither the law on courts nor the law on enforcement of economic decisions nor the civil and economic procedure code establishes any restrictions to choose foreign arbitration in commercial contracts moreover it is the established contract practice in uzbekistan that in many instances legal entities have agreed and have chosen foreign arbitration as the means to settle their disputes including state authorities where they are a party to an investment agreement signed on behalf of the republic of uzbekistan where contractual terms of a shariah governed agreement do not contradict imperative rules of uzbekistan law it would be possible to enforce in uzbekistan a foreign arbitral award issued in accordance with shariah uzbekistan is a party to the new york convention if the decision is made by a state court then enforcement shall be made under bilateral or multilateral treaties to which uzbekistan is a party in the following cases a foreign judicial or arbitration decision may be refused recognition and enforcement the parties to a contract have not explicitly chosen shariah law in their contract or the provision choosing shariah law is insufficiently clear the party to a contract relying upon a certain provision of shariah law has not proved the existence of this law to an uzbek court please note that in accordance with the economic procedure code and the civil code if the parties choose foreign law as the governing law of the contract and the matter is brought before an uzbek court the burden of proof of existence of foreign law lies with the party relying upon this law typically foreign law can be proved either by receiving a certified copy of law from the competent state authorities of the respective country or by providing original publication or by certifying a copy of the law with an uzbek consular department in rare cases courts tend to accept original publications or explore publicly available internet databases if uzbek laws require satisfaction of certain procedural or legal requirements for example registration of a contract with certain authorities or providing certain provisions in the text of a contract and these requirements have not been fulfilled owing to their not being necessary under a foreign law chosen by the parties then the courts will refuse application of such foreign law and will give preference to existing uzbek laws and if the matter is related to enforcement of foreign arbitration decision then the court may refuse application of foreign law if this law contradicts the public order of uzbekistan this ground is provided by the new york convention by public policy considerations uzbekistan courts tend to understand existing uzbekistan legislation enacted by the parliament the president and the cabinet of ministers of uzbekistan institutional takeover are there any special considerations for the takeover of an islamic financial institution outside the requirements of the general merger control regime not applicable other notable features are there any notable features of the islamic finance regime and markets for islamic finance products in your jurisdiction not covered above assuming that further expansion of islamic finance in uzbekistan has become a fait accompli we believe the concept of islamic boards will be difficult to apply in the conventional legislative framework updates and trends updates and trends updates and trends the draft presidential decree setting out the roadmap for the creation of islamic banking and finance infrastructure is undergoing public consultation in uzbekistan according to the document a sector specific commission under the ministry of finance will have a remit to develop and implement the principles of islamic banking and finance in uzbekistan the task force will bring the key stakeholders to a discussion table for putting together a comprehensive reform package aimed at introducing islamic finance principles with grants made available from the islamic development bank the commission is set to prepare the ground for the establishment of the islamic development bank of uzbekistan ibru alongside the ongoing currency liberalisation agenda in uzbekistan the proposed approach will help to address the systemic challenges facing the industry and unlock emerging opportunities as well as paving the way for practical steps in rolling out islamic finance products

increasing the number of fracture stimulations used in its completion operations petrus drilled or participated in 2 gross 0 7 net cardium condensate wells during the first half of 2018 petrus strategically deferred further capital development until the second half of 2018 in order to permit debt repayment early in the year as well as to provide time to analyze well performance to evaluate the new completion techniques the company s 2018 operated drilling program resumed in the second half of 2018 with 5 gross 2 9 net cardium light oil wells drilled and fracture stimulated with an average of 76 stages per one mile lateral length the december test production over a 14 day period attributed to petrus 2 9 net additional wells was approximately 2 000 boe d which was comprised of 50 light oil 60 total liquids the light oil test rates of approximately 1 000 boe d nearly doubled petrus light oil production reported for the third quarter of 2018 of 1 243 boe d petrus is pleased with the results of the 2018 drilling program and looks forward to continue development of its cardium light oil in ferrier in a consistent disciplined manner the company plans to drill evenly throughout 2019 within funds flow and repay 1 to 2 million of debt each quarter fourth quarter average production was 7 934 boe d in 2018 compared to 10 711 boe d in 2017 looking at the company s recent change in total boe production rates is inaccurate as an evaluation of potential cash flow and value in the current commodity price environment as liquids weighting increases cash flow and value can increase despite lower overall boe production the new liquids production related to the fourth quarter 2018 wells is not reflected for a full quarter as the wells were brought on stream in december the resulting production is more valuable in the current commodity environment as the light oil and total liquids weighting has increased significantly the company s december 2018 light oil weighting increased 59 from january 2018 similarly the company s december 2018 total liquids weighting was 40 which is a 43 increase from january 2018 the company s operating netback increased 5 from 14 33 per boe in 2017 to 15 08 per boe in 2018 however the full impact of the increase in liquids weighting is not reflected due to when the new wells were brought on stream in late december in 2018 the company s drilling program proved that the ferrier cardium asset base provides optionality between natural gas or light oil development this optionality permits the company s development program to be agile and efficiently respond to changes in commodity pricing petrus board of directors has approved a first quarter 2019 capital budget of 8 to 10 million based on a current forecast for commodity futures pricing anticipated service costs and current activity levels management anticipates that the 2019 capital plan will be fully funded by funds flow systematically scheduled evenly through the year to maintain flexibility and permit debt reduction each quarter in the first quarter of 2019 the company expects to generate funds flow between 10 and 11 million with the remaining 1 to 2 million to be directed toward debt repayment the commodity price assumptions used for the first quarter 2019 capital budget were an average price of 1 31 c gj for natural gas aeco and 53 03 us bbl for oil wti petrus estimated first quarter average differential for western canadian light oil is estimated at 7 55 us bbl the first quarter capital budget is expected to include the drilling of 5 gross 2 0 net cardium wells targeting the most condensate rich areas within the reservoir as part of the 2019 first quarter capital budget petrus has drilled 2 gross 1 2 net cardium light oil wells the wells have finished drilling and offset the recently drilled 5 gross 2 9 net wells from the fourth quarter 2018 drilling program the 2 first quarter 2019 wells have 1 5 mile and 1 0 mile horizontal lateral lengths respectively both wells are being fracture stimulated with 124 and 77 stages respectively completion operations are currently ongoing and the wells test volumes can flow inline as the wells were drilled from pre existing surface locations both wells are expected to be on production by the end of march petrus board of directors has approved a second quarter 2019 capital budget of 7 to 8 million based on a current forecast for commodity futures pricing anticipated service costs and current activity levels the second quarter budget will allow for debt repayment of 1 to 2 million in the quarter petrus estimates the 2019 capital plan will maintain production year over year increase its oil and total liquids weighting and reduce debt throughout the year approximately 85 of the capital plan will be directed to development of cardium light oil wells in the ferrier area of alberta which we estimate will have payouts of less than one year and achieve its objective to increase its light

most directly comparable gaap ifrs measures operating netback operating netback is a common non gaap financial measure used in the oil and natural gas industry which is a useful supplemental measure to evaluate the specific operating performance by product at the oil and natural gas lease level the most directly comparable gaap measure to operating netback is funds flow operating netback is calculated as oil and natural gas revenue less royalties operating and transportation expenses it is presented on an absolute value and per unit basis funds flow and corporate netback corporate netback is a common non gaap financial measure used in the oil and natural gas industry which evaluates the company s profitability at the corporate level corporate netback is equal to funds flow which is a directly comparable gaap measure petrus analyzes these measures on an absolute value and per unit basis management believes that funds flow and corporate netback provide information to assist a reader in understanding the company s profitability relative to current commodity prices it is calculated as the operating netback less general and administrative expense finance expense decommissioning expenditures plus other income and the net realized gain loss on financial derivatives net debt net debt is a non gaap financial measure and is calculated as current assets excluding unrealized financial derivative assets less current liabilities excluding unrealized financial derivative liabilities and deferred share unit liabilities and long term debt petrus uses net debt as a key indicator of its leverage and strength of its balance sheet there is no gaap measure that is reasonably comparable to net debt net debt to funds flow net debt to funds flow is calculated as the

free market economists have been very successful at convincing the public that free trade is good and protectionism is bad the truth is that multinational corporations and their shareholders have done very well under the banner of free trade but manufacturing workers communities and the middle class have not free market ideologies allow a hybrid capitalistic system like that in china to operate under its own rules to cheat manipulate their currencies subsidize industries and steal technologies while the u s plays by the market rules according to a 2017 report from the federal commission on the theft of american intellectual property the annual loss to the u s economy from chinese ip theft was between 225 billion and 600 billion the u s not only doesn t have a trade policy it doesn t have a plan china on the other hand has a well defined 10 year plan on how to become no 1 called made in china 2025 it uses a combination of government subsidies state owned enterprises and the pursuit of intellectual property to catch up with and ultimately overtake other countries in 10 key sectors from it and telecommunications to advanced robotics and artificial intelligence so far cheating has paid off handsomely for china according to the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd china s exports have exploded in nearly every big money manufacturing sector including railroad equipment a 600 increase from 2001 to 2017 machinery and equipment 900 cars 1200 marine vehicles 1100 and airplanes 1200 meanwhile in the u s working class jobs in areas like machinery and equipment manufacturing fabricated metals automotive paper and pulp and textiles have all seen wage growth fall below inflation over the last 20 years according to the oecd america is slowly losing the trade battle free trade as it exists today will guarantee the long term decline of u s manufacturing as multinational corporations continue to move production to low cost countries and china is allowed to play by its own rules if we are going to have any chance of growing our manufacturing industries we need to replace the notion of free trade with the concept of managed trade to do this we need an industrial policy that commits to growing the u s manufacturing sector as a percentage of gdp the manufacturing sector has been stagnant at around 12 of gdp for many years in 2018 it was 11 6 of gdp if we are serious about real manufacturing growth we should pick a target for growth like 14 5 which was manufacturing s percentage of gdp in 2000 and publicize it the industrial policy should also include a specific goal to reduce the trade deficit not a general statement saying trade deficits are bad i mean a specific goal with the timetable to reduce the trade deficit to achieve this goal we will have to solve many major problems that restrict manufacturing growth such as currency manipulation if the u s is going to begin reducing the trade deficit and growing exports it must penalize countries for artificially increasing the value of the dollar so their exports to the u s are cheaper and our exports are more expensive according to the economic policy institute the president has the power to shape policy that would penalize currency manipulation together these policies could lead to exchange rate movements that would create 2 3 million to 5 8 million jobs over the next three years by ending currency manipulation by a group of about 20 countries with china as the linchpin the epi stated there is precedent in 1982 president reagan held a private meeting at the plaza hotel in new york to tell japan germany and three other trading partners they had to quit manipulating their currencies that kept the u s dollar high it worked and the trade deficit began to subside reciprocity and tariffs the trump administration is beginning to get china s attention by imposing tariffs on imported goods we need to go a step further and analyze all of the tariffs and value added taxes placed on our exports country by country the following chart shows the tariffs and vats of 10 of our largest trading partners
over the past three years sri lanka has been a bright spot for u s foreign policy in the indo pacific the coalition government led by president maithripala sirisena and the more reform minded prime minister ranil wickremesinghe has expanded relations with the u s and india to balance the country s firm embrace of china during the tenure of president mahinda rajapaksa 2005 2015 in order to maintain positive momentum in bilateral relations and prepare for a potential return to power by rajapaska and his family the u s will have to employ a comprehensive strategy that elevates the importance of diplomatic and military engagement with sri lanka draws contrasts between the u s and chinese development models deploys new tools of development finance effectively and improves coordination with regional partners such as india and japan this backgrounder examines recent trends in sri lankan politics and foreign policy as well as the state of sri lankan u s relations while offering policy recommendations to the u s government it begins with a brief overview of sri lanka s growing geopolitical profile before reviewing the political crisis sparked by president sirisena s attempt to install ex president rajapaksa as prime minister in october 2018 an attempt that ultimately failed the backgrounder then explores the prospects that the rajapaksas will return to power in presidential and parliamentary elections scheduled to take place in 2019 and 2020 followed by a deeper dive into the history of the family and their controversial role in sri lankan politics a comprehensive review of sri lankan u s relations is then offered before moving to policy recommendations for the u s government and a conclusion background on sri lanka a democratic nation of 22 million citizens 70 percent buddhist 13 percent hindu 10 percent muslim 7 percent christian with a gross domestic product of roughly 90 billion sri lanka s modest stature obscures its substantial geostrategic potential a central hub positioned at the mid point of the indian ocean sri lanka lies halfway between the east coast of africa and the strait of malacca some 30 000 naval vessels 45 000 aircraft and 4 500 oil tankers traverse sri lanka s 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone each year connecting energy consumers in east asia with energy suppliers in the middle east you can t get from hormuz to malacca or from the red sea to the south china sea without going near sri lanka observed the former head of u s indo pacific command usindopacom admiral harry harris he calls it the pearl of the indian ocean on one of our planet s most critical trade routes ref before 2009 sri lanka was perhaps best known for the government s decades long counterinsurgency campaign against the tamil tigers a terrorist group claiming to defend the rights of the country s hindu tamil minority the tigers led the world in suicide bombings from 1980 to 2003 ref when the group was decisively crushed by a military offensive ordered by then president rajapaksa in 2009 international attention shifted to china s expanding footprint on the island and its multibillion dollar investments in sri lankan ports and infrastructure projects the vast majority of these projects are not conventional investments but loans to sri lanka at commercial interest rates these projects remain the subject of intense controversy and international debate they even made their way into an october 4 2018 speech by vice president mike pence who used china s infrastructure projects on the island as a warning of the risks associated with beijing s expansive belt and road initiative bri ref china he argued had saddled sri lanka with unsustainable debt which it then leveraged to pressure colombo into transferring the chinese built hambantota port to a chinese firm on a 99 year lease separately chinese firms have been accused of corrupt practices making illegal campaign donations to sri lankan officials and including sovereignty violating provisions in deals negotiated in secret ref after tilting toward china for years president rajapaksa witnessed a surprise upset in the 2015 presidential election being narrowly defeated by a former ally maithripala sirisena after parliamentary elections that year sirisena went on to form a coalition government with one of his political rivals prime minister ranil wickremesighe the new government sought to rebalance sri lankan foreign policy away from dependence on china and toward strengthened relations with india and the u s critically it also sought to revise the terms of several deals the rajapaksa government had signed with china to mixed success against this backdrop the country s domestic politics were thrown into turmoil in late 2018 when president sirisena attempted to oust prime minister wickremesinghe via unconstitutional means and install rajapaksa in his place the endeavor failed but many political forecasters are predicting a likely return to power by the rajapaksa family in forthcoming elections and a potential re orientation back toward china casting a cloud of uncertainty over this frontline indo pacific state the political crisis sri lanka s president and prime minister have been trying to navigate an uneasy truce since they formed a coalition government in 2015 ref president sirisena a former rajapaksa ally surprised observers by defecting from the latter s sri lanka freedom party slfp to challenge and ultimately defeat rajapaksa in the 2015 presidential election with 51 percent of the vote wickremesinghe who hails from the more reform minded united national party unp assumed the role of prime minister later that year after years of personal differences and infighting including over the prime minister s attempts at economic liberalization tensions came to a head in october 2018 to balance the billions in chinse debt the rajapaksa government had accrued wickremesinghe sought to court new investments from india during a trip to delhi in april 2017 he signed several tentative agreements outlining new infrastructure projects for indian firms these included a solar power plant in sampur upgrades to an airport in jaffna new railways and housing projects in the country s north an oil tank farm and refinery in trincomalee and an expansion of the east container terminal at the country s main port in colombo ref over wickremesinghe s objections president sirisena slow walked or put a halt to several of the projects in the year to follow in mid october 2018 the prime minister again visited delhi and enraged sirisena by suggesting prime minister narendra modi was displeased with the pace of progress on india s investments and implying the president was to blame ref according to one account this episode precipitated the final crisis ref at a cabinet meeting that month president sirisena reportedly vetoed a plan to grant an indian japanese consortium a 1 billion stake to develop the east container terminal at the colombo port sirisena then surprised his cabinet by declaring without proof that india s external intelligence agency the research and analysis wing had hatched a plot to assassinate him sirisena disbanded parliament soon after and sought to install former president rajapaksa as the new prime minister by some estimates it was the first attempt at an unconstitutional transfer of power in the country s post independence history sri lanka considers itself the oldest democracy in asia with universal suffrage introduced in 1931 and democratic governance taking hold after independence from britain in 1948 most legal experts inside and outside the country decried the move the sri lankan constitution stipulates that a president can only force the resignation of a prime minister after a government has served for at least four and a half years this government had served only three and a half years the u s and india issued statements urging respect for the democratic and constitutional processes the u s embassy in sri lanka warned president sirisena s decision to dissolve parliament poses a vital threat to sri lanka s democratic institutions uch actions jeopardize sri lanka s economic progress and international reputation ref furthermore the u s froze a nearly complete 500 million millennium challenge corporation mcc compact for soft infrastructure investments ref meanwhile the japan international cooperation agency temporarily suspended a 1 4 billion soft loan for a light railway project in colombo china by contrast quickly sent its envoy in colombo to congratulate rajapaksa though it subsequently arranged a meeting with wickremesinghe as well after gauging international opinion ref notably in the middle of the constitutional crisis rajapaksa s shadow government signed two multimillion dollar contracts with chinese firms to upgrade a container terminal at the colombo port and purchase new cranes ref soon after the soft coup was announced the horse trading began one member of parliament pledged support for rajapaksa on a saturday switched loyalties to wickremesinghe on sunday and was appointed to rajapaksa s shadow cabinet on monday night the speaker of the parliament accused rajapaksa and sirisena of offering bribes and ministerial positions to members of parliament mps to secure their loyalty contrary to all norms of transparency decency democracy and good governance he concluded the entire series of events can only be described as a coup albeit one without the use of tanks and gun ref however the prime minister s allies held the line rajapaksa and sirisena reportedly came within five to 10 votes of securing a majority in the 225 member house but their overtures were rejected by numerous smaller parties and they ultimately lost three consecutive votes in parliament on november 13 the country s supreme court overturned sirisena s decision to dissolve parliament and halted his order to prepare for snap elections in january then in mid december the highest court weighed in decisively extending a lower court s suspension of president sirisena s unconstitutional maneuvers on december 15 rajapaksa accepted the decision and resigned one day later wickremesinghe was sworn in again as prime minister ending the 50 day crisis rajapaksa now leader of the opposition vowed that his party would soon return to power as a country wide political force that no one can stop ref looking ahead a return for rajapaksa the attempt by sirisena and rajapaksa to conduct a soft coup surprised domestic and international observers alike not least because it was widely accepted that rajapaksa s political fortunes were on the rise while support for the current government was dwindling as rajesh venugopal writes in the wire the unp led government was losing popularity with each passing day and would have died a natural death at the polls in 2020 mahinda or his chosen family anointee could easily with a little patience have sat back and won the presidency and parliament fair and square in little over a year instead the coup has now possibly given the unp and ranil wickremesinghe an underserved life line ref the rajapaksa family would indeed seem well positioned for presidential elections scheduled to be held between november 2019 and january 2020 and for parliamentary elections to follow between march and september 2020 after his fallout with sirisena in 2015 rajapaksa helped form a new party the sri lanka podujana peramuna slpp though he still commands some support from mps in his old party the slfp now headed by sirisena in february 2018 the slpp won 40 percent of votes in local elections as compared with 29 percent for the wickremesinghe led united national front alliance and 12 percent for the sirisena led united people s freedom alliance however president rajapaksa and his family also face formidable institutional hurdles in the forthcoming presidential elections in april 2015 the sri lankan parliament adopted the 19th amendment to the constitution which diluted the powers of the executive branch re introduced a two term limit for the president shortened the presidential term from six years to five years and restricted the power of the president to dissolve parliament critically the amendment also raised the minimum age for a presidential candidate from 30 to 35 and barred dual citizens from holding the presidency in tandem the adjustments present specific obstacles for influential members of the rajapaksa family mahinda rajapaksa has already served two terms as president his son namal is only 32 rajapaksa s two brothers gotabaya and basil both hold dual citizenship in the u s and in sri lanka undeterred in january 2019 gotabaya declared his intention to run for president he has been coy about whether he will renounce his u s citizenship but has insisted it could be done in two months time if he chooses to do so some insiders are skeptical this will be possible another brother chamal followed with his own announcement of intent to run for president president sirisena who has had an up and down relationship with the rajapaksas is likely to seek re election prime minister wickremesinghe may contest the presidential election as well meanwhile insiders believe mahinda is likely to seek the prime ministership after the 2020 parliamentary elections or may seek to nominate his son namal who is likely being groomed for an eventual presidential run who are the rajapaksas the son of a prominent politician and government minister mahinda rajapaksa was at the time the youngest mp ever elected when he won his father s former seat in 1970 at the age of 24 after losing that seat in 1977 he practiced law for over a decade in 1989 rajapaksa returned to politics winning the parliamentary seat for his home district of hambantota a tiny fishing village of 10 000 people he held that seat for a quarter century while heading various government ministries including labor fisheries and highways and even briefly serving as prime minister before being elected president in 2005 mahinda rajapaksa was not alone at one point 29 members of rajapaksa s extended family senior positions within the government civil service media and industry ref his family members have served as ambassadors government ministers and the head of sri lankan airlines chamal his eldest brother was speaker of the parliament brothers gotabaya and basil have served as defense minister and minister for economic development respectively namal was elected to parliament in 2010 representing the hambantota district in addition to charges of gross human rights abuses during the civil war against the tamil tigers the rajapaksas were widely accused of illiberal and authoritarian strong arm tactics during their decade long reign they curtailed media freedoms imprisoned and disappeared political opponents and showed little toleration for dissent they were also accused of widespread corruption several of them have been placed under investigation basil was arrested in 2016 for alleged misappropriation of state funds ref gotabaya has been accused of war crimes and is currently facing charges he misappropriated state funds to build a mausoleum for his late parents ref jaliya wickramasuriya a first cousin to mahinda and a former sri lankan ambassador to the u s 2009 to 2015 is facing criminal prosecution in the u s the indictment unsealed in december 2018 accuses him of tax evasion immigration fraud and embezzling over 300 000 from the government of sri lanka ref separately he was arrested in 2016 in sri lanka by the police financial crimes investigation division for misusing state funds while serving in washington ref in foreign policy president rajapaksa s most notable achievement was overseeing a dramatic expansion of chinese interests and influence on the island years before the bri was unveiled by president xi jinping colombo witnessed a wave of multibillion dollar chinese investments loans and construction projects while some of the projects brought tangible benefits others were of questionable economic value critics argue that they saddled the country with unsustainable levels of debt while facilitating corruption and nepotism chinese firms were accused of making illegal campaign donations to the rajapaksas and actively lobbying politicians on their behalf meanwhile the secretive deals chinese firms signed during the rajapaksa era were later found to have contained several objectionable provisions including granting china sovereign control over territory near sri lanka s ports they were later rejected and renegotiated by the sirisena wickremensinghe government ref yet despite their authoritarian tendencies the rajapaksas remain genuinely popular in sri lanka they are revered by many in the buddhist sinhala majority for defeating the tamil tigers and overseeing an economic and infrastructure boom efforts to portray them in narrow black and white terms obscure a more complex reality the rajapaksas do not seem inherently anti american basil and gotabaya have homes in the u s and carry u s citizenship as president mahinda initially sought military aid and investments from america but was largely shunned and sanctioned over credible accusations of misconduct and gross human rights violations during the war with the tamil tigers the rajapaksas are far from jeffersonian democrats but neither are they totalitarian dictators nor are they mere chinese puppets rather they are sri lankan nationalists they would likely welcome perhaps even prefer billions of dollars in u s investments too they believed they were getting a good deal from china at a time when no other country was willing to invest in sri lanka since then they have occasionally led protests against chinese infrastructure projects when it was politically desirable and have insisted they would also seek to revise and amend the terms of inequitable deals recognizing his embrace of china ruffled no shortage of feathers in india particularly after welcoming chinese submarines to colombo for the first time in 2014 former president rajapaksa also has been seeking to mend fences in delhi in recent years to mixed results notably he met with indian prime minister narendra modi when the latter visited colombo in 2017 during a trip to delhi in september 2018 rajapaksa called india our closest relation and blamed past problems on misunderstandings in all our dealings with china we never forgot about the interests of india he insisted we had a very good understanding with the indian government and we always told them that we would never allow our territory to be used for any activity against our neighbor ref finally the rajapakasas have at least demonstrated a modicum of restraint in recent years the local elections held in february 2018 were some of the most peaceful the country has held with turnout at over 75 percent rajapaksa urged his supporters to refrain from violence and set an example no matter what the opposition does ref during the soft coup attempt in late 2018 the rajapaksas avoided the temptation to call their supporters to the streets for violent protests though they were accused of harassing local reporters who contributed to an article examining corruption in the hambantota and colombo port deals ref u s sri lankan relations since president rajapaksa was voted out of office in 2015 sri lanka and the u s have substantially expanded bilateral relations particularly in the defense arena the courtship began in 2015 with the first visit to sri lanka by a u s secretary of state in 30 years by 2017 a senior trump administration official declared that sri lanka u s ties had reached an all time high with common goals as fellow democracies both working to promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms ref as just one potent example of how rapidly ties have developed and how often sri lanka is overlooked in the western media since late 2018 the country has been serving as a new indian ocean logistics hub for the u s navy sri lanka has also welcomed u s maritime patrol aircraft at the controversial chinese built hambantota airport military cooperation the sri lankan and u s militaries are no strangers washington and colombo signed their first status of forces agreement sofa in the mid 1990s establishing the rights and privileges that u s military personnel operating in the country would enjoy ref an acquisition and cross servicing agreement acsa followed in 2007 allowing the two sides to provide each other with non lethal logistics support supplies and refueling services during peacekeeping missions humanitarian operations and joint exercises ref in 2016 the year after president rajapaksa was unseated sri lanka began welcoming u s naval visits again after a five year hiatus and has hosted over one dozen u s navy ships since then in 2017 a u s aircraft carrier visited sri lanka for the first time in over three decades ref the uss nimitz was not able to dock at the colombo port for logistical reasons but sri lankan officials were brought out for a tour of the carrier in 2017 sri lanka was included for the first time in the pacific partnership mission the largest annual multilateral humanitarian assistance and disaster relief preparedness mission conducted in the indo asia pacific ref the same year usindopacom conducted its first cooperation afloat readiness and training carat exercise with the sri lankan navy ref in 2018 sri lanka was included in the u s led rim of the pacific exercises for the first time observing from australian vessels in 2018 the trump administration expanded an existing program to provide maritime security assistance to southeast asia to include south asian nations making bangladesh and sri lanka eligible for equipment supplies and training assistance since then sri lanka has been granted 39 million under the bay of bengal initiative to support sri lanka s coastal maritime radar system to provide training and equipment for improved surveillance response and interdiction ref similarly the asia reassurance initiative act of 2018 specifically calls for expanding cooperation with democratic partners in south asia including bangladesh nepal and sri lanka ref in spring 2019 the u s will transfer a second hamilton class coast guard cutter to sri lanka the first was delivered over a decade ago and the two cutters are the largest ships in sri lanka s fleet the two countries have also begun holding air force to air force talks ref while sri lanka is sending roughly a dozen military officers to the u s each year for training finally since a new arrangement was reached in august 2018 the u s has begun to resupply naval vessels in the indian ocean from sri lankan facilities in january 2019 the uss john stennis aircraft carrier was resupplied using the bandaranaike international airport bia at colombo a u s military cargo plane from bahrain delivered the supplies to bia where they were loaded onto a transport aircraft from the carrier similar operations were carried out to resupply u s navy ships from bia in august 2018 and from the airport in trincomalee in december 2018 ref the air logistics hub ref operates under a temporary cargo transport initiative according to a report in sri lanka s sunday times there are plans to develop a standard operations procedure sop or draft a memorandum of understanding to streamline and better process such temporary logistics operations in a more effective manner in the future ref civilian aid and capacity building u s civilian aid and assistance programs to sri lanka are extensive the u s has funded 13 cultural preservation projects in sri lanka in addition to tsunami relief and malaria elimination programs ref the u s is training and assisting sri lankan officials in the fields of law enforcement counter narcotics and counterterrorism while the u s treasury and justice departments have established programs in the country to help address fiscal and debt challenges to strengthen rule of law and to enhance transparency the u s is sponsoring multimillion dollar mine clearing initiatives ref and u s hospital ships have been making regular visits to the north and central part of the country to provide disaster relief and medical care while renovating schools ref a 21 million project from the u s department of agriculture is increasing the productivity of sri lanka s dairy sector the u s peace corps is returning to sri lanka to teach english and the u s embassy in colombo offers training for journalists on access to information increasing diversity in types of stories covered and improving english language skills perhaps most notably in 2018 sri lanka negotiated a nearly 500 million compact with the mcc the funds will be allocated to upgrade road infrastructure in the country among other things though the mcc compact was put on hold during the late 2018 political crisis officials now hope the deal can be finalized before an mcc board meeting in late march in 2016 the sri lankan parliament launched a collaboration agreement with the u s house democracy partnership to provide training programs for sri lankan members of parliament and their staff ref that same year the u s agency for international development usaid began a three year program in sri lanka the strengthening democratic governance and accountability project it is designed to strengthen public accountability systems improve planning communication policy reform and implementation and increase the participation of women and under represented groups in sri lanka similarly the usaid led sri lankan parliament project facilitates multi stakeholder dialogues on key reforms and by bringing together the prime minister cabinet ministers members of parliament commissioners and leading civil society organizations ref other recent usaid programs include a 2008 contract to support local government institutions in the eastern province a 2009 program project to advance reintegration and stabilization in the east and north a 2012 program to assist the judiciary to improve management of the legal system a 2013 program to advance legal and policy reforms in partnership with the bar association of sri lanka and the u s legal aid commission and a 2015 program establishing workshops with parliamentary staff and financial committees economic ties sri lanka exports more goods which in 2017 reached 2 9 billion to the u s than to any other country sri lankan imports from the u s the same year were 811 million ref after signing a u s sri lanka trade and investment framework agreement tifa in 2002 the two countries have held regular meetings among their respective trade representatives in a joint council ref numerous u s companies including citibank ibm oracle microsoft facebook google coke pepsi marriot hyatt hilton visa and mastercard have ongoing business in sri lanka u s private equity firms have made investments in the local banking and health care sectors in 2018 general electric won a 48 million contract to supply a dozen locomotives for sri lanka s state run railways ref notably nearly half of sri lanka s sovereign bonds are currently held by u s based investors including jp morgan and citibank major underwriters of the sovereign fund of sri lanka meanwhile the u s overseas private investment corporation opic has cumulatively invested 118 million in sri lanka and currently has 20 million invested in four active projects ref policy recommendations in order to sustain momentum in sri lankan u s relations and advance the trump administration s vision for a free and open indo pacific the u s should make u s aid and assistance conditional the trump administration was right to put a nearly 500 million mcc compact with sri lanka on hold during the late 2018 political crisis the u s must tie future aid and assistance to the government s performance on basic metrics like human rights and respect for the democratic process china s growing influence on the island has undoubtedly complicated the process it was in part a suspension of u s aid that influenced president rajapaksa s decision to turn to china in the late 2000s while recognizing the need for flexibility in this complex environment the u s must also be clear about its red lines and what it expects of any future sri lankan government that desires a productive and lucrative partnership with the u s prioritize the completion of new sofa and acsa agreements washington and colombo are in the process of upgrading a sofa first signed in the mid 1990s ref the two sides hoped to have the agreement completed before january 2019 but were unable to reach terms in time they are also negotiating an updated acsa agreement prime minister wickremesinghe is reportedly a supporter of both agreements and the sri lankan military is currently reviewing the technical details expand military to military cooperation discussions with senior officials in colombo in october 2018 revealed an appetite for even more robust military and strategic cooperation with the u s ref the officials expressed interest in sending more military officers to the u s for training and in purchasing c130j transport aircraft with roll on roll off kits for maritime surveillance moreover the u s should consider inviting sri lanka to other regional military exercises potentially first with observer status additionally the u s should seek new arrangements to use hambantota port as a logistics hub as it has done with colombo port while advancing negotiations with the sri lankan government about storing pre positioned humanitarian aid and disaster relief stocks at hambantota regularize and upgrade diplomatic interactions and restore the partnership dialogue in 2016 the u s and sri lanka began an annual partnership dialogue between their top diplomats the u s secretary of state and sri lanka s foreign minister the partnership dialogue continued in 2017 but was downgraded to the level of u s under secretary of state and sri lanka s foreign secretary ref there was no meeting in 2018 presumably a result of the constitutional crisis the partnership dialogue should be restored in 2019 and ideally should return to the level of secretary of state and foreign minister furthermore the u s should consider upgrading the discussions to a strategic dialogue which sri lanka currently enjoys with china and would like to see with the u s make the galle dialogue a priority begun in 2010 each year sri lanka hosts a prominent international maritime conference dubbed the galle dialogue in november 2016 usindopacom commander admiral harris addressed the dialogue in 2017 the commander of the pacific fleet admiral scott swift represented the u s in 2018 the u s sent rear admiral jimmy pitts commander of submarine group 7 in 2019 the u s should reverse this trend of declining representation and again send the head of usindopacom use new tools to extend assistance to sri lanka countries like sri lanka have legitimate development needs yet save perhaps for japan the u s and its partners have not developed adequate tools and mechanisms to meet those needs or properly compete in a new strategic battleground after the passage of the build act by the u s congress opic was brought under the moniker of a new international development finance corporation idfc and its spending cap on investments was roughly doubled to 60 billion unlike opic the idfc has also been granted the authority to make direct equity investments in specific circumstances the build act was billed as a means to use development finance in a more strategic manner at a time china was ensnaring indo pacific capitals in debt traps via unsustainable large scale infrastructure projects theoretically the idfc will use its new capital and authorities to provide alternatives to regional capitals seeking infrastructure investments without the strategic baggage accompanying china s bri if the build act is to serve that purpose sri lanka would present a model case opic already has four projects active in sri lanka and has signed a memorandum of understanding with the japan bank for international cooperation to promote joint infrastructure projects in the indian ocean region where it is not viable or valuable for the idfc and other relevant government agencies to provide development support the u s government should facilitate investments by the private sector as well as work in tandem with like minded development partners such as india and japan finally the u s should provide assistance to the sri lankan government in evaluating project proposals implementing high standards agreements and implementing best practices garner support for a free and open indo pacific foip the trump administration should continue to seek support from colombo for its foip vision and a rules based order notably colombo already endorsed the vision at the 2017 partnership dialogue the joint statement read he two governments resolved to work together toward a free and open indo pacific region and for greater peace and stability around the world the united states and sri lanka agreed that the security stability and prosperity of the indian ocean region should be safeguarded through the promotion of a rules based order ref the u s should continue to encourage sri lanka to support the foip strategy in both word and deed draw contrasts china has pursued a model of development in sri lanka that has focused on state run enterprises and high profile infrastructure projects that have at times proven economically unviable and saddled the country with unsustainable debt levels the benefits of these projects often accrue exclusively to china chinese banks are paid interest on chinese loans to fund projects being built by chinese companies and workers because many of these contracts lack transparency and accountability they have also been prone to fueling corruption the u s offers a different model one aspect of the model focuses on private sector driven growth economic sustainability high standards and transparency where the u s government is involved it is providing no cost assistance in mine clearing cultural preservation health care agriculture aid legal training strengthening the rule of law and promoting reconciliation america must do a better job of publicly drawing contrasts between itself and china and of underscoring the strengths of its own more generous and equitable relationship model as u s ambassador to sri lanka alaina teplitz explained in december 2018 all our assistance is grants and not loans which have to be repaid we do this because we want to be a friend and partner where we share mutual interest ref conclusion while the political crisis in colombo has been resolved ongoing differences between the president and prime minister suggest that political gridlock will endure at least until presidential elections are held within a year in the coming months washington must focus on solidifying the gains made in bilateral relations since 2015 while helping to manage political instability critically washington must work to ensure that the democratic process is respected during forthcoming elections unless the soft coup attempt of late 2018 decisively shifted public sentiment the rajapaksa family and their allies are likely poised for a political comeback though the opposition led by prime minister wickremesinghe will remain a significant political force commanding at least 30 percent to 40 percent of popular support can the u s work with the rajapaksas if they return to power that will depend very much on their actions in some areas their track record is lamentable u s diplomats who have served in sri lanka paint a bleak picture to advance a narrow agenda the rajapaksas often worked against the interests of the u s of sri lankan minorities and of the country at large at times they acted like feudal warlords overseeing an island fiefdom they are however also genuinely popular in sri lanka and the u s must be prepared to respect the will of the sri lankan public to a limit most important the u s must hold any future government in colombo to a basic set of democratic and humanitarian standards in some ways sri lanka presents a model test case for the trump administration s free and open indo pacific strategy bilateral ties have flourished in recent years precisely because sri lanka has become more free and open since rajapaksa s ouster the coalition government particularly wickremesinghe and his allies have tried to make governance more transparent and more fiscally responsible they have renegotiated the terms of engagement with china while broadening cooperation with india and the u s america and sri lanka both have an interest in ensuring those trends are not reversed by whatever government comes next jeff m smith is research fellow in the asian studies center of the kathryn and shelby cullom davis institute for national security and foreign policy at the heritage foundation

and financial performance before the impact of investing and financing transactions income taxes and certain non core and non recurring items in our financial statements the presentation of adjusted ebitda and core net income should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by other charges and gains we consider to be outside the ordinary course of our business the use of adjusted ebitda and core net income has certain limitations because it does not reflect all items of income and expenses that affect our operations items excluded from adjusted ebitda and core net income are significant components in understanding and assessing our operating and financial performance depreciation and amortization expense for various long term assets income tax and share based compensation have been and will be incurred and are not reflected in the presentation of adjusted ebitda each of these items should also be considered in the overall evaluation of our results additionally adjusted ebitda and core net income does not consider capital expenditures and other investing activities and should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity we compensate

operations in west central alberta principally focused on profitable development of the spirit river liquids rich natural gas play non gaap measures throughout this press release the company uses terms that are commonly used in the oil and natural gas industry but do not have a standardized meaning presented by international financial reporting standards ifrs and therefore may not be comparable to the calculations of similar measures for other entities management believes that the presentation of these non gaap measures provide useful information to investors and shareholders as the measures provide increased transparency and the ability to better analyze performance against prior periods on a comparable basis operating netbacks are calculated by subtracting royalties transportation and operating expenses from total revenue management believes this measure is a useful supplemental measure of the amount of total revenue received after transportation royalties and operating expenses the company s calculation of total revenue includes petroleum and natural gas sales and other income and excludes commodity price risk management total capital expenditures net includes the cash impact of capital expenditures and property dispositions as well as the non cash capital impacts of corporate acquisitions property acquisitions adjustments to the company s decommissioning liabilities and share based compensation these measures have been described and presented in this news release in order to provide shareholders and potential investors with additional information regarding bellatrix s liquidity and its ability to generate funds to finance its operations for additional information about these non gaap measures including reconciliations to the most directly comparable gaap terms see our md a this press release contains the term adjusted funds flow which should not be considered an alternative to or more meaningful than cash flow from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of the company s performance therefore reference to adjusted funds flow or adjusted funds flow per share may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other entities management uses adjusted funds flow to analyze operating performance and leverage and considers adjusted funds flow to be a key measure as it demonstrates the company s ability to generate the cash necessary to fund future capital investments and to repay debt adjusted funds flow is calculated as cash flow from operating activities excluding decommissioning costs incurred changes in non cash working capital incurred and transaction costs the reconciliation between cash flow from operating activities and adjusted funds flow can be found in the md a adjusted funds flow per share is calculated using the weighted average number of shares for the period this press release also contains the terms total net debt and adjusted working capital deficiency which also are not recognized measures under gaap therefore reference to total net debt and adjusted working capital deficiency may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other entities the company s calculation of total net debt excludes other deferred liabilities deferred capital obligations long term risk management contract liabilities decommissioning liabilities and deferred tax liabilities total net debt includes the adjusted working capital deficiency long term loans receivable senior notes convertible debentures liability component current credit facilities and long term credit facilities the adjusted working capital deficiency is calculated as net working capital deficiency excluding current risk management contract assets and liabilities current portion of other deferred liabilities current portion of decommissioning liabilities and the current credit facilities management believes these measures are useful

undertake any obligation to update publicly or to revise any of the included forward looking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise except as may be required by applicable securities laws barrels of oil equivalent the term barrels of oil equivalent boe may be misleading particularly if used in isolation a boe conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil equivalent 6 mcf bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead all boe conversions in this press release are derived from converting gas to oil in the ratio of six thousand cubic feet of gas to one barrel of oil given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6 1 utilizing a conversion on a 6 1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value initial rates of production references in this press release to initial production rates associated with certain wells are useful in confirming the presence of hydrocarbons however such rates are not determinative of the rates at which such wells will commence production and decline thereafter and are not indicative of long term performance or of ultimate recovery while encouraging readers are cautioned not to place reliance on such rates in calculating the aggregate production for the company the company cautions that such production rates should be considered to be preliminary oil and gas metrics this press release contains metrics commonly used in the oil and natural gas industry such as fd a costs recycle ratio operating netback reserve life index and sustaining capital these terms do not have standardized meanings and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies and therefore should not be used to make such comparisons fd a costs are used as a measure of capital efficiency fd a presented herein has been calculated based on exploration development and acquisition capital spent in the applicable period including changes in future development capital if applicable for that period divided by the change in reserves for that period including revisions for that same period bellatrix provides fd a costs that incorporate all acquisitions and exclude the reserve capital and fdc impact of dispositions during the year the calculation of fd a herein is based on working interest reserves recycle ratio is a measure for evaluating the effectiveness of a company s reinvestment program and the efficiency of capital investment it accomplishes this by comparing the operating netback per boe to that year s reserve fd a cost per boe see non gaap measures above for a description of how operating netbacks are calculated the reserve life index for 2018 is calculated by dividing reserves as at december 31 2018 by 2019 forecasted average production and has been presented to provide a measure of the amount of time production could be sustained at the production rates based on the reserves at the applicable point in time sustaining capital refers to capital expenditures to maintain production from existing facilities at current production levels additional details of how certain of these measures have been calculated are included in the press release of the company dated march 14 2019 which is available on the company s website at www bxe com and are filed on sedar at www sedar com and on edgar at www sec gov edgar drilling locations this press release discloses drilling locations in three categories i proved locations ii probable locations and iii unbooked locations proved locations and probable locations which are sometimes collectively referred to as booked locations are derived from the company s most recent independent reserves evaluation of the company s assets as prepared by insite petroleum consultants ltd insite as of december 31 2018 and account for drilling locations that have associated proved or probable reserves as applicable unbooked locations are internal estimates based on the company s prospective acreage and an assumption as to the number of wells that can be drilled per section based on industry practice and internal review unbooked locations do not have attributed reserves or resources of the 382 net spirit river drilling locations identified herein 132 are proved or probable locations and 250 are unbooked locations of the 251 net cardium drilling locations identified herein 127 are proved or probable locations and 124 are unbooked locations unbooked locations have specifically been identified by management as an estimation of our multi year drilling activities based on evaluation of applicable geologic seismic and engineering production and reserves data on prospective acreage and geologic formations the drilling locations on which we actually drill wells will ultimately depend upon the availability of capital regulatory approvals seasonal restrictions oil and natural gas prices costs actual drilling results and other factors while certain of the unbooked drilling locations have been derisked by drilling existing wells in relative close proximity to such unbooked drilling locations the majority of other unbooked drilling locations are farther away from existing wells where management has less information about the characteristics of the reservoir and therefore there is more uncertainty whether wells will be drilled in such locations and if drilled there is more uncertainty that such wells will result in additional oil and gas reserves resources or production information regarding disclosure on oil and gas reserves the reserves data set forth herein is based upon a report prepared by insite the company s independent reserves evaluator which is an independent reserves assessment and evaluation prepared by insite with an effective date of

natural gas to one barrel of oil equivalent 6 mcf bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead all boe conversions in this press release are derived from converting gas to oil in the ratio of six thousand cubic feet of gas to one barrel of oil given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6 1 utilizing a conversion on a 6 1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value initial rates of production references in this press release to initial production rates associated with certain wells are useful in confirming the presence of hydrocarbons however such rates are not determinative of the rates at which such wells will commence production and decline thereafter and are not indicative of long term performance or of ultimate recovery while encouraging readers are cautioned not to place reliance on such rates in calculating the aggregate production for the company the company cautions that such production rates should be considered to be preliminary oil and gas metrics this press release contains metrics commonly used in the oil and natural gas industry such as fd a costs recycle ratio operating netback reserve life index and sustaining capital these terms do not have standardized meanings and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies and therefore should not be used to make such comparisons fd a costs are used as a measure of capital efficiency fd a presented herein has been calculated based on exploration development and acquisition capital spent in the applicable period including changes in future development capital if applicable for that period divided by the change in reserves for that period including revisions for that same period bellatrix provides fd a costs that incorporate all acquisitions and exclude the reserve capital and fdc impact of dispositions during the year the calculation of fd a herein is based on working interest reserves recycle ratio is a measure for evaluating the effectiveness of a company s reinvestment program and the efficiency of capital investment it accomplishes this by comparing the operating netback per boe to that year s reserve fd a cost per boe see non gaap measures above for a description of how operating netbacks are calculated the reserve life index for 2018 is calculated by dividing reserves as at december 31 2018 by 2019 forecasted average production and has been presented to provide a measure of the amount of time production could be sustained at the production rates based on the reserves at the applicable point in time sustaining capital refers to capital expenditures to maintain production from existing facilities at current production levels additional details of how certain of these measures have been calculated are included in the press

collectively referred to as booked locations are derived from the company s most recent independent reserves evaluation of the company s assets as prepared by insite petroleum consultants ltd insite as of december 31 2018 and account for drilling locations that have associated proved or probable reserves as applicable unbooked locations are internal estimates based on the company s prospective acreage and an assumption as to the number of wells that can be drilled per section based on industry practice and internal review unbooked locations do not have attributed reserves or resources of the 382 net spirit river drilling locations identified herein 132 are proved or probable locations and 250 are unbooked locations of the 251 net cardium drilling locations identified herein 127 are proved or probable locations and 124 are unbooked locations unbooked locations have specifically been identified by management as an estimation of our multi year drilling activities based on evaluation of applicable geologic seismic and engineering production and reserves data on prospective acreage and geologic formations the drilling locations on which we actually drill wells will ultimately depend upon the availability of capital regulatory approvals seasonal restrictions oil and natural gas prices costs actual drilling results and other factors while certain of the unbooked drilling locations have been derisked by drilling existing wells in relative close proximity to such unbooked drilling locations the majority of other unbooked drilling locations are farther away from existing wells where management has less information about the characteristics of the reservoir and therefore there is more uncertainty whether wells will be drilled in such locations and if drilled there is more uncertainty that such wells will result in additional oil and gas reserves resources or production information regarding disclosure on oil and gas reserves the reserves data set forth herein is based upon a report prepared by insite the company s independent reserves evaluator which is an independent reserves assessment and evaluation prepared by insite with an effective date of

enough room in government shelters most kids are eventually released to parents or relatives __ 4 55 p m president donald trump s 2020 budget plan calls for a nationwide work requirement for low income adults getting health insurance through the federal state medicaid program a national work requirement would reduce medicaid spending by 130 billion over 10 years according to the budget

million more than the administration sought in the 2019 budget but it s at least 13 billion less than what congress approved it s also about 14 billion less than what lawmakers approved for 2018 the cuts in the new spending plan would come largely from sharp reductions in funding to international organizations like the united nations global health and refugee programs and a reorganization of

trump s 2020 spending blueprint he said gross domestic product grew by 3 1 percent in the 2018 fiscal year vought says the administration met its economic forecasts two years in a row although critics

clear if all will find support __ 2 p m anti aids activists are condemning proposed cuts for worldwide efforts to fight the disease in president donald trump s new budget request activists say the

million in new fees from the electronic cigarette industry to help combat a surge in underage vaping e cigarettes are battery powered devices that typically heat a nicotine solution into an inhalable

people with democrats in charge of the house trump s grand plan has no chance of being enacted and few republican lawmakers want to be dragged into another health care fight under the budget both programs would be turned over to the states starting in 2021 the affordable care act would be replaced with grants that states could use to subsidize private insurance coverage and medicaid would be replaced with a block grant instead of the current open ended federal commitment future federal spending increases would be tied to the rate of general inflation which is lower than health care inflation ___ 12 25 p m president donald trump is seeking just over 93 billion for the department of veterans affairs in his budget proposal for 2020 an increase of 6 5 billion from the year before

chancellor philip hammond has delivered the spring statement issuing warnings over brexit promising more money for police to tackle knife crime free sanitary products from schools and cash to help build affordable homes here s the full text of his speech mr speaker i am acutely conscious of the fact that the house has other pressing matters on its mind today and to avoid making this statement any longer than necessary i am laying a wms which contains additional announcements and provides further details of those that i will make mr speaker last night s vote leaves a cloud of uncertainty hanging over our economy and our most urgent task in this house is to lift that uncertainty but the economy itself is remarkably robust it has grown for nine consecutive years with the longest unbroken quarterly growth run of any g7 economy and is forecast to continue growing in each of the next five years an economy that has created over 3 5 million net new jobs that has seen female participation in the workforce increase to record levels and that is now delivering the fastest rate of wage growth in over a decade an economy that has defied expectations and will provide the solid foundation that britain needs to seize the opportunities that the future offers and thanks to the difficult decisions we have taken in the last nine years and the hard work of the british people i can also report today on public finances that continue to improve so that provided we do reach a deal to leave the european union with an orderly transition this country for the first time in a decade will have genuine and sustainable choices about its future today s obr report marks another step on britain s road out of austerity and i d like to thank robert chote and his team for their work despite the slowing world economy the obr expect britain to continue to grow in every year of the forecast at 1 2 this year with both the imf and the oecd forecasting the uk to grow faster than germany then 1 4 in 2020 as forecast at the budget and 1 6 in each of the final three years cumulative growth over the five years now slightly higher than the budget forecast meanwhile britain s remarkable jobs story is set to continue by 2023 the obr expect to see 600 000 more new jobs in our economy and despite the constant attempts from the opposition front bench to talk down our remarkable achievement on jobs the fact mr speaker is this last year 96 of new jobs were full time with the obr revising up wage growth to 3 or higher in every year and with inflation now around the target throughout the forecast period that means real wage growth in every year of the forecast a growing economy a thriving labour market inflation on target mr speaker a solid foundation on which to build britain s future image pa pa and there s good news on the public finances too borrowing this year will be just 1 1 of gdp 3 billion lower than forecast at the autumn budget looking forward borrowing will fall from 29 3 billion in 2019 20 then 21 2 billion 17 6 billion 14 4 billion and finally 13 5 billion in 2023 24 its lowest level in 22 years we remain on track to meet both our fiscal targets early with the cyclically adjusted deficit at 1 3 next year falling to just 0 5 by 2023 24 and with headroom against our fiscal mandate in 20 21 increasing from 15 4 billion at the autumn budget to 26 6 billion today less borrowing means less debt now lower in every year than forecast at the budget falling to 82 2 of gdp next year then 79 74 9 74 and finally 73 in 2023 24 our national debt falling sustainably for the first time in a generation since 2010 we have been steering the country on a journey of recovery back then the most important task was to get borrowing down to manageable levels but when i became chancellor in 2016 i recognised that with the progress we had already made as well as getting britain s debt down our continued success as a nation would depend on investing in our future supporting our vital public services and keeping taxes low to attract talent and investment i called it a balanced approach and it is delivering with the highest sustained levels of public capital investment in 40 years cuts in income taxes for more than 30 million people in three weeks time and debt on a sustained downward path for the first time in a generation i have made over 150 billion of new spending commitments since 2016 and at the budget i announced that the long but necessary squeeze on current public spending would come to an end at the upcoming spending review setting out an indicative 5 year path of 1 2 per annum real terms increases in day to day spending on public services compared to real terms cuts of 3 per annum announced at sr 2010 and 1 3 cuts at sr 2015 we have made our biggest choice on public spending putting the nhs first in line as the british public would expect with my rhf the prime minister s announcement of 34 billion of additional funding per year by the end of the period the single largest cash commitment ever made by a peacetime british government to support our long term plan for the nhs delivering mr speaker improved cancer and mental health care a transformation of gp services more doctors more nurses and better outcomes for patients now we need to address wider departmental spending for the next review period image house of commons pa house of commons pa so i can confirm today that assuming a brexit deal is agreed over the next few weeks and the uncertainty that is hanging over our economy is lifted i intend to launch a full three year spending review before the summer recess to be concluded alongside an autumn budget it will set departmental budgets beyond the nhs to reflect the public s priorities between areas like social care local government schools police defence and the environment and it will maximize value for taxpayers money through a renewed focus on delivering high quality outcomes and if we leave the eu with a deal and an orderly transition to a future economic partnership we will see a deal dividend an economic boost from recovery in business confidence and investment and a fiscal boost from a reduction in the minimum necessary level of fiscal headroom once the risk of a no deal exit is removed giving us as a nation real choices as we use the spending review to decide how much of this deal dividend we can prudently release and how we would share it between increased spending on public services capital investment in britain s future prosperity and keeping taxes low while always continuing to keep our debt falling real terms increases in public spending record investment in britain s future more jobs than ever before higher wages and lower taxes meaning increased take home pay and for the first time in a generation our debt going down that mr speaker is what i mean by an end to austerity image afp getty images afp getty images but mr speaker the progress we have made will be at risk if we cannot secure a smooth and orderly exit from the eu and a transition to a new partnership that protects the complex trading relationships businesses have built up over 45 years and on which so many british jobs depend i hoped we would do that last night but i am confident that we as a house will do it over the coming weeks leaving with no deal would mean significant disruption in the short and medium term and a smaller less prosperous economy in the long term than if we leave with a deal higher unemployment lower wages higher prices in the shops that is not what the british people voted for in june 2016 which is why all of us have a solemn duty in the days and weeks ahead to put aside our differences and seek a compromise on which this house can agree in the national interest but government also has a duty to plan for every reasonably foreseeable contingency and we have done so first we have plans in place to minimise disruption to our financial system and the bank of england judges that it is resilient to any likely no deal shock second we have worked across whitehall to put in place mitigations at our border although we cannot regulate how the eu will operate its border in a no deal exit third we have published today our temporary uk no deal tariff schedule carefully balancing the needs of producers and consumers in the context of the pressures the no deal economy would face and fourth the treasury and the bank of england together have all the tools of fiscal and monetary policy available to us including the fiscal headroom i have held in reserve but i need to be straight with the house a no deal brexit would deliver a significant short to medium term reduction in the productive capacity of the british economy and because our economy is operating at or near full capacity any fiscal and monetary response would have to be carefully calibrated not to simply cause inflation compounding the effect of any movement in the exchange rate on the price of goods in our shops and while fiscal and monetary intervention might help to smooth our path to a post brexit economy both could only be temporary and neither would allow us to avoid the effects of a relatively smaller economy nor the pain of restructuring so the idea that there is some simple readily available fix that can be deployed to avoid the consequences of a no deal brexit is i am afraid just wrong but mr speaker i m confident that we re going to do a deal and when we do the british people will fully expect us to fire up our economic plan to seize the opportunities as confidence in our economy returns but it isn t just the spectre of uncertainty that we need to overcome if we are to restore confidence and unlock a brighter future so our task is to demonstrate to the british people that working with business through the mechanism of a well regulated market economy our plan will deliver a brighter future for them a plan which makes the most of the opportunities ahead as we make our own way independent from but in continuing partnership with the european union a plan to embrace the technologies of the future and equip british workers to use them to back the enterprise and ambition of british business to support our world leading entrepreneurs creators and innovators inventors and discoverers to build on the uk s fundamental strengths and competitive advantages so that we can slay once and for all the twin demons of low productivity and low wages and build an economy that works for everyone mr speaker the only sustainable path to higher wages and rising living standards is to boost productivity and to do that we are investing in infrastructure skills technology and housing under our plan for britain s future with 37 billion in the national productivity investment fund the largest ever investment in england s strategic roads the biggest rail investment programme since victorian times and a strategy for delivering a nationwide full fibre network by 2033 at sr19 we will set multi year capital budgets following a zero based review protecting our record levels of capital spending while ensuring that investment is focussed to deliver the greatest impact on productivity and our investment strategy is benefitting the whole of the uk i can announce today up to 260 million for the innovative borderlands growth deal covering the border regions of england and scotland on top of the 100 million hif funding already announced for carlisle negotiations are progressing on future deals for mid wales and derry londonderry and i reiterate today this government s commitment to the northern powerhouse rail project and look forward to considering tfn s business case ahead of the spending review we will publish the updated national infrastructure strategy alongside the spending review and i am publishing today a consultation on our approach to supporting private infrastructure investment once we leave the european investment bank but raising our productivity isn t just about investing in physical capital it s also about investing in people the augar review will be published shortly and will represent an important contribution to our overall plan for post 18 education the government will respond later in the year we are committed to returning technical and vocational skills to the heart of our educational system with the new t level system on track to deliver the first three routes in 2020 the first phase of the national retraining scheme starting this summer and the apprenticeship programme rolling out 3 million new high quality apprenticeships and to help small businesses take on more apprentices i can announce that i am bringing forward the 700 million package of reforms i announced at budget to the start of the new financial year in april the productivity agenda is above all about increasing the wages of the lowest paid and the pay of a full timer on national minimum wage has risen by 2 750 a year since 2016 we ve confirmed the low pay commission s remit for the national living wage to reach 60 of median earnings by 2020 but later this year we will need to set a new remit beyond 2020 we want to be ambitious driving productivity across the income distribution with the ultimate objective of ending low pay in the uk but we also want to take care to protect employment opportunities for lower paid workers so we have asked professor arin dube a world leading expert in the field to undertake a review of the international evidence on the employment and productivity effects of minimum wage rates this study will support the extensive discussions that we will be having with employer organisations trades unions and the lpc itself over the coming months starting with a roundtable which i will chair next month mr speaker alongside our commitment to giving british workers the skills they need is a commitment to maintaining the openness of our economy to talent from around the world as we leave the eu free movement of people will end and we will take back control of our borders my rhf the home secretary has set out a framework for a future immigration system in the immigration white paper focussed on attracting those with the skills we need in the uk economy no matter where they come from we have committed to consulting with business to ensure that the new system supports the needs of our economy and as we do so i can announce that from june we will begin to abolish the need for paper landing cards at uk points of entry and we will allow citizens of the usa australia new zealand canada japan singapore and south korea to start using e gates at our airports and eurostar terminals alongside the eea nationals who can already use them mr speaker our ambition is to be able to go further in due course a signal to the world of our commitment to global britain another key pillar of our plan is backing britain to remain at the forefront of the technology revolution that is transforming our economy and to support that ambition from this autumn we will completely exempt phd level roles from the visa caps since 2016 we have launched our modern industrial strategy and committed an additional 7 billion to science and innovation clear progress towards our target of total r d spending reaching 2 4 of the economy but technology does not stand still and neither can we so to maintain the uk s technological edge we will invest 79 million in archer2 a new supercomputer to be hosted at edinburgh university i am told that it s up to five times faster than the current generation capable of a staggering ten thousand trillion calculations per second and i am told mr speaker that with the right algorithms it might even be able to come up with a solution to the backstop i am allocating 45 million of npif funding to the european bioinformatics institute ensuring britain s continued lead in genomics research i will guarantee our commitment to the uk s funding for the jet nuclear fusion reactor whatever happens with brexit and invest 81 million in a new extreme photonics centre in oxfordshire to develop new types of lasers literally the cutting edge of technology mr speaker the digital economy presents enormous opportunities but enormous challenges as well i have already responded to concerns about unfairness in the tax system with a new digital services tax so that digital platform companies pay their fair share but we also need to adapt our regulatory environment to ensure competition works for consumers in the digital market place as it does in the real market place i asked professor jason furman barack obama s former chief economist to review competition in the digital market place and i welcome his report published today he sets out far reaching recommendations including new powers for consumers and an overhaul of competition regulation updating our regulatory model for the digital age and as a first step towards implementing reforms i am asking the competition and markets authority to undertake a market study of the digital advertising market as soon as possible mr speaker the uk will remain a great place to do digital business but it will be a place where successful global tech giants pay their fair share where competition policy works in consumers interests and where the public are protected from online harms under this government britain will lead the world in delivering a digital economy that works for everyone image getty images getty images mr speaker a well regulated market economy is the best indeed the only way to deliver a brighter future for our country our challenge is to demonstrate to the next generation that our market economy can fulfil their aspirations and speak to their values so before i finish i want to talk about two subjects dear to them housing and the environment last year housing delivery exceeded 220 000 additional homes the highest level in all but one of the last 31 years mr speaker our ambitious plan to restore the dream of home ownership to millions of younger people is already delivering planning reform to release land in areas where the pressure is greatest a five year 44 billion housing programme to help raise annual housing supply to 300 000 by the mid 2020s the help to buy equity loan scheme abolition of stamp duty for first time buyers which has so far helped 240 000 people onto the property ladder and restored the proportion of first time buyers to above 50 for the first time in a generation and today i can announce a new 3 billion affordable homes guarantee scheme to support delivery of around 30 000 affordable homes the launch next month of the 1 billion enable build sme guarantee fund that i announced at budget and 717 million from the housing infrastructure fund to unlock up to 37 000 new homes on sites in west london cheshire didcot and cambridge the latter two being at opposite ends of the oxford cambridge arc for which i am publishing a new vision statement today mr speaker as with the challenge of adapting to the digital age so with the challenge of shaping the carbon neutral economy of the future we must apply the creativity of the marketplace to deliver solutions to one of the most complex problems of our time climate change and build sustainability into the heart of our economic model the uk is already leading the world reducing the carbon intensity of our economy faster than any other g20 country with ambitious and legally binding targets for the future today i can announce our next steps first we will publish a call for evidence on whether all passenger carriers should be required to offer genuinely additional carbon offsets so that customers who want zero carbon travel have that option and can be confident about additionality second we will help small businesses cut their carbon emissions and their energy bills publishing today a call for evidence on the business energy efficiency scheme that i announced at the budget third we will publish proposals to require an increased proportion of green gas in the grid advancing decarbonisation of our mains gas supply and finally we will introduce a future homes standard mandating the end of fossil fuel heating systems in all new houses from 2025 mr speaker delivering lower carbon and lower fuel bills too but mr speaker climate change is not our only environmental challenge we are already consulting on new tax and regulatory measures to tackle the scourge of plastic waste defacing our countryside and choking our oceans now for the first time in 60 million years the number of species worldwide is in sustained mass decline the uk s 1 500 species of pollinators deliver an estimated 680 million annual value to our economy so there is an economic as well as an environmental case for protecting the diversity of the natural world so following consultation the government will use the forthcoming environment bill to mandate biodiversity net gain for development in england ensuring that the delivery of much needed infrastructure and housing is not at the expense of vital biodiversity but this is a global problem mr speaker so later this year the uk government will launch a comprehensive global review of the link between biodiversity and economic growth to be led by professor sir partha dasgupta emeritus professor of economics at cambridge we in this house mr speaker should be proud that the uk with its overseas territories has already declared more than 3m square kilometres of marine protected area and today i can announce our intention to designate a further 445 000 square kilometers of ocean around ascension island as marine protected area taking action today on our pledge to be the first in history to leave our environment in a better condition than we found it image getty images getty images mr speaker before i conclude i have three further short announcements to make first in response to rising concern by headteachers that some girls are missing school attendance due to inability to afford sanitary products i have decided to fund the provision of free sanitary products in secondary schools and colleges in england from the next school year i congratulate those honourable members who have campaigned on this issue on all sides of this house and my rhf the education secretary will announce further details in due course second i announced a year ago that we would take definitive action to tackle the scourge of late payments for our small businesses a full response to last year s call for evidence will be published shortly but i can announce today that as a first step we will require company audit committees to review payment practices and report on them in their annual accounts my rhf the business secretary will announce further details in due course and i congratulate the fsb in particular on its tireless campaign on this issue third mr speaker the recent surge in knife crime represents a personal tragedy for the scores of families of victims and i know i can speak for the whole house when i offer my deepest sympathies to them we must and we will stamp out this menace police funding is due to rise by up to 970 million from april many police crime commissioners have already committed to using this extra funding to recruit and train additional police officers but that takes time and action is needed now so the prime minister and i have decided exceptionally to make available immediately to police forces in england and wales an additional 100 million over the course of the next year ring fenced to pay for additional overtime targeted specifically on knife crime and for new violent crime reduction units to deliver a wider cross agency response to this epidemic ahead of the spending review my rhf the home secretary will work with the police to consider how best to prioritise resources going forward including newly funded manpower to ensure a lasting solution to the problem mr speaker to be frank last night s events mean we are not where i hoped we would be today our economy is fundamentally robust but the uncertainty i hoped we would lift last night still hangs over it we cannot allow that to continue it is damaging our economy and it is damaging our standing and reputation in the world tonight we have a choice we can remove the threat of an imminent no deal exit hanging over our economy tomorrow we will have the opportunity to start to map out a way forward towards building a consensus across this house for a deal we can collectively support to exit the eu in an orderly way to a future relationship that will allow britain to flourish protecting jobs and businesses we have huge opportunities ahead of us our capital is the world s financial centre our universities are global powerhouses of discovery and innovation our businesses are at the cutting edge of the tech revolution and we have shown that we are not shy as a nation of the tasks that lie ahead we are addressing the environmental challenges that threaten our planet we are building the homes that the next generation desperately need we are investing in our future tackling the productivity gap and embracing technological change rising to its challenges and seizing its opportunities our potential is clear our advantages are manifest we are the fifth largest economy in the world a proud successful outward looking nation with no limit to our ambition and no boundaries to what we can achieve a brighter future is within our grasp tonight let s take a decisive step towards seizing it and building a britain fit for the future a britain the next generation will be proud to call their home i commend this statement to the house
first down week since january for s p 500 as unease spreads another wave of selling on wall street friday left the s p 500 with its worst weekly showing since january and its eighth loss in the last

peaking about a slowing global economy and that interest rates may rise too quickly since then the federal reserve helped calm some of the worries by pledging to be patient in raising rates still investors are feeling increasingly uneasy about the global economy the organisation for economic co operation and development said this week that it expects global growth to be 3 3 percent this year down from the 3 5 percent that it had forecast just four months ago the oecd said economic prospects are weaker in nearly all the countries that make up the g20 than previously expected and it cited a slowdown in trade and global manufacturing among other reasons the united states and china have been locked in a particularly tense trade dispute though the countries say they re making progress in negotiations analysts are debating whether the u s stock market s latest moves are the last gasps for the longest bull market on record for u s stocks which began 10 years ago this weekend or just the latest challenge for it muddle through right now the u s economy is gradually slowing and earnings are trending a little bit lower watkins said any news that has been coming out that hasn t been that strong has been a little bit of a negative catalyst for the market to have a reason to move back just a little bit the strong u s labor market has been a major pillar of support for the stock market s run in recent years but friday s jobs report was surprisingly bad employers added just 20 000 jobs last month when economists were expecting something closer to 180 000 last month s job growth was also a sharp slowdown from january s 311 000 a number that the government revised higher on friday a slower global economy wouldn t need as much oil and the price of crude sank friday along with expectations for demand benchmark u s crude fell 1 percent to settle at 56 07 per barrel brent crude the international standard lost 0 8 percent to close at 65 74 per barrel the sharp decline sent energy companies to double the loss of any of the other 10 sectors that make up the s p 500 they ended 2 percent lower also hurting the sector was a decision by norway s 1 trillion wealth fund to dump

the national debt is continuing to grow with deficits on track to hit 1 trillion and up but the massive debt isn t pushing interest rates up or even causing inflation which remains below the fed s 2 percent target this is an alice in wonderland world former international monetary fund chief economist olivier blanchard said in an interview with bloomberg and it s a world that japan has long been familiar with that europe also is getting used to and an idea that is prompting u s policy makers to reconsider how taxpayer money and interest rates should be handled the potential pitfalls include even higher government deficits and debt and faster inflation which goes against everything you learn in a basic economics course per bloomberg voodoo economics in congress there s a brewing fight over fiscal policy progressive democrats have seized on the growing tolerance of red ink to propose expensive new programs like the green new deal championed by new york congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez the political calculus goes something like this if president donald trump can drive up the deficit by cutting taxes for corporations and the wealthy without spooking the bond market why can t the democrats do the same with the spending packages they prefer at the fed chairman jerome powell and his colleagues are conducting a formal review of how they make policy and putting a renewed focus on fanning the inflation they complain is muted after raising interest rates four times in 2018 the central bank surprised markets in january by calling a time out investors are now betting the fed will stay on hold for the rest of this year and that its next rate move is more likely to be a cut than a hike in academia meanwhile a debate on the efficacy of government debt is playing out among left leaning economists at its heart is something called modern monetary theory a heterodox economic school that argues the u s can run bigger budget shortfalls without worrying about going broke because it prints its own money mainstream democrat economists have lambasted the theory former treasury secretary and now harvard university professor larry summers has said it s akin to voodoo economics with its promise of a proverbial free lunch assuming we re alive but such blowback obscures an important point even among establishment figures like summers there s a growing tolerance for deficits in a keynote address to the american economic association in january blanchard argued that with interest rates low and likely to stay that way government debt needn t be a bogeyman the peterson institute for international economics senior fellow returned to the theme last week sketching out this hypothetical scenario to reporters it s 2050 global temperature has increased by 5 percent the world is coming to an end and we turn to the kids at that point assuming we re still alive and we say look guys yes it s not good but there is no debt the fed has a shorter horizon for its wide ranging review of strategies tools and communications practices an idea borrowed from the bank of canada it s seeking outside views and aims to reach conclusions in the first half of next year front and center is what to do about inflation powell has ruled out raising the 2 percent target but he s also evinced concern about the risk of the u s falling into a disinflationary spiral that s what happened to japan more than two decades ago with disastrous results because the japanese expected prices to keep falling consumers put off purchases and companies shelved expansion plans and zero rates policy at the central bank failed to entice them eventually a combination of cheap money and budget deficits succeeded in shoring up demand but only after years of lost growth seductive idea in a march 8 speech powell suggested one way to battle the low inflation syndrome from the monetary side he said the fed could adopt a make up strategy letting inflation run above target during good times like now to offset the periods of slower price rises the aim would be to cement the public s view of where prices are headed and so avoid the deflationary trap that snared japan we want inflation expectations to be anchored at around 2 percent powell told cbs in an interview aired march 10 there are risks of course if consumers and companies decide that the goal of price stability has been abandoned then inflation could rise a lot higher than the fed wants as in the 1970s when it reached double digits mmt type fiscal policy carries perils as well it could open the floodgates to a rush of costly programs it s a very seductive idea said maya macguineas president of the non profit committee for a responsible federal budget i can spend money on everything and taken together a laissez faire approach to both inflation and deficits could awaken the bond vigilantes and send long term interest rates shooting skyward in the end though the u s may have little choice but to adapt policy to the looking glass economy it s stuck with the same applies in much of the industrial world sum9222 mers argued in a paper this month co authored with bank of england senior economist lukasz rachel without a forceful response he wrote it s at risk of mirroring the experience of japan
luxembourg march 14 2018 prnewswire adecoagro s a nyse agro bloomberg agro us reuters agro k a leading agricultural company in south america announced today its results for the fourth quarter of 2018 main highlights for the period full year 2018 adjusted ebitda 3 was 314 7 marking a 13 9 increase compared to the previous year adjusted ebitda margin net of 3rd party commercialization reached 47 3 96 basis points higher than 2017 marking a 13 9 increase compared to the previous year adjusted ebitda margin net of 3rd party commercialization reached 47 3 96 basis points higher than 2017 gross sales reached 810 6 million in 2018 13 1 lower year over year in 2018 13 1 lower year over year full year 2018 adjusted net income was 91 3 million marking a 30 2 increase compared to the previous year financial operational highlights in our sugar ethanol energy business adjusted ebitda reached 238 3 million in 2018 9 0 million or 3 6 lower year over year adjusted ebitda was positively affected by i the full maximization of ethanol production allowing us to profit from higher relative prices hydrous and anhydrous ethanol traded at a 26 1 and 32 0 premium to sugar respectively almost 74 total trs produced was diverted to ethanol an all time record ii higher crushing activities which contributed to fixed costs dilution resulting in a 22 8 reduction in total cash cost of production higher cane availability coupled with adequate weather during november and december explained the 10 9 increase in milling operations at the same time improved efficiencies at the agricultural and industrial level contributed to higher crushing activities these were reflected in the 2 8 increase in milling per hour year over year iii a 12 9 million higher gain derived from the mark to market of our commodity hedge position these positive effects were offset by lower sales mainly as a result of lower average realized selling prices measured in usd higher ethanol carry to profit from higher prices in the off season coupled with a non cash loss resulting from the fair value of the unharvested cane on a quarterly basis the sugar ethanol energy business delivered outstanding operational performance the combination of dry weather during november and december sugarcane availability and operational efficiency enabled our mills to crush 2 7 million tons 24 8 higher compared to 4q17 our lower costs of production were fully offset by lower selling prices coupled with a negative non cash result derived from the mark to market of the unharvested sugarcane adjusted ebitda in our farming and land transformation businesses reached 96 4 million in 2018 45 8 million or 90 3 higher year over year this increase is primarily related to i the 36 2 million in ebitda generated by the sale of rio de janeiro and conquista farms during 2q18 ii the better performance of our crops and rice businesses enhanced operational efficiencies and the depreciation of the argentine peso which allowed us to further reduce total cost of production were responsible for the 9 0 and 6 6 million increase in our crops and rice businesses ebitda respectively these positive results were partially offset by the 5 1 million ebitda reduction in results in our dairy business mainly driven by lower average selling prices on a quarterly basis adjusted ebitda was negative 4 0 million 17 1 million lower compared to the same period of last year this decrease is primarily explained by the performance of our rice and dairy businesses the postponement of rice sales towards to 1q19 resulted in lower ebitda generation as for dairy the 15 1 reduction in average selling prices explain the 3 6 million decrease year over year net income in 2018 resulted in a loss of 23 2 million compared to a 15 0 million gain recorded in the same period of last year higher ebitda generation as a result of better economic performance was offset by i the 183 2 million non cash loss derived from the revaluation of our u s dollar denominated financial debt measured in local currency coupled with ii a 15 7 million loss resulting from the application of ias 21 the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates compared to a gain recorded in the same period of last year higher ebitda generation as a result of better economic performance was offset by i the non cash loss derived from the revaluation of our u s dollar denominated financial debt measured in local currency coupled with ii a loss resulting from the application of ias 21 the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates adjusted net income a concept we introduced in 2018 to more accurately provide a proxy cash metric by definition excludes i any non cash result derived from bilateral exchange variations ii any revaluation result from the hectares held as investment property iii any inflation accounting result and includes iv any gains or losses from disposals of non controlling interests in subsidiaries whose main underlying asset is farmland the latter is already included in adj ebitda we believe adjusted net income is a more appropriate metric to reflect the company s performance in 2018 adjusted net income reached 91 3 million 21 2 million or 30 2 higher compared 2017 please refer to page 33 for a reconciliation of adjusted net income to profit loss strategy execution 5 year plan update the execution of our 5 year plan is advancing according to plan as explained in detail at last investor day projects are estimated to contribute to a 50 increase in ebitda and strong cash generation it should be noted that the projects are of a additional nature thereby reducing execution risk this fits perfectly in our long term growth strategy by vertically integrating our business and making them more robust the expansion of our cluster in mato grosso do sul is proceeding according to plan a total of 48 201 hectares have been secured for planting so far representing 90 0 of the total hectares needed to fully supply the 3 million tons of additional crushing capacity planting operations are also well underway as a matter of fact 20 100 hectares have already been planted we feel confident that we will be able to plant the remaining hectares throughout 2020 and 2021 dependent on normal weather conditions milk processing facilities investment update on february 11th we completed the acquisition of two milk processing plants the 45 million deal was structured as a cash for asset totally free of debt and other liabilities both plants are well equipped and strategically located one is in the city of morteros province of cordoba in the center of argentina s largest dairy basin with a total processing capacity of 910 thousand liters per day this facility will produce powder milk and cheese for the export market the other plant located in the city of chivilcoy province of buenos aires is halfway between our dairy free stalls facilities and the city of buenos aires the largest fluid dairy market total processing capacity of this facility is to 700 thousand liters per day this transaction as was announced in our last investor day is in line with our 5 year plan and fits perfectly our long term growth strategy in fact we are following the same strategy as in our rice and sugar ethanol and energy businesses in both cases being vertically integrated has proven to be the right thing to do controlling the supply chain allow us to enhance efficiencies and increase margins at the same time apart from synergizing with our already efficient upstream operation this transaction will enable us with the flexibility to sell into the export and domestic market based on relative profitability with a view to generate attractive returns it s worth highlighting that we are entering the consumer retail market with products that bear similar characteristics with those of commodities indeed powder milk and uht milk are largely commoditized and do not require large investment in marketing and branding we are confident that this transaction will be accretive to our existing shareholders with expected roic in 20 25 range once stabilized results are based on three main pillars namely i being efficient raw milk producers raw milk constitutes almost 50 of final products total cost ii being efficient processors by having state of the art facilities with focus on both quality and cost and iii operating an efficient logistic chain on this final point we will rely on third party trucks and distribute exclusively to large distribution centers at the same time we are exploring different business to business agreements to further enhance margins going from private label agreements with supermarkets to specific supply agreements we may also be able to leverage the high quality in milk and stable production of our free stall facilities crops update our crops are going through their respective critical stage actual conditions are so far optimal and we expect yields to be above historical average and significantly higher compared to the previous harvest year at the same time higher yields will offset lower planted area due to flooding during december and january of some fields over the last five years we have been systematically increasing peanut area reaching the current 15 608 hectares this is a crop that fits well into the traditional corn beans wheat rotation reason why we are strategically increasing production specifically over leased area on february 8th we acquired a peanut processing facility for a total of 10 million half of its replacement cost to be paid in three equal yearly installments the plant is equipped with cutting edge technology and it has been granted with all the necessary certifications and export permits it s worth highlighting that the yearly installment cost fully offset the tolling expenses we paid before the acquisition this transaction is in line with our strategy to increase peanut area as it will enable us to control processing activities and develop direct and long term relations with different customers around the world we expect irr to be above 30 farmland sale at premium to independent appraisal during january 2019 we completed the sale of alto alegre farm located in tocantins for 16 8 million to be paid in 7 installments the selling price represents a 33 premium to the latest cushman and wakefield s independent appraisal as of september 30 2018 adjusted free cash flow during 2018 our operations have delivered 77 8 million of adjusted free cash flow from operations adjusted free cash flow before expansion capex in line with the previous year lower sales volume in our crops business as a result of the drought that hit argentina at the beginning of 2018 compromising production volumes for the 2017 18 harvest season coupled with the ethanol carry strategy that we pursued were offset by lower production costs as a result of enhanced efficiencies and the sale of rio de janeiro and conquista farms during 2q18 adjusted free cash flow totaled negative 18 1 million 25 2 million lower compared to the same period of last year the decrease is fully explained by the higher expansion capex as we are advancing in the execution of our 5 year plan investment projects we are confident adjusted ebitda and cash flows will increase as we complete the investment cycle and start ramping up our operations 1 adjusted ebitda is defined as i consolidated net profit loss for the year as applicable before interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization net gain from fair value adjustments of investment property land foreign exchange gains or losses other net financial expenses and ii adjusted by profit or loss from discontinued operations if any and iii adjusted by those items that do not impact profit and loss but are recorded directly in shareholders equity i e x the gains or losses from disposals of non controlling interests in subsidiaries whose main underlying asset is farmland

luxembourg march 14 2018 prnewswire adecoagro s a nyse agro bloomberg agro us reuters agro k a leading agricultural company in south america announced today its results for the fourth quarter of 2018 main highlights for the period full year 2018 adjusted ebitda 3 was 314 7 marking a 13 9 increase compared to the previous year adjusted ebitda margin net of 3rd party commercialization reached 47 3 96 basis points higher than 2017 marking a 13 9 increase compared to the previous year adjusted ebitda margin net of 3rd party commercialization reached 47 3 96 basis points higher than 2017 gross sales reached 810 6 million in 2018 13 1 lower year over year in 2018 13 1 lower year over year full year 2018 adjusted net income was 91 3 million marking a 30 2 increase compared to the previous year financial operational highlights in our sugar ethanol energy business adjusted ebitda reached 238 3 million in 2018 9 0 million or 3 6 lower year over year adjusted ebitda was positively affected by i the full maximization of ethanol production allowing us to profit from higher relative prices hydrous and anhydrous ethanol traded at a 26 1 and 32 0 premium to sugar respectively almost 74 total trs produced was diverted to ethanol an all time record ii higher crushing activities which contributed to fixed costs dilution resulting in a 22 8 reduction in total cash cost of production higher cane availability coupled with adequate weather during november and december explained the 10 9 increase in milling operations at the same time improved efficiencies at the agricultural and industrial level contributed to higher crushing activities these were reflected in the 2 8 increase in milling per hour year over year iii a 12 9 million higher gain derived from the mark to market of our commodity hedge position these positive effects were offset by lower sales mainly as a result of lower average realized selling prices measured in usd higher ethanol carry to profit from higher prices in the off season coupled with a non cash loss resulting from the fair value of the unharvested cane on a quarterly basis the sugar ethanol energy business delivered outstanding operational performance the combination of dry weather during november and december sugarcane availability and operational efficiency enabled our mills to crush 2 7 million tons 24 8 higher compared to 4q17 our lower costs of production were fully offset by lower selling prices coupled with a negative non cash result derived from the mark to market of the unharvested sugarcane adjusted ebitda in our farming and land transformation businesses reached 96 4 million in 2018 45 8 million or 90 3 higher year over year this increase is primarily related to i the 36 2 million in ebitda generated by the sale of rio de janeiro and conquista farms during 2q18 ii the better performance of our crops and rice businesses enhanced operational efficiencies and the depreciation of the argentine peso which allowed us to further reduce total cost of production were responsible for the 9 0 and 6 6 million increase in our crops and rice businesses ebitda respectively these positive results were partially offset by the 5 1 million ebitda reduction in results in our dairy business mainly driven by lower average selling prices on a quarterly basis adjusted ebitda was negative 4 0 million 17 1 million lower compared to the same period of last year this decrease is primarily explained by the performance of our rice and dairy businesses the postponement of rice sales towards to 1q19 resulted in lower ebitda generation as for dairy the 15 1 reduction in average selling prices explain the 3 6 million decrease year over year net income in 2018 resulted in a loss of 23 2 million compared to a 15 0 million gain recorded in the same period of last year higher ebitda generation as a result of better economic performance was offset by i the 183 2 million non cash loss derived from the revaluation of our u s dollar denominated financial debt measured in local currency coupled with ii a 15 7 million loss resulting from the application of ias 21 the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates compared to a gain recorded in the same period of last year higher ebitda generation as a result of better economic performance was offset by i the non cash loss derived from the revaluation of our u s dollar denominated financial debt measured in local currency coupled with ii a loss resulting from the application of ias 21 the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates adjusted net income a concept we introduced in 2018 to more accurately provide a proxy cash metric by definition excludes i any non cash result derived from bilateral exchange variations ii any revaluation result from the hectares held as investment property iii any inflation accounting result and includes iv any gains or losses from disposals of non controlling interests in subsidiaries whose main underlying asset is farmland the latter is already included in adj ebitda we believe adjusted net income is a more appropriate metric to reflect the company s performance in 2018 adjusted net income reached 91 3 million 21 2 million or 30 2 higher compared 2017 please refer to page 33 for a reconciliation of adjusted net income to profit loss strategy execution 5 year plan update the execution of our 5 year plan is advancing according to plan as explained in detail at last investor day projects are estimated to contribute to a 50 increase in ebitda and strong cash generation it should be noted that the projects are of a additional nature thereby reducing execution risk this fits perfectly in our long term growth strategy by vertically integrating our business and making them more robust the expansion of our cluster in mato grosso do sul is proceeding according to plan a total of 48 201 hectares have been secured for planting so far representing 90 0 of the total hectares needed to fully supply the 3 million tons of additional crushing capacity planting operations are also well underway as a matter of fact 20 100 hectares have already been planted we feel confident that we will be able to plant the remaining hectares throughout 2020 and 2021 dependent on normal weather conditions milk processing facilities investment update on february 11th we completed the acquisition of two milk processing plants the 45 million deal was structured as a cash for asset totally free of debt and other liabilities both plants are well equipped and strategically located one is in the city of morteros province of cordoba in the center of argentina s largest dairy basin with a total processing capacity of 910 thousand liters per day this facility will produce powder milk and cheese for the export market the other plant located in the city of chivilcoy province of buenos aires is halfway between our dairy free stalls facilities and the city of buenos aires the largest fluid dairy market total processing capacity of this facility is to 700 thousand liters per day this transaction as was announced in our last investor day is in line with our 5 year plan and fits perfectly our long term growth strategy in fact we are following the same strategy as in our rice and sugar ethanol and energy businesses in both cases being vertically integrated has proven to be the right thing to do controlling the supply chain allow us to enhance efficiencies and increase margins at the same time apart from synergizing with our already efficient upstream operation this transaction will enable us with the flexibility to sell into the export and domestic market based on relative profitability with a view to generate attractive returns it s worth highlighting that we are entering the consumer retail market with products that bear similar characteristics with those of commodities indeed powder milk and uht milk are largely commoditized and do not require large investment in marketing and branding we are confident that this transaction will be accretive to our existing shareholders with expected roic in 20 25 range once stabilized results are based on three main pillars namely i being efficient raw milk producers raw milk constitutes almost 50 of final products total cost ii being efficient processors by having state of the art facilities with focus on both quality and cost and iii operating an efficient logistic chain on this final point we will rely on third party trucks and distribute exclusively to large distribution centers at the same time we are exploring different business to business agreements to further enhance margins going from private label agreements with supermarkets to specific supply agreements we may also be able to leverage the high quality in milk and stable production of our free stall facilities crops update our crops are going through their respective critical stage actual conditions are so far optimal and we expect yields to be above historical average and significantly higher compared to the previous harvest year at the same time higher yields will offset lower planted area due to flooding during december and january of some fields over the last five years we have been systematically increasing peanut area reaching the current 15 608 hectares this is a crop that fits well into the traditional corn beans wheat rotation reason why we are strategically increasing production specifically over leased area on february 8th we acquired a peanut processing facility for a total of 10 million half of its replacement cost to be paid in three equal yearly installments the plant is equipped with cutting edge technology and it has been granted with all the necessary certifications and export permits it s worth highlighting that the yearly installment cost fully offset the tolling expenses we paid before the acquisition this transaction is in line with our strategy to increase peanut area as it will enable us to control processing activities and develop direct and long term relations with different customers around the world we expect irr to be above 30 farmland sale at premium to independent appraisal during january 2019 we completed the sale of alto alegre farm located in tocantins for 16 8 million to be paid in 7 installments the selling price represents a 33 premium to the latest cushman and wakefield s independent appraisal as of september 30 2018 adjusted free cash flow during 2018 our operations have delivered 77 8 million of adjusted free cash flow from operations adjusted free cash flow before expansion capex in line with the previous year lower sales volume in our crops business as a result of the drought that hit argentina at the beginning of 2018 compromising production volumes for the 2017 18 harvest season coupled with the ethanol carry strategy that we pursued were offset by lower production costs as a result of enhanced efficiencies and the sale of rio de janeiro and conquista farms during 2q18 adjusted free cash flow totaled negative 18 1 million 25 2 million lower compared to the same period of last year the decrease is fully explained by the higher expansion capex as we are advancing in the execution of our 5 year plan investment projects we are confident adjusted ebitda and cash flows will increase as we complete the investment cycle and start ramping up our operations 1 adjusted ebitda is defined as i consolidated net profit loss for the year as applicable before interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization net gain from fair value adjustments of investment property land foreign exchange gains or losses other net financial expenses and ii adjusted by profit or loss from discontinued operations if any and iii adjusted by those items that do not impact profit and loss but are recorded directly in shareholders equity i e x the gains or losses from disposals of non controlling interests in subsidiaries whose main underlying asset is farmland

in an ideal world the fall of robert mugabe as president of zimbabwe was supposed to usher in a period of sustained economic growth and prosperity mugabe 95 was toppled by his loyalists in a military coup in november 2017 after a long and bitter succession battle in his ruling zanu pf the rise of his protégé emmerson mnangagwa to become only zimbabwe s second leader in 38 years promised an immediate end to economic turmoil as the country emerged from international isolation however more than a year after mugabe s departure zimbabwe s economy is far from bouncing back and frustration is beginning to creep in among long suffering citizens thanks to a currency crisis in february the reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz abandoned the united states dollar which has been in use since 2009 in favour of a virtual currency fear now abounds that savings will be wiped out for the second time in a decade and confidence is waning that mnangagwa is the messiah the country was shocked by recent revelations that the rbz has already borrowed a staggering 985 million from african banks including mozambique s central bank and the african export and import bank without parliamentary approval in a very short space of time according to government documents and interviews with former ministers the debts that are now the biggest impediment to economic revival were accrued to cover a big financial hole created through the financing of programmes rolled just before mugabe s dramatic ouster to shore up his presidency in the last days of his rule mugabe resorted to populist but economically daft policies for which zimbabwe is still paying jonathan moyo a former minister and close mugabe ally now says the policies were pushed by a zanu pf faction aligned to the army that was preparing the groundwork for the coup the biggest such programme was the command agriculture scheme which was sponsored by mnangagwa who went on to topple mugabe with the help of the army the programme was supposed to ensure that zimbabwe grows enough grain to sustain itself it was touted as a runaway success even if the country continues to be a wholesale importer of grain long after it implemented the command agriculture scheme that it was extended to other spheres such as command livestock and command fisheries among other similar schemes figures are hard to come by in zimbabwe but moyo a former zanu pf spin doctor estimates that the zimbabwean economy lost 5 billion thanks to command agriculture with most of that money being used to deepen corruption in 2017 the international monetary fund imf warned that the funding structure for the command agriculture scheme would exacerbate cash scarcity further jeopardise the financial sector and ultimately fuel inflation an advisory generated by the finance ministry s debt management office last year warned that the funding model for command agriculture would be disastrous for the economy it pointed out that the scheme was open to abuse as the supposed funders were actually feeding off from the government but at the time the red flag was raised mugabe came out in defence of the programme saying it was the panacea to zimbabwe s food insecurity but people like moyo and former finance minister tendai biti believe that there was a more sinister agenda to the command agriculture scheme and it was used as the launchpad for the coup that toppled mugabe who had ruled zimbabwe since independence from britain in 1980 biti believes that command agriculture scheme and diamond mining where mugabe once claimed the country lost 15 billion to corruption were vehicles for self aggrandisement for those close to mnangagwa his theory is that mugabe discovered the looting kicked out the mining firms from china and confronted the chinese authorities claiming your boys are stealing with my boys and the coup happened fast because mugabe was getting closer to the truth you cannot view command agriculture in isolation to the infrastructure of corruption what i call the commanding heights of corruption in the country biti says verbosely moyo on the other hand says mugabe was warned that his then deputy was plotting against him but he chose not to believe the intelligence and instead described command agriculture as a beautiful programme in general president mugabe trusted mnangagwa and constantino more than he trusted some of us he says somewhat wistfully in the end he saw the two and described them as his tormentors moyo continued command agriculture was a coup plotting strategy initially crafted by the military intelligence department overseen by emmerson mnangagwa as then vice president and general constantino chiwenga then commander of the zimbabwe defence forces its multiple objectives included taking over a civilian portfolio ministry of agriculture deeply connected across the economy and with rural and farming communities that make up the majority of the electorate in order to embed the army with the civilian population another strategic purpose was to access unlimited funding to finance the coup and accumulate patronage since the land reform programme that began in 2000 which saw productive white farmers being kicked off the land zimbabwe has struggled to produce enough to feed itself the country then adopted the ambitious command agriculture programme which was implemented by senior army officials who were close to mnangagwa mnangagwa s critics believe he used the cover of this programme to embed local communities and ultimately it was the launchpad for the coup moyo claimed command agriculture was only one component of the coup as mnangagwa had laid out a strategy to capture state institutions such as the zimbabwe anti corruption commission the national prosecuting authority and elements of the judiciary to target political opponents for persecution in the form of corrupt prosecutions and to get favourable decisions from the bench in aid of the coup president mugabe was told about these programmes and their sinister objectives the former minister now exiled in kenya said for the most part he did not believe the information when i raised red flags about command agriculture calling it uglyculture president mugabe publicly defended the programme and mnangagwa calling command agriculture a beautiful programme in general president mugabe trusted mnangagwa and constantino more than he trusted some of us i suppose because he came with him a long way and they were pillars of his rule since 1980 when he realised their plots against him as the coup was unfolding president mugabe clearly felt betrayed by mnangagwa and chiwenga in particular to him the two were treacherous beyond description the former information minister faces accusations of abuse of office and corruption but he dismisses the charges as spurious and politically motivated he claims chiwenga and mnangagwa tried to kill him during the coup after soldiers fired several shots at his harare home mnangagwa picked oxford professor and former african development bank vice president mthuli ncube to clean up the financial mess of mugabe s last year s in office but few countries appear willing to give zimbabwe a substantial financial bailout botswana was recently forced to deny claims by zimbabwean government official that it had offered harare a 600 million diamond backed loan on his return from a one day state visit to zimbabwe botswana president mokgweetsi masisi told journalists that his government had only offered to guarantee a 100 million private credit line for local companies to invest in the troubled neighbouring country zimbabwe cannot access loans from multilateral lenders such as the imf and the world bank because it owes the bretton woods millions of dollars in loans dating back to the mugabe era

reference to the non gaap measures of net debt may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other entities operating netback is calculated by deducting transportation royalties and operating costs from revenue operating netback includes the impact of commodity price risk management contracts the company s calculation of total net debt excludes other deferred liabilities deferred capital obligations long term risk management contract liabilities decommissioning liabilities and deferred tax liabilities total net debt includes the adjusted working capital deficiency long term loans receivable senior notes second lien notes convertible debentures liability component current credit facilities and long term credit facilities the adjusted working capital deficiency is calculated as net working capital deficiency excluding current risk management contract assets and liabilities current portion of other deferred liabilities current portion of deferred capital

to oil in the ratio of six thousand cubic feet mcf of gas to one barrel bbl of oil boe may be misleading particularly if used in isolation a boe conversion ratio of 6 mcf 1 bbl is based on an energy conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead in addition given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6 1 utilizing a conversion on a 6 1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value drilling locations this press

in a washington post op ed piece dated march 4 lawrence summers one of the most deliberative and experienced economists issued dire warnings on the risks associated with modern monetary theory a new school of thought it proposes that in an era of low interest rates central banks could finance increased government spending by increasing money supply to stimulate economic growth or protect against a recession the warnings were directed at the extreme or asymptotic conditions of the theory but while it was a valid idea the article disappointed by not expanding on why when or how the theory could be practicable or useful of course stretched out abused and misused modern monetary theory is silly and will lead to both increased inflation and currency depreciation but this is like saying alcohol will destroy mankind without realizing that used in moderation and only by responsible people it might have beneficial and enjoyable effects also directly comparing it to supply side economics can be confusing the former deals with central bank monetary policy while the latter associated with the still unproven laffer curve theory where tax cuts would pay for themselves by promoting growth deals with fiscal policy two totally different kinds of policies that could each be economically beneficial when pursued in moderation but damaging when misused the legacy of supply side economics is easy to see repeatedly overused tax cuts produced larger budget deficits which accumulated over the past 20 years to unsustainable levels the u s public debt is now more than 22 trillion galloping at a faster growth rate than that of the gdp just recently the bureau of economic analysis came out with its first cut gdp growth numbers after unprecedented tax cuts more than 2 trillion the economy grew at 2 9 percent in 2018 while producing another budget deficit approaching 1 trillion by comparison the u s economy had also grown by the same 2 9 percent in 2015 but with a deficit about half as large and without tax cuts taking the national debt to unwelcome heights when will economists and politicians admit that george h w bush was right when he called misguided overreliance on tax cuts voodoo economics it seems reasonable therefore that before we consider which monetary theory to embrace we should first extricate ourselves from what has been a demonstrably misguided mindset of fiscal policy without falling in the mental traps of right vs left wing classifications as to monetary policy without dwelling on the merits of modern versus classic monetary theories the time has also come to reduce the reliance on the federal reserve to sustain america s prosperity the latter results from other forms of proactive policies focused on productivity gains by boosting the value and reach of a nation s human capital versus the shuffling of interest rates or money supply laissez faire economics is a lazy man s sport not the champion s approach to global competitiveness the good news is that none of this is unknown to the fed america s central bank it would be surprising if alan greenspan ben bernanke janet yellen or jerome powell thinks otherwise if the fed thinks we can finance increased infrastructure or public works spending i e constructive accretive investments through increased money supply without sacrificing the value of the dollar or inviting a spike in inflation they may be more accommodating but they will have to fit in a grander bolder vision articulated by congress that should form the basis to revise the fed s new mandate what will that revised monetary policy be called then it doesn t matter as long as it is done in tandem with prudent fiscal policies both pushing in the same direction versus one sabotaging the other simply put the days of burdening the fed with supply side economics i e fiscal follies are over the question is what will we have instead in a decelerating economy where thoughtful policy leadership has never been more critical since the 1950s moris simson is a fellow of the ic² institute at the university of texas at austin and a member of the american college of corporate directors a version of this op ed appeared in the hill
by nottingham advisors the 35 day us government shutdown that ended on january 25th skewed much of the economic data that came out in february that being said the consensus seems to be that the us is following the rest of the world into a slower growth mode fourth quarter gdp was released on february 28th and it showed the us economy growing at a 2 6 annualized rate beating expectations for 2 2 growth but down from the prior reading of 3 4 growth in personal consumption fell from 3 5 to 2 8 while the gdp price index edged up 1 8 retail sales for december registered a surprise 1 2 mom drop against expectations for a 0 1 gain mom while ex autos retail sales dropped 1 8 mom analysts registered confusion over the drop in sales coming during the busy holiday shopping period however some are suggesting q4 s equity market collapse sapped the consumers confidence and that spilled over into a pullback in spending coincident with this pullback in spending was a rise in the household saving rate during december to 7 6 we ll look to march s report to either confirm or doubt the signals from the february retail sales number the markit us manufacturing pmi for january came in at 54 9 and fell to 53 0 for february the ism manufacturing pmi dropped from 56 6 in january to 54 2 for february while both numbers are suggestive of a continued expansion in the us manufacturing sector the pace of growth would appear to be slowing the markit us services pmi for february came in at 56 2 signaling continued strength in the non manufacturing sectors housing data for the notoriously fickle winter month of january showed a drop off from december with existing home sales falling 1 2 mom and housing starts collapsing by 11 2 mom no doubt the q4 stock sell off followed by the government shutdown created a lot of noise with the data for january and february we ll look to the coming months reports for a better picture as to the health of the us economy for now the fed appears to be on hold and the bulls have taken back the equity market we would expect improved data going forward domestic equity u s equities continued their hot streak in february as the federal reserve tempered expectations for future interest rate hikes and president trump postponed a planned tariff increase on chinese goods the benchmark s p 500 index rose 3 21 on the month only to be outperformed by the smaller s p smallcap 600 and midcap 400 indices which returned 4 35 and 4 24 respectively through just the first two months of the year the s p 500 is already up 11 48 while small and mid caps have fared much better up 15 45 and 15 14 respectively at the current index level of 2 784 on the s p 500 index u s equities appear to be reasonably valued at approximately 16 times consensus earnings estimates for 2019 which is in line with long term averages from a sector standpoint all 11 gics sectors finished the month in positive territory information technology was the top performer rising 6 89 on the month followed closely by industrials which gained 6 40 both cyclical sectors likely benefitted from the postponement of chinese tariffs and an overall risk on sentiment during the period both industrials and tech are handily beating the broader market year to date up 18 55 and 14 34 respectively defensive sectors were a mixed bag with utilities rising 4 16 consumer staples adding 2 30 and real estate gaining 1 11 health care one of last year s top performers has languished year to date overshadowed by political risk heading into the 2020 election the sector gained 1 17 in february and has trailed the broader market by more than five percentage points year to date while defensive sectors have lagged since the start of the year they remain the best performers over the past year with utilities and real estate up nearly 20 apiece compared to the s p 500 s less than 5 return leading factor contributors for the year include high beta and momentum which have gained 13 39 and 17 47 respectively on the year international equity investing international equities continued to rally in february following their u s equity brethren higher during the period the federal reserve s pause and president trump s delay in implementing tariffs on chinese goods contributed to an overall risk on tone for the month pushing both developed and emerging markets equities higher developed international equities as measured by the msci eafe index rose 2 58 during the period and are now up 9 36 for the year emerging markets gained a scant 0 22 during the month but are still up 8 99 ytd from a regional and country standpoint geopolitics clearly played a role in returns with sharp differentials from europe to asia u k equities as measured by the ftse 100 index gained 2 30 on the month and are up 6 02 on the year in gbp terms with the impending march 29 brexit deadline quickly approaching it remains to be seen whether or not lawmakers will call another referendum or reach a deal with the eu in time for an orderly brexit furthermore japanese equities rose 3 02 on the month and are up 6 93 on the year in jpy terms ahead of another planned sales tax increase set to take place this year it remains to be seen whether pm abe will enact a stimulus package to offset the impact of the hike in the meantime investors appear to be steering clear of both countries ahead of such uncertainty as both markets have trailed the broader msci eafe benchmark ytd eurozone equities remain the anomaly gaining 3 96 on the month and 10 57 ytd in eur terms despite economic data that continues to deteriorate critical u s negotiations on eu auto tariffs remain which could derail the rally chinese equities rallied sharply with the shanghai composite index up 13 79 in cny terms on the month index provider msci announced last night that it will be increasing the weight of china a shares in the msci em index from a factor of 5 to 20 over the next year with the inclusion taking place in three phases msci noted the progress that china has made in opening up the china a market but cautioned on further inclusion until further operational improvements are made china a shares will make up about 3 3 of the msci em index from 0 7 currently when all is said and done about on par with the weight of mexico in the benchmark msci also noted that companies listed on shenzhen s chinext exchange will become eligible for inclusion in may chinext is a technology heavy exchange similar to nasdaq fixed income investing february was a fairly quiet month for the treasury yield curve rates moved marginally higher 4 8 basis points in a roughly parallel shift the minor inversion putting the 12 month treasury yield slightly higher than the 2 3 and 5 year yields became less pronounced as the 12 month yield stood still as those around it rose the greater concern lies with a possible inversion of the 2 year yield vs the 10 year yield or even the 3 month yield vs the 10 year yield it has not occurred in this cycle to date and we have moved slightly away from the possibility with the 2y10y curve steepening back to almost 20 basis points vs 10 bps at year end the longer portion of the curve 10y30 has not been this steep 35 bps since the end of 2017 in chairman powell s recent testimony before congress he reiterated his newly dovish message of a patient fed willing to hold off on further rate increases in the near term noting muted inflation pressures and the possibility of slack remaining in the labor market he also noted that the fomc expects somewhat slower growth in 2019 and that the committee now favors ending the balance sheet runoff or what the president refers to as the 50 b s later this year the market is no longer expecting a rate increase in 2019 in not unrelated news the risk on trade in fixed income that began in january has continued to run with high yield and bank loans returning coupon plus price appreciation the yield spread over treasuries offered by high yield bonds continued to contract significantly in february while the tightening in investment grade spreads followed suit but at a clearly slower rate the returns on non investment grade bonds have handily outperformed investment grade bonds which have outperformed treasury and government agency aaa rated bonds with the recent weakening of global economic numbers it can be argued that the risk on trade in non investment grade debt may be getting a bit ahead of itself the municipal bond market continues to perform well issuance has remained constrained and continues to support pricing strong demand for municipal bonds maturing in less than five years has made it difficult to find attractive yields in this range and may push some accounts to hold taxable credit in this area maturities beyond five years still offer significant value for those in high federal income tax brackets and high tax states alternative investments investing alternative investments joined global equities and mostly rallied in february federal reserve chairman jerome powell noted that the fed would be more patient with future increases and said that the federal open market committee fomc sees inflationary pressures remaining muted with thursday s announcement that the u s economy grew at a 2 6 annualized rate in q4 a slowdown from q2 s 4 2 and q3 s 3 4 rate it should be noted that the fed sees growth slowing further over the next three years specifically economic growth is estimated to be 2 3 this year followed by 2 0 in 2020 and 1 8 in 2021 if there s a bright spot increased spending in intellectual property grew at a 13 1 annualized rate in q4 a positive for potential productivity gains it should be noted that long term sustainable gdp growth is largely a function of two components labor force growth and productivity gains we ve started to see signs of the labor force growing but have lacked a sharp uptick in productivity ultimately these factors should impact inflation and interest rates which contribute heavily to performance of alternative investments west texas intermediate wti crude oil gained 6 4 during the month to close just over 57 barrel a four month high wti s gains helped buoy the bloomberg commodities index which rose 0 8 on the month commodities as a whole have come under pressure over the past year with the index falling 7 7 on slowing global growth muted inflation and a strong u s dollar speaking of the dollar the dxy index rose 0 6 on the month and is up 6 1 over the past year the dollar s rise has pressured gold which lost 0 6 on the month to close at 1 313 oz and is largely flat over the past year equity market volatility and rising geopolitical risks have given gold a bid helping offset the strength in the dollar looking ahead gold remains a viable portfolio hedge and a breakout above 1 350 oz would likely garner further investor interest hedge funds posted mixed results in february with 6 of 10 strategies posting positive returns however all trailed the broader s p 500 index the top performing strategy was equity hedge l s which gained 1 31 while the worst performing strategy was equity

these synergies tervita s q4 2018 results were impacted by a decrease in energy services divisional ebitda margin from 58 in q4 2017 to 44 in q4 2018 due to the following while volumes at our

lower margins than our treatment recovery disposal trd services corporate level ebitda margins are anticipated to rise as a result of the newalta transaction as executed synergies more than offset the

recycling yards outlook with 63 of tervita s 2018 energy services revenue excluding energy marketing coming from anticipated stable oil and gas production related activities we believe that tervita s energy services business remains resilient even during the current challenging environment while reduced drilling activity is expected to result in partially lower drilling and completions related revenues particularly in the first half of 2019 we remain focused on what is under our control we believe that the contribution from a full year of results from the acquired newalta operations the continued successful execution of newalta integration synergies additional contributions from growth capital spending and steady improvements from our industrial services businesses will result in continued sustained growth in tervita s adjusted ebitda in 2019 vs 2018 following the early 2019 recovery of wti to us 50 55 per barrel and the return of canadian oil price differentials to fundamental ranges we anticipate relatively stable oil and gas prices in 2019 per barrel and the return of canadian oil price differentials to fundamental ranges we anticipate relatively stable oil and gas prices in 2019 while egress challenges persist western canadian oil and gas production is anticipated to remain at levels matching takeaway capacity in 2019 we anticipate the continued increase in crude by rail capacity will likely be sufficient to support higher industry drilling activity in the second half of the year assuming a stable price environment we continue to expect to find opportunities to attract and optimize crude oil volumes throughout our expansive network of facilities while continuing to assist our customers to maximize the price they receive for their products in this challenging environment this includes the internalization of oil marketing activities at the newly added newalta facilities these volumes were marketed by a third party until december 31 2018 for industrial services we expect moderate market growth in line with gdp growth across western canada our metals recycling business is expected to continue to grow with the investment in additional rail cars to increase our capacity to ship metal to end markets business lines with higher exposure to energy activity will fluctuate with those activity levels and capital spending of our customers although environmental project opportunities increased in 2018 the average revenue available on those projects decreased compared to prior years particularly in alberta and we do not anticipate this will change into 2019 since the close of the newalta acquisition we have identified several field based service lines that are common in a variety of geographies during 2019 we intend to reorganize these field services and rationalize service offerings across a single field organization overall while revenue from these various service lines is expected to fall we anticipate lower costs will more than compensate for this decrease in revenue resulting in higher overall contributions to industrial services divisional ebitda in 2019 and we do not anticipate this will change into

services and rationalize service offerings across a single field organization overall while revenue from these various service lines is expected to fall we anticipate lower costs will more than compensate for this decrease in revenue resulting in higher overall contributions to industrial services divisional ebitda in 2019 we continue to expect that the integration of newalta will realize annualized synergies of 40 45 million of adjusted ebitda due to identified repairs and maintenance required at certain facilities we have increased the estimated one time costs from 20 million to 21 23 million of which the remaining 3 5 million will be spent in 2019 of adjusted ebitda due to identified repairs and maintenance required at certain facilities we have increased the estimated one time costs from to of which the remaining will be spent in 2019 in 2019 we expect to realize 35 40 million of synergies and to have almost fully realized the 40 45 million in annualized synergies effective

momentum in the canadian commercial market and contributions from acquisitions adjusted ebitda as a percentage of sales in the quarter reflected seasonal patterns and was consistent with 2017 agi brazil posted a loss for the quarter despite an increase in sales largely due to a significant warranty provision related to damaged steel and expenses incurred in delivery and assembly as we improve our distribution model in brazil in the quarter net profit was negatively impacted by a non cash foreign exchange loss on u s dollar denominated debt and a non cash loss on the company s equity compensation swap however adjusted profit and profit per share increased significantly compared to the prior year a strong fourth quarter closed off a record year for agi in 2018 said tim close president and ceo of agi we made significant progress against our 5 6 7 strategy throughout 2018 resulting in organic sales growth of 12 8 we kicked off 2019 with three acquisitions as agi added significantly to its food platform and made two transformational additions one to its technology platform and more recently to establish a solid platform in india moving into 2019 a prolonged winter has impacted projects and deliveries pushing some sales into the second quarter however we expect continued organic growth in 2019 augmented with significant contributions from acquisitions trade sales and adjusted ebitda for the year ended december 31 2018 were at record levels significantly exceeding 2017 results farm sales increased over 2017 as higher sales in the u s and contributions from acquisitions more than offset an expected decrease in canada from record 2017 levels continued momentum in the canadian grain and fertilizer platforms along with robust international demand

in the 2017 figures in the above table and elsewhere in this press release outlook successive large crops in the united states and market expectations for another large planting in 2019 coupled with recent underinvestment in grain storage has resulted in an on farm storage deficit in the u s accordingly although farmer economics in the u s remain challenged agi anticipates strong demand for grain storage systems in 2019 in addition sales of portable grain handling equipment are expected to benefit from high crop volumes and the replacement nature of the product in canada farm economics remain positive and management anticipates strong demand in 2019 in both the u s and canada a challenging winter and what appears to be a late spring are expected to dampen sales in q1 2019 however anticipated growth rates are expected to return upon commencement of the new crop season in q2 2019 based on current conditions management anticipates that total farm sales and adjusted ebitda in 2019 will exceed 2018 results agi s commercial backlog in canada remain very strong due to continued investment in canadian commercial grain handling and fertilizer infrastructure and accordingly management anticipates robust sales in 2019 in the united states commercial activity is expected to remain stable compared to 2018 agi s international sales backlog is significantly higher than the prior year and momentum is expected to continue throughout 2019 due to strong levels of quoting activity in most regions including emea and latin america accordingly commercial backlogs in canada and offshore remain significantly higher than the prior year commercial sales are expected to be weighted towards the second half of 2019 due to challenging winter conditions in north america and customer construction schedules overall management anticipates sales and adjusted ebitda related to commercial equipment in 2019 will exceed strong 2018 results agi brazil entered 2019 with a record sales order backlog that includes a strong farm component as well as substantial south american commercial projects new order intake has accelerated over recent quarters and momentum is expected to continue in 2019 in addition margins are expected to improve in 2019 and over the longer term as agi continues to apply lean practices on all aspects of the organization including manufacturing logistics and customer service accordingly management anticipates adjusted ebitda in brazil in 2019 will be higher than the prior year and further improvements are expected over the long term however quarterly results may vary as agi brazil navigates the complexities of being a start up company with ambitions of rapid growth in brazil in summary management anticipates 2019 sales and adjusted ebitda will increase significantly compared to the prior year the anticipated growth compared to 2018 is expected to be weighted towards the second half of 2019 due to difficult winter conditions in north america and customer construction schedules overall positive farm demand drivers in north america are expected to drive sales growth in grain storage systems and portable handling equipment and commercial sales are anticipated to be very strong in canada and internationally based on existing backlogs quoting activity and positive demand drivers management expects record results in 2019 and looks forward with excitement to the upcoming fiscal year on march 11 2019 agi announced that it had entered into binding purchase agreements to acquire 100 of the outstanding shares of milltec machinery limited milltec for 109 5 million plus the potential for up to an additional 38 4 million based on the achievement of financial targets the transaction will be funded by agi s revolving credit facility for the twelve months ended january 31 2019 milltec s sales and ebitda were 56 2 million and 10 1 million respectively milltec s sales reflect agricultural seasonality in india and historically approximately 70 of their sales have occurred in the first and fourth calendar quarters trade sales and adjusted ebitda in 2019 will be influenced by among other factors weather patterns crop conditions the timing of harvest and conditions during harvest and changes in input prices including steel the company endeavors to mitigate its exposure to higher input costs through strategic procurement of steel sales price increases and limiting the length of time commercial quotes remain valid however the pace and volatility of input price increases may negatively impact financial results other factors that may impact results in 2019 include the impact of existing and potential future trade actions the ability of our customers to access capital the rate of exchange between the canadian and u s dollars changes in global macroeconomic factors as well as sociopolitical factors in certain local or regional markets and the timing of commercial customer commitments and deliveries

otherwise stated oyu tolgoi delivered strong operational results in 2018 said ulf quellmann turquoise hill s chief executive officer for the year oyu tolgoi achieved an industry leading safety performance and benefitted from processing higher gold grade ore which resulted in us exceeding copper and gold production guidance increased gold production along with higher average copper prices for the year led to a more than 25 increase in revenue and more than 11 increase in operating cash flow over 2017 underground development continued to progress during 2018 with more than 10 equivalent kilometres completed by year end as can occur in a project of this size and complexity mine manager rio tinto has identified challenges with the location of some ore passes on the footprint we acknowledge rio tinto s proactive approach to maintaining the highest level of infrastructure stability by reviewing the location of these ore passes the impact of these changes will be reflected in the definitive estimate review which is expected to be complete towards the end of the year oyu tolgoi is a world class asset with a best in class workforce turquoise hill is a tremendous opportunity to invest in a copper and gold producer with a direct participation in the world s next tier 1 copper asset highlights full year 2018 oyu tolgoi achieved an industry leading all injury frequency rate of 0 16 per 200 000 hours worked for the year ended december 31 2018 on december 31 2018 oyu tolgoi and the government of mongolia signed the power sector framework agreement providing a pathway forward for a tavan tolgoi based power plant copper production of 159 100 tonnes for 2018 increased 1 1 over 2017 and exceeded guidance by 2 6 gold production of 285 000 ounces in 2018 increased 150 0 over 2017 and exceeded guidance by 1 8 mill throughput for 2018 decreased 5 9 over 2017 due to increased processing of harder phase 4 ore throughout the year revenue of 1 2 billion in 2018 increased 25 6 over 2017 due to the significant increase in gold sales a 5 0 increase in copper sales volumes and the impact of higher average copper prices for 2018 income of 394 3 million increased 255 4 over 2017 reflecting the significant increase in gold revenue and reduced unit costs of production driven by higher head grades and recoveries for 2018 oyu tolgoi s cost of sales was 2 25 per pound of copper sold 2 32 2017 c1 cash costs of 1 59 per pound of copper produced 1 92 2017 and all in sustaining costs of 2 20 per pound of copper produced 2 39 2017 1 for 2018 mining costs 1 per tonne were 2

were 3 03 2 93 2017 total operating cash costs 1 of 817 1 million for 2018 increased 14 8 over 2017 due to higher freight and royalty costs a reduction in costs capitalized as deferred stripping as well as higher fuel and power costs of 817 1 million for 2018 increased 14 8 over 2017 due to higher freight and royalty costs a reduction in costs capitalized as deferred stripping as well as higher fuel and power costs during 2018 underground lateral development advanced 10 3 equivalent kilometres a 68 9 increase over 2017 underground expansion capital for 2018 was 1 2 billion meeting the upper end of the company s guidance during 2018 oyu tolgoi completed the sinking and commissioning of shaft 5 fourth quarter 2018 copper production of 41 500 tonnes during q4 18 decreased 8 4 over q4 17 due to lower throughput which was partially offset by higher grades and recovery gold production of 117 000 ounces during q4 18 increased 234 3 over q4 17 due to significant increases in both grades and recovery as planned mill throughput in q4 18 decreased 13 6 over q4 17 due to increased processing of harder phase 4 ore revenue of 346 2 million in q4 18 increased 37 5 over q4 17 due to higher gold revenue driven by a significant increase in volumes of gold in concentrate sales for q4 18 oyu tolgoi s cost of sales was 2 12 per pound of copper sold 2 32 q4 17 c1 cash costs of 1 24 per pound of copper produced 2 05 q4 17 and all in sustaining costs of 2 01 per pound of copper produced 2 40 q4 17 1 for q4 18 mining costs 1 per tonne were 2 28 1 72 q4 17 milling costs 1 per tonne were 6 82 5

costs 1 of 242 3 million in q4 18 increased 11 3 over q4 17 mainly due to higher freight and royalty costs associated with higher sales revenue of 242 3 million in q4 18 increased 11 3 over q4 17 mainly due to higher freight and royalty costs associated with higher sales revenue during q4 18 underground lateral development progressed 2 3 equivalent kilometres subsequent events the company has completed an independent review of rio tinto s second annual schedule and cost re forecast since completion of the company s independent review rio tinto as project manager has advised turquoise hill that delays on the shaft 2 fit out are expected to result in an overall schedule delay to sustainable first production beyond the end of q3 21 additionally rio tinto is studying relocating the ore passes on the footprint and this may modify the initiation sequence within panel 0 the study will be incorporated into the definitive estimate 1 please refer to the non gaap measures section of this press release for further information financial results income in 2018 was 394 3 million compared with 110 9 million in 2017 the increase mainly reflects the 240 2 million increase in revenue driven primarily by the 150 0 increase in gold production in addition there were reduced unit costs of production driven by higher head grades and recoveries as oyu tolgoi benefitted from the processing of phase 4 ore that contained higher gold content further there was reduced depreciation and depletion due to certain long lived assets reaching the end of their depreciable lives and lower finance costs due to higher amounts capitalized to property plant and equipment cash generated from operating activities in 2018 was 180 0 million compared to 118 0 million in 2017 primarily reflecting the impact of higher sales revenue capital expenditure on property plant and equipment was 1 3 billion on a cash basis in 2018 compared with 917 5 million in 2017 attributed principally to underground development 1 2 billion with the remainder related to open pit activities turquoise hill s cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2018 were 1 6 billion oyu tolgoi the oyu tolgoi mine is approximately 550 kilometres south of ulaanbaatar mongolia s capital city and 80 kilometres north of the mongolia china border mineralization on the property consists of porphyry style copper gold silver and molybdenum contained in a linear structural trend the oyu tolgoi trend of deposits throughout this trend they include from south to north the heruga deposit the oyut deposit and the hugo dummett deposits hugo south hugo north and hugo north extension the oyu tolgoi mine was initially developed as an open pit operation the copper concentrator plant with related facilities and necessary infrastructure was originally designed to process approximately 100 000 tonnes of ore per day from the oyut open pit however since 2014 the concentrator has improved operating practices and gained experience which has helped achieve a consistent throughput of over 105 000 tonnes per day concentrator throughput for 2019 is targeted at 110 000 tonnes per day and expected to be approximately 40 million tonnes for the year in august 2013 development of the underground mine was suspended pending resolution of matters with the government of mongolia government following signing of the oyu tolgoi underground mine development and financing plan underground plan in may 2015 and the signing of a 4 4 billion project finance facility in december 2015 oyu tolgoi received formal notice to proceed approval by the boards of turquoise hill rio tinto and oyu tolgoi llc in may 2016 which was the final requirement for the re start of underground development underground construction recommenced in may 2016 prior to suspending underground construction in august 2013 underground lateral development at hugo north lift 1 had advanced approximately 16 kilometres off shaft 1 at the end of 2018 oyu tolgoi had a total workforce employees and contractors including underground project construction of approximately 17 000 of which 92 6 were mongolian underground development progress significant progress on the oyu tolgoi underground project continued through 2018 with the construction of critical above and below ground infrastructure shaft 2 connected underground infrastructure progressed well during q4 18 with the completion of the lining installation and handover of ore bin 11 as well as advancement of the new 6 000 tonne per day jaw crusher under construction during q4 18 turquoise hill carried out its own review of the previously announced rio tinto schedule and cost re forecast for the project 2018 rio tinto review that concluded a delay to sustainable first production was expected from q1 21 to the end of q3 21 the company s review with the assistance of turquoise hill s independent qualified person and mining consultants orewin pty ltd found that project cost was expected to remain within the 5 3 billion budget but that it is likely there will be further delays to individual activities and that this will result in additional delays to sustainable first production the company s independent review found that the following key risks are developing shaft 2 equipping delays were due to lower than expected productivity in steel and electrical installation as well as increased quality assurance measures it was likely the completion date would move beyond q1 19 and impact overall underground development rate increases there have been delays to development progress and productivities in key areas even though lateral development has experienced consistent overall progress development of some critical areas such as the footprint primary crusher 1 pc1 system shaft 2 and shaft 5 have been impacted by delays and with the exception of shaft 5 are critical path items for the project schedule small delays in lateral development on the footprint have had a direct impact on the project schedule critical path even though total lateral development or equivalent development metres have been on budget development in the pc1 system which includes the pc1 chamber and transfers 3 4 and 5 has since the time of the rio tinto review data cut off fallen significantly behind target rates the company review indicated that in some areas there was a delay to the critical path from scope growth in mass excavation and additional ground support due to unexpectedly adverse geotechnical conditions although the ground support quantities and installation times are less but not materially less than planned in the 2016 oyu tolgoi feasibility study and ground support quantities are reported as lower than planned some types of ground support have had reduced installation times since completion of the company s independent review rio tinto as manager of the project has advised turquoise hill that further delays on the shaft 2 fit out are expected to contribute to an overall schedule delay to sustainable first production beyond the end of q3 21 additionally rio tinto is studying relocating the ore passes on the footprint and this may modify the initiation sequence within panel 0 the study will be incorporated into the definitive estimate review as will work necessary to estimate any impact of cost and development schedule oyu tolgoi spent 347 3 million on underground expansion during q4 18 and 1 2 billion for 2018 meeting the company s guidance total underground project spend from january 1 2016 to december 31 2018 was approximately 2 3 billion underground project spend on a cash basis includes expansion capital vat and capitalized management services payment and excludes capitalized interest in addition oyu tolgoi had further capital commitments2 of 1 2 billion as of december 31 2018 at the end of q4 18 the underground project had committed almost 87 of direct project contracts and procurement packages of which 73 were to mongolian companies since the restart of project development oyu tolgoi has committed nearly 2 3 billion to mongolian vendors and contractors the main focus of 2018 was underground development the fit out of shaft 2 completion and commissioning of shaft 5 support infrastructure and the convey to surface decline shaft 2 completed sinking in january 2018 which was followed by the completion of stripping in q3 18 and commencement of the fit out process in the same quarter the completed commissioning of shaft 5 was achieved during q2 18 during 2018 underground development advanced 10 3 equivalent kilometres a 68 9 increase over 2017 due to the commissioning of the new 3 500 tonne per day crusher in the second half of 2017 and increased development capability with increased ventilation following the completion of shaft 5 despite the strong year over year progress during q4 18 underground development achieved a lower than expected 2 3 equivalent kilometres of development against a target of 3 0 equivalent kilometres the shortfall in q4 18 led to 10 3 equivalent kilometres for 2018 against the expected target of approximately 11 0 kilometers of equivalent development the underground development challenges experienced in q4 18 included time constraints during hoist rope maintenance and the introduction of a new underground traffic management plan lateral development progressed 7 9 kilometres during 2018 and was impacted by the same challenges but also a shift in priorities of resources from lateral development to mass excavation due to the latest rio tinto advice turquoise hill s previous guidance of lateral development advancement of 15 0 to 16 0 kilometres during 2019 is under review the following table provides a breakdown of the

and non underground development activities 3 please refer to the non gaap measures section of this press release for further information full year 2018 revenue of 1 180 0 million in 2018 increased 25 6 compared to 939 8 million in 2017 partly due to the significant increase in gold revenue from 130 8 million in 2017 to 300 4 million in 2018 driven by the 150 0 increase in gold production as oyu tolgoi benefitted from the processing of phase 4 ore that contained higher gold content the remaining increase in revenue was driven by an increase in copper revenue due to a 5 0 increase in volumes of copper in concentrate sales and a 5 9 increase in average copper price from 2017 to 2018 cost of sales in 2018 was 777 2 million compared to 763 8 million in 2017 reflecting a 3 1 increase in the volumes of concentrates sold supported by reduced unit cost of production due to higher head grades and recoveries capital expenditure on a cash basis for 2018 was 1 304 3 million compared to 917 5 million in 2017 comprising amounts attributed to the underground project and open pit activities of 1 213 8 million and 90 5 million respectively open pit capital expenditure includes deferred stripping of 17 3 million and tailings storage facility spending of 20 3 million total operating cash costs3 at oyu tolgoi were 817 1 million in 2018 compared to 711 6 million in 2017 the increase was primarily due to higher freight and royalty costs associated with increased sales revenue and a reduction in the amount of costs capitalized as deferred stripping resulting from a decrease in the proportion of waste removed as mining resources prioritized movement of ore during the year other contributors include higher input prices for key items such as fuel and power cost of sales were 2 25 per pound of copper sold in 2018 compared with 2 32 per pound of copper sold in 2017 reflecting higher volumes of metals in concentrate sold and reduced unit cost of production due to higher head grades and recoveries oyu tolgoi s c1 cash costs3 in 2018 were 1 59 per pound of copper produced a decrease from 1 92 per pound of copper produced in 2017 and are presented net of revenues from gold and silver sales the decrease was mainly due to higher gold sales and reduced unit costs of production driven by higher head grades and recoveries as oyu tolgoi benefitted from the processing of phase 4 ore that contained higher gold content all in sustaining costs3 in 2018 were 2 20 per pound of copper produced compared with 2 39 per pound of copper produced in 2017 the decrease was mainly due to the impact of higher gold sales and higher head grades and recoveries mining costs3 in 2018 were 2 13 per tonne of material mined compared with 1 51 per tonne of material mined in 2017 the increase was mainly due to higher maintenance costs increased fuel costs and increased cycle time as the open pit deepens milling costs3 in 2018 were 7 11 per tonne of ore treated compared with 6 36 per tonne of ore treated in 2017 the increase was mainly due to higher raw material costs such as steel and increased energy costs required to process the harder phase 4 ore g a costs in 2018 were 3 03 per tonne of ore treated compared with 2 93 per tonne of ore treated in 2017 the increase was due to higher power study costs during 2018 3 please refer to the non gaap measures section of this press release for further information fourth quarter 2018 revenue of 346 2 million in q4 18 increased 37 5 compared to 251 7 million in q4 17 primarily due to the significant increase in gold revenue from 32 5 million in q4 17 to 132 7 million in q4 18 driven by the 234 3 increase in gold production due to significant increases in both grades and recovery this was partly offset by a decrease in copper revenue driven by lower average copper prices in q4 18 compared to q4 17 cost of sales for q4 18 was marginally higher at 187 7 million compared to 182 7 million in q4 17 the increase was due to the 9

tonnes and gold production of 285 000 ounces increased 1 1 and 150 0 respectively over 2017 during 2018 oyu tolgoi benefitted from the processing of phase 4 ore that contained higher gold grades fourth quarter 2018 gold production in q4 18 increased 234 3 over q4 17 due to significant increases in both grades and recovery copper production in q4 18 declined 8 4 over q4 17 due to lower throughput which was partially offset by higher grades and recovery as planned mill throughput in q4 18 decreased 13 6 over q4 17 due to the concentrator processing harder phase 4 ore compared to the processing of predominately softer phase 6 ore in q4 17 operational outlook oyu tolgoi is expected to produce 125 000 to 155 000 tonnes of copper and 180 000 to 220 000 ounces of gold in concentrates

expanding its 66 owned oyu tolgoi mining operation in mongolia from an open pit into one of the world s largest new copper gold underground producers oyu tolgoi which commenced production in 2013 has the potential to operate for approximately 100 years cautionary statement the potential to operate for approximately 100 years is based on a preliminary economic assessment alternative production case that is preliminary in nature and that includes inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves there is no certainty that the alternative production case will be realized mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability for more information about the alternative production case readers are referred to the 2016 oyu tolgoi technical report forward looking statements certain statements made herein including

outcomes or statements regarding an outlook these include but are not limited to information regarding the timing and amount of production and potential production delays statements in respect of the impacts of any delays on the company s cash flows liquidity funding requirements and planning statements regarding timing and status of underground development timing and status of the tavan tolgoi based power project capital and operating cost estimates mill throughput anticipated business activities planned expenditures corporate strategies and other statements that are not historical facts forward looking statements and information are made based upon certain assumptions and other important factors that if untrue could cause the actual results performance or achievements of the company to be materially different from future results performance or achievements expressed or implied by such statements or information there can be no assurance that such statements or information will prove to be accurate such statements and information are based on numerous assumptions regarding present and future business strategies local and global economic conditions and the environment in which the company will operate in the future including the price of copper gold and silver and projected gold copper and silver grades anticipated capital and operating costs anticipated future production and cash flows and the status of the company s relationship and interaction with the government of mongolia on the continued operation and development of oyu tolgoi and oyu tolgoi llc internal governance certain important factors that could cause actual results performance or achievements to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements and information include among others copper gold and silver price volatility discrepancies between actual and estimated production mineral reserves and resources and metallurgical recoveries development plans for processing resources matters relating to proposed exploration or expansion mining operational and development risks including geotechnical risks and ground conditions litigation risks regulatory restrictions including environmental regulatory restrictions and liability oyu tolgoi llc s ability to deliver a domestic power source for the oyu tolgoi project within the required contractual time frame communications with local stakeholders and community relations activities actions or assessments including tax assessments by governmental authorities events or circumstances including strikes blockages or similar events outside of the company s control that may affect the company s ability to deliver its products in a timely manner currency fluctuations the speculative nature of mineral exploration the global economic climate dilution share price volatility competition loss of key employees cyber security incidents additional funding requirements including in respect of the development or construction of a long term domestic power supply for the oyu tolgoi project capital and operating costs including with respect to the development of additional deposits and processing facilities and defective title to mineral claims or property although the company has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual actions events or results to differ materially from those described in forward looking statements and information there may be other factors that cause actions events or results not to be as anticipated estimated or intended all such forward looking statements and information are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by the company s management in light of their experience and perception of historical trends current conditions and expected future developments as well as other factors management believes are appropriate in the circumstances these statements however are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements or information with respect to specific forward looking information concerning the continued operation and development of oyu tolgoi the company has based its assumptions and analyses on certain factors which are inherently uncertain uncertainties and assumptions include among others the timing and cost of the construction and expansion of mining and processing facilities the timing and availability of a long term domestic power source or the availability of financing for the company to construct such a source for oyu tolgoi the ability to secure and draw down on the supplemental debt under the oyu tolgoi project financing facility and the availability of additional financing on terms reasonably acceptable to oyu tolgoi llc rio tinto and the company to further develop oyu tolgoi the impact of changes in changes in interpretation to or changes in enforcement of laws regulations and government practices in mongolia the availability and cost of skilled labour and transportation the obtaining of and the terms and timing of obtaining necessary environmental and other government approvals consents and permits delays and the costs which would result from delays in the development of the underground mine which could significantly exceed the costs projected in the 2016 oyu tolgoi feasibility study and the 2016 oyu tolgoi technical report projected copper gold and silver prices and their market demand and production estimates and the anticipated yearly production of copper gold and silver at oyu tolgoi the cost timing and complexities of mine construction and development are increased by the remote location of a property such as oyu tolgoi it is common in mining operations and in the development or expansion of existing facilities to experience unexpected problems and delays during development construction and mine start up additionally although oyu tolgoi has achieved commercial production there is no assurance that future development activities will result in profitable mining operations the december 31 2018 md a the md a also contains references to estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources the estimation of reserves and resources is inherently uncertain and involves subjective judgments about many relevant factors the mineral resource estimates contained in the md a are inclusive of mineral reserves further mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability the accuracy of any such estimates is a function of the quantity and quality of available data and of the assumptions made and judgments used in engineering and geological interpretation including future production from oyu tolgoi the anticipated tonnages and grades that will be achieved or the indicated level of recovery that will be realized which may prove to be unreliable there can be no assurance that these estimates will be accurate or that such mineral reserves and mineral resources can be mined or processed profitably see the discussion under the headings language regarding reserves and resources and note to united states investors concerning estimates of measured indicated and inferred resources in section 20 cautionary statements of the md a such estimates are in large part based on the following interpretations of geological data obtained from drill holes and other sampling techniques large scale mineral continuity and character of the deposits can be improved with additional drilling and sampling actual mineralization or formations may be different from those predicted it may also take many years from the initial phase of drilling before production is possible and during that time the economic feasibility of exploiting a deposit may change reserve and resource estimates are materially dependent on prevailing metal prices and the cost of recovering and processing minerals at the individual mine sites market fluctuations in the price of metals or increases in the costs to recover metals or the actual recovery percentage of the metal s from the company s mining projects may render mining of ore reserves uneconomic and affect the company s operations in a materially adverse manner moreover various short term operating factors may cause a mining operation to be unprofitable in any particular accounting period assumptions relating to commodity prices and exchange rates during the expected life of production mineralization of the area to be mined the projected cost of mining and the results of additional planned development work actual future production rates and amounts revenues taxes operating expenses environmental and regulatory compliance expenditures development expenditures and recovery rates may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates any significant change in these assumptions including changes that result from variances between projected and actual results could result in material downward revision to current estimates assumptions relating to projected future metal prices the company uses prices reflecting market pricing projections in the financial modeling for oyu tolgoi which are subjective in nature it should be expected that actual prices will be different than the prices used for such modeling either higher or lower and the differences could be significant and assumptions relating to the costs and availability of treatment and refining services for the metals mined from oyu tolgoi which require arrangements with third parties and involve the potential for fluctuating costs to transport the metals and fluctuating costs and availability of refining services these costs can be significantly impacted by a variety of industry specific as well as regional and global economic factors including among others those which affect commodity prices many of these factors are beyond the company s control readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking information or statements by their nature forward looking statements involve numerous assumptions inherent risks and uncertainties both general and specific which contribute to the possibility that the predicted outcomes will not occur events or circumstances could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those estimated or projected and expressed in or implied by these forward looking statements important factors that could cause actual results to differ from these forward looking statements are included in the risks and uncertainties section in the md a readers are further cautioned that the list of factors enumerated in the risks and uncertainties section of the md a that may affect future results is not exhaustive when relying on the company s forward looking statements and information to make decisions with respect to the company investors and others should carefully consider the foregoing factors and other uncertainties and potential events furthermore the forward looking statements and information contained in the md a are made as of the date of this

stabilized its core production base in 2018 as the company began enhancing the portfolio to deliver growth as planned we replaced over 100 of produced reserves in 2018 which was enabled by the completion of the quifa water handling expansion project as well as exploration successes at alligator and coralillo in the guatiquia block and jaspe in the quifa north area significant investment in colombia in 2018 has contributed to a strong start in 2019 particularly in the quifa sw field with new water handling facilities in operation in addition after last year s interruptions production from block 192 in peru has recently restarted as it returns to peak levels total company production is the strongest it has been in over a year with solid production and cash flow generation we are executing a number of initiatives to drive production and reserves growth including successfully being awarded two highly prospective blocks in an exploration bid round in ecuador and testing the deliverability of natural gas production from our z 1 block offshore peru we are also very excited by upcoming drilling on the vim 1 block in colombia and on the corentyne block offshore guyana later this year gabriel de alba chairman of the board of directors of the company commented thanks to substantial progress by the frontera team in 2018 the company is better positioned than ever to deliver returns to shareholders with improved capital allocation and a plan to sustain production and reserves from our existing production base at current levels for the next five years both of which we re already delivering on frontera can generate sufficient cash flow to drive growth initiatives in the upstream business as well as take steps to further enhance shareholder returns as oil prices permit continuing on our progress in reducing g a in 2018 we are pursuing additional opportunities to improve the efficiency and cost structure of the business especially in the field and to monetize non core assets these actions will generate additional cash flow and capital for growth and enhanced equity returns frontera is off to a positive start in 2019 production is strong brent oil prices are

the following financial terms that do not have standardized definitions in the international financial reporting standards ifrs operating ebitda operating netback and net sales these financial measures together with measures prepared in accordance with ifrs provide useful information to investors and shareholders as management uses them to evaluate the operating performance of the company the company s determination of these non ifrs measures may differ from other reporting issuers and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies further these non ifrs measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance or cash flows prepared in accordance with ifrs these financial measures are included because management uses this information to analyze operating performance and liquidity management believes that ebitda is a common measure used to assess profitability before the impact of different financing methods income taxes depreciation and impairment of capital assets and amortization of intangible assets ebitda is a commonly used measure that adjusts net income loss as reported under ifrs to exclude the effects of income tax expense net finance costs and depletion depreciation and amortization expense operating ebitda represents the operating results of the company s primary business excluding the items noted above including fees paid on suspended pipeline capacity other investments such as infrastructure assets certain non cash items such as impairments foreign exchange and unrealized risk management contracts and share based compensation and gains or losses arising form the disposal of capital assets in addition other unusual or non recurring items are excluded from

netback is a useful measure to assess the net profit after all the costs associated with bringing one barrel of oil to the market it is also commonly used by the oil and gas industry to analyze financial and operating performance expressed as profit per barrel operating netback represents realized price per barrel plus realized gain or loss on financial derivatives less production costs high price royalties and royalties paid in cash and transportation and diluent costs and shows how efficient the company is at extracting and selling its product refer to the operating netback section on page 9 of the md a net sales net sales is a non ifrs subtotal that adjusts revenue to include realized gains and losses from risk management contracts while removing the cost of dilution activities this is a useful indicator for management as the company hedges a portion of its oil production using derivative instruments to manage exposure to oil price volatility this metric allows the company to report its realized net sales after factoring in these risk management activities the exclusion of diluent cost is helpful to understand the company s sales performance based on the net realized proceeds from production net of dilution the cost of which is partially recovered when the blended product is sold net sales does not include the sales and purchases of oil and gas for trading as the gross margins from these activities are not considered significant or material to the company s operations refer to the reconciliation in the sales section on page 10 of the md a advisory note regarding oil and gas information the reserves information contained in this press release has been prepared in accordance with ni 51 101 complete reserves disclosure required in accordance with ni 51

estimated future net revenue from the production of the disclosed oil and natural gas reserves in this news release does not represent the fair market value of these reserves the estimates of reserves

on mar 13 the department of commerce released u s factory orders for long lasting durable goods in january although the increase was a modest one in terms of percentage what is more important is that the consensus estimate was for a contraction of factory orders moreover core durable goods order a key metric to track business investment plan jumped significantly against this backdrop it will be prudent to invest in stocks with a favorable zacks rank that are poised to gain from the solid factory orders data solid durable goods data in january the department of commerce reported that new orders for manufactured durable goods rose 0 9 billion or 0 4 to 255 3 billion in january from december this was the third straight month of growth for durable goods orders notably the consensus estimate for factory orders in january was for a decline of 0 4 more important information from the report is that the core durable goods order which exclude defense aircraft jumped 0 8 in january after witnessing a sharp fall in the previous two months this also reflects highest monthly gain of core factory orders since july 2018 in january leading performers were commercial aircraft networking gear transportation equipment and machinery segments implication of strong core durable goods data economists view the core durable goods order data as business investment plans by u s corporates a significant rise in this metric indicates that the u s manufacturing sector which constitutes around 12 of its gdp is pushing up capital spending driven by a massive tax overhaul

it is just february but the air was already sultry in kottakkal a small nondescript town in the heart of kerala s malabar region a modest non air conditioned conference hall on the first floor of a hotel was quickly filling up with people as the clock slipped towards 2 pm close to 300 people mostly men had crammed into the hall which could hardly accommodate half that number a short man dressed in a formal shirt and pants who identified himself as hamza anchumukkil standing on a small dais turned towards them and said sorry brothers for making you stand like that we had expected 50 100 people and had arranged chairs for them clearly the response has been overwhelming i know it s very hot today so please adjust advertisement the participants at the business seminar hosted by hamza anchumukkil in kottakkal kerala express photo by vishnu varma the participants at the business seminar hosted by hamza anchumukkil in kottakkal kerala express photo by vishnu varma the large crowd had gathered to attend a business seminar by anchumukkil who prides himself a motivational speaker and a successful self made businessman a few days earlier anchumukkil had announced through his much popular facebook page that he would be holding a free business seminar for all those who wanted to know the basics of running a business assessing its profits and strategies to promote it on social media a lot of expatriate malayalis who are returning from the gulf to set up businesses in kerala are failing so it s important to know the basics before starting an enterprise he had pointed out in his facebook post advertisement also read back from the gulf part 2 why kerala needs to find a new economic model fast that day anchumukkil himself was stunned by the turnout in kottakkal that an overwhelming section of the people who turned out that day to listen to him were pravasi expatriate malayalis was hardly a coincidence but more than anything it underscored in stark detail a problem that kerala has long feared to address the return of the pravasi gulf malayali and the tragedy that s waiting to take place in the absence of proper corrective steps advertisement kerala has a special relationship with the gulf countries that go back thousands of years as early as 3000 bc the region of present day kerala was an important spice trade centre dealing extensively with major ports across the arabian sea all the way to europe in the middle ages historical accounts have pointed to strong trade links between kingdoms in kerala and the arabs a relationship which manifested in strong cultural and social influence on the region the monopoly was broken only with the arrival of the portuguese on the shores of the state in the 15th century followed by the dutch and much later the british post independence the wave of migration from kerala began in the early 60s in the form of poor unskilled malayalis traversing the sea and braving great dangers in search of employment the earliest accounts talked of large groups of men boarding dhows a kind of traditional sailing vessel from the coasts of kerala to migrate to the gulf many perished in the sea as the risks were too high but it didn t dampen hopes of the others for the reward at the end of the journey was priceless the oil boom in the gulf in the 70s provided the perfect economic conditions for the average malayali to prosper who were only too eager to escape the poverty and joblessness back home in return the stream of cheap hard working malayali labour became the perfect ingredient for the gcc gulf cooperation council countries as they utilised the oil money to spend big on setting up industries and expanding infrastructure through the 80s and the 90s it became a pattern as streams of mostly young unskilled men made their way to the gulf later helping to translocate their families and friends as well advertisement by 2013 kerala had an estimated 2 4 million immigrants 85 per cent of whom were living and working in the gulf the united states of america the next best choice for malayalis was a far distant choice with just 3 per cent more importantly the money they sent home from the gulf became the foundation of kerala s economic growth in 2014 remittances touched 36 3 per cent of kerala s net domestic product and last year close to rs 85 000 crore swept into the state from abroad the sudden affluence also served to buttress any feeling of ill will and overall resentment in the state during the 70s and 80s when unemployment figures touched the roof in a state that lacked any serious industrial investment by previous regimes and notorious for its trade union culture and frequent shutdowns the remittances from abroad served as much needed capital to fund its infrastructure projects and welfare schemes on health and education last year the state s fourth international airport in kannur home to thousands of migrants opened doors to the public with a slew of gulf based airlines waiting in line to begin services advertisement kottakkal a small town in malappuram district of kerala exhibits a rich dose of gulf influence the streets here are lined with shops selling perfumes dates nuts all of which are imported from the gulf express photo by vishnu varma kottakkal a small town in malappuram district of kerala exhibits a rich dose of gulf influence the streets here are lined with shops selling perfumes dates nuts all of which are imported from the gulf express photo by vishnu varma entire districts such as malappuram where 71 per cent of households have either an emigrant or a return migrant prospered on gulf money with shiny shopping complexes and glitzy jewellery stores dotting small towns and villages a walk through towns like kottakkal tirur manjeri and ponnani takes you into a world of arab influence where you will find shops selling expensive perfume and ittar in exquisite glass cases with their names in arabic restaurants serving everything from al faham to shawarma and expansive chain stores selling imported dates plums and nuts all in all it has been a great run for the state and it s large diverse expatriate gulf malayali population until now a report published in september last year by the thiruvananthapuram based centre for development studies cds confirmed that emigration from kerala is indeed falling the number of return migrants is increasing every year and that the long history of migration from kerala to the gulf is in its last phase a reduction of 3 lakh emigrants has been observed in the period of 2013 18 which is one tenth of the total emigrants in 2013 advertisement the cds study eighth in a series of migration surveys that began in 1998 lists five key reasons for the fall in emigration one kerala reaching replacement level fertility as early as 1987 has ensured the reduction in population in migration prone age group second oil prices in the gulf have been on a decline since 2010 thereby affecting key sectors such as real estate and construction third naturalisation policies like nitaqat in saudi arabia and elsewhere ensured that native youths are employed in sectors once dominated by migrants fourth a fall in wage levels in the gulf particularly after the 2008 financial crisis de motivates people to migrate fifth wages have improved domestically with kerala providing the highest rate in the informal sector it is obvious that the long term future of the state of kerala is going to be less dependent on emigration and remittances with an unfavourable demographic dividend it is impossible for kerala to regain the dominance it had in migration to the gulf a vibrant domestic economy is the only solution to deal with the change in migratory patterns the cds study concluded s irudaya rajan co author of the study doesn t think the gulf dream is over for a malayali as opportunities still exist for educated skilled persons it s just that people from kerala are increasingly being forced to compete for low wages in the unorganised sector with migrants from other states of india advertisement gulf is not dead it is still surviving he said over the phone the gulf economy still needs a lot of unskilled workers it s just that the salary levels are much lower than what people were getting in 2008 because of the global crisis now for malayalis this is not an income for them to go there it s competitively better for people from states like uttar pradesh bihar and countries like nepal pakistan and bangladesh kv abdul khader a cpi m legislator from guruvayur and a key office bearer of an expatriate collective voiced the same fears his constituency in thrissur district of the state comprises of small clusters of coastal villages that continue to send people to the gulf in search of jobs advertisement our estimate is that most of them returning are still unskilled or semi skilled workers and traders they are people who may have been working as help in houses in saudi or oman driving cars managing textile shops or running stores selling cell phones once the nationalisation process kicked in they lost their jobs said khader over phone so a lot of the technically qualified and highly educated malayalis are still sticking to their jobs there similarly of the people now migrating most of them are skilled in some way khader admits that he cannot contemplate a situation when all of them would have to come back advertisement it s definitely one of the big challenges facing kerala today i frankly don t have an answer what we can do back in the stuffed conference hall in kottakkal anchumukkil in a conversational thick malappuram accent is laying it out for his audience about how he a return migrant from the gulf built a steady business from scratch in kerala his humble origins coupled with a certain burlesque humour makes him a crowd favourite i started a small shop just two doors away from this hotel renting out mobile phones in the late 90s for rich arabs who came here for ayurvedic treatment it was a time when everything was rented out cars phones bikes cameras anchumukkil said advertisement from renting anchumukkil says he moved on to mobile phone servicing and then later to training young people to repair cell phones today he heads britco bridco a company which offers courses on mobile phone repairing and has technicians dedicated to the same cause on its website the company claims to have 14 affiliated institutes in kerala alone one in delhi and four abroad the bottom line he affirms is the need to constantly innovate instead of copying each other s ideas and replicating them that s the problem with all of you he almost scolds them restaurants serving high end arabic cuisine are common in these parts of kerala express photo by vishnu varma restaurants serving high end arabic cuisine are common in these parts of kerala express photo by vishnu varma if one man starts a kuzhimanthi restaurant five others will start the same business on the same street today i can t walk the street without seeing a kuzhimanthi restaurant he says referring to the popular yemeni chicken rice dish among gastronomists in kerala advertisement i know many of you are more talented than me many of you have the potential to grow much higher he remarked to a round of applause among those who sat in the front row chairs for anchumukkil s seminar was 42 year old rajkumar who hailed from punalur in the western fringes of southern kerala he had seen the former s facebook post and had taken a train all the way from his hometown nearly 300 kilometres away to attend the event in the hope of taking home some valuable business strategies and ideas in 2009 rajkumar who left studies after the 12th grade had migrated to muscat the capital of oman via a friend in search of a job the financial crisis notwithstanding there were plenty of jobs for unskilled migrants at that point of time in oman and other gcc countries soon enough rajkumar landed a job at a computer service centre where his salary was fixed at 250 omani rial close to rs 46 000 my arab owner provided for my accommodation since the cost of living in muscat is not as high as dubai so savings are possible life was really tough but the good thing was i was able to send some money back home i would spend about 50 omr for my expenses and send the rest home every month he said for the next eight years rajkumar worked at the same establishment alongside three other malayalis servicing computers and other electronics the pay remained the same and even if he tried to change jobs he knew he couldn t expect a massive hike considering his educational level but things came to a head in early 2018 when his arab owner informed him that he would be laid off as a result of the omanisation policy through which the government aimed to replace migrant workers with native omanis to stem unemployment and domestic slump government authorities would carry out searches at shops and establishments to check whether the policy was being implemented licenses were slashed if the rules were found to be violated the situation was really tense there were frequent burglaries and shoplifting by the omanis themselves they had large families to take care of and unemployment was a big issue said rajkumar the shop owners had no choice they know that the natives would not work with as much dedication as we do but they had to follow the law i looked for other jobs but it was really difficult for foreigners he continued six months ago opting out of visa renewal he returned home with a heavy heart back in kerala rajkumar hasn t set his mind on what he wants to do in life having entered his 40s with a wife daughter and aged parents to take care of he can t afford to invest his savings in a business that would go kaput fortunately for him he doesn t have loans to repay or liabilities to take care of unlike many of his friends who have returned in recent weeks from countries like saudi arabia oman and kuwait around him he says restaurants and thattu kadas roadside eateries have bloomed and waned in equal measure almost all of them financed by return migrants marketing is good it s safe i think i will do that he said in mid march he plans to go on a business trip with anchumukkil and three dozen people to malaysia to get a first hand account of enterprise ideas and sourcing the southeast asian region for products that would sell like hot cakes in kerala malaysia is a hub for electronic products if we can find a market for them here in kerala i m sure they will work technology is changing everyday and kerala is after all a consumer state he quipped even as the gulf dream may be fading for thousands of malayalis people like rajkumar are proof that it doesn t deter them from exploring new frontiers to find work in part 2 tomorrow a look at the social and economic costs facing kerala with the return of migrants

opportunities that lie ahead i would like to start the call this morning by providing a high level overview of the fourth quarter and full year 2018 and then i ll turn the call over to adrian to provide specifics on our financial results as well as color on our outlook for 2019 2018 brought many exciting milestones for our business in addition to the ipo in february we had a number of key rfp wins extensions and expansions that will enhance our operations by over 50 000 square feet as these stores come online and nearly 5 increase of our current footprint we also recently surpassed the 1 000 store mark a key measure of the scale we have achieved across north america s travel hubs finally we made impressive strides in our food and beverage business growing this category to nearly 40 of our total sales this includes product mix within our convenience stores as well as stand alone food and beverage operations we are now positioned as a formidable competitor in this space and maybe unless to capture a larger share of spend among air travelers who are looking to fuel up before a flight starting with our top line we delivered full year organic sales growth of 7 in line with our expectations and long term framework fourth quarter organic sales growth which is a combination of like for like and net new business growth came in at 4 1 impacted by a continuation of the headwinds that we discussed on our third quarter earnings call namely the fx impacts and softer sales in our duty free and luxury business as the result of trends with chinese travelers while it s important to note that these trends have no impact on our core travel convenience business which comprises 76 of our sales they still influenced our overall like for like sales growth which increased 2 5 in constant currency during the quarter to help life ph drive sales in our duty free business in december we implemented a number of compelling offers including tier discount programs these programs drove increased foot traffic and passenger spend leading to positive gains in the final month of the quarter despite these programs we were still able to drive solid gross margin expansion of 180 basis points in q4 2018 meanwhile for the full year gross margin increased to 140 basis points driven by our ongoing vendor negotiations and sales mix shifts toward higher margin categories including food and beverage net new business the other component of our organic sales growth was up 3 3 for the year as discussed there is variability in this metric from period to period given the nature of our industry as it relates to the timing of new rfps and project construction in this respect the first half of the year was stronger than the second half as we had some larger projects coming online earlier in the year in terms of recent wins in the fourth quarter we were awarded four rfps under an eight year contract at salt lake city international airport which includes 13 travel convenience luxury and duty free stores and doubles our existing footprint in this location to over 12 000 square feet we also had a number of contract extensions during the quarter including dallas love field dallas fort worth and vancouver subsequent to year end we also announced a new 10 year contract win at indianapolis international airport which adds another nine stores and 9 000 square feet to our portfolio we also just announced a new contract win an extension of an existing contract at philadelphia international airport which will more than double our current footprint to over 17 000 square feet these wins and extensions exemplify hudson s strong industry reputation track record for creating retail packages and our ability to tailor programs to meet the needs of travelers with new contracts come new stores and during the fourth quarter we had a number of new notable store openings at laguardia we unveiled five stores that were part of an rfp won last year and the new reimagined terminal b included in this win was our first fao schwarz store a hudson one duty free store and mac we also partnered with local iconic new york independent bookseller mcnally jackson offering a bookstore with a true sense of place at boston logan where we previously won a new 10 year contract covering over 40 stores we completed four store openings during the fourth quarter including a hudson tumi tech on the go and ink by hudson we plan to complete another 23 new store openings in boston in 2019 as we ve discussed in the past airport directors are looking for operators who can not only create a custom portfolio of concepts that will be highly productive but also those that can deliver a local design and feel one of the ways we achieve this is by localizing our hudson stores in certain markets some examples of new stores we completed this quarter include our ingenuity store by hudson in san francisco and two island market stores at billy bishop in toronto as we look ahead hudson has a bright future overall travel retail has solid long term fundamental growth drivers including continued passenger growth ever expanding white space opportunities as airports continue to invest in infrastructure projects in fact the airports council international or aci just updated their forecasts and estimates that airports will need to invest nearly 130 billion through 2023 to modernize aging facilities and keep up with growing passenger volumes this bodes well for our line of business at hudson we have a solid foundation built upon our leading market share decades long experience in the travel retail industry and our positive track record and relationships with our landlords these strengths will allow us to continue on our trajectory and capitalize on the many opportunities that lie ahead the hudson group management team and i are committed to delivering value for all of our stakeholders including our investors my vision for hudson over the next several years is to establish further establish ourselves as a preeminent airport retailer at the same time we want to solidify our platform to support a thriving food and beverage service beyond qsr beyond specialty coffee locations that we currently operate expanding our food and beverage service capabilities will allow us to bid on larger food and beverage concession contracts with the full scope of offerings including full service sit on restaurants and bars we will look to achieve this through our organic growth and by continuing to evaluate ideal m a targets as a combined operator of both retail and food and beverage locations we can cast a wider net and pursuit a broader range of concession opportunities including smaller airports that may currently not meet our minimum return thresholds this is the natural evolution of our business we are excited about the numerous initiatives under way and we look forward to reporting on our progress in the upcoming quarters now i ll turn it over to adrian for more details on our financial results adrian bartella chief financial officer thank you roger we are pleased with our solid financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 which highlighted our continued ability to drive organic sales growth and net new business wins and strengthen our gross profit margin you can find details of our fourth quarter and full year performance in our press release so i will just provide some color in my comment i do want to point out that our bottom line results were impacted by recording of a non routine impairment charge of 10 4 million in the fourth quarter related to a location that had performed below our expectations this was a non core hotel location location outside of our airport business excluding this non routine impairment charge in the fourth quarter 2018 adjusted net profit would have been 14 9 million or 0 16 on adjusted eps base organic sales growth which is a combination of like for like sales and net new business was 4 1 during the fourth quarter compared to 6 5 in the third quarter of this year and 9 4 in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the full year organic growth was 7 compared to 8 8 in 2017 in terms of the two components of organic growth first like for like sales for the quarter like for like sales grew 1 6 or 2 5 in constant currency compared to 5 6 or 4 5 in constant currency last year q4 like for like sales growth was driven by robust duty paid and convenience growth which was partially offset by weaker duty free and luxury sale as a result of trends in chinese passenger demand for the full year like for like sales growth was 3 7 compared to 4 8 in 2017 the second component of organic growth is net new business the total contribution of net new business to organic growth was 2 5 in q4 and 3 3 in 2018 versus 4 in 2017 turning page to the income statement during the fourth quarter our gross margin improved 180 basis points to 64 3 and gross margin for the full year 2018 increased 140 basis points to 63 7 key drivers were improved vendor terms and continued sales mix shift to higher margin categories as we previously noted there was a change in the structure of some vendor allowances which benefited our gross profit margin starting in 2018 but retroactive to january 1st some of our vendors support now comes in the form of reduction in costs offset instead of advertising income turning to expenses within operational expenses we have selling expenses personnel expenses and general expenses for these line items the explanations for the trend in the fourth quarter are similar to that for the year for the fourth quarter selling expenses rose 2 6 to 108 6 million for the full year selling expenses increased 5 7 over the prior year to 445 million as you may know concession fees which compromise the majority of this line item are most variable expense driven by net sale despite an increase in selling expenses year over year for 2018 selling expenses as a percentage of turnover improved slightly totaling 23 1 as compared to 23 4 in 2017 regarding the fourth quarter 2018 personnel expenses rose 12 2 to 107 million personnel expenses increased 10 7 for the full year 2018 over 2017 to 411 million this increase in personnel expenses was driven primarily due to wage increases and new hires associated with the opening of new stores location and additional personnel expenses up on becoming a public company in addition as noted on our last earnings call q4 2018 saw the impact of our new long term incentive plan which contributed approximately 1 8 million to personnel expenses for the full year 2018 personnel expenses represent a 21 4 of turnover an increase of 80 basis points as compared to 2017 in fourth quarter 2018 the general and administrative expenses were down 11 6 to 34 2 million compared to last year general expenses decreased 16 3 to 131 4 million for the full year 2018 as a percentage of turnover general expenses decreased from 8 7 in 2017 to 6 8 in 2018 the key driver of the decrease was the lower franchise fees paid to dufry as you may remember from previous calls as of january 1 2018 we paid dufry an average about 1 of net sale in franchise fees which decreased from about 2 of net sales in the previous year turning to our balance sheet and cash flow as of december 31 2018 our net debt position was 310 million resulting in a net debt to ebitda leverage of 1 3 times a notable improvement of a net debt to ebitda leverage of 2 7 times in 2017 cash flow from operating activities for the year were 232 7 million compared to 130 8 million in 2017 the increasing cash flow was driven by improved operating performance and timing of franchise fees payments to dufry capital expenditure decreased to 69 3 million in 2018 from 87 8 million in the prior year as a result of timing of new projects lastly i would like to comment briefing our expectations for 2019 in the first half of the year we expect to see similar current headwinds like in q3 and q4 2018 due to the weakening of the canadian dollar versus the us dollar while our duty paid business is robust and growing we expect continuous softness in duty free and luxury business as a result of spending trend with chinese travelers in the second half of the year we anticipate that the currency headwinds and macroeconomic factors would dissipate as we anniverse ph their impact however we will face some contra exploration that will impact second half growth while new stores wins come online specifically we have few concessions that we will be rolling off in 2019 while unfortunate the loss of this contract is not a complete surprise expired few years ago but the timing of closures was not clear these operations would be closing down primarily in the second half of the year while it s always unfortunate to lose contract this business had its ups and downs and as we have said our extension rate is now at 80 our diverse portfolio of contacts and our ability to navigate these ebbs and flows has made us successful over the 10 years history there has been no change in our win rate and our ability to execute on extension and new business opportunities moving forward like those that roger already discussed given these factors we would like to provide some color around our expectations for 2019 while we have confidence in our long term framework and believe that our organic growth sales will ramp up over the long term as currency headwinds and pressure from chinese customers mitigate we expect organic sales growth for 2019 to be in the low to mid single digit range we expect our gross margin in 2019 to slightly improve and to be offset by some modest deleverage on the personnel expense line resulting in a flat ebitda margin in 2019 this excludes the impact of lease accounting changes which i will discuss in a second the effective tax rate is estimated to come in higher at about 40 for the year due to the non deductibility of certain compensation severance expenses and the increase in the beat tax rate from 5 in 2018 to 10 in 2019 consequently we expect our adjusted eps pre ifrs 16 changes to be relatively flat in 2019 finally i would also like to mention that as of january 1 2019 we have implemented ifrs 16 standard on lease accounting we have provided an overview in our 20 f i just want to highlight the key changes and this will bring under the new standard we are required to capitalize the fixed portion of our lease which amounts to roughly half of our total rent expense as a result we would bring about 1 billion on our balance sheet as fixed assets and debt there s also p l impact which is different than u s gaap filers ph in which our rent expenses reduce and we will now we will recognise interest and amortization on the capitalized leases the interest is front loaded during the life of the lease so we expect a negative impact to the bottom line when comprised with trade line rent expense we ll provide more details in our q1 result going forward we plan to break out the impact of the lease accounting on our results for use of comparison to be clear these accounting changes will not affect the fundamental strength of our business and we do not foresee this affecting our business decisions as we look to drive organic growth in summary we saw solid organic growth in both like for like and net new business during 2018 resulting in a healthy year of operating results the growth levers we have laid out in the past including our productivity and pricing initiatives the resilience of our business our distinct operating advantages and industry leading position and the temporary nature of some of the 2019 headwinds continue to give us confidence in our ability to achieve our long term three to five year framework we look forward to building on our progress in 2019 and now i will turn it back over to the operator to open it up for q a questions and answers operator we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions and our first question will come from seth sigman of credit suisse seth sigman credit suisse analyst thanks guys how are you all thanks for taking the question my first question is around the sales guidance so low to mid single digit organic sales growth in 2019 what s the assumption embedded here for the contribution for from new stores new business ads and if you could just sort of speak to any more color around the stores that are coming up for renewal in 2019 how that compares to 2018 thanks adrian bartella chief financial officer hi seth it s adrian so from from a split from organic between like for like and net new business we expect the like for like to be somewhere between low to mid single digit primarily because of the pressures we see in the duty free and luxury business and the net new business as two contracts i mentioned in the call earlier starts to close down the net new business for the year would be around flat seth sigman credit suisse analyst okay understood roger fordyce chief executive officer and director hey i m sorry this roger i just wanted to complete the part of the second question that you asked on the i guess the pipeline and the outlook for the stores opening this year you know part of the reason why the sales forecast is slightly for a long term framework is the timing really of store openings and we ve constantly reminded the market of the variable nature of the rfp wins and when stores actually come online and you know this year we have what we ve already reported some great wins the salt lake city as well as the indianapolis one earlier this year a lot of that is very late this year or early 2020 which just pushes out the results of those wins beyond some of the waiting of the loss of the contracts that adrian mentioned seth sigman credit suisse analyst okay so just to sum that up in the context of the low to mid single digit guidance when you think about the cadence should the first half and the second half look similar because they re separate i guess headwinds in the first half and second half adrian bartella chief financial officer i mean the first half would have exchange rate headwinds i think the first quarter would be probably around 1 headwind from exchange rate the second quarter should go somewhere between 0 5 to 0 8 and then we should see the exchange headwinds to go away as we get through the fourth quarter but then we will get pressure from some of the contracts which expire before the new contracts get online so i would say they would be probably somehow balanced seth sigman credit suisse analyst okay my follow up question is around the gross margin which has been just a great story this past year can you just help us better understand the guidance for up slightly in 2019 mix should continue to be a benefit i would think is there conservatism in here or are there negative offsets that we should be thinking about obviously you have a difficult comparison but just help us better understand some of the puts and takes thanks adrian bartella chief financial officer so this year was really successful we were really successful in negotiating some of our big vendor agreements and of course as you said the comparison of the comps are pretty pretty tough so we expect the phasings to continue there may be some upside potential but we re still working diligently on renegotiating our vendor agreements but i would not see anything to the extend we ve seen in 2018 we will probably see a support coming from our sales mix change which as we as we always communicated would be probably 20 bps seth sigman credit suisse analyst okay thank you operator the next question will come from michael lasser of ubs mark carden ubs investment bank analyst good morning it s actually mark carden on for michael lasser thanks a lot for taking the question so in recent quarters there s also been some softening in your like for like growth now i know there s some unusual headwinds built into your forecast but what can we expect hudson to return to more normalized growth levels on this metric thanks adrian bartella chief financial officer i would expect somewhere in q3 q4 to see a normalization on these metrics as i mentioned the like for like is primarily impacted by the softening in luxury and duty free business and we have seen the softening started sometime in q3 last year if you dissect the business between duty free and duty paid the duty paid business is pretty stable the like for like is very robust and there was no big fluctuations the key driver of the softening is the duty free business and as we get to the comp period sometimes late in q3 we should see stabilization on the metric mark carden ubs investment bank analyst great that s helpful and then also there s been news much of the 737 max fleet has been grounded in the us now historically how have these kinds of disruptions impacted your business do leisure passengers get spooked at all and fly less would you expect to see any prolonged decrease in air traffic growth or passenger growth rates remain relatively in line with what you ve seen historically thanks roger fordyce chief executive officer and director you know i think it s a little early in this new story to identify the actual long term impact i mean what we do know is that there are about 70 of those planes that were flown by domestic us airlines primarily united american and southwest news reports this morning was that obviously because of the advanced notice of this they were already rebooking passengers and trying to accommodate them to the extent possible and i would expect because you know those of us who fly frequently know that it s the unannounced cancellizations that are the ones that are more problematic if an airline has an opportunity to know in advance of a possibility of a reshift of a flight they have the opportunity of trying to re accommodating passengers so i think the impact or we re hoping the impact to be very minimal but it s very early in this story to know if there s going to be anything significant mark carden ubs investment bank analyst great thanks very much operator and the next question will come from vincent sinisi of morgan stanley vincent sinisi morgan stanley analyst hey great good morning guys thanks very much for taking our question so just wanted to go back to the you know the duty free part of the business and obviously the still soft chinese consumer are you seeing anything kind of different in the baskets today that lead you to believe that you know anything may change as we go through this year as it can be more a case of you know kind of starting to lap the softness from a couple of quarters back and then also i now you said in the past that you were starting to kind of broaden the duty free assortment with some more mid tier merchandise can you give us an update how that s going roger fordyce chief executive officer and director so you know to answer a few components of those questions i think you know the softening that we experienced in q3 and q4 will obviously have some impact on the current results and will kind of i think bring it to a more level comparative situation for us in the current situation so i do think that we will see some moderation of the impact as we hit that q3 q4 comp period in regards to changes that we ve seen it s a little early in q3 to really identify any significant changes we just kind of completed a little bit of an offset of a chinese new year we re still evaluating the overall results for the first quarter of the year i think we have a better handle on that in a few weeks once we can look at because of the holiday actually fell about 10 or 11 days later this year so the offset periods were are actually just completing right now so we ll have a little bit better handle on on how that trended in regards to additional promotions we obviously we talked about some discounting fewer discounting programs we did at the end of last year which were very successful those did end in december but we also had additional discounting that we did during the chinese new year period to continue to help drive and take advantage of that heavy travel period for the chinese passenger so we did see some positive results that came out of that and lastly we are continuing to look at for example we just opened up moncler shop in vancouver and we re continuing to look at other brands and continue to evolve the mix as the change in the chinese passenger continues to develop so it is something that is an ongoing process vincent sinisi morgan stanley analyst okay all right that s helpful roger thank you and then maybe just as a follow up this is going to be more obviously more kind of a longer term strategy but as of course food and beverage is more and more of a focus as you mentioned you can open larger contracts if you do have a more established food and beverage offering any thoughts i know it s still early but any thoughts on kind of how much more opportunity will ultimately be open to you within the industry versus with your current food and beverage offerings and when we can see more of a notable move to that side of the business roger fordyce chief executive officer and director so i think you ll see throughout 2019 some movement in that area obviously we continue to look at a whole range of potential opportunities within the food and beverages as we we ve reported to the market in the past and those drivers are driven by us continuing to expand and look at additional brands to improve our portfolio we continue to grow the brands that we ve started to develop throughout 2019 we also are continuing to look at potential acquisition targets to help accelerate that we are looking at that broader range we ve reported to the market the breadth of whitespace on the food and beverage side i think the three drivers of the potential really is the opportunities for us to expand our portfolio and improve our skill sets organically but then how quickly an acquisition can take place and accelerate that overall view obviously an acquisition would significantly change the size and scope of what we could look at in the rfp pipeline adrian bartella chief financial officer and just to put it in the context i think the food and beverage pipeline is probably double the size of the retail pipeline so there s a lot of room and opportunity for growth vincent sinisi morgan stanley analyst okay very helpful guys thanks very much good luck operator operator instructions our next question will come from marisa sullivan of bank of america merrill lynch marisa sullivan bank of america merrill lynch analyst good morning thanks for taking my question just wanted to ask about the expense line i know you re expecting some personnel expense deleverage but can you just give us some further color on the quarterly cadence and then the key drivers there and then whether you see any offsets elsewhere in expenses or both in personnel and then elsewhere thank you adrian bartella chief financial officer so we would see a probably bigger deleverage in the first quarter the key driver of the deleverage is the new equity plan and also the additional overhead we had to hire because of being public company and in december most of our overheads were in place so in q1 we see some deleverage q2 is slight and then as we go into q3 and q4 we see some leverage so overall for the full year there will be slight deleverage offsetting impacts will be the gross profit margin where we expect some improvement on other expenses sale expenses we expect them to be pretty flat compared to 2018 as a percentage of sale marisa sullivan bank of america merrill lynch analyst actually that s very helpful and then just on the commentary about the concession losses can you just give us a little bit more color on the reasons for that loss and have you seen any changes in the competitive environment and then as we look to 2019 how is the pipeline shaping up as it compared to previous years thanks so much roger fordyce chief executive officer and director thanks marisa again i think you know our the pipeline remains extremely robust as we continue to both on the retail side as well as the expansion of us having the opportunity of looking into food and beverage as a component of that pipeline you know the concession losses we ve reported to the market are success rate of 80 of retaining contracts over time that remains intact that was through in 2018 the outlook for that i think remains going forward into the future so 80 means that we do lose contracts from time to time it really just comes down to the timing of the loss of those contracts against our ability to put new wins and new additional square footage against that that s why it isn t always necessarily as evident as this particular the next few quarters for us and again it is all about the timing as i said some of the we have some great wins already on the table but much of that does not come online until late 2019 early 2020 so it really is about that this is a normal course of business there is nothing unique about those losses they do happen from time to time we don t have 100 success rate i wish we could on each of our contracts so i would say it s a normal course of business and we re just really about a matter of timing to be able to offset those losses marisa sullivan bank of america merrill lynch analyst sure thank you so much operator and this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to debbie belevan for any closing remarks deborah belevan

stabilized its core production base in 2018 as the company began enhancing the portfolio to deliver growth as planned we replaced over 100 of produced reserves in 2018 which was enabled by the completion of the quifa water handling expansion project as well as exploration successes at alligator and coralillo in the guatiquia block and jaspe in the quifa north area significant investment in colombia in 2018 has contributed to a strong start in 2019 particularly in the quifa sw field with new water handling facilities in operation in addition after last year s interruptions production from block 192 in peru has recently restarted as it returns to peak levels total company production is the strongest it has been in over a year with solid production and cash flow generation we are executing a number of initiatives to drive production and reserves growth including successfully being awarded two highly prospective blocks in an exploration bid round in ecuador and testing the deliverability of natural gas production from our z 1 block offshore peru we are also very excited by upcoming drilling on the vim 1 block in colombia and on the corentyne block offshore guyana later this year gabriel de alba chairman of the board of directors of the company commented thanks to substantial progress by the frontera team in 2018 the company is better positioned than ever to deliver returns to shareholders with improved capital allocation and a plan to sustain production and reserves from our existing production base at current levels for the next five years both of which we re already delivering on frontera can generate sufficient cash flow to drive growth initiatives in the upstream business as well as take steps to further enhance shareholder returns as oil prices permit continuing on our progress in reducing g a in 2018 we are pursuing additional opportunities to improve the efficiency and cost structure of the business especially in the field and to monetize non core assets these actions will generate additional cash flow and capital for growth and enhanced equity returns frontera is off to a positive start in 2019 production is strong brent oil prices are averaging close to 63 00 bbl in line with our guidance and the company is currently benefiting from narrow oil price differentials financial results 2018 2017 q4 full year q4 full year revenue mm 265

million up 26 1 than the previous quarter and 40 6 from the fourth quarter of 2017 the increase during the fourth quarter relates to the construction of additional water handling facilities in the

well as two development wells at zopilote sur on the cravo viejo block a total of 29 wells were drilled in the fourth quarter of 2018 slightly lower than the 31 wells planned as the cocodrilo

standards ifrs operating ebitda operating netback and net sales these financial measures together with measures prepared in accordance with ifrs provide useful information to investors and shareholders as management uses them to evaluate the operating performance of the company the company s determination of these non ifrs measures may differ from other reporting issuers and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies further these non ifrs measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance or cash flows prepared in accordance with ifrs these financial measures are included because management uses this information to analyze operating performance and liquidity management believes that ebitda is a common measure used to assess profitability before the impact of different financing methods income taxes depreciation and impairment of capital assets and amortization of intangible assets ebitda is a commonly used measure that adjusts net income loss as reported under ifrs to exclude the effects of income tax expense net finance costs and depletion depreciation and amortization expense operating ebitda represents the operating results of the company s primary business excluding the items noted above including fees paid on suspended pipeline capacity other investments such as infrastructure assets certain non cash items such as impairments foreign exchange and unrealized risk management contracts and share based compensation and gains or losses arising form the disposal of

the market it is also commonly used by the oil and gas industry to analyze financial and operating performance expressed as profit per barrel operating netback represents realized price per barrel plus realized gain or loss on financial derivatives less production costs high price royalties and royalties paid in cash and transportation and diluent costs and shows how efficient the company is at extracting and selling its product refer to the operating netback section on page 9 of the md a net sales net sales is a non ifrs subtotal that adjusts revenue to include realized gains and losses from risk management contracts while removing the cost of dilution activities this is a useful indicator for management as the company hedges a portion of its oil production using derivative instruments to manage exposure to oil price volatility this metric allows the company to report its realized net sales after factoring in these risk management activities the exclusion of diluent cost is helpful to understand the company s sales performance based on the net realized proceeds from production net of dilution the cost of which is partially recovered when the blended product is sold net sales does not include the sales and purchases of oil and gas for trading as the gross margins from these activities are not considered significant or material to the company s operations refer to the reconciliation in the sales section on page 10 of the md a advisory note regarding oil and gas information the reserves information contained in this press release has been prepared in accordance with ni 51 101 complete reserves disclosure required in accordance with ni 51 101 is contained in the f1 report filed on sedar actual oil and natural gas reserves and future production may be greater than or less than the estimates provided in this news release there is no assurance that forecast prices and costs assumed in the reserves report and presented in this this news release will be attained and variances from such forecast prices and costs could be material the estimated future net revenue from the production of the disclosed oil and natural gas reserves in this news release does not represent the fair market value of these reserves the estimates of reserves for individual properties may not reflect the same confidence level as estimates of reserves for all properties due to the effects of aggregation the term reserves replacement ratio is used in this news release this term is consistent with disclosure by other oil and gas companies reserves replacement ratio is calculated by dividing proved plus probable boe reserves added during the year by the total boe production during the year boe conversion the term boe is used in this news release boe may be

pleasure to join you on my first earnings call as hudson s newly appointed ceo while i m new to this position i m not new to the company as i ve just celebrated my 30th anniversary this past september i ve had the fortune of being an integral part of hudson s success over the years and i m eager to lead our highly talented team as we continue to grow the business we have many exciting new initiatives on the way and great opportunities that lie ahead i would like to start the call this morning by providing a high level overview of the fourth quarter and full year 2018 and then i ll turn the call over to adrian to provide specifics on our financial results as well as color on our outlook for 2019 2018 brought many exciting milestones for our business in addition to the ipo in february we had a number of key rfp wins extensions and expansions that will enhance our operations by over 50 000 square feet as these stores come online and nearly 5 increase of our current footprint we also recently surpassed the 1 000 store mark a key measure of the scale we have achieved across north america s travel hubs finally we made impressive strides in our food and beverage business growing this category to nearly 40 of our total sales this includes product mix within our convenience stores as well as stand alone food and beverage operations we are now positioned as a formidable competitor in this space and maybe unless to capture a larger share of spend among air travelers who are looking to fuel up before a flight advertisement advertisement starting with our top line we delivered full year organic sales growth of 7 in line with our expectations and long term framework fourth quarter organic sales growth which is a combination of like for like and net new business growth came in at 4 1 impacted by a continuation of the headwinds that we discussed on our third quarter earnings call namely the fx impacts and softer sales in our duty free and luxury business as the result of trends with chinese travelers while it s important to note that these trends have no impact on our core travel convenience business which comprises 76 of our sales they still influenced our overall like for like sales growth which increased 2 5 in constant currency during the quarter to help life ph drive sales in our duty free business in december we implemented a number of compelling offers including tier discount programs these programs drove increased foot traffic and passenger spend leading to positive gains in the final month of the quarter despite these programs we were still able to drive solid gross margin expansion of 180 basis points in q4 2018 meanwhile for the full year gross margin increased to 140 basis points driven by our ongoing vendor negotiations and sales mix shifts toward higher margin categories including food and beverage net new business the other component of our organic sales growth was up 3 3 for the year as discussed there is variability in this metric from period to period given the nature of our industry as it relates to the timing of new rfps and project construction in this respect the first half of the year was stronger than the second half as we had some larger projects coming online earlier in the year in terms of recent wins in the fourth quarter we were awarded four rfps under an eight year contract at salt lake city international airport which includes 13 travel convenience luxury and duty free stores and doubles our existing footprint in this location to over 12 000 square feet we also had a number of contract extensions during the quarter including dallas love field dallas fort worth and vancouver advertisement advertisement subsequent to year end we also announced a new 10 year contract win at indianapolis international airport which adds another nine stores and 9 000 square feet to our portfolio we also just announced a new contract win an extension of an existing contract at philadelphia international airport which will more than double our current footprint to over 17 000 square feet these wins and extensions exemplify hudson s strong industry reputation track record for creating retail packages and our ability to tailor programs to meet the needs of travelers with new contracts come new stores and during the fourth quarter we had a number of new notable store openings at laguardia we unveiled five stores that were part of an rfp won last year and the new reimagined terminal b included in this win was our first fao schwarz store a hudson one duty free store and mac we also partnered with local iconic new york independent bookseller mcnally jackson offering a bookstore with a true sense of place at boston logan where we previously won a new 10 year contract covering over 40 stores we completed four store openings during the fourth quarter including a hudson tumi tech on the go and ink by hudson we plan to complete another 23 new store openings in boston in 2019 as we ve discussed in the past airport directors are looking for operators who can not only create a custom portfolio of concepts that will be highly productive but also those that can deliver a local design and feel one of the ways we achieve this is by localizing our hudson stores in certain markets some examples of new stores we completed this quarter include our ingenuity store by hudson in san francisco and two island market stores at billy bishop in toronto as we look ahead hudson has a bright future advertisement advertisement overall travel retail has solid long term fundamental growth drivers including continued passenger growth ever expanding white space opportunities as airports continue to invest in infrastructure projects in fact the airports council international or aci just updated their forecasts and estimates that airports will need to invest nearly 130 billion through 2023 to modernize aging facilities and keep up with growing passenger volumes this bodes well for our line of business at hudson we have a solid foundation built upon our leading market share decades long experience in the travel retail industry and our positive track record and relationships with our landlords these strengths will allow us to continue on our trajectory and capitalize on the many opportunities that lie ahead the hudson group management team and i are committed to delivering value for all of our stakeholders including our investors my vision for hudson over the next several years is to establish further establish ourselves as a preeminent airport retailer at the same time we want to solidify our platform to support a thriving food and beverage service beyond qsr beyond specialty coffee locations that we currently operate expanding our food and beverage service capabilities will allow us to bid on larger food and beverage concession contracts with the full scope of offerings including full service sit on restaurants and bars we will look to achieve this through our organic growth and by continuing to evaluate ideal m a targets as a combined operator of both retail and food and beverage locations we can cast a wider net and pursuit a broader range of concession opportunities including smaller airports that may currently not meet our minimum return thresholds this is the natural evolution of our business we are excited about the numerous initiatives under way and we look forward to reporting on our progress in the upcoming quarters now i ll turn it over to adrian for more details on our financial results advertisement advertisement adrian bartella chief financial officer thank you roger we are pleased with our solid financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 which highlighted our continued ability to drive organic sales growth and net new business wins and strengthen our gross profit margin you can find details of our fourth quarter and full year performance in our press release so i will just provide some color in my comment i do want to point out that our bottom line results were impacted by recording of a non routine impairment charge of 10 4 million in the fourth quarter related to a location that had performed below our expectations this was a non core hotel location location outside of our airport business excluding this non routine impairment charge in the fourth quarter 2018 adjusted net profit would have been 14 9 million or 0 16 on adjusted eps base organic sales growth which is a combination of like for like sales and net new business was 4 1 during the fourth quarter compared to 6 5 in the third quarter of this year and 9 4 in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the full year organic growth was 7 compared to 8 8 in 2017 advertisement advertisement in terms of the two components of organic growth first like for like sales for the quarter like for like sales grew 1 6 or 2 5 in constant currency compared to 5 6 or 4 5 in constant currency last year q4 like for like sales growth was driven by robust duty paid and convenience growth which was partially offset by weaker duty free and luxury sale as a result of trends in chinese passenger demand for the full year like for like sales growth was 3 7 compared to 4 8 in 2017 the second component of organic growth is net new business the total contribution of net new business to organic growth was 2 5 in q4 and 3 3 in 2018 versus 4 in 2017 turning page to the income statement during the fourth quarter our gross margin improved 180 basis points to 64 3 and gross margin for the full year 2018 increased 140 basis points to 63 7 key drivers were improved vendor terms and continued sales mix shift to higher margin categories as we previously noted there was a change in the structure of some vendor allowances which benefited our gross profit margin starting in 2018 but retroactive to january 1st some of our vendors support now comes in the form of reduction in costs offset instead of advertising income turning to expenses within operational expenses we have selling expenses personnel expenses and general expenses for these line items the explanations for the trend in the fourth quarter are similar to that for the year for the fourth quarter selling expenses rose 2 6 to 108 6 million for the full year selling expenses increased 5 7 over the prior year to 445 million as you may know concession fees which compromise the majority of this line item are most variable expense driven by net sale despite an increase in selling expenses year over year for 2018 selling expenses as a percentage of turnover improved slightly totaling 23 1 as compared to 23 4 in 2017 advertisement advertisement regarding the fourth quarter 2018 personnel expenses rose 12 2 to 107 million personnel expenses increased 10 7 for the full year 2018 over 2017 to 411 million this increase in personnel expenses was driven primarily due to wage increases and new hires associated with the opening of new stores location and additional personnel expenses up on becoming a public company in addition as noted on our last earnings call q4 2018 saw the impact of our new long term incentive plan which contributed approximately 1 8 million to personnel expenses for the full year 2018 personnel expenses represent a 21 4 of turnover an increase of 80 basis points as compared to 2017 in fourth quarter 2018 the general and administrative expenses were down 11 6 to 34 2 million compared to last year general expenses decreased 16 3 to 131 4 million for the full year 2018 as a percentage of turnover general expenses decreased from 8 7 in 2017 to 6 8 in 2018 the key driver of the decrease was the lower franchise fees paid to dufry as you may remember from previous calls as of january 1 2018 we paid dufry an average about 1 of net sale in franchise fees which decreased from about 2 of net sales in the previous year turning to our balance sheet and cash flow as of december 31 2018 our net debt position was 310 million resulting in a net debt to ebitda leverage of 1 3 times a notable improvement of a net debt to ebitda leverage of 2 7 times in 2017 cash flow from operating activities for the year were 232 7 million compared to 130 8 million in 2017 the increasing cash flow was driven by improved operating performance and timing of franchise fees payments to dufry capital expenditure decreased to 69 3 million in 2018 from 87 8 million in the prior year as a result of timing of new projects lastly i would like to comment briefing our expectations for 2019 in the first half of the year we expect to see similar current headwinds like in q3 and q4 2018 due to the weakening of the canadian dollar versus the us dollar while our duty paid business is robust and growing we expect continuous softness in duty free and luxury business as a result of spending trend with chinese travelers in the second half of the year we anticipate that the currency headwinds and macroeconomic factors would dissipate as we anniverse ph their impact however we will face some contra exploration that will impact second half growth while new stores wins come online specifically we have few concessions that we will be rolling off in 2019 while unfortunate the loss of this contract is not a complete surprise expired few years ago but the timing of closures was not clear these operations would be closing down primarily in the second half of the year while it s always unfortunate to lose contract this business had its ups and downs and as we have said our extension rate is now at 80 our diverse portfolio of contacts and our ability to navigate these ebbs and flows has made us successful over the 10 years history there has been no change in our win rate and our ability to execute on extension and new business opportunities moving forward like those that roger already discussed given these factors we would like to provide some color around our expectations for 2019 while we have confidence in our long term framework and believe that our organic growth sales will ramp up over the long term as currency headwinds and pressure from chinese customers mitigate we expect organic sales growth for 2019 to be in the low to mid single digit range we expect our gross margin in 2019 to slightly improve and to be offset by some modest deleverage on the personnel expense line resulting in a flat ebitda margin in 2019 this excludes the impact of lease accounting changes which i will discuss in a second the effective tax rate is estimated to come in higher at about 40 for the year due to the non deductibility of certain compensation severance expenses and the increase in the beat tax rate from 5 in 2018 to 10 in 2019 consequently we expect our adjusted eps pre ifrs 16 changes to be relatively flat in 2019 finally i would also like to mention that as of january 1 2019 we have implemented ifrs 16 standard on lease accounting we have provided an overview in our 20 f i just want to highlight the key changes and this will bring under the new standard we are required to capitalize the fixed portion of our lease which amounts to roughly half of our total rent expense as a result we would bring about 1 billion on our balance sheet as fixed assets and debt there s also p l impact which is different than u s gaap filers ph in which our rent expenses reduce and we will now we will recognise interest and amortization on the capitalized leases the interest is front loaded during the life of the lease so we expect a negative impact to the bottom line when comprised with trade line rent expense we ll provide more details in our q1 result going forward we plan to break out the impact of the lease accounting on our results for use of comparison to be clear these accounting changes will not affect the fundamental strength of our business and we do not foresee this affecting our business decisions as we look to drive organic growth in summary we saw solid organic growth in both like for like and net new business during 2018 resulting in a healthy year of operating results the growth levers we have laid out in the past including our productivity and pricing initiatives the resilience of our business our distinct operating advantages and industry leading position and the temporary nature of some of the 2019 headwinds continue to give us confidence in our ability to achieve our long term three to five year framework we look forward to building on our progress in 2019 and now i will turn it back over to the operator to open it up for q a questions and answers operator we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions and our first question will come from seth sigman of credit suisse seth sigman credit suisse analyst thanks guys how are you all thanks for taking the question my first question is around the sales guidance so low to mid single digit organic sales growth in 2019 what s the assumption embedded here for the contribution for from new stores new business ads and if you could just sort of speak to any more color around the stores that are coming up for renewal in 2019 how that compares to 2018 thanks adrian bartella chief financial officer hi seth it s adrian so from from a split from organic between like for like and net new business we expect the like for like to be somewhere between low to mid single digit primarily because of the pressures we see in the duty free and luxury business and the net new business as two contracts i mentioned in the call earlier starts to close down the net new business for the year would be around flat seth sigman credit suisse analyst okay understood roger fordyce chief executive officer and director hey i m sorry this roger i just wanted to complete the part of the second question that you asked on the i guess the pipeline and the outlook for the stores opening this year you know part of the reason why the sales forecast is slightly for a long term framework is the timing really of store openings and we ve constantly reminded the market of the variable nature of the rfp wins and when stores actually come online and you know this year we have what we ve already reported some great wins the salt lake city as well as the indianapolis one earlier this year a lot of that is very late this year or early 2020 which just pushes out the results of those wins beyond some of the waiting of the loss of the contracts that adrian mentioned seth sigman credit suisse analyst okay so just to sum that up in the context of the low to mid single digit guidance when you think about the cadence should the first half and the second half look similar because they re separate i guess headwinds in the first half and second half adrian bartella chief financial officer i mean the first half would have exchange rate headwinds i think the first quarter would be probably around 1 headwind from exchange rate the second quarter should go somewhere between 0 5 to 0 8 and then we should see the exchange headwinds to go away as we get through the fourth quarter but then we will get pressure from some of the contracts which expire before the new contracts get online so i would say they would be probably somehow balanced seth sigman credit suisse analyst okay my follow up question is around the gross margin which has been just a great story this past year can you just help us better understand the guidance for up slightly in 2019 mix should continue to be a benefit i would think is there conservatism in here or are there negative offsets that we should be thinking about obviously you have a difficult comparison but just help us better understand some of the puts and takes thanks adrian bartella chief financial officer so this year was really successful we were really successful in negotiating some of our big vendor agreements and of course as you said the comparison of the comps are pretty pretty tough so we expect the phasings to continue there may be some upside potential but we re still working diligently on renegotiating our vendor agreements but i would not see anything to the extend we ve seen in 2018 we will probably see a support coming from our sales mix change which as we as we always communicated would be probably 20 bps seth sigman credit suisse analyst okay thank you operator the next question will come from michael lasser of ubs mark carden ubs investment bank analyst good morning it s actually mark carden on for michael lasser thanks a lot for taking the question so in recent quarters there s also been some softening in your like for like growth now i know there s some unusual headwinds built into your forecast but what can we expect hudson to return to more normalized growth levels on this metric thanks adrian bartella chief financial officer i would expect somewhere in q3 q4 to see a normalization on these metrics as i mentioned the like for like is primarily impacted by the softening in luxury and duty free business and we have seen the softening started sometime in q3 last year if you dissect the business between duty free and duty paid the duty paid business is pretty stable the like for like is very robust and there was no big fluctuations the key driver of the softening is the duty free business and as we get to the comp period sometimes late in q3 we should see stabilization on the metric mark carden ubs investment bank analyst great that s helpful and then also there s been news much of the 737 max fleet has been grounded in the us now historically how have these kinds of disruptions impacted your business do leisure passengers get spooked at all and fly less would you expect to see any prolonged decrease in air traffic growth or passenger growth rates remain relatively in line with what you ve seen historically thanks roger fordyce chief executive officer and director you know i think it s a little early in this new story to identify the actual long term impact i mean what we do know is that there are about 70 of those planes that were flown by domestic us airlines primarily united american and southwest news reports this morning was that obviously because of the advanced notice of this they were already rebooking passengers and trying to accommodate them to the extent possible and i would expect because you know those of us who fly frequently know that it s the unannounced cancellizations that are the ones that are more problematic if an airline has an opportunity to know in advance of a possibility of a reshift of a flight they have the opportunity of trying to re accommodating passengers so i think the impact or we re hoping the impact to be very minimal but it s very early in this story to know if there s going to be anything significant mark carden ubs investment bank analyst great thanks very much operator and the next question will come from vincent sinisi of morgan stanley vincent sinisi morgan stanley analyst hey great good morning guys thanks very much for taking our question so just wanted to go back to the you know the duty free part of the business and obviously the still soft chinese consumer are you seeing anything kind of different in the baskets today that lead you to believe that you know anything may change as we go through this year as it can be more a case of you know kind of starting to lap the softness from a couple of quarters back and then also i now you said in the past that you were starting to kind of broaden the duty free assortment with some more mid tier merchandise can you give us an update how that s going roger fordyce chief executive officer and director so you know to answer a few components of those questions i think you know the softening that we experienced in q3 and q4 will obviously have some impact on the current results and will kind of i think bring it to a more level comparative situation for us in the current situation so i do think that we will see some moderation of the impact as we hit that q3 q4 comp period in regards to changes that we ve seen it s a little early in q3 to really identify any significant changes we just kind of completed a little bit of an offset of a chinese new year we re still evaluating the overall results for the first quarter of the year i think we have a better handle on that in a few weeks once we can look at because of the holiday actually fell about 10 or 11 days later this year so the offset periods were are actually just completing right now so we ll have a little bit better handle on on how that trended in regards to additional promotions we obviously we talked about some discounting fewer discounting programs we did at the end of last year which were very successful those did end in december but we also had additional discounting that we did during the chinese new year period to continue to help drive and take advantage of that heavy travel period for the chinese passenger so we did see some positive results that came out of that and lastly we are continuing to look at for example we just opened up moncler shop in vancouver and we re continuing to look at other brands and continue to evolve the mix as the change in the chinese passenger continues to develop so it is something that is an ongoing process vincent sinisi morgan stanley analyst okay all right that s helpful roger thank you and then maybe just as a follow up this is going to be more obviously more kind of a longer term strategy but as of course food and beverage is more and more of a focus as you mentioned you can open larger contracts if you do have a more established food and beverage offering any thoughts i know it s still early but any thoughts on kind of how much more opportunity will ultimately be open to you within the industry versus with your current food and beverage offerings and when we can see more of a notable move to that side of the business roger fordyce chief executive officer and director so i think you ll see throughout 2019 some movement in that area obviously we continue to look at a whole range of potential opportunities within the food and beverages as we we ve reported to the market in the past and those drivers are driven by us continuing to expand and look at additional brands to improve our portfolio we continue to grow the brands that we ve started to develop throughout 2019 we also are continuing to look at potential acquisition targets to help accelerate that we are looking at that broader range we ve reported to the market the breadth of whitespace on the food and beverage side i think the three drivers of the potential really is the opportunities for us to expand our portfolio and improve our skill sets organically but then how quickly an acquisition can take place and accelerate that overall view obviously an acquisition would significantly change the size and scope of what we could look at in the rfp pipeline adrian bartella chief financial officer and just to put it in the context i think the food and beverage pipeline is probably double the size of the retail pipeline so there s a lot of room and opportunity for growth vincent sinisi morgan stanley analyst okay very helpful guys thanks very much good luck operator operator instructions our next question will come from marisa sullivan of bank of america merrill lynch marisa sullivan bank of america merrill lynch analyst good morning thanks for taking my question just wanted to ask about the expense line i know you re expecting some personnel expense deleverage but can you just give us some further color on the quarterly cadence and then the key drivers there and then whether you see any offsets elsewhere in expenses or both in personnel and then elsewhere thank you adrian bartella chief financial officer so we would see a probably bigger deleverage in the first quarter the key driver of the deleverage is the new equity plan and also the additional overhead we had to hire because of being public company and in december most of our overheads were in place so in q1 we see some deleverage q2 is slight and then as we go into q3 and q4 we see some leverage so overall for the full year there will be slight deleverage offsetting impacts will be the gross profit margin where we expect some improvement on other expenses sale expenses we expect them to be pretty flat compared to 2018 as a percentage of sale marisa sullivan bank of america merrill lynch analyst actually that s very helpful and then just on the commentary about the concession losses can you just give us a little bit more color on the reasons for that loss and have you seen any changes in the competitive environment and then as we look to 2019 how is the pipeline shaping up as it compared to previous years thanks so much roger fordyce chief executive officer and director thanks marisa again i think you know our the pipeline remains extremely robust as we continue to both on the retail side as well as the expansion of us having the opportunity of looking into food and beverage as a component of that pipeline you know the concession losses we ve reported to the market are success rate of 80 of retaining contracts over time that remains intact that was through in 2018 the outlook for that i think remains going forward into the future so 80 means that we do lose contracts from time to time it really just comes down to the timing of the loss of those contracts against our ability to put new wins and new additional square footage against that that s why it isn t always necessarily as evident as this particular the next few quarters for us and again it is all about the timing as i said some of the we have some great wins already on the table but much of that does not come online until late 2019 early 2020 so it really is about that this is a normal course of business there is nothing unique about those losses they do happen from time to time we don t have 100 success rate i wish we could on each of our contracts so i would say it s a normal course of business and we re just really about a matter of timing to be able to offset those losses marisa sullivan bank of america merrill lynch analyst sure thank you so much operator and this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to debbie belevan for any closing remarks deborah belevan

the price of a year at college has increased by more than 1 200 percent over the last 30 years far outpacing any other price the government tracks food housing cars gasoline tvs you name it tuition has increased at a rate double that of medical care usually considered the most expensive of human necessities it has outstripped any reasonable expectation people might have had for investments over the period and as we all know it has crushed a generation of college grads with debt today thanks to those enormous tuition prices young americans routinely start adult life with a burden unknown to any previous cohort and whose ruinous effects we can only guess at on the assumption that anyone in that generation still has a taste for irony i offer the following quotation on the subject drawn from one of the earliest news stories about the problem of soaring tuition the newspaper was the washington post the speaker was an assistant dean at a college that had just announced a tuition hike of 19 percent and the question before him was how much farther tuition increases could go maybe all of a sudden this bubble is going to burst he was quoted as saying how much will the public take oh we would take quite a lot as it happened it was 1981 when the assistant dean worried in that manner the very first year of what was once called the tuition spiral when higher ed prices got the attention of the media by outpacing inflation by a factor of two or three there was something shocking about this development tuition hadn t gone up like that during the 1970s even though that was the heyday of ascending consumer prices yet at that point the tuition spiral had more than three decades to go indeed it is still twisting upward today but the way we talk about this slow motion disaster has changed little over the years ever since the spiral began commentators have been marveling at how far it s gone and wondering how much farther it has yet to run the trend can t continue they say every few years they ask when the families and politicians of america are finally going to get off their knees and do something about it but somehow nothing ever gets done the trend does continue and for 30 years the journalists who cover the subject have followed the same pointless script they have hunted fruitlessly for the legitimate expense that they knew must be driving up the prices they have chased repeatedly after the wrong answers blaming everybody and everything except for the obvious culprits they have related to us the politicians plans for bringing the spiral to a stop plans that everyone can see have virtually no chance of succeeding and all along the larger meaning of the spiral is almost never discussed as though it were contrary to some unwritten rule of journalistic cognition reading back over journalistic accounts of the tuition spiral from the 80s and 90s you get the impression that all concerned felt it was a wee bit uncouth to dig too deeply into a university s pricing practices or suspect the sachems of higher learning who presided over them of anything inappropriate these were the journalists s beloved alma maters after all surely they had our best interests at heart surely we could trust the word of university administrators even though they always in their determination to make tuition price increases seem rational and sensible seemed to find a way to blame someone other than themselves and so beginning in the 80s university administrators their words dutifully transcribed by journalists blamed utility bills for soaring tuition they blamed libraries which made a certain amount of sense until libraries went dramatically out of fashion in the internet age and yet still tuition prices went up they blamed professors of course since professors are the most visible part of a university and because it s easy to hate professors sometimes university spokesmen would claim that colleges were being forced to spend a lot in order to hire the very best professors an academic echo of the reasoning corporate america uses to explain fat executive salaries on other occasions however they would claim that they were being forced to spend a lot because professors nowadays were lazy and didn t want to teach and so they were forced to hire an expanded roster of them to offer all their courses both excuses were plausible on paper and there s probably some university president somewhere who s still blaming professors for his insane tuition bills but these alibis only made sense until the outside world figured out that universities were actually using graduate students and adjuncts to teach their courses and yet still tuition prices were mounting at an insane clip administrators also blamed tuition inflation on onerous government regulations which they said forced them to hire bureaucrats to fill out forms sometimes they did this even when they themselves had lobbied for the government regulation in question they blamed students who were supposedly demanding all manner of luxuries and would not be denied students today want carpeting they want furniture they want voice mail an administrator at a nevada university told usa today for a 1997 story about the tuition spiral they want all the amenities that 10 20 30 years ago were almost unheard of one wonders if by that logic students today want life altering amounts of debt too and administrators blamed society which was forcing them to be high tech and culturally diverse social improvements that were supposed to be terribly expensive according to a tuition spiral story that appeared in the new york times in 1988 colleges say that tuition bills reflect the demands society places on them to shelter students from drugs and alcohol to diversify their campuses with more black hispanic and rural students to provide access ramps and elevators for the handicapped to prepare students for a high technology society in one of the most curious bits of blame evasion a 1990 report commissioned by the college board actually attributed rising tuition prices to a declining student population like all the other excuses this got university administrators off the hook but it also raised troubling questions ordinarily reduced demand makes prices go down not up that the opposite was happening implied that colleges had the power simply to impose their costs on the student population regardless of that population s size or wishes besides when the student population numbers reversed themselves and began to rise several years later tuition still ascended the same report went on to insist that higher ed was an extremely competitive industry but that it had simply chosen to compete in ways other than price they were building really fine gymnasiums in lieu of keeping prices under control six one way half dozen the other this was supposed to be reassuring but like the stuff about reduced demand yielding higher prices it should have rung alarm bells all over washington clearly indicating that this particular industry was not subject to basic market forces that regulation and maybe even price controls were immediately required the possibility that higher tuition prices were going to pay for rapidly multiplying and yet educationally unnecessary administrators was not really raised in earnest until a memorable page one series published in 1996 by the philadelphia inquirer this interpretation had the virtue of being accurate unlike tenured faculty university administrations actually have grown by 369 percent since the mid 1970s as i have noted before but blaming administrators proved difficult for journalists perhaps because administrators were the very people journalists had been going to for explanations in their tuition outrage stories could their sources actually be the culprits no way and so less than a year after the inquirer s series appeared usa today ran its own big tuition shock tale in which the blame was pinned on all the familiar blame objects professors student demands technology gummint regulation a 1997 cover story in time magazine how colleges are gouging u the illustration shouted barely mentioned administrators at all one factor remained constant through all these years of journalistic hand wringing those who wrote about the higher ed price problem kept expecting the invisible hand to assert itself and straighten this thing out every glimmer of light looked to them like the end of the tunnel an unusually small tuition increase at stanford in 1990 for example was trumpeted on page one of the new york times as evidence that market forces had worked that the spiral had ended others agreed in february of 1991 the seattle times announced that we had reached the end of the ordeal the fact is middle class students and parents simply can t pay any more they were wrong of course eight months later usa today reported that tuition was spiking upward again growing by 12 percent that year at state universities and it pains me to report that an education at stanford today costs about 60 000 per year just a little less than the most expensive schools of them all what were journalists to do after ringing the alarm bells for so many years without effect well there was one easy answer to this frustrating situation to discover that there wasn t really any problem in the first place that the tuition spiral was entirely reasonable even if no one could actually explain it how so well if you examine what has come to be called the college wage premium the difference between what is earned by college grads and high school grads it becomes clear that someone who finishes four years at a university will eventually earn far more than they spent to go there even at the crazy tuition prices of recent decades today this is a universal way of considering the situation always leading us to conclude that going to college is worth it that it is a bargain that it pays off but it only seemed to enter journalists consciousness in the 1990s as on the occasion when gaston caperton president of the college board explained matters thusly to the los angeles times in 1999 he said there has been too much focus on the cost of college and too little on the lifetime returns for four years of investment because a college graduate today earns about twice as much as a worker with only a high school diploma he said a college education is worth about 1 million over a lifetime the mind reels when confronted with this kind of smugness one wonders is there some identifiable aspect of a college education that yields that million dollar prize exposure to advanced literary theory for example is there a way to isolate that particular 24 carat nugget and leave the dross behind all the plush dorm carpeting and the many layers of assistant deans my guess though is that caperton s statement meant exactly the opposite of this that there was no need to inquire any further about the tuition outrage what it implied by extension was that since we now know the final value of a college degree one million dollars the colleges can simply keep raising tuition prices and student indebtedness until they have extracted that amount from their graduates and only after they have hit that figure will we have cause to complain government has been little better than journalists over the three decades of the tuition spiral by far the most forthright antagonist of the inflation happy colleges was the reagan era culture warrior education secretary william bennett who seemed to delight in blunt statements like this one some of our colleges and universities charge what the market will bear the heart of the matter is that colleges raise costs because they can were some member of the compromise minded obama team to talk like that today the centrist earth below washington dc would gape in outrage and swallow them up unfortunately angry rhetoric is as far as bennett went the solutions he proposed like all the solutions anyone has proposed over the three decades of the tuition spiral did the opposite of help bennett believed that federal grants fed the tuition spiral replacing them with loans and restricting the annual increase was supposed to solve the problem the basic idea here was that if we exposed students more directly to the educational market that bennett had identified making them borrow the money to attend we could then count on those self interested economic actors to behave as consumers are supposed to and do something about the problem the policy was to re emphasize self help per the new york times but this particular market has never worked that way and the only effect of course was to raise up the himalayas of student debt that are such a familiar part of the landscape today the hunt for a market based solution went on however during the presidency of george h w bush the department of justice accused the ivy league universities of acting as a collegiate cartel and conspiring to fix financial aid and hence prices the antitrust case was settled with a consent decree in 1991 the tuition spiral proceeded as before i have written about this elsewhere in case you re interested and that was pretty much it the very last time the federal government tried to get tough with the higher ed industry since then the two parties have gone their different ways on the matter democrats today worship education while republicans today worship the market neither of which faith has brought us close to a solution the efforts of the clinton administration for example were almost unbelievably feeble with great fanfare the democrats streamlined the student loan process proposed a tax cut for parents who paid for college and hooray cracked down on student borrowers we have tracked down defaulters and made them pay bill clinton boasted in 1997 a low point of sorts was reached in the late 1990s when congress appointed a national commission on the cost of higher education and filled it with university presidents and the head of one of the main higher ed lobby groups the report they proceeded to publish in 1998 was an entirely predictable outcome of this staffing decision i suppose but still the reader is struck by its resounding impotence this panel was so pallid it didn t even amount to a whitewash on page one of its report for example the commission declared that it wasn t really interested in soaring tuition at all except insofar as soaring tuitions might cause americans to feel ill will toward universities after going on to catalog the usual culprits blame regulations blame students the commission concluded that there should be yes further study on the matter the commission recommends that the philanthropic community research institutes and agencies of state and local government adopt the topic of academic cost control as a research area worthy of major financial support they also recommended that universities do a better pr job that they organize themselves to inform the public about the returns on this investment but even that would probably be considered an outrage were it published today last year the obama administration announced its own plan to make college more affordable the centerpiece was a scheme for doing something analogous to what that commission proposed back in 1998 building a rating system to inform the public about the returns on college investments there was also the obligatory olive branch to the right in a proposal to reduce regulatory barriers the universities responded by going absolutely apeshit they are happy to talk about the return on investment when it s a vague promise of a million bucks for anyone who pays up and goes to college when someone actually takes them at their word and tries to measure the claim it seems that fundamental principles are being trampled i hope obama ignores the wailing of the universities and goes through with his plan despite the obvious folly of trying to explain people s relative prosperity by reference to the college they attended instead of their class background if the president were to expand his approach to include data on the vast and growing size of university administrations and how many courses are taught at each college by adjuncts his rating system might well be useful but there should be no illusions more information by itself is not going to stop the tuition spiral not after 33 years in fact we can predict fairly easily how this thing will backfire once the government discovers and announces the precise return on investment for each institution of higher learning like any rational profit maximizing entity those institutions will simply continue hiking tuitions in order to capture a larger chunk of that return for themselves as the reforms fail and the journalism fails maybe we will figure out that all along there has been a single bad ideological idea behind all of this failure the notion that the market will solve the problem if we only adjust the controls a little and as the newspapers of 2020 tell us about an angry new generation of students shouldering an unimaginable debt burden maybe it will dawn on barack obama by then retired and relaxing on the beach in hawaii that maybe we shouldn t have thought of education as a market in the first place maybe college shouldn t be about individuals getting rich maybe there is another purpose in the long sweep of journalistic commentary on the tuition spiral relatively few have raised that question one occasion when it cropped up was in 1986 when the shift from grants to loans was under way and a spokesman for a higher ed accreditation group was able to grasp the larger meaning of the change a grant conveys the message we value you and will invest in your future he told the new york times the message of a loan is go forward if you want but on your own nickel loans reinforce privatist instrumental values a sense that you re in college for yourself and that college studies have as an end only what comes later a job and paying off the loan let me repeat as a fact of some significance that the great tuition price spiral began in 1981 that was the same year in which ronald reagan brought his jolly band of deregulators to washington in which congress enacted the landmark kemp roth tax cut and in which the air traffic controllers union went down to humiliating defeat in 1981 the old order was crumbling the soldiers of the free market were strapping on their adam smith neckties and colleges all across america were deciding they needed to jack up tuition prices far in excess of the rate of inflation something they had not done before when considering the significance of this point of beginning a 1987 inquiry into the tuition problem threw up its hands nobody knows why tuition increases lagged behind consumer prices in the 1970s and jumped ahead in the 1980s according to an associated press summary but in retrospect i think the answer is obvious it happened then because these things are all related deregulation tax cuts de unionization and outrageous tuition inflation are all part of the same historical turn i acknowledge that on the surface this is not an obvious connection the reagan administration was always hostile to universities and loved to bemoan the tuition spiral what s more over the period in question the universities themselves embraced a hyper leftist public image that helped them distract attention from the catastrophe they have visited upon the nation s young but if we think of these things as part of a larger ideological shift they all start to make sense universities were capable of doing in the 70s what they did in the 80s and still are doing today but maybe they didn t do it then because americans thought of universities in a different light in those days what i mean to say is that the tuition price spiral is part of the larger history of inequality just as is the ever rising price of andy warhol paintings or the ever growing size of the mcmansion or the ever weightier catalogs issued by restoration hardware and of course the never increasing wages of american workers as the rewards that can potentially be won by members of the white collar class have gone from meh in the egalitarian 1970s to neronian today it feels natural that the entrance fee for membership in that class should have escalated in a corresponding manner the iron logic of inequality works the other way as well although a college degree doesn t necessarily guarantee a life of splendor not having one pretty much makes a life of poorly compensated toil a sure thing finding ourselves on the receiving end of inequality is a fate we will pay virtually any price to avoid and our system of higher ed exists to set and extract that price put it another way over the last 30 odd years we have essentially privatized higher ed in saying this i m not referencing the defunding of our state u s an explanation for the tuition spiral by the way that doesn t get nearly enough journalistic attention and i am aware that a good chunk of our institutions of higher ed have been private all along what has changed is that they aren t our institutions of higher ed anymore maybe they never were but not too long ago it was possible to think of them from milton friedman s university of chicago all the way down to michele bachmann s winona state university as serving some sort of public function whether founded by the grace of rockefeller or by act of the minnesota legislature they manufactured good citizens they taught us scientific farming techniques hell they built the atomic bomb and created the internet this is why our government subsidized and still subsidizes them with grants and earmarks and tax abatements and preferential treatment of every description but the other part of the bargain doesn t work the way it used to anymore everyone in the age of inequality knows that the purpose of a college education isn t to benefit the nation it s to give the private individual a shot at achieving a high net worth agreeing upon that everyone from state legislators to the secretary of education naturally began to ask why should i pay for someone else to get rich those people need to foot the bill themselves agreeing upon that the colleges and universities reconceived their mission and began to put a more accurate price tag on what the consensus now acknowledged that they were selling the whole enterprise changed one term they used for it in the early days according to a landmark 1988 magazine article by barry werth was the chivas regal argument the idea that college was a luxury good and should be treated as such forget all the bushwah about diversity and lazy professors driving up tuition price increases in those days became virtually an end in themselves something colleges did simply to burnish their prestigious brand image werth quoted an administrator from lehigh university who put the new philosophy succinctly if it s going to be a world of haves and have nots we sure intend to be among the haves that is the offer our ever more expensive colleges extend to their students as well in a world of rich and poor the only choice before you is whether or not you intend to purchase a place among the haves and these days even the once sanctimonious new york times runs stories openly treating the most expensive colleges as brands as class signifiers economists who write about class issues usually depict higher ed as a force for solving the inequality problem not for making it worse other big thinkers tell us that universities are fountainheads of innovation and creativity the only things we really have going for us as a nation those attitudes plus the amazing deference our professional and political classes feel toward the hallowed groves of academe probably explain why this industry has been able to get away with 30 years of something close to price gouging a practice that would never be tolerated from any other provider of life s necessities they also explain why american students have done virtually nothing to stop the spiral while students elsewhere take to the streets in fury when threatened with the tiniest tuition increases because in this country college fulfills a different role even if those peaceful campus quadrangles were originally laid out by quakers or by the egalitarian thomas jefferson we all know what they signify today they are the central symbolic device for explaining inequality college is where money and merit meet where the privileged learn that they are not only smarter than everyone else but that they are more virtuous too they are better people with better test scores better taste better politics college itself is the biggest lesson of them all the thing that teaches us where we stand in a world that is very rapidly coming apart
some years ago i faced up to the futility of reporting true things about america s disastrous wars and so i left afghanistan for another remote mountainous country far away it was the polar opposite of afghanistan a peaceful prosperous land where nearly everybody seemed to enjoy a good life on the job and in the family this story first appeared at tomdispatch it s true that they didn t work much not by american standards anyway in the u s full time salaried workers supposedly laboring 40 hours a week actually average 49 with almost 20 clocking more than 60 these people on the other hand worked only about 37 hours a week when they weren t away on long paid vacations at the end of the work day about four in the afternoon perhaps three in the summer they had time to enjoy a hike in the forest or a swim with the kids or a beer with friends which helps explain why unlike so many americans they are pleased with their jobs often i was invited to go along i found it refreshing to hike and ski in a country with no land mines and to hang out in cafés unlikely to be bombed gradually i lost my warzone jitters and settled into the slow calm pleasantly uneventful stream of life there four years on thinking i should settle down i returned to the united states it felt quite a lot like stepping back into that other violent impoverished world where anxiety runs high and people are quarrelsome i had in fact come back to the flip side of afghanistan and iraq to what america s wars have done to america where i live now in the homeland there are not enough shelters for the homeless most people are either overworked or hurting for jobs housing is overpriced hospitals crowded and understaffed schools largely segregated and not so good opioid or heroin overdose is a popular form of death and men in the street threaten women wearing hijab did the american soldiers i covered in afghanistan know they were fighting for this ducking the subject one night i tuned in to the democrats presidential debate to see if they had any plans to restore the america i used to know to my amazement i heard the name of my peaceful mountain hideaway norway bernie sanders was denouncing america s crooked version of casino capitalism that floats the already rich ever higher and flushes the working class he said that we ought to look to countries like denmark like sweden and norway and learn from what they have accomplished for their working people he believes he added in a society where all people do well not just a handful of billionaires that certainly sounds like norway for ages they ve worked at producing things for the use of everyone not the profit of a few so i was all ears waiting for sanders to spell it out for americans but hillary clinton quickly countered we are not denmark smiling she said i love denmark and then delivered a patriotic punch line we are the united states of america well there s no denying that she praised capitalism and all the small businesses that were started because we have the opportunity and the freedom in our country for people to do that and to make a good living for themselves and their families she didn t seem to know that danes swedes and norwegians do that too and with much higher rates of success the truth is that almost a quarter of american startups are not founded on brilliant new ideas but on the desperation of men or women who can t get a decent job the majority of all american enterprises are solo ventures having zero payrolls employing no one but the entrepreneur and often quickly wasting away sanders said that he was all for small business too but that meant nothing if all of the new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent as george carlin said the reason they call it the american dream is because you have to be asleep to believe it in that debate no more was heard of denmark sweden or norway the audience was left in the dark later in a speech at georgetown university sanders tried to clarify his identity as a democratic socialist he said he s not the kind of socialist with a capital s who favors state ownership of anything like the means of production the norwegian government on the other hand owns the means of producing lots of public assets and is the major stockholder in many a vital private enterprise i was dumbfounded norway denmark and sweden practice variations of a system that works much better than ours yet even the democratic presidential candidates who say they love or want to learn from those countries don t seem to know how they actually work why we re not denmark proof that they do work is delivered every year in data rich evaluations by the u n and other international bodies the organization for economic cooperation and development s annual report on international well being for example measures 11 factors ranging from material conditions like affordable housing and employment to quality of life matters like education health life expectancy voter participation and overall citizen satisfaction year after year all the nordic countries cluster at the top while the united states lags far behind in addition norway ranked first on the u n development program s human development index for 12 of the last 15 years and it consistently tops international comparisons of such matters as democracy civil and political rights and freedom of expression and the press what is it though that makes the scandinavians so different since the democrats can t tell you and the republicans wouldn t want you to know let me offer you a quick introduction what scandinavians call the nordic model is a smart and simple system that starts with a deep commitment to equality and democracy that s two concepts combined in a single goal because as far as they are concerned you can t have one without the other right there they part company with capitalist america now the most unequal of all the developed nations and consequently a democracy no more political scientists say it has become an oligarchy a country run at the expense of its citizenry by and for the super rich perhaps you noticed that in the last century scandinavians aiming for their egalitarian goal refused to settle solely for any of the ideologies competing for power not capitalism or fascism not marxist socialism or communism geographically stuck between powerful nations waging hot and cold wars for such doctrines scandinavians set out to find a path in between that path was contested by socialist inspired workers on the one hand and capitalist owners and their elite cronies on the other but it led in the end to a mixed economy thanks largely to the solidarity and savvy of organized labor and the political parties it backed the long struggle produced a system that makes capitalism more or less cooperative and then redistributes equitably the wealth it helps to produce struggles like this took place around the world in the twentieth century but the scandinavians alone managed to combine the best ideas of both camps while chucking out the worst in 1936 the popular u s journalist marquis childs first described the result to americans in the book sweden the middle way since then all the scandinavian countries and their nordic neighbors finland and iceland have been improving upon that hybrid system today in norway negotiations between the confederation of trade unions and the confederation of norwegian enterprise determine the wages and working conditions of most capitalist enterprises public and private that create wealth while high but fair progressive income taxes fund the state s universal welfare system benefitting everyone in addition those confederations work together to minimize the disparity between high wage and lower wage jobs as a result norway ranks with sweden denmark and finland among the most income equal countries in the world and its standard of living tops the charts so here s the big difference in norway capitalism serves the people the government elected by the people sees to that all eight of the parties that won parliamentary seats in the last national election including the conservative høyre party now leading the government are committed to maintaining the welfare state in the u s however neoliberal politics put the foxes in charge of the henhouse and capitalists have used the wealth generated by their enterprises as well as financial and political manipulations to capture the state and pluck the chickens they ve done a masterful job of chewing up organized labor today only 11 of american workers belong to a union in norway that number is 52 in denmark 67 in sweden 70 in the u s oligarchs maximize their wealth and keep it using the democratically elected government to shape policies and laws favorable to the interests of their foxy class they bamboozle the people by insisting as hillary clinton did at that debate that all of us have the freedom to create a business in the free marketplace which implies that being hard up is our own fault in the nordic countries on the other hand democratically elected governments give their populations freedom from the market by using capitalism as a tool to benefit everyone that liberates their people from the tyranny of the mighty profit motive that warps so many american lives leaving them freer to follow their own dreams to become poets or philosophers bartenders or business owners as they please family matters maybe our politicians don t want to talk about the nordic model because it shows so clearly that capitalism can be put to work for the many not just the few consider the norwegian welfare state it s universal in other words aid to the sick or the elderly is not charity grudgingly donated by elites to those in need it is the right of every individual citizen that includes every woman whether or not she is somebody s wife and every child no matter its parentage treating every person as a citizen affirms the individuality of each and the equality of all it frees every person from being legally possessed by another a husband for example or a tyrannical father which brings us to the heart of scandinavian democracy the equality of women and men in the 1970s norwegian feminists marched into politics and picked up the pace of democratic change norway needed a larger labor force and women were the answer housewives moved into paid work on an equal footing with men nearly doubling the tax base that has in fact meant more to norwegian prosperity than the coincidental discovery of north atlantic oil reserves the ministry of finance recently calculated that those additional working mothers add to norway s net national wealth a value equivalent to the country s total petroleum wealth currently held in the world s largest sovereign wealth fund worth more than 873 billion by 1981 women were sitting in parliament in the prime minister s chair and in her cabinet american feminists also marched for such goals in the 1970s but the big boys busy with their own white house intrigues initiated a war on women that set the country back and still rages today in brutal attacks on women s basic civil rights health care and reproductive freedom in 1971 thanks to the hard work of organized feminists congress passed the bipartisancomprehensive child development bill to establish a multi billion dollar national day care system for the children of working parents in 1972 president richard nixon vetoed it and that was that in 1972 congress also passed a bill first proposed in 1923 to amend the constitution to grant equal rights of citizenship to women ratified by only 35 states three short of the required 38 that equal rights amendment or era was declared dead in 1982 leaving american women in legal limbo in 1996 president bill clinton signed the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act obliterating six decades of federal social welfare policy as we know it ending federal cash payments to the nation s poor and consigning millions of female heads of household and their children to poverty where many still dwell 20 years later today nearly half a century after nixon trashed national child care even privileged women torn between their underpaid work and their kids are overwhelmed things happened very differently in norway there feminists and sociologists pushed hard against the biggest obstacle still standing in the path to full democracy the nuclear family in the 1950s the world famous american sociologist talcott parsons had pronounced that arrangement with hubby at work and the little wife at home the ideal setup in which to socialize children but in the 1970s the norwegian state began to deconstruct that undemocratic ideal by taking upon itself the traditional unpaid household duties of women caring for the children the elderly the sick and the disabled became the basic responsibilities of the universal welfare state freeing women in the workforce to enjoy both their jobs and their families that s another thing american politicians still boringly mostly odiously boastful men surely don t want you to think about that patriarchy can be demolished and everyone be the better for it paradoxically setting women free made family life more genuine many in norway say it has made both men and women more themselves and more alike more understanding and happier it also helped kids slip from the shadow of helicopter parents in norway mother and father in turn take paid parental leave from work to see a newborn through its first year or more at age one however children start attending a neighborhood barnehage kindergarten for schooling spent largely outdoors by the time kids enter free primary school at age six they are remarkably self sufficient confident and good natured they know their way around town and if caught in a snowstorm in the forest how to build a fire and find the makings of a meal one kindergarten teacher explained we teach them early to use an axe so they understand it s a tool not a weapon to americans the notion of a school taking away your child to make her an axe wielder is monstrous in fact norwegian kids who are well acquainted in early childhood with many different adults and children know how to get along with grown ups and look after one another more to the point though it s hard to measure it s likely that scandinavian children spend more quality time with their work isn t everything parents than does a typical middle class american child being driven by a stressed out mother from music lessons to karate practice for all these reasons and more the international organization save the children cites norway as the best country on earth in which to raise kids while the u s finishes far down the list in 33rd place don t take my word for it this little summary just scratches the surface of scandinavia so i urge curious readers to google away but be forewarned you ll find much criticism of all the nordic model countries the structural matters i ve described of governance and family are not the sort of things visible to tourists or visiting journalists so their comments are often obtuse take the american tourist blogger who complained that he hadn t been shown the slums of oslo there are none or the british journalist who wrote that norwegian petrol is too expensive though not for norwegians who are in any case leading the world in switching to electric cars neoliberal pundits especially the brits are always beating up on the scandinavians in books magazines newspapers and blogs predicting the imminent demise of their social democracies and bullying them to forsake the best political economy on the planet self styled experts still in thrall to margaret thatcher tell norwegians they must liberalize their economy and privatize everything short of the royal palace mostly the norwegian government does the opposite or nothing at all and social democracy keeps on ticking it s not perfect of course it has always been a carefully considered work in progress governance by consensus takes time and effort you might think of it as slow democracy but it s light years ahead of us
2019 bloomberg finance lp japan interest rates zero european interest rates zero u s interest rates better closer to 3 but if you are not involved in the carry trade that is borrowing money from a low yielding country like japan and using it to buy high yielding bonds in countries like brazil then the only way to get 3 interest on anything is in junk bonds out of curiosity i asked some fund managers to give me some stocks with a 5 or greater dividend yield i didn t want crazy penny stocks and i didn t want new speculative industries like medical marijuana artificial intelligence or blockchain and crypto nearly all of the names came from emerging markets one of the highest yielders china 2017 bloomberg finance lp love them or hate them china citic bank international is the best yielding financial for a big bank it pays 5 96 and is traded on the hong kong stock exchange in hong kong dollars which is pegged to the u s dollar so currency risk is low and is up 7 89 this year we just bought it recently we have another rebalance of the fund coming up and that stock will be staying in it one of the reasons is that dividend says eric ervin a fund manager for the reality shares nasdaq nexgen economy china etf bcna if you go out of the chinese banking sector you won t find yield like that he says all of our largest yielders are chinese banks and all pay over 5 he says naming the agriculture bank of china 5 75 and the bank of china 5 57 as the two others in the fund i wouldn t bet the farm on chinese banks he says but i wouldn t ignore them either plus they are dirt cheap the bank of america trades at around 10 times earnings citic 5 2x everyone seems to love the financials when it comes to dividend stocks abroad 2018 bloomberg finance lp bank polska i think it s the best bank in poland says jin zhang portfolio manager and senior analyst at vontobel quality growth a boutique investment firm within vontobel asset management the bank trades on the warsaw stock exchange and is down 0 05 year to date the bank s largest shareholder is the polish government with a 20 position their polish business has been solid they have a dominant corporate sector for trade finance and all the important financial services that companies need i just think they re a great story zhang says poland s economy is also better than most of europe s their economy grew around 4 in 2018 making it the european envy of president trump when it comes to gdp growth rates while the rest of europe has had its ups and downs with the ftse europe off by 8 95 since 2013 the warsaw stock exchange total return index is up 20 still out of three fund managers who discussed dividend payers china seems like the place to be for all of them china highway toll operator hopewell highway infrastructure is traded in hong kong is up just 4 2 this year but it has a dividend yield of 5 4 as a growth stock hopewell has underperformed the msci hong kong because of a tender offer of shares last summer that didn t go according to plan we bought it a while ago back when i was looking for diversification in asia says bryce fegley a fund manager for saturna capital fegley runs the sextant global high income fund sghix a balanced mutual fund hopewell is not a chinese monopoly but they do have control over some infrastructure so from a bottom up perspective they always looked pretty good to us most of the high yielders are emerging market banks natural resources and energy energy tends to be the most interesting because they are cyclical in nature and their main commodity oil and gas is priced in dollars so if foreign oil and gas stocks are down in the dumps there is a chance that it is cyclical and it represents a good entry point for investors it s easier to be contrarian says fegley who mentioned chinese oil firm cnooc ceo an adr with a 4 4 yield if you want to look at high yield you re going to find most of them in emerging markets anyway fegley says and if you want to limit some of the forex volatility then energy stocks are better than financials you just might not find 5 yield 2015 bloomberg finance lp investors who are feeling particularly frisky and fearless can check out russian oil firm gazprom their london listed shares yield 5 26 gazprom is one of the biggest natural gas producers and exporters in the world the only problem is that its business faces sanctions and a worst case scenario of its securities being banned from trading in the u s italy s eni spa is a bit safer its dividend yield is a high 5 47 the stock is also up 10 over the last 12 months meanwhile ftse europe is down by the same amount could they innoculate themselves from a continually unfolding eu political crisis it s really hard to predict that says zhang we are bottom up so what we try to do is own businesses that will do well in either situation he says of euro zone breakups and brexit and china trade wars high quality businesses have been around for decades they know how to navigate crisis he says five percent yield or less the best companies are always thinking ahead they are positioning their company to gain market share when things turn sour he says i m buying the companies that can do that and if they pay a high dividend it s just a bonus for your investors
a small business investment company sbic is a privately owned and operated company that makes long term investments in american small businesses and is licensed by the united states small business administration sba the principal reason for a firm to become licensed as an sbic is access to financing leverage provided by sba in addition banks and federal savings associations as well as their holding companies have the ability to own or to invest in sbics and thereby to own indirectly more than 5 percent of the voting stock of a small business 1 and can receive community reinvestment act credit for sbic investments banks and their holding companies are permitted to invest in sbics under the regulations implementing the volcker rule pursuant to the dodd frank act they also receive exemptions from certain capital charge regulations and lending affiliation rules under the gramm leach bliley act a business seeking a u s government contract that is a set aside for small businesses does not lose its status as a small business by reason of a control investment by an sbic many business development companies bdcs also have formed sbic subsidiaries as part of their business strategies this document provides a summary description of the sbic debenture program sba leverage in the form of debentures and a general overview of sba regulations and policies applicable to debenture sbics the u s small business administration sba administers the sbic program through its investment division which employs approximately 80 people sba is an independent federal agency located at 409 third street sw washington dc 20006 202 205 6510 useful information about the sbic program is available on sba s website at www sba gov inv or may be obtained by contacting samuel j boyd jr 202 205 7546 sbia the sbic industry is served by an active trade association the small business investor alliance sbia which is located at 1100 h street nw suite 1200 washington dc 20005 202 628 5055 www sbia org sbia s president is brett palmer harry haskins the long term senior career sba manager of the sbic program is sbia s director of sbic relations sbia provides a variety of information and services to its members and represents the industry with sba and on capitol hill sbia publishes regular updates and is a resource for information concerning the sbic program development of sbic program established by the united states congress in 1958 to stimulate long term investment in american small businesses the sbic program has evolved into a significant factor in financing smaller american businesses from the sbic program s inception to december 31 2018 sbics have provided approximately 97 6 billion of funding in more than 181 185 financings to businesses 2 including well known companies such as amgen apple computer costco federal express intel tesla and whole foods 3 the sbic program has undergone significant changes since its creation in 1958 the original program permitted only debenture leverage the small business equity enhancement act of 1992 drastically changed the sbic program it created a new form of sba leverage known as participating securities essentially preferred limited partnership interests in an sbic increased the amount of leverage available to an sbic to 90 million which subsequently was indexed to reflect changes in the cost of living since march 31 1993 and then modified in 2009 to be 150 million and again in 2018 to be 175 million required minimum private capital of 10 million for sbics using participating securities and 5 million for sbics using debentures provided for stricter sba licensing standards and enacted other changes to make the program more consistent with the private venture capital industry unlike the debenture program where sba is a creditor of the sbic which requires an sbic to make periodic interest payments the participating securities program required an sbic to pay sba a prioritized payment preferred return and a profit share when the sbic realized profits as a consequence the participating securities program was designed to permit investing in equity securities whether or not those securities had a current pay component this new program resulted in a large expansion of the number of sbic licenses granted following the burst of the technology bubble in 2002 the administration decided there no longer was a need for an equity sbic program and that the existing participating securities program would cause significant losses to sba accordingly sba decided to terminate the participating securities program and announced that beginning on october 1 2004 it would not issue commitments to use participating securities leverage or license new sbics using that leverage sba officials continue to emphasize that they believe the debenture program is working well and they want to expand it the governing law and regulations for the debenture program have undergone several revisions since 1994 that have further streamlined and improved the sbic program sba has continued its outreach to institutional investors bank regulators and prospective applicants in order to enlarge the existing debenture program and to create ways for sbics to make certain kinds of equity investments without undermining the financial integrity of the debenture program as of september 30 2018 4 there were 305 licensed sbics with approximately 15 8 billion of private capital and 10 9 billion of outstanding sba leverage of which 10 8 billion is debenture leverage and 18 million is participating securities leverage of these sbics 227 use debentures 25 use participating securities 47 do not use leverage and six are specialized sbics during the 2018 federal fiscal year october 1 september 30 federal fy ended september 30 2018 sba licensed a total of 25 sbics with approximately 1 2 billion of private capital of those 21 were debenture sbics and four were unleveraged sbics sba leverage sba currently provides financing called leverage to sbics in the form of debentures sbic s borrow leverage by issuing debentures debentures are unsecured ten year loans issued by the sbic that have interest only payable semi annually most debentures bear a temporary interest rate based on libor until they are pooled and sold to the public the interest rate excluding the annual sba charge described below on these debentures is fixed when the sba pools debentures from various sbics and sells them to the public with the pooled debentures having a 10 year maturity from the sale date the interest rate recently has been between 33 8 and 65 9 basis points in excess of the interest rate on treasury notes with 10 year maturities the treasury note rate in the most recent march 2019 pooling the interest rate was 3 113 percent excluding the annual sba charge described below this interest rate represented a 0 513 percent premium to the treasury note rate and reflected a decrease from the 3 548 percent excluding the annual sba charge described below rate set in the september 2018 pooling as of september 30 2018 there were 10 8 billion of debentures outstanding plus 3 4 billion of undrawn commitments to issue debentures lmi and energy saving debentures more than a decade ago sba created lmi debentures for use by sbics making equity investments in low and moderate income zones lmi zones or in companies with significant numbers of employees in lmi zones that are more fully described below under the heading lmi debentures in addition on april 19 2012 sba published final regulations authorizing a limited amount of so called energy saving debentures which would enable sbics licensed after 2008 to acquire equity securities in energy saving qualified investments using debentures no energy saving debentures have been issued early stage sbic initiative on january 31 2011 the administration announced its start up america initiative which among other things had as its purpose to promote high growth entrepreneurship across the country with new programs to help encourage private sector investment in startups and small firms as part of this initiative the sba published final regulations on april 27 2012 that established a new type of sbic called an early stage sbic by their own terms these regulations provided that the early stage program would terminate on september 30 2016 on september 19 2016 sba published a notice of proposed rulemaking which proposed various changes to the early stage program the proposed rule reflected sba s intent to continue licensing and providing sba guaranteed leverage to early stage sbics beyond the initial five year term previously announced and proposed regulatory changes however on september 28 2017 sba announced that it was not going to renew the early stage program or finalize the proposed rule in its memorandum announcing the non renewal of the early stage program sba encouraged venture capital fund managers to apply for a license as a non leveraged sbic i e an sbic that does not utilize sba debenture leverage 5 sba licensed only five early stage sbic s during the early stage program s existence sba is no longer issuing leverage commitments to these early stage sbics however they may continue to draw on their existing leverage commitments subject to sba regulations and policies impact investment program as part of the start up american program the sba also approved the creation of an impact investment fund program and set aside an aggregate of 1 billion of debenture leverage to be distributed over five years beginning with federal fy 2011 on september 25 2014 sba announced policy changes for this program including an extension of the program past the original five year period and an intention to commit on average 200 million per year to impact sbics on february 2 2016 sba published a proposed rule which would create a new class of sbic s called impact sbics however on september 28 2017 sba announced the termination of the impact investment program in its memorandum terminating the impact investment program sba stated that although it is terminating the impact investment program it remains committed to licensing qualified applicants which intend to finance small businesses located in underserved arears or employ an investment strategy focused on social environmental and or economic impact accordingly since november 1 2017 sba has not accepted management assessment questionnaires for applicants seeking to be licensed under the impact investment program fund managers who submitted management assessment questionnaires before september 28 2017 were given an opportunity to convert to a standard sbic applicant by providing written notice to sba no later than october 28 2017 fund managers with existing green light letters from sba authorizing them to submit an application for an sbic under the impact investment program are permitted to submit the license application consistent with the requirements contained in the green light letter if any such manager is approved as an impact sbic then it must operate under the impact sbic policy guidance under which it is licensed licensed sbics that are operating under the impact investment fund program are required to continue operations under the impact sbic policy guidance under which they were licensed and if they were approved to issue debentures sba will continue its practice of approving leverage commitments and draws based upon sba s regulations and credit policies that are applicable to all sbics business development companies a significant number of the publicly traded bdcs have sbic subsidiaries using debentures a bdc owned sbic is generally able to use up to 175 million of debentures on a 2 1 ratio to the amount of capital contributed to the sbic bdcs also may form more than one sbic and thereby use up to 350 million of debentures at one time formation of a second sbic is subject to sba policies that generally apply to the formation of second funds requiring successful operations of the first fund for at least two years among other requirements sbic subsidiaries of bdcs like other sbics are required to have a limited life typically with a five year investment period followed by a five year harvest period and may not be formed with perpetual existence reserving and drawing leverage sbics obtain leverage by reserving a leverage commitment and then drawing down leverage that commitment leverage commitments may be obtained at the time of licensing for an amount up to one tier6 of leverage subject to availability and thereafter as needed for an amount of up to two tiers of leverage 7 but not more than twice in any federal fy when a leverage commitment is issued the sbic pays a one time commitment fee that is 1 percent of the amount of the leverage commitment a leverage commitment expires on september 30 of the fourth federal fy following the fiscal year of its issuance sbics may apply twice each month to draw down leverage commitments sba s approval of a draw request is good for 58 days and an sba can make a draw against the approval on one day s notice a newly licensed sbic is permitted to draw only one half tier of leverage before sba s first regulatory examination generally 6 10 months after licensure debentures that will be pooled use an interim credit facility provided by the federal home loan bank of chicago at the time of each disbursement for these pooled debentures fees totaling 2 425 percent are deducted from the amount the sbic receives a 2 percent user fee payable to sba 37 5 basis points of underwriting fees and 5 basis points as an administrative fee to the selling agent the sbic pays an interim interest rate on debenture leverage of libor plus 30 basis points and the amount of sba s charge described below in march and september of each year all debenture leverage issued since the prior pooling is pooled by sba and sold to the public in the form of trust certificates and a new interest rate for all such debenture leverage is established and fixed until the leverage is repaid typical use of leverage a management team may hold a closing and form its fund at any time before or after it files its formal sbic application 8 however it may not obtain leverage until it receives its license a process that currently is taking about 6 12 months from the date that sba accepts a filed license application for processing 9 after the license application is accepted by sba for processing many applicants draw their private capital to pay organization expenses and management fees and to make investments in any event an sbic is required to have drawn at least 2 5 million of private investors capital prior to licensing once licensed most sbics fund their operations solely by using sba leverage until the ratio of outstanding leverage to paid in capital from private investors called leverageable capital reaches two to one and they then coordinate capital calls from private investors with the use of leverage to maintain a two to one leverage to drawn private capital ratio 10 sbics are permitted to borrow money from banks or other unaffiliated third parties prior to their initial leverage but sba requires such borrowings to be repaid when leverage is first drawn leverage availability a single sbic may use up to 175 million of debentures and the total amount of debentures that may be outstanding among a group of commonly controlled sbics is limited to an aggregate of 350 million 11 the amount of leverage commitments available to an sbic is its regulatory capital multiplied by the tiers of leverage that sba has approved for the sbic sba obtains funds enabling it to supply leverage for pooled debentures by guarantying payment of trust certificates that are purchased by traditional purchasers of government guaranteed notes sba then invests the proceeds in sbics in the form of debentures sba guaranteed trust certificates for debentures are sold in march and september of each year sba obtains funds enabling it to supply leverage for debentures that are not pooled including lmi debentures and early stage sbic debentures by guarantying loans made by the federal home loan bank of chicago the amount of leverage commitments that may be issued each year is subject to the amount authorized by congress in recent years congress has enacted authorized levels in three year cycles for federal fy 2019 4 billion of leverage commitments is expected to be available leverage commitments issued by sba each year have been well below the amounts authorized by congress during the past five 5 federal fys sba issued a total of 12 098 billion of leverage commitments as shown in the following chart federal fy leverage commitments issued by sba 2014 2 549 billion 2015 2 553 billion 2016 2 514 billion 2017 1 960 billion 2018 2 522 billion sbics

2016 2 158 billion 2017 1 902 billion 2018 2 119 billion the trust certificates representing an interest in the pooled debentures are sold with the assistance of investment bankers who receive a 37 5 basis point fee to institutional purchasers of government guaranteed fixed rate notes with 10 year maturities the interest rate on trust certificates is a premium over the 10 year treasury note rate the premium has been as high as 2 273 percent in the pooling in september 2008 since then the premium has decreased dramatically and during the last five years has been less than 1 percent the premium

annual congressional appropriation of an amount necessary to cover anticipated losses on the leverage issued thus the amount of congressional appropriation and the rate of loss anticipated on the issued leverage referred to as the subsidy rate determined the actual amount of leverage that would be available each year this typically resulted in significantly less leverage being available than the level authorized by congress beginning on september 1 1996 sba charged a 1 00 percent annual charge on leverage it provided to sbics causing significant reductions in required congressional appropriations needed to support increasing amounts of available leverage the amount of the charge is determined in the fiscal year in which a leverage commitment is issued and applies to all leverage issued pursuant to that commitment the subsidy rate was substantially reduced in the case of debentures to less than 1 00 percent with the result that no appropriations were required to support their issuance beginning in federal fy 2000 in december 2000 legislation was enacted requiring sba to set the amount of the charge it imposed on commitments issued each fiscal year at the rate necessary so that the sum of all fees charged including 1 percent commitment fees 2 percent user fees the annual charge and anticipated profit distributions would equal the amount of anticipated losses the charge for leverage commitments issued between federal fy 2006 and federal fy 2018 varied from a low of 0 285 percent for federal fy 2010 to a high of 0 94 percent for federal fy 2006 the charge for leverage commitments issued in federal fys 2014 2015 2016 2017 and 2018 was 0 355 percent 0 742 percent 0 672 percent 0 374 percent and 0 222 percent respectively the charge for leverage commitments issued during federal fy 2019 is 0 094 percent an all time low sba s website contains historical information concerning the sbic program including the amount and pricing of leverage committed and issued since the sbic program was restructured in 1994 summary of calculation of interest rate charged on conventional pooled debentures the rate of interest payable by a conventional sbic on pooled debentures is the sum of the following 1 the interest rate of treasury notes with 10 year maturities at the time the trust certificates are pooled and sold 2 the premium required by the purchasers of the trust certificates above the 10 year treasury note rate and 3 the annual charge payable to sba at the rate applicable in the fiscal year in which the commitment was issued thus for example the interest rate for debentures issued in the march 2019 pooling pursuant to a leverage commitment issued during federal fy 2018 was 2 600 10 year treasury rate 0 513 premium required by trust certificate purchasers 3 113 trust certificate rate 0 222 sba charge for debenture commitment issued in federal fy 2018 3 335 total interest rate repayment of debenture leverage debentures that have 10 year maturities from the date of pooling are not amortized prior to maturity and bear interest payable semi annually 12 debentures are unsecured and the general partner of the sbic is generally not liable for their repayment beginning with the september 2006 issuance debentures may be prepaid without penalty but a debenture must be repaid in whole repayment of debentures is subordinate to repayment of loans from non associate lenders up to the lesser of 10 million or twice the amount of the sbic s regulatory capital 13 sba is able to issue debentures with maturities shorter than 10 years but has not done so since 1991 unrelated business taxable income exemption prior to october 2004 certain tax exempt entities that invested in sbics were subject to recognition of unrelated business taxable income ubti as a result of the issuance of debentures tax legislation adopted in october 2004 exempts tax exempt investors from ubti that otherwise would be caused by the issuance of debentures by sbics licensed after enactment of the legislation but only if no tax exempt investor other than a governmental unit owns more than 25 percent of the capital or profits interest of the sbic and all tax exempt investors including governmental units other than any agency or instrumentality of the united states own less than 50 percent of the capital and profits interest of the sbic distributions by debenture sbics an sbic using debentures makes distributions among its partners as provided in the sbic s limited partnership or operating agreement the sources of those distributions are limited as follows 1 distributions from positive retained earnings available for distribution so called read an sbic has read if it has positive net realized cumulative retained earnings that is the cumulative earnings after all expenses and realized and unrealized depreciation of investments have been deducted an sbic may distribute an amount equal to read prior to repayment of its outstanding debentures note that sba determines whether distributions have been made in excess of read as of the end of each calendar year 2 in addition to distributions from read described in paragraph one except as provided in paragraph three below until all debentures have been repaid in full an sbic may make distributions in any calendar year up to two percent of its regulatory capital 14 3 after an sbic has substantially completed making new investments it generally files a wind up plan with sba if sba feels secure about repayment of outstanding debentures sba may permit some repayment of regulatory capital prior to the repayment in full of all outstanding debentures sba generally only gives that approval when the sbic has previously made significant repayments of debentures the remaining portfolio is performing well and sba feels reasonably well assured that outstanding debentures will be repaid in full with respect to funds available for distribution an sbic will seek to negotiate with sba the proportion of those funds that will be used to repay debentures and to make distributions constituting a return of regulatory capital while sometimes this proportion is 1 1 an sbic cannot reliably predict what arrangement if any sba may be willing to accept sbics are permitted to make distributions before the end of a fiscal year in situations where an sbic made a distribution mid year from read that then existed but at the end of the year the sbic did not have read for the year for example if the sbic wrote off an investment after mid year sba has taken the position that the sbic s distribution was improper and that event of default occurred under the debenture leverage in such a case the sbic would be given a specified period of time to cure the default not less than fifteen days the failure to cure could result in sba declaring all debentures immediately due and payable and seeking the appointment of sba or its designee as a receiver unlike conventional debentures which are permitted to make distributions to its investors from read before debentures are repaid an early stage sbic must make distributions to sba concurrently with the making of any distributions to its investors the amount that an early stage sbic must distribute to sba is determined by a formula based on the degree of capital impairment 15 a leverage ratio and amounts previously distributed to sba just in time financing the sbic program permits the funds from investors and sba leverage to be taken down by the partnership in lock step thereby delaying investor capital calls and potentially increasing investor returns an sbic using debentures is required to have total regulatory capital of at least 5 million 20 million in the case of an early stage sbic 16 however sba requires an sbic applicant to have firm commitments when it files its formal license application in an amount equal to the amount of capital that is sufficient to enable the applicant to have a first closing and conduct its operations even if does not subsequently raise additional funds generally at least 20 25 million while an applicant needs to have binding subscriptions for the full amount of its regulatory capital only 2 5 million of the sbic s regulatory capital needs to be paid in prior to issuance of the sbic license 17 lmi debentures on september 30 1999 sba adopted regulations providing incentives for sbics to invest in low and moderate income zones lmi zones an lmi zone is a geographic area that satisfies one of five definitions that currently are used by different federal agencies in determining areas requiring special attention debenture sbics also may use lmi debentures highlights of the regulations are as follows sbics making venture capital type investments equity or certain subordinated loans in small businesses with 50 percent or more of its employees or tangible assets in an lmi zone or to a small business that has 35 percent of its employees residing in an lmi zone will be eligible to obtain sba financing in the form of a deferred interest debenture sba intends to issue non amortizing debentures with maturities of 5 or 10 years each with a zero coupon for the first five years if the interest rate is 5 percent this means that the sbic would receive approximately 75 000 in proceeds for issuing a 100 000 debenture on the 10 year debentures interest would be payable semi annually commencing in the sixth year the small business financed by the sbic must either satisfy the employee or asset test described above at the time of applying to the sbic for financing or within 180 days after the closing of the financing lmi debentures will be issuable to sbics that have reserved debenture leverage at the time of making a draw request the sbic specifies whether it will use an lmi debenture or a regular debenture the interest rate for the lmi debenture is fixed when it is initially issued for its full term lmi debentures will be held by the federal home loan bank of chicago and are not pooled in the same manner as other leverage community reinvestment act credit current community reinvestment act cra regulations present banks other than certain small banks with a continuing need to make investments that qualify for cra purposes investment in an sbic is specifically identified in the cra regulations as a type of investment that will be presumed by the regulatory agencies to be a qualified investment for cra purposes the investment should be in an sbic that is located in or doing substantial business in the region in which the bank s assessment area is located but the sbic is not required to be headquartered within the assessment area itself the sbic act and other federal statutes explicitly permit banks bank holding companies federal savings associations and savings and loan holding companies to invest in sbics gramm leach bliley and dodd frank act exemptions as part of the implementation of the gramm leach bliley act the glb act effective april 1 2002 the federal reserve board the fdic and the office of the comptroller of the currency adopted new regulations governing regulatory capital treatment for certain equity investments held by banks bank holding companies and financial holding companies under the regulations an 8 percent tier 1 capital deduction applies on covered investments that in the aggregate are less than 15 percent of an organization s tier 1 capital a 12 percent deduction applies to investments aggregating 15 24 99 percent of tier 1 capital and a 25 percent deduction applies to investments aggregating 25 percent and above of tier 1 capital the regulations exempt sbic investments from such capital charges so long as their value is less than 15 percent of tier 1 capital however the amount of sbic investments will be considered when determining capital charges with respect to other investments these rules however may be affected by contemplated changes to bank capital requirements to conform to the basel iii accords in addition ownership of a 15 percent equity interest in a portfolio company by a bank affiliated sbic will not give rise to a presumption that the portfolio company is an affiliate under sections 23 a and b of the glb act the dodd frank act generally prohibits a banking entity from acquiring or retaining any equity partnership or other ownership interest in or sponsoring a private equity fund in addition non bank financial companies that engage in proprietary trading or ownership or sponsorship of a private equity fund may be subject to additional capital and quantitative limits these prohibitions are not applicable to investments in sbics the final regulations implementing the volcker rule under the dodd frank act permit banking entities to invest in licensed sbics as well as in funds that have received permission from sba to file an sbic license application and to sponsor sbics investment advisers act exemption an adviser that solely advises sbics an entity that has received a green light letter authorizing it to submit a formal sbic license application to sba and an applicant that is affiliated with one or more sbics and that has applied for another sbic license are expressly exempted from the dodd frank act amendments to the investment advisers act of 1940 the advisers act which generally require advisers to certain types of private funds to register with the securities and exchange commission or to become exempt reporting advisers the sbic advisers relief act which became law on december 4 2015 provides certain additional relief for investment advisers that advise private funds and sbics and for investment advisers that advise venture funds and sbics before the enactment of the sbic advisers relief act only advisers solely to private funds that had assets under management in the united states of less than 150 million could rely upon the so called private fund adviser exemption from the advisers act s investment adviser registration requirements also prior to the enactment of the sbic advisers relief act only advisers solely to one or more venture capital funds as defined by the sec could rely upon the so called venture capital fund adviser exemption from the advisers act s investment adviser registration requirements the sbic advisers relief act revised the private fund adviser exemption by excluding sbic assets from counting towards the 150 million threshold for purposes of determining whether an investment adviser satisfies the conditions for the private fund adviser exemption and by deeming sbics to be venture capital funds for purposes of the venture capital fund adviser exemption sbic investments an sbic can only invest in small businesses and must invest at least 25 percent of its invested funds in smaller enterprises 18 sba regulations define a small business as a company with tangible net worth total net worth less goodwill of less than 19 56 million and average after tax income exclusive of loss carry forwards for the prior 2 years of less than 6 5 million a company failing that test can still qualify as a small business if it meets the size standards for its industry group under an alternative test the size standards for industry groups under this alternative test are based on the number of employees typically 500 to 1 000 for a manufacturing company or gross revenues 19 a smaller enterprise is a company with a net worth excluding goodwill of less than 6 million and average after tax income for the prior two years of less than 2 million or which meets the alternative test importantly in making a determination under the size test and the alternative test the company and all affiliates of the company must be considered companies are affiliates of each other if one controls or has the power to control the other or a third party or parties control or have the power to control both sbics and private funds exempted from registration under certain sections of the investment company act of 1940 are not considered affiliates of a company for purposes of determining whether that company qualifies as a small business or a smaller enterprise certain debt to equity ratios must also be met if an sbic finances the change of ownership of a small business with more than 500 employees sbic regulations restrict the amount that an sbic is permitted to invest in any company and its affiliates the so called overline limit the stimulus legislation of 2009 changed the overline limit from 20 percent of regulatory capital to 10 percent of the sum of regulatory capital20 and the total amount of leverage that is projected to be used by the sbic in its business plan that was approved at the time its sbic s license was granted i e 30 percent of regulatory capital if regulatory capital is 75 million or less and the regulatory capital is proposed to be fully leveraged with two tiers of leverage by way of example if an sbic has regulatory capital of 25 million it may not invest more than 7 5 million in a single company without sba s approval assuming the sbic was approved for two tiers of leverage at the time it was licensed as an sbic sba may approve a larger percentage if necessary to protect the sbic s investment but has indicated it will give such consent only in unusual circumstances sbic regulations preclude investment in the following types of businesses companies whose principal business is re lending or re investing venture capital firms leasing companies factors banks many kinds of real estate projects single purpose projects that are not continuing businesses companies that will use the proceeds outside of the united states or have more than 49 percent of their tangible assets or employees outside the united states at the time of financing or within one year following the financing unless the funding is used for a specific u s purpose that is acceptable to sba businesses that are passive and do not carry on an active trade or business and businesses that use 50 percent or more of the funds to buy goods or services from an associated supplier historically sba regulations prevented an sbic or two or more sbics acting together and its associates controlled or related persons from controlling a small business except on a temporary basis to protect its investment or if the small business was a start up in december 2000 legislation was enacted eliminating the legislative basis for regulating control during the investment period effective november 21 2002 sba adopted final regulations permitting an sbic and its associates to control a small business for up to seven years and with sba s consent for a longer period to permit an orderly sale of the investment or to ensure the financial stability of the small business sbics are precluded from making investments in a small business if it would give rise to a conflict of interest generally a conflict of interest may arise if an associate21 of the sbic has or makes an investment in the small business or serves as one of its officers or directors or would otherwise benefit from the financing investing in an associate generally requires prior sba approval unless an exception applies joint investing with an associate such as another fund controlled by affiliates of the general partner may be made on the same terms and conditions and at the same time or on terms that are fair to the sbic terms of portfolio company financings an sbic may make investments in the form of debt with no equity features loans debt with equity features debt securities or stock rights to acquire stock and interests in limited partnerships limited liability companies and joint ventures equity securities investments must be made for a term of not less than one year except for bridge loans in anticipation of a permanent financing in which the sbic intends to participate or to protect the sbic s prior investment loans and debt securities must have amortization not exceeding straight line the permissible interest rate depends on the type of debt for straight loans the maximum permitted rate is the higher of i 19 percent or ii 11 percent over the higher of the sbic s weighted cost of debenture leverage or the current debenture rate for debt securities the maximum permitted rate is the higher of i 14 percent or ii 6 percent over the higher of the sbic s weighted cost of debenture leverage or the current debenture rate regulations define an sbic s weighted cost of debenture leverage and describe the maximum permitted rate when more than one sbic participates in the financing the applicable interest rate is calculated adding in all points fees discounts and other costs of money other than i application fees of up to 1 percent of the proposed financing and closing fees of up to 4 percent of the financing if it is a debt security or 2 percent for loans ii permitted prepayment penalties and iii reasonable monitoring expenses each of which may be charged in addition to the permitted interest in addition an sbic may be reimbursed for its reasonable closing costs including legal fees in addition sbics may structure financings to receive a royalty based upon the improvement in the performance of a portfolio company after the financing an sbic may also charge a default rate of interest of up to 7 percent and a royalty based on improvement in the performance of a portfolio company after the financing an sbic is permitted to require a small business to redeem equity securities but only after one year and only for a price equal to either i the purchase price or ii a price determined at the time of redemption based on a a reasonable formula that reflects the performance of the company e g based on the book value or earnings or b fair market value determined by a professional third party appraiser mandatory redemptions not complying with these requirements will result in the investment being treated as a debt security subject to the interest restrictions described above however the small business can be required to redeem the sbic s equity security earlier than one year after its issuance if the small business has a public offering has a change of control or management or defaults under its investment agreement an sbic is permitted to retain its investment in a business that ceases to be a small business and is permitted to continue to invest in such a large business until the company has a public offering following a public offering the sbic is permitted to exercise rights to acquire securities that were obtained prior to the public offering if within one year of the initial financing by an sbic a portfolio company changes its business to one in which an sbic is prohibited from investing then the sbic must divest itself of the investment absent sba s approval to retain the investment sbic operations sba has adopted a number of regulations and policies concerning operating requirements of sbics intended to assure their proper management principal regulations and policies include an sbic using leverage must invest its idle funds not invested in small businesses in liquid safe short term investments specified in the regulations principally u s government obligations repurchase obligations with federally insured institutions with a maturity of 7 days or less and whose underlying securities are direct u s government obligations federally insured deposits and deposits in well capitalized federally insured financial institutions an sbic and its associates may provide management services to small businesses in which the sbic invests but only may charge for services at competitive rates for services actually rendered sba requires that leveraged sbics applying for a license after april 1 2004 must credit 100 percent of such fees if not paid to the sbic against the management fee otherwise payable by the sbic to the management team except for placement fees paid to associated licensed broker dealers sbics are required to value their assets annually semi annually if leverage is used pursuant to valuation guidelines approved by sba sba has issued model valuation guidelines that are similar to those customarily used by venture capital firms but do not conform with generally accepted accounting principles an sbic s ability to borrow funds from third parties is subject to sba regulation sbics may only incur unsecured debt sbics are required to file a variety of reports with sba none of which generally are considered burdensome these reports include an annual financial statement which is certified to by the sbic s independent certified public accountants and contains information concerning each portfolio company valuation reports as described above capital certificates reporting among other things changes in regulatory capital and leverageable capital reports as to changes in the sbic s management material litigation a brief report describing each investment and copies of reports sent to investors and if applicable to the sec sba will conduct regulatory examinations of each sbic on an annual basis a key regulatory metric for sba is the extent of capital impairment which is the extent of realized and in certain circumstances net unrealized losses of an sbic compared with the sbic s regulatory capital interest payments management fees organization and other expenses are included in determining realized losses sba regulations preclude the full amount of unrealized appreciation in the value of an sbic s portfolio investments from being considered when calculating capital impairment in certain circumstances if an sbic issues leverage it will be required to avoid capital impairment capital impairment will be considered to exist if the sbic s capital impairment ratio calculated by adding the sbic s realized losses and net unrealized depreciation22 and dividing the result by the sbic s private capital exceeds permitted levels detailed in the regulations and which vary depending on the proportion of equity investments made by the sbic and the ratio of outstanding leverage to leverageable capital sba has certain rights and remedies if the sbic violates sba regulations which include being in a condition of capital impairment remedies for regulatory violations are graduated in severity depending on the seriousness of capital impairment or other regulatory violation for minor regulatory infractions warnings are given for serious infractions the use of debentures may be limited or prohibited outstanding debentures may be declared to be immediately due and payable restrictions on distributions and making new investments may be imposed management fees may be required to be reduced and investors may be required to pay their unfunded capital commitments to the sbic in severe cases sba may require the limited partners to remove the partnership s general partner or manager or its officers directors managers or partners or sba may obtain appointment of a receiver for the partnership organization sbics are organized under state law as corporations limited partnerships or limited liability companies sba strongly encourages debenture sbics to be organized as limited partnerships investors investors may be either domestic or foreign individuals or entities the sbic act specifically authorizes banks and federal savings associations to invest up to 5 percent of their capital and surplus in sbics certain investors owning 33 percent or more of an sbic are required to submit certain background information to sba and are subject to sba s fingerprinting requirements all investors in an sbic and anyone owning 10 percent or more of any investor owning 10 percent of an sbic must be identified to sba in the sbic s license application diversity of ownership sba has regulations and policies designed to assure that leveraged sbics receive significant investments from investors who do not participate in or otherwise control the sbic s management additionally a leveraged sbic must receive at least 30 percent of its private capital from a total of three or more investors who are unrelated to the management and who are not affiliated with one another or from a single such investor meeting certain limited qualifications such as a bank insurance company or certain publicly traded corporations no single investor together with its affiliates may own more than 70 percent of a leveraged sbic s private capital restrictions on transfer investors in an sbic may not transfer their interests without sba s prior consent additionally as a condition to providing leverage to the sbic sba presently requires investors owning 50 percent or more of an sbic that uses leverage as well as the sbic s managers and other control persons to enter into a written agreement with sba providing for personal liability for repayment of leverage for directly or indirectly participating in a change of control of an sbic without sba s prior consent additionally without sba s consent an sbic may not release any of its investors from the liability to make the full amount of their capital contribution management fee management fees paid by sbics using leverage are subject to sba s prior approval leveraged sbics that submit license applications from and after april 1 2004 and that intend to use leverage are permitted to charge an annual management fee of up to 2 5 percent of the sum of i the amount of its regulatory capital adding back certain distributions made which reduce regulatory capital and ii the amount of debenture leverage the sbic plans to use that is approved by sba for five years and thereafter 2 5 percent of the cost basis of loans and investments in active portfolio companies however if the base on which the fee is calculated exceeds 60 million the permissible rate declines to 2 percent when the base is 120 million or more sba policies require that management fees for leveraged sbics be reduced by 100 percent of consulting board and other fees received from portfolio companies by affiliates of the sbic s general partner except for fees paid to licensed broker dealers sba only permits increases in regulatory capital to create a prospective entitlement to increased management fees i e the increased level of management fees only may be charged from the beginning of the calendar quarter in which the regulatory capital is increased not the date of the initial closing sba s policies concerning management fees are quite detailed and are set forth in tech note 7a 23 licensing sba uses a two step licensing process for first time sbics in the first phase an applicant completes and submits to sba a form entitled management assessment questionnaire maq an applicant must pay a non refundable fee of 10 000 at the time it submits the maq 24 the maq contains the elements of the applicant s business plan as well as detailed information concerning the experience of each of the principals to carry out the business plan sba generally requires that at least two substantially full time principals have at least five years of successful investment experience at a decision making level in the types of investments the applicant is proposing to make generally each individual s track record should include at least 10 15 investments with a reasonable number of complete realizations during the last ten years and preferably including some that are quite recent sba also considers how long and in what ways the management team has worked together sba views the track record of the principals and the cohesiveness of the key principals as being fundamentally important additionally sba is concerned about the internal management of the sbic they prefer a team composed of three to five principals although as few as two and as many as six also are acceptable however sba does not want dominance by a single principal over investment and other management decisions including personnel matters they do not want to license a one man band sba looks at the division of the sbic s carried interest to evaluate relationships they have an informal rule that no principal may own 50 percent or more of the carried interest unless there are only two principals and they each have 50 percent the maq is then reviewed by sba s investment committee after which the principals if appearing qualified are invited to meet with the members of the investment committee after the meeting with the applicant s principals sba s investment committee may turn the application down or issue a green light letter indicating that the applicant has passed the first part of the application process and now is authorized to file a formal application at the present time a green light letter usually is issued three to four months following submission of the maq and immediately after the interview an applicant that receives a green light letter must file its formal license application not more than 18 months after the date of that letter applicants must pay sba an additional non refundable license application fee of 20 000 at the time they submit their formal application for an sbic license 25 after receipt of the green light letter and obtaining commitments for at least the minimum required regulatory capital from investors satisfying the diversity requirement the applicant files a formal application which contains additional information about the applicant and the management team as well as the applicant s and its general partner s or manager s organizational applicant documents although the regulations require a debenture sbic to have at least 5 million of regulatory capital sba generally requires an sbic to have firm commitments when its formal license application is filed for an amount of capital that is sufficient to enable the sbic to have a first closing and conduct its operations even if it does not subsequently raise additional funds depending on the projected size of the sbic sba could require 20 25 million of private commitments or more at the time the application is filed during the formal licensing process sba seeks to determine that there is a qualified management team and that the sbic has a good chance of operating profitably sba reviews the applicant s business plan projections and organizational documents and conducts reference and other background checks including litigation searches and an fbi fingerprint check on the management team the process presently is taking approximately 6 12 months sba requires applicants to advise their investors that the investors are not entitled to rely on sba s review of the applicant in deciding whether to invest after a license application is filed and accepted for processing by sba an applicant may make pre licensing investments which will be included in the applicant s regulatory capital if they are submitted to and approved by sba prior to the investment being made sba requires 10 business days to review such pre licensing investments but approvals frequently take longer sba does not determine the quality or wisdom of the investment rather sba simply seeks to determine if the investment is made in compliance with sba regulations once licensed sba pre approval of investments is not required sba requires all principal members of the management team to attend a one day regulations class run by sba and will only permit one pre licensing investment to be made prior to at least one person from applicant attending the class arrangements for attending the regulations class are made by contacting sbia timeline applicants should assume the following timeline for securing a license and leverage management assessment questionnaire 3 6 months formal license approval 6 12 months receipt of leverage following licensing 1 2 months 10 20 months use of more than one half of one tier of leverage following licensing 6 10 months after licensing this timeline assumes the license application is filed immediately upon receipt of the green light letter licensing second funds for second sbic funds sba follows a process that is similar to licensing new funds with one important exception if certain conditions are satisfied instead of filing a maq the process is initiated by submitting a formal written request asking sba to issue a green light letter for the new fund sba now requires the submission of a nonrefundable fee in the same amount that would have been paid had a maq been submitted to utilize this process and avoid writing a new maq to obtain a green light letter there should be substantially the same management team that is pursuing an investment strategy that is substantially similar to that of the existing sbic after submission of a request outlining the proposed new sbic sba s office of operations compares the new fund and the prior fund s similarity of business plan changes in management team track record profitability liquidity and prior sba compliance record and makes a recommendation to the investment committee that in turn makes a decision whether to issue a green light letter for the new fund following receipt of that letter when the new fund has received commitments for the minimum required capital that also satisfies the diversity requirement the fund may submit a formal application for processing under sba policy the prior sbic and the follow on sbic must each agree not to co invest more than 30 percent of its investable capital with the other sbic endnotes 1 this longtime ability of banks federal savings associations and their holdings companies to invest in sbics was preserved in the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act 2 u s small business administration offering circular series sbic 2019 10 a march 12 2019 3 small business administration 2017 sbic update summary 4 sbics that have surrendered their licenses or have been transferred to the office of liquidation are not included in these figures 5 a more detailed description of the non leveraged sbic program is available from pepper hamilton llp 6 a tier is sba jargon for the multiple of an sbic s regulatory capital the sbic may obtain in leverage regulatory capital is an important metric for sbics and is represented by the sum of an sbic s funded commitments from its investors plus unfunded commitments from investors that have sufficient financial means to qualify as institutional investors sba regulations describe the qualifications of institutional investors most forms of business entities with a net worth excluding however unfunded capital commitments from that entity s investors of at least 10 million qualify as institutional investors as do banks or savings and loan associations or their holding companies insurance companies pension plans for private or public sector employees and tax exempt foundations or trusts in each case with a net worth of at least 1 million if an entity institutional investor has a net worth of less than 10 million only that part of its unfunded commitment that is less than 10 percent of its net worth will be included in regulatory capital institutional investors also include individuals with a net worth exclusive of the equity of their most valuable residence of at least 10 million or if the amount committed to the sbic does not exceed 10 percent of their net worth 2 million not more than 33 percent of the sbic s regulatory capital may be invested by state or local government entities that are not pension plans 7 sba permits debenture sbics that are performing well and have seasoned portfolios to use a third tier of leverage in certain limited circumstances see the section below entitled just in time financing 8 see the section below entitled licensing 9 an sbic that makes an investment prior to the acceptance of its license application by sba will not be able to include the amount so invested in the sbic s regulatory capital 10 sba policies however require that an sbic must have invested in portfolio companies at least 50 percent of the private capital that it had drawn prior to receipt of leverage some sbics that have incurred sizeable organization expenses and or management fees prior to making investments have found it necessary to draw more than 2 5 million of private capital in order to comply with this policy additionally debenture funds may draw at a three to one ratio in certain limited circumstances 11 the regulations implementing the new markets venture capital program act of 2000 provide that an sbic may have outstanding leverage in excess of the generally applicable leverage ceiling based on investments in low income geographic areas for sbic s licensed before october 1 2009 the leverage ceiling is calculated without regard to the amount of the cost basis of equity investments in smaller enterprises located in a low income geographic area but only to the extent that such amounts do not exceed 50 percent of the sbic s leverageable capital for sbic s

received the benefit of deductions for these losses in prior years although use of such losses is severely restricted for individuals they may incur phantom income in the year in which such profits

such low rates don t look sustainable in the long term says rbnz governor adrian orr photo file such low rates don t look sustainable in the long term says rbnz governor adrian orr photo file comment two weeks ago the treasury s debt management office got away an issue of six year government bonds at an average yield of 1 82 per cent just 7 basis points above the overnight official cash rate it is only the second time in many decades if ever that government bonds other than inflation indexed ones have been issued at a yield with a 1 in front of the decimal point the other time was in january even 10 year government stock is trading at a yield around 2 1 per cent when delivering the reserve bank s monetary policy statement last month governor adrian orr was asked what the bond market with a yield curve as flat as that was saying about the outlook either they are expecting very very low growth or quite low growth and low inflation he said he went on to say that one of the biggest questions global financial markets were struggling with is where the neutral long run interest rate is now that is the rate that is neither stimulatory nor contractionary but 2 per cent to us feels too low orr said it s not a sustainable long term position in our projection framework so the reserve bank expects nominal bond yields to rise not just here but internationally it could be for a good reason because the market expects sustained real growth and normal inflation levels orr said or they could rise for negative reasons people could wake up one morning and think wow i might not get my money back at these levels of debt he said our projections are the former as it is the market evidently does not see much risk of higher inflation and therefore higher short term interest rates in the near or medium term the swaps curve has a normal shape that is longer maturities command higher interest rates to compensate for the greater risk of holding longer dated securities rather than successive shorter term ones but the incline is pretty gentle by historical standards at the time of writing the one two and three year swap rates are sitting at 1 86 per cent before rising to 2 38 per cent 10 years out currently the curve says the ocr is not going to do much there s not much inflationary pressure said westpac s senior market strategist imre speizer he also points to the information in the yields at which inflation indexed bonds are trading the 2025 inflation linked bond now implies a break even average inflation rate over that period of 0 91 per cent and at the long end a 2040 maturity implies 1 12 per cent speizer said as consumers we might like the sound of such subdued inflation but were it to eventuate it would suggest pretty weak economic growth and a sustained squeeze on firms pricing power the international context to all this is that more than 10 years after the global financial crisis the world is still heavily medicated in terms of monetary policy central banks policy interest rates remain near the emergency levels they were slashed to then by 5 75 percentage points in new zealand s case the only significant exception being the united states longer term rates have trended relentlessly lower and spreads have compressed this is powerful medicine and it has serious side effects a build up of debt inflated asset prices and the mis pricing of risk according to the international monetary fund s global debt database which covers some 190 countries the combined debt of governments corporates and households by the end of 2017 stood at us 184 trillion or a record 225 per cent of global gross domestic product for advanced economies it was 266 per cent of gdp new zealand s debt to gdp ratio was 205 per cent reflecting a relatively low level of government debt but before we get smug about that household debt at 92 per cent of gdp is high by international standards and by historical standards too in 1990 it was 28 per cent of gdp also a high proportion of new zealand s debt a net 52 per cent of gdp was and remains owed to foreign lenders another source of vulnerability we saw that when the crisis hit in 2008 and the offshore credit markets on which we depend and which currently smile upon us threatened to freeze and the government had to put in place a wholesale funding guarantee scheme for the banks in its february statement the reserve bank reflects on some of these international risks in particular that many major economies have limited policy space to respond to future downturns most central banks have policy rates at historically low levels in addition government debt levels are high in many economies limiting the fiscal response to any future downturn high debt levels and elevated asset prices increase the vulnerability of borrowers and debt markets to rising interest rates particularly if driven by a sudden rise in risk spreads the reserve bank warned the rise of leveraged loans in the corporate sector that is loans to highly indebted corporations with minimal creditor protections is a particular concern as such a significant disruption in financial markets or the global growth outlook could have wide reaching effects to be clear the reserve bank is not forecasting global financial crisis ii the sequel but it is clearly right to recognise a risk 10 years into an economic expansion and when global growth is slowing that we get sideswiped again by developments in the other 99 8 per cent of the world economy in that eventuality the current benign pricing we see in the bond market will with hindsight look like myopic complacency so while it is tempting to argue that when the government can borrow so cheaply and there is so much un met need about it should shed the self imposed fiscal straitjacket of its debt target and fill its boots there is a case for guarding the space for fiscal policy to respond to the next shock especially when there are so few bullets left in the bandolier of conventional monetary policy

hybrid metal for its use as a currency and in the industrial application has been hit the hardest in the past three years falling by more than half to below 20 per ounce on average silver is in a

supportive of the federal reserve s pledge to be patient before raising interest rates further this year if the fed is reading the tea leaves the economic brew of data are distinctly on the weak side

washington s trade war with beijing slowing demand overseas and uncertainty over britain s exit from the european union are also hurting economic activity the government reported last week that nonfarm payrolls increased by only 20 000 jobs in february the weakest since september 2017 in part as payback after hefty gains in the prior two months but the unemployment rate dropped two tenths of

conference call participants stephane foucaud â gmp chen lin â lin asset management colin smith â panmure gordon garett ursu â cormark operator good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the valeura fourth quarter 2018 results conference call at this time all lines are in a listen only mode following the presentation we will conduct a question and answer session this call is being recorded on thursday march 14 2019 and i would now like to turn the conference over to sean guest president and ceo please go ahead sean guest thank you operator so my name is sean guest iâ m the president and chief executive officer of valeura joining me here in calgary today are steve bjornson our cfo heather campbell our financial controller and robin martin investor relations manager before getting started iâ d like to draw your attention to our general disclaimer which is provided on our corporate website and in our updated corporate presentation which is on our website and available by link to those of you join to the webcast i would also like to point out the advisories regarding forward looking statements and non gaap measures used in this discussion as of this morning we filed our financial and operating results for q4 2018 as well as our reserves and resource report for the year ended december 31 2018 theyâ re available on sedar and on our website so to get started today iâ ll touch on the highlights from our press release and then hand over to steve who will take you through our financial review after steve iâ ll provide an update on operations and activities and weâ ll then take any questions you might have so starting off 2018 as a whole was a challenging year for turkey given the federal elections followed by the devaluation of the turkish lira and an increase in inflation a lot of volatility q4 in contrast was relatively quieter quarter for turkey from a news flow point of view and with that we saw a recovery of the turkish lira and a period of financial stability as i look back at 2018 though there are two points that i want to make related to turkey first we continue to see a stable and secure operating environment on the ground in northwest turkey we have good relationships with the regulators and government agencies we depend on for permitting and approvals as well as the local communities where we work on a daily basis second while the turkish lira devalued sharply mid year at valeura weâ ve actually seen an increase in our realized gas prices of 37 in 2018 in canadian dollars such that in q4 we realized over 9 these high prices have continued into 2019 and i want to emphasize this again as i believe many of our shareholders are concerned in our ability to realize full value for our gas because the price is set in turkish lira we continue to see the turkish regulator and price authority botas regularly adjusting gas prices so the pricing remains similar to the cost of gas in the european region thatâ s an important relationship as we look forward to the long term value of our gas resource in turkey so touching on a few highlights and is required by the tsx our reserves were evaluated by our auditor d m at year end 2018 we have two peak volumes of nearly 7 4 million barrels equivalent that number is down 6 from the prior year but thatâ s really reflecting our 2008 produced volumes of notice that the value is remaining reserves is up 35 from the prior year given the higher gas prices in turkey and in the region our average production for q4 of 623 barrels equivalent a day was roughly flat compared to q3 2018 but we ended the year at a higher rate of 777 barrels equivalent a day given continued maintenance and work over by our staff in turkey weâ ve been able to roughly maintain this level of production into the start of q1 2019 while weâ re pleased with results from our shallow production our operational focus in 2018 was on appraisal of the deep unconventional play these appraisal activities have continued on plan into 2019 and we continue to be encouraged by what weâ re seeing in all the data acquired to this point we currently have operations ongoing at three deep well sites at the yamalik 1 discovery well we are preparing the well for production logging to increase our understanding of the flow potential of different zones that were originally stimulated in the well at inanli 1 we will be undertaking a diagnostic fracture injectivity test as the first step prior to really finalizing the complete stimulation and testing program and meanwhile at devepinar 1 the appraisal well is drilled to just above the objective cash item section and thereâ s already been clear indications of overpressured gas at the base of the section where weâ ve just drilled on a corporate front we ended the year with 60 million of working capital which is more than we had after our q1 rates and we are progressing towards an additional listing of the company shares in the uk and i will speak more to this in a moment so with that iâ m going to hand over to steve to walk through our financial review steve steve bjornson thanks sean hi everyone financial and operating results for q4 are summarized in the table at pages 2 and 3 of the press release we issued this morning the headline from a finance standpoint is that our balance sheet remains in excellent shape we have no debt and working capital is sitting at 59 5 million in fact our working capital has grown at the close of 2018 from the 55 4 million equity financing in the first quarter of 2018 as we continue planning out the appraisal program iâ m confident that we have sufficient resources to fully fund our portion of spending through the end of 2019 and beyond we are in good financial position remaining costs for the inanli 1 appraisal well namely the completion program are being carried by our partner equinor as part of their farm in agreement iâ m pleased to say that drilling operations which are operated by valeura were concluded on budget and weâ re working hard to keep the completion program on budget too as of devepinar 1 we are now participating according to our working interest share which is 31 5 and so just to reiterate weâ ve got sufficient financing for this and fully financed through the remainder of the capital program for 2019 which includes devepinar 1 drilling completion and testing along with further capital spending for the bcga in 2019 so as sean mentioned our conventional gas production continues with average production of 623 boes a day in q4 which generated revenue of 3 15 million while production was down 5 over the prior quarter revenue was up by 31 reflecting the higher prices we saw in q4 natural gas price realizations were 9 06 per mcf which is by no means is a record for our business in turkey but itâ s in stark contrast to the prevailing prices in north america we have a very valuable business in turkey and i believe the results like this will illustrate it well not surprisingly we achieved strong operating netbacks in the fourth quarter of 32 48 per boe which is 38 higher than in q3 so with that iâ ll hand it back to sean sean guest thanks steve iâ d now like to give a little more color on our current operations and activities by way of reminder our focus is on appraising and derisking our basin centered gas play the way we intend to do this is by one demonstrating that overpressured gas is pervasive across our lands and two we can achieve commercial flow for yamalik we believe there is more that we can learn from the yamalik 1 exploration well and for that reason weâ ve gone back to the well and are currently preparing to log individual intervals that were stimulated by production logging testing what this will tell us is the rates of inflow and specific products on an interval by interval basis we expect the results of that production logging over the next few weeks inanli 1 our first appraisal well which was drilled to nearly 4 900 meters in january encountered a large column of 1 615 meters of high net to gross gas bearing sandstones and we identified at least four intervals of interest worthy of fracking and testing weâ re getting into the initial phase of the completion program now with the dfit near the bottom of the well the dfit test is expected to occur over the next few weeks but i caution our listeners that these data are not on its own exciting but will be used mainly to finalize the selection of equipment and finalize the full completion program which is then expected to start around the end of april based on the data we currently have from inanli 1 we expect to frack at least four zones and this program will continue for a couple of months as we previously announced if we see something interesting from the fracked results we are prepared to test individual zones for longer periods of several weeks and will â wherever possible tests to our existing production infrastructure so that weâ re able to sell the gas to our customers we expect to announce results as and when we have material information to share the next appraisal well devepinar 1 is ongoing those of you whoâ ve been watching our announcements know that this was flooded last month now this well is a big step out from the prior bcga wells approximately 20 kilometers to the west and will really test the extent of the bcga to the western side of the basin itâ s early days for devepinar 1 but drilling is going well and we are at the intermediate casing point just above the target cash information we already have confirmation of high pressure gas entering the wellbore weâ ll release more information when weâ re able to what we learned from the drilling logging and testing of yamalik and inanli and devepinar will greatly advance our understanding of this play now to be clear the appraisal wells weâ re currently drilling are only vertical wells and are designed to give us an understanding of how the quality of our bcga played varies vertically through more than a kilometer of gas charge section that we have drilled to date and laterally across the whole area of the basin we control in normal course in our industry one wants to many of these vertical wells with production data to build the vertical and lateral model of the play and to identify the best zones in the best areas these would then be targeted for horizontal wells in our planning with their partners we believe that these steps to not have to run in a serial mode but with good results in 2019 the notional plan for 2020 would already be drilling horizontal wells to understand the production present potential while at the same time progressing with continued vertical appraisal drilling across the whole area this is very important to the horizontal wells as we know from looking across basins in north america that horizontal wells will deliver much higher production than seen in vertical wells the production rates in horizontal wells will be multiples or many multiples of what you see in vertical production itâ s an exciting time for bcga play and weâ re moving ahead as quickly as we can given that weâ re at the early phases of learning and appraisal so a couple of other points iâ d like to touch on related to the bcga play you will note that d m that the d m perspective resource report was updated to year end 2018 this was not a requirement for the tsx but we did require this update to include in our perspectives and filing to support the uk listing that was the sole reason for undertaking the update and unfortunately also drove the timing of that report and that it was as of december 31 2018 and as of december 31 2018 the effective date of the report the new information available to d m was the yamalik 1 long term production test and the drilling data from a portion of the inanli 1 that was drilled as of year end and having reviewed the yamalik 1 production data and the limited data from inanli 1 d m concluded that there was not sufficient new information that would justify a change in either the volumes because they associated with the play or the risk of success on that play accordingly the numbers remain unchanged from 2017 which showed the valeura with 10 1 tcf of estimated working interest unrest mean perspective resource of natural gas iâ d also like to make a comment on the value in very simple terms if you look at the current market cap of valeura at 250 million if you subtract the value of the cash that we have in bank and our audited 2p reserves value the total value of the market is attributing to this whole play that we have is approximately 75 million now again iâ m not pointing to the exact size that we have here what iâ m pointing to is the vast difference between what the market is describing to the asset and to what we our external auditors and our analysts see as a potential of this play so another point is that weâ re stepping up our efforts to have the valeura story heard by a broader audience of investors in november we released that the company was planning to undertake an additional listing of our shares in london and that this would be a q1 2019 activity with timing link to our year end results today we released our year end financials and reserves london listing is the right move for the company and our existing shareholders we believe that we will be able to attract increased institutional falling and more research coverage in the london market at turkish gas story is much better understood in europe to emphasize this point when we raised capital 12 months ago almost all of the money came out of london looking at a 12 month period around our raise at that time the total amount of equity raises for international oil and gas companies in toronto was 60 million valeura was 45 million of that in the equivalent period in london more than 2 billion was raised so at this point i can confirm to you that we are proceeding with the documentation in filing for an additional listing in london and that this will be on the main board of the london stock exchange i can confirm to you that the company does not intend to raise any capital at the time was this listing and there will be no solution to the existing shareholders on the exact timing of the commencement of trading in london this will be related to the uk listing authority approval of the prospectus and the listing once the ukla has granted the company approval the normal process is to issue an announcement of our formal intention to file and then in normal course to company would be trading about one week later so before i bring this to a close i wanted to touch on one other issue iâ m sure you will all be aware of the debates going on globally about the positives and negatives of social media and the many recent abuses this extends directly into investor information sharing websites while the objectives of these websites are extremely valuable to the community and that they strive to provide a forum for information sharing between investors they remain highly susceptible to misinformation some of which is malevolent and designed to influence and others is more innocence just lacking real or fulsome data on which to draw conclusions we would caution our shareholders against believing information posted on these websites as a company we are bound by strict legal guidelines as to what weâ re able to share with you and assuring that we are able to back up all statements with external advice anonymous bloggers have no such guidelines we appreciate our shareholders who contact us and make us aware of some of these posts but to be clear the company will not engage on debate on these websites we remain open to our shareholders contacting us directly with their questions are concerns and we remain open to people who feel that they have a geological background calling us and asking questions but we also encourage all of investors to seek professional investment advice so in summary i just like to say this continues to be an exciting time for valeura we continue to find positive signs as we proceed through our evaluation program and i believe we were doing the right things to demonstrate the value of our bcga play and to unlock the value in the capital markets with that iâ d like to thank everyone for calling in this morning and iâ ll now turn the call back over to the operator to help us take any questions thank you question and answer session operator and your first question comes from stephane foucaud from gmp please go ahead stephane foucaud hi sean hi guys a simple one for me could you concern that the inanli test the well test will indeed start by the bottom and theyâ d probably go â probably going up and therefore we probably start the year at least exciting is always among the few that youâ ve got to test thank you sean guest yes thank you stephane good afternoon yes with the way that you have to do the stimulation and fracking program unfortunately the company we would like to go to the very best zones and just start there but no youâ re correct and that we actually have to work from the bottom of the well up so the first test would be getting down at the lowest part of the well which is the way porosity naturally decreases with depth those are likely to be some of the poorest reservoirs relative to each other so we would expect better reservoirs near the upper part of the well but youâ re correct we do need to start testing at the bottom and then work our way up stephane foucaud so we know that what is the result of the button the full test of the button is not great itâ s not really a big deal because that doesnâ t involve but i think itâ s a very good result and itâ s very encouraging for the rest sean guest thatâ s very correct and that was similar as we saw in yamalik where we had very good production from the deep stephane foucaud thank you operator thank you your next question comes from chen lin from lin asset management please go ahead chen lin hi sean thank you for taking my question so one â first is that yamalik youâ ve said youâ re going to go back in to test them from one by one are you planning to get â to check the production data of the gas or find out where the water comes from or whatâ s your plan there sean guest yes to be clear itâ s very hard to go back in and change how the wellâ s been stimulated in the perforation that you have there we all have this all is commingled flow so all the zones over 800 meters are all flowing into the well together so thatâ s why itâ s very difficult to analyze the single bit of information which is what you get out of the top and tell whatâ s coming from whatsoever so what weâ re going to do is what we call production logging so itâ s actually sending tools down the hole that are then capable of looking at each zone and what fluids are coming from each zone so thatâ s the operations weâ ll undertake and itâ s been quite a complicated planning process on that because there are a number of different ways you can try and do this type of production logging and it was only really recently last month that we came to an agreement with equinor to the best way to try and get information from the well so weâ ve gone back there and pulled that tubing earlier and youâ re getting ready to start that production logging program over the next few weeks chen lin okay great thank you just a curiosity is the equinor paying for this or now itâ s a 50 50 sean guest no we would be sharing the cost of 50 50 with equinor chen lin thank you the next well youâ re drilling at devepinar right so whatâ s the maximum dense youâ re planning to â how deep youâ re planning to sean guest yeah chen itâ s a good question because in inanli we were pushing that well down towards 5 000 meters because we wanted to really look to the full extent of how deep does this overpressured gas go with inanli we saw that the gas goes down to the total depths and down to 4 900 meters but as we were talking about what we do know is that porosity decreases with depth and the better quality rock is in the shallower formations and what i mean by that is weâ re still talking from that interval of approximately 3 000 meters to 5 000 meters but we expect the better rocks in the shallower part in the 3 000 meter to 3 500 meter range rather than down at 4 500 meters so when inanli proves that the gas goes all the way down weâ re not sure we need to be doing that anymore because our focus is now on demonstrating commerciality drilling very deep down to 5 000 meters is expensive and i would rather see our capital allocated towards actually the testing and demonstrating that we can achieve commercial flow rather than try to prove our volumes that likely wouldnâ t be developed until 2040 or 2050 the deeper stuff we expect to be later life development the shallower stuff would likely have better reservoir quality and would be the first thing that you would develop so when we look at devepinar in the future drilling while weâ ve maintained a well design that is capable of pushing that deep weâ re not sure in the end that we will drill that full way chen lin okay thank you back to the inanli i still â my understanding on your prior questions was do some testing at the bottom first so first real production test will be starting at the end of april have i heard correctly sean guest thatâ s correct thatâ s our current timing now is about the end of april we need to get this pressure data from what we call a dfit analysis to look at the maximum pressure in the well because it then determines what type of pressure equipment we need at the surface and so thatâ s one of the key drivers there chen lin and then you will â assume you may â you will start testing if it goes well then you have extended testing maybe three to four weeks is that correct sean guest thatâ s correct so you could be looking at on a positive result each test could be taking three weeks or even more depending on how we view the produced data so it could extend for quite a lengthy time but again in our view that would be very good news chen lin yes okay great thank you sean sean guest thanks chen operator thank you your next question is from colin smith from panmure gordon please go ahead colin smith thanks very much hi sean hi everybody there just apropos of your points about the sort of success of the vertical drilling that youâ ve had so far are you expecting that the sort of last place of well in the program will also be a vertical well or would you consider drilling horizontally at this stage bringing in major comments about having identify as the shallower role cause as really the main target sean guest yes thanks colin and good afternoon it is a good question because weâ ve been working with our partner to really determine what weâ d like out of that third well and i think thereâ s a recognition that getting to a horizontal well here will be quite important is really one of the challenges weâ re having is the timing of information that weâ re getting which is coming from production and further drilling and then being ready to be able to say well i can go to a horizontal well for that third well so at this point we think it is much more likely that it will be a vertical well however is a location could be selected to the point that it sets you up to then be able to do a horizontal well whether from that same pad or from another pad nearby that then goes towards that well in your first horizontals it is preferable that you have what we call a heel and a toe well in other words that you have a vertical well near both ends of the horizontal is it helps guide you through that drilling so we would like to get to a horizontal in that third one but i think it will be challenged given the timing of the production data that weâ re going to get colin smith okay thank you operator and your next question comes from garett ursu from cormark please go ahead garett ursu hey guys just curious with some of the more â are the extra work on yamalik and stuff like that iâ m just hoping to get a sense of capital spending for q1 and q2 as well as part of your â some of your shallow stuff what youâ re spending there what youâ re doing there and what we could expect for the first half spending sean guest yes there is a â rough in our corporate presentation during â based on the timeline kind of a breakdown of the capital expenditures by quarter and so â yes i think as youâ ve got there as we get into q1 now devepinar weâ re paying our working interest share of 31 so that is going to start we are going to start spending money during that period and then that will continue as we look at the third well and as we continue on testing of devepinar in that in our shallow activities the current plan right now is quite limited so even looking at over the year weâ re currently spending on the order of i think itâ s about 1 million to 2 million steve bjornson yes so across the q1 is going to be 5 million if everythingâ s on time above 5 million and then youâ d get anywhere from 10 million to 13 million in q2 often weâ ve been a delayed on moving equipment and getting things done but i think thatâ s kind of a canadian dollars but if you want to look at the summary for the program in u s dollars and canadian dollars that we reflect in all of our disclosure and it lays out where when the timing of the wells garett ursu okay okay thanks just to be clear i guess when youâ re testing some of these wells the production wonâ t be recorded i guess in barrels and the cash flow will go against capex or how would that be kind of accounted for go forward steve bjornson yes thatâ s what happening when you end up in this extended test period garrett you know the well doesnâ t really move into production until itâ s really on production at that point in time so when weâ re doing extensive work downhole thatâ s basically still part of the capital any test production now obviously has to be matched up with the capital so that kind of it gets capitalized if you kind of follow me garett ursu yes steve bjornson so thatâ s likely going to happen with every well at this stage garett ursu and thatâ s included in the capital spending as much kind of a net number steve bjornson yes with net number but thereâ s â as the race â the net cash flow on the well is not going to be that significant to change if you mean if we get a better production that will help us garett ursu okay thank you steve bjornson thatâ s the capital numbers that we put in there are probably the more conservative numbers garett ursu okay thanks operator thank you at this time we have no further questions you may proceed sean guest no further questions operator no further questions sean guest okay iâ d like to thank everyone for joining us here today and again as weâ ve emphasized please feel free to reach out and contact us if you do have any further questions operator ladies and gentlemen this concludes todayâ

d uring turkey s constitutional upheavals in 2016 17 when president recep tayyip erdogan faced down an attempted coup and gathered up new political powers and prisoners the country s economic reformers remembered better days they talked wistfully of an imminent return to factory settings turkey they believed had a default set of successful policies from which it had recently deviated and to which it could quickly revert undoing any mistakes in between listen to this story enjoy more audio and podcasts on ios or android your browser does not support the element instead the economy suffered something closer to a system crash excessive lending some of it guaranteed by the government contributed to rising inflation and a widening current account deficit the central bank s ability to restore order was stymied by mr erdogan s hostility to orthodox monetary policy he compared interest rates to tools of terrorism when the government fell out with president donald trump over the arrest of an american pastor working in anatolia foreign investors and many turkish depositors lost their nerve turkey s currency the lira fell by 40 against the dollar in the first eight months of 2018 that drop was excruciating for the many companies that had borrowed in euros or dollars foreign currency corporate debt amounted to over 35 of gdp in 2018 hundreds of firms have since defaulted or applied for konkordato a court approved rescheduling of debt that allows them to avoid declaring bankruptcy their number includes the turkish franchises of gloria jean s coffees owned by haci sayid a cafeteria chain founded by two brothers who have been making baklava since 1968 the full extent of the damage became clearer on march 11th when turkey reported its latest gdp figures they showed that the economy shrank by 3 in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared with a year earlier see chart that was an even sharper fall than expected but if anything it understates the suffering an unusually large share of this diminished output was exported to foreigners rather than enjoyed at home household consumption a better measure of pleasure and pain shrank by almost 9 the crisis has however forced the government to reset its reckless macroeconomic policies the appointment in july of berat albayrak the president s son in law as finance minister did not bode well but for the moment the family dynamic seems to be working in the economy s favour helping to reconcile mr erdogan to the need for monetary and fiscal restraint the central bank was belatedly permitted to unholster its terrorist tools and raise interest rates the government has also set itself ambitious fiscal targets that will require cutting pensions and postponing investment to narrow the budget deficit the flow of credit has been sharply curtailed imports have collapsed and exports have boomed the current account even swung into surplus for four months in a row from august to november as turkey welcomed more foreign tourists and fewer foreign goods this rebalancing has helped to revive the lira which rose by 28 from the end of august to the end of january but how long will it take for stability to translate into growth an economy unfortunately cannot be reset as easily as a smartphone past mismanagement tends to become embedded in the circuits the turkish public for example will not quickly forget last year s erosion in the value of the lira they now hold nearly half of their deposits in foreign currency and the central bank will have to keep interest rates high for some time to convince people that it can conquer inflation which remains at almost 20 in its impatience the government has resorted to opening subsidised food stalls in big cities to dampen the rise in the price of groceries which mr albayrak has branded food terrorism inflation should fall further later in the year as the effects of the lira s decline wear off credit is already beginning to revive led by state banks and some early indicators for 2019 suggest that the pace of economic contraction is starting to ease bbva a bank believes growth will return in the second half of the year leaving the economy 1 bigger this year than last a cyclical recovery will not however resolve questions about turkey s longer term future it is hard now to argue that the market friendly policies embraced by mr erdogan s party from 2002 to 2011 represent the economy s default mode after all the populism and cronyism of more recent years is hardly new in turkey a similar kind of mismanagement reared its head many times before the financial crisis of 2001 and the promise of european union membership motivated a decade of reform perhaps populism not liberalism represents turkey s factory settings to which it has returned after all

centre not just of turkey but of the ottoman empire at its peak covering modern bulgaria egypt greece hungary jordan lebanon israel and the palestinian territories macedonia romania syria and parts of the arab peninsula and north africa the central bank and stock exchange were both located on this street today these buildings are occupied by a commercial bank and the ottoman bank museum opposite is the twirling camondo stairs so named after a sephardic jewish banking family out of venice no one said it wasn t complicated widely known as the rothschilds of the ottoman empire who not only financed the state and its leadership but spent generously in the arts and other charity works the ottoman bankers started to fade with the relocation of abraham camondo the first foreigner to own land in the empire to paris in the late 19th century the last members of his family perished in the horror of auschwitz the world changed while the bricks and mortar history is still visible many of the shops on the avenue are today taken up with electrical and lighting supply stores but some things remained the same istanbul s banking tradition has continued through the rise and fall of empires the move of most bank headquarters and the stock exchange to istanbul s modern business districts and of the central bank to the capital ankara and regular crises especially following the lifting of strict controls in the 1990s istanbul s stock market capitalisation is now 220 billion and the banking sector is active across the middle east eastern europe and central asia and many of the domestic cyclical boom and bust problems remain today turkey s economy is in recession this has its roots in politics according to official stats the economy shrank by 2 4 in the fourth quarter of 2018 making it two quarters in succession the definition of a recession the immediate cause is a trade spat with the united states in august 2018 donald trump tweeted about doubling tariffs on turkish steel and aluminium the lira crashed 17 that same day since losing 40 of its value against the dollar but there are deeper reasons on paper turkey is in the top 20 largest economies worldwide a founding member of the group of developed economies the oecd and also the g20 it has been in a customs union with the european union its largest trade partner for more than 20 years although its per capita income of 10 500 classifies turkey as an upper middle income country its labour force participation rate of 56 is well below the oecd average of 74 current account deficits have consistently run high as the government prefers to spend its way to popularity relying on foreign capital inflows to balance the books and top up low domestic savings the fall of the lira by three times its value over the last five years has made imports more expensive and prompted the central bank to raise interest rates constraining business economic growth was just 2 6 overall for 2018 well down from 2017 s growth rate of 7 4 ankara s spat with washington was sparked by the continued detention of an american pastor allegedly involved in a 2016 coup attempt against president recep erdoğan but came as the ruling party s support in the cities of ankara and istanbul was seen to be slipping due to rising food prices which officially was blamed on speculators and unemployment while the government says that the economy should return to growth in 2019 other analysts are less optimistic sinan ulgen heads istanbul ekonomi a respected local consultancy the 2001 imf programme he notes laid the foundations for turkey s economic growth imf conditionalities plus cheap liquidity and a benign international environment helped the fiscal stimulus and quantitative easing after the 2008 global crisis helped further reinforcing a turkish growth model which had relied on using imported savings to boost internal demand everyone knew however that this world would end and it has now rather than invest in improving productivity through education labour market reforms and strengthened competition the government has focused expenditure on real estate development and construction this has traditionally been the sector from which political rents are extracted contemporary turkey challenges the conventional wisdom that countries liberalise their politics after they reach a certain per capita threshold even though it topped a 10 000 per capita income political regression has set in while there is active multiparty competition the political space has narrowed with the new constitution control of the public service including the security agencies the instrumentalisation of religion and control of the media in part this reflects the extent to which turkish politics has been steered away from building consensus and achieving a social peace into building a personal platform for erdogan abdullah gül was erdogan s predecessor serving as the 11th president of turkey from 2007 to 2014 having been prime minister 2002 to 2003 and concurrently deputy prime minister and foreign minister 2003 to 2007 he is at pains to stress the economic opportunities now present as a result of great economic and structural changes from 2000 today he says the private sector is the leader in the economy since 2003 we have enjoyed the same political party running the country though there have been changes in going from a parliamentary to a presidential political system and he prefers to stress turkey s market position on the crossroads of east and west and its firm relations with the eu iran and russia than its current economic wobbles at the end of 2018 gül responded to criticism from the ruling justice and development party akp which he had co founded with erdoğan over a debate on a controversial emergency decree as someone who believes in freedom of thought and expression which are founding principles of our party i will continue to express my view in situations i find necessary he tweeted his former colleague erdoğan wasted no time in responding shame said the president weren t we sharing the cause as a professor of economics smiles gül i regularly gave lectures on the relationship between law politics and the economy but we have a long history and some things are just temporary businesses agree though remain fearful of venturing any opinion on politics this is part of our operational geography comments one terrorism war violence political instability all these things are realities in this region business hoped it seems for a chinese like contract economic growth with political stability and without their opposition to the government rather like the frog in the pot no matter how well it can swim if the water is boiling it s a dead frog the former president confesses that fears however misplaced about economic and political stability are discounting turkish assets and adding a premium for much needed foreign direct investment while i have my own different views about domestic politics he admits we are all interested in the same thing for turkey to be wealthy and successful for him a little risk is not a bad thing after all he asks opportunity and risks are linked no risk means little return it may well be a good time to invest in turkey because of the mispricing moreover the economy retains great strengths not least the size of its population at 80 million almost the same as germany and a median age of just 30 turkey is a top five producer of a range of agricultural goods including various nuts fruits including cherries figs apricots pomegranates quinces watermelons apples vegetables cucumbers green peppers lentils and chickpeas tomatoes eggplants sugar beet as well as olives and tea the consumer electronics industry has boomed this century while turkey is in the top 15 producers of cars worldwide with 1 5 million units annually nearly three times sa s number some 80 of these are destined for export the country possesses perhaps the most diversified industrial skill set from germany to china tourism too has been a steady performer visitors attracted by great beaches historical sights value for money and easy

annually ranking it in the top five globally which will rise to 200 million passengers over the next ten years twice the current capacity of atlanta now the busiest it s a serious and sophisticated place though its politics make it difficult right now to realise its potential the ottoman empire collapsed under the weight of external borrowing to finance the increasingly extravagant tastes of the elite their interests became inimical to the country s position and progress along came mustafa kemal ataturk with an aim of a secular westernised turkey in pursuit of which he carried out a set of radical reforms which have stood the country in remarkably good stead for 100 years in the greater sweep of history turkey s current economic and political turn is likely to prove a blip no matter the medium term low growth and stagflation scenarios the question is less whether rather than when it will get its politics right dm dr mills heads the brenthurst foundation and is the co author of

it s a crucial fact that almost every country of the world has taken external debt india is also one of them india s external debt was 510 4 billion at sept end which was at all time high of 529 billion dollar in march 2018 in such a scenario when india has debt of around 20 8 of its gdp and the country is paying 18 of its revenue in interest payment a question arises in the mind of common peoples that why does india not repay this debt by printing more indian currency despite having a currency printing machine in the country let s discuss about its possibility and consequences arising from it how much currency notes can be printed by the rbi printing of currency notes in india is done on the basis of minimum reserve system mrs this system is applicable in india since 1957 according to this system the reserve bank of india has to maintain assets of at least rs 200 crore all the time out of this rs 200 cr rs 115 cr should in the form of gold and rest rs 85 cr should be in the form of foreign currency after holding asset of rs 200 cr the rbi can print any number of currency notes as per the requirement of the economy although before printing the notes rbi has to take prior permission from the central government what is the cost of printing 200 500 and 2000 rupees notes in india external debt on india at end september 2018 india s external debt was us 510 4 billion which was 529 billion dollars in march 2018 the external debt to gdp ratio of india stood at 20 8 at end september 2018 higher than its level of 20 5 at end march 2018 the largest component of external debt of india was commercial borrowings 37 1 followed by nri deposits 23 9 and short term trade credit 19 9 the largest component of india s external debt was in us dollar i e 49 7 in september 2018 followed by the indian rupee 36 1 sdr 5 3 yen 4 7 and euro 3 2 sources of inflow of dollars in india are 1 dollar inflows in india when a foreign company individual investor invests in india 2 payment received for indian export 3 external remittances sent by indian workers working abroad 4 foreign students who come to study in india also bring dollars 5 foreign tourists also bring dollars 6 external help india receives from international institutions and rich countries 7 government borrowings from the international institutions and rich countries can the indian government repay the foreign debt by printing new currency the answer is no government of india cannot print the new rupees to pay the external debt because india has to pay the external debt in the same currency in which it is borrowed the largest component of india s external debt was in us dollar i e 49 7 it means india need to repay maximum debt in us dollars which can t be printed by the rbi so india has to pay debt in dollars not in indian rupees if the rbi prints the new currency it won t be of any use because the lender country which may be usa or any other country will not accept the payment in indian currency hence printing of new rupees will put extra burden on the exchequer without any profit if foreign countries and institutions are ready to accept repayment in the indian currency only then printing of new currency notes can be used to repay the external debt but indian rupee is not global currency so foreign institutions and countries will not accept indian rupees until there is a trade agreement between them how does printing excess money affect the economy if the rbi prints new currency then the supply of currency will increase in the country which will further increase the inflation in the country suppose if the money supply increased to 50 then the price of general prices like bread butter clothing house etc will also increase proportionately 50 so the printing of new currency will not have any positive impact on the indian economy on the other hand public exchequer will have to bear the cost of printing of new notes thus it can be said that the rbi can print innumerable rupees but if this extra money increases the inflation and external debt of the country remains as it was then printing of countless rupees is not in the country s interest list of top five debt ridden country of the world where do printing of security papers notes and minting take place in india
but perhaps the market is giving this phenomenon too much weight in terms of the actual risk it poses for the us economy and it s not only the market that remains on knife edge about this issue mr porcelli pointed to a survey by the wall street journal in which nearly half of economic prognosticators see trade policy or china as the biggest risk to the us outlook the real effect is likely to be quite modest mr porcelli said we re ran a var impulse response simulation and it shows that a 1 standard deviation shock to us import prices from china which is about 0 23 m m has about a 0 01 impact on us core pce inflation in other words an across the board 23 increase in chinese import prices to the us lifts core pce inflation by about 1 theoretically the standard error is large enough that we cannot rule out the impact is actually zero while tariffs are indeed a tax on us consumers it is not clear that they have a one for one relationship with import prices as evidenced by the y y declines in china import prices to the us over recent months we think the china trade risk to the us comes more from an overreaction in us equity markets that then flows through to tighter financial conditions

this article is more than 5 years old getty financial and non financial corporations optimism about business and economic conditions has waned in 2019 moreover according to a well researched and documented survey conducted by strategic treasurer and td bank america s most convenient bank a significant percent of companies surveyed have not benefited from president trump s tax reform nearly as much as they had hoped the second annual treasury perspectives survey s 340 respondents from different sectors of the economy are concerned the most about rising interest rates gridlock in washington d c and increased regulatory oversight in the survey released yesterday respondents stated their most significant concerns are rising interest rates 56 gridlock in d c 38 and an increasingly complex regulatory environment 34 additionally fears about the escalating trade conflict and a near term recession were among their top five concerns survey respondents are focused first and foremost on debt repayment like many corporations around the world u s companies borrowed significantly in the last decade due to very low interest rates as rates rose steadily last year and as some companies have to refinance debt excess cash will be for debt repayment 31 followed by capital expenditures capex 29 and holding cash for future investments 24 barely a few months into 2019 the corporate positive outlook decreased to 44 while those with a negative perspective increased to 14 this is a significant change just in the last 12 months strategic treasuries and td bank the 340 company executives interviewed were from a diverse array of sectors of the economy the top two sectors were banking 13 and manufacturing 12 td bank and strategic treasurer 95 of the respondents had operations in the americas outside of north america the two largest geographic areas where companies had operations were in western europe and asia pacific how international these companies are gives them a good perspective on country and economic risks they need to think about that could impact their strategic plans and profitability strategic treasurer and td bank of concern to financial markets should also be the respondents expectations of gross domestic product gdp performance 57 of surveyed firms expect a gdp increase over the next 12 months in comparison to 12 months ago when 67 expected a gdp increase 8 of the surveyed expect a gdp decrease in comparison to 12 months ago when only 1 expected a gdp decline td bank and strategic treasurer surprisingly and boding well for the u s economy companies are still planning to continue spending over the next two years about 30 of the companies surveyed plan to undertake a significant acquisition or more than one 30 plan to invest heavily in financial technology upgrades and 25 plan to launch a major new service line or product contrary to what trump and the white house might have hoped however nearly half of the company executives interviewed stated that tax reform has had no significant impact on their businesses according to tom gregory manager of treasury management sales at td bank the impact of the cash savings was not as large as expected so the reality vs what corporates anticipated when the tax cuts were announced is quite different moreover according to the survey only 15 percent of the 2019 respondents increased total income 12 percent improved financial performance and 10 percent brought funds back to the u s in the 2018 survey 42 of the respondents had hoped that federal tax reform would provide a significant benefit unfortunately the reality has been very different strategic treasurer and td bank when asked about the ongoing trade tensions the majority of organizations 65 stated that trade conflicts have not had any significant impact on their business thus far the ongoing trade conflicts with china g7 and north american free trade agreement nafta were listed as the fourth highest concern for companies both domestically and internationally trade tension concerns came after other issues such as cyber fraud rising interest rates and increasing regulation strategic treasurer and td bank strategic treasurer s and td bank s survey also found that enhanced technology within the treasury organization is needed in particular companies need automation and straight through processing stp in order for personnel to free up time for numerous other tasks the survey data however show that in the current environment corporates are not hurrying to adopt newer or innovative solutions treasury functions tend to be conservative in adopting in new technologies strategic treasurer and td bank non financial corporates treasuries are much less prepared for disruption than banks treasuries company treasurers do see value in newer technologies 75 of corporates say that they are excited about innovation within the technology realm and numerous practitioners said that they would rather upgrade their technology than hire additional staff strategic treasurer and td bank surveyed companies are also concerned about the regulatory environment a little over half of those surveyed stated that regulatory oversight was higher than historical norms know your customer rules kyc remains the top compliance related concern for corporations over the next 1 3 years 50 followed by dodd frank 41 and foreign banks and financial accounts fbar 38 every aspect of this data rich survey points to the fact that it is very challenging for treasury professionals to cope with all the significant economic technological and regulatory changes in their professions moreover their responsibilities and expectations are growing in my experience for treasury professionals to succeed in their roles they will need strong support from senior executives additional technological and human resources and training to fulfill their responsibilities successfully companies can only achieve their strategic and profit objectives if their treasuries are robust

like like love haha wow sad angry 1 thyblackman com for the month of january the treasury reported a budget surplus of 9 billion down 41 billion or 82 from the same month a year ago the widening deficit comes as the congressional budget office is projecting a shortfall of 897 billion for the full fiscal year or 4 2 of gross domestic product that s up from 779 billion in fiscal 2018 when spending climbed and revenue remained nearly flat the cbo sees trillion dollar deficits beginning in fiscal 2022 when trump and the republicans were selling their supply side tax cut snake oil i did some research to determine whether or not tax cuts actually spurred economic growth and boosted the economy i discovered they did do not i went all the way back to 1920 and discovered that only in a short seven year period from 1920 to 1927 in the administrations of warren g harding and calvin coolidge did a fiscal policy of austerity actually produce the desired results despite taking office during a depression in 1920 warren harding following the advice of his secretary of treasury andrew mellon cut taxes cut government spending targeted paying down the national debt and actually generated a three hundred million dollar surplus harding died in office in 1923 there was no autopsy he was embalmed within hours of his death so no one knows what he died from his vice president calvin coolidge assumed office and continued harding s policies coolidge declined to run again in 1928 and a recession occurred in the final months of his administration that eventually morphed into the great depression once herbert hoover took office various schools of economic theory debate and argue over why harding and coolidge were able to resolve the 192 21 depression without using accepted modern interventions like increased government spending or inflationary monetary policy what these economists ignore is the basic approach harding and coolidge took to the economy which was don t spend more than you take in in revenue live on a balanced budget and pay off your debts they cut taxes cut spending and paid down the debt their actions along with new technologies spurred economic growth during the era known as the roaring twenties despite these policies when hoover assumed office in 1929 the recession was worsening he doubled down on harding and coolidge s policies but they didn t work for him hoover had always an interventionist in harding s diary he noted hoover who was his secretary of commerce was always coming to him with one idea after another about how to deal with the depression hoover s ideas were more interventionist than either harding or coolidge s ironically one of the justifications for creating the federal reserve bank it s not a government entity at all it s a group of privately owned banks was it would end the relentless cycles of boom bust prosperity recession and depression however history has shown this not to be true since the 1929 great depression all presidents even so called conservatives like ronald reagan have eschewed the holistic policies of harding and coolidge tax cuts spending cuts paying down the debt and accountability harding created the general accounting office to audit government spending in favor of either tax cuts or spending cuts done separately and randomly rather than in tandem of course in 1921 there were no gargantuan new deal programs or military industrial complex to pay for like today today a charlatan like donald trump hoodwinks the people by telling them tax cuts will stimulate the economy while he simultaneously increases government spending granted some government spending was for wildfires floods and hurricane relief in addition to initiating a boneheaded trade war around the world but trump is not the only president to do this all of his immediate predecessors even the ones who raised taxes like bu h senior and clinton have spent more than the government took in presidents bu h jr and obama both cut taxes obama extended bu h s tax cuts but simultaneously increased spending by doing so they increased the federal deficit ronald reagan did the same thing although the media perpetrates the lie his tax cuts stimulated the economy which they did not the united states is in a deep fiscal hole it spends far more than it takes in trump s tax cuts and spending spikes increased the federal deficit over 700 billion dollars in 2018 and is projected to increase the deficit by 879 billion in 2019 this is insane even though the federal reserve bank and us treasury can theoretically continue to create and print money via computer strokes that policy is unsustainable over the long haul even the imf says so this coupled with the escalating economic slowdown we are now experiencing the things do not bode well for us insanity is defined as doing the same thing over and over with the same people expecting different results by that reckoning we truly are insane written by junious ricardo stanton official website
the number of americans filing applications for unemployment benefits increased more than expected last week suggesting the labour market was slowing but probably not to the extent implied by a near stall in job growth in february while other data on thursday showed import prices rising in february by the most in nine months the trend in imported inflation remained weak import prices dropped on a year on year basis for a third straight month in february news on the housing market remained downbeat with new home sales falling more than expected in january the stream of data remains broadly supportive of the federal reserve s pledge to be patient before raising interest rates further this year if the fed is reading the tea leaves the economic brew of data are distinctly on the weak side today and will keep fed policy cemented in place at next week s meeting said chris rupkey chief economist at mufg in new york fed officials are scheduled to meet next tuesday and wednesday to decide on monetary policy the u s central bank increased borrowing costs four times last year initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 6 000 to a seasonally adjusted 229 000 for the week ended march 9 the labour department said economists polled by reuters had forecast claims rising to 225 000 in the latest week claims have been hovering in the middle of their 200 000 253 000 range this year the labour market is slowing as workers become more scarce hiring is also being constrained by a weakening economy as stimulus from a us 1 5 trillion tax cut diminishes washington s trade war with beijing slowing demand overseas and uncertainty over britain s exit from the european union are also hurting economic activity the government reported last week that non farm payrolls increased by only 20 000 jobs in february the weakest since september 2017 in part as payback after hefty gains in the prior two months but the unemployment rate dropped two tenths of a percentage point to 3 8 per cent and annual wage growth was the strongest since 2009 separately on thursday the commerce department said new home sales declined 6 9 per cent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 607 000 units in january economists had forecast new home sales which account for about 11 per cent of housing market sales slipping 0 6 per cent to a 620 000 unit pace in january cold weather and a five week partial shutdown of the government that ended on jan 25 probably weighed on sales economists said still affordability remains a challenge especially at the lower end of the market even as mortgage rates have dropped to 13 month lows and house price inflation has slowed expensive lumber as well as land and labour shortages are constraining builders from increasing construction of homes in this market segment there are concerns that lower house prices could encourage builders to cut back on new projects the median new home price fell 3 8 per cent in january from a year ago deflationary impulse given the rising cost pressures builders are facing this could suggest continued difficulty for new homes and new construction ahead said danielle hale chief economist at realtor com the dollar rose against a basket of currencies while u s treasury prices fell stocks on wall street were higher in a third report on thursday the labour department said import prices rose 0 6 per cent last month boosted by increases in the costs of fuels and consumer goods that was the biggest gain since may and followed a 0 1 per cent rise in january economists polled by reuters had forecast import prices rising 0 3 per cent in february in the 12 months through february import prices fell 1 3 per cent that followed a 1 6 per cent decline in january the report came on the heels of data showing tame producer and consumer inflation readings in february the jump in the monthly import prices did not change economists views that inflation will remain moderate through the first half of 2019 a deflationary impulse from abroad is putting slight downward pressure on domestic prices at the start of 2019 said jake mcrobie a u s economist at oxford economics in new york last month prices for imported fuels and lubricants rose 4 9 per cent after increasing 4 1 per cent in january prices for imported petroleum increased 4 7 per cent after rebounding 7 1 per cent in january but food

what are known as the core import prices fell 0 3 per cent in the 12 months through february increases in core import prices have been curbed by last year s strength in the dollar prices for imported consumer goods excluding automobiles rose 0 3 per cent in february reversing january s drop the cost of goods imported from china was unchanged in february after dropping 0 3 per cent in the prior

on september 21 1945 five months after franklin roosevelt s death president harry truman assembled his cabinet for a meeting that one historian has called a turning point in the american century the purpose of the meeting was to discuss secretary of war henry stimson s proposal to share atomic bomb information with the soviets stimson who had directed the manhattan project maintained that the only way to make the soviets trustworthy was to trust them in his proposal to truman he wrote that not sharing the bomb with the soviets would almost certainly stimulate feverish activity on the part of the soviets in what will in effect be a secret armament race of a rather desperate character cold war militarism achieved its own coherence and legitimacy by adopting economic logic and criteria henry wallace the secretary of commerce and former vice president agreed with stimson as did undersecretary of state dean acheson though he later changed his position but secretary of the navy james forrestal laid down the definitive opposition the russians like the japanese he argued are essentially oriental in their thinking and until we have a longer record of experience with them it seems doubtful that we should endeavor to buy their understanding and sympathy we tried that once with hitler there are no returns on appeasement forrestal a skilled bureaucratic infighter had made his fortune on wall street and frequently framed his arguments in economic terms the bomb and the knowledge that produced it forrestal argued was the property of the american people control over it like the u s seizure of japan s former pacific island bases needed to be governed by the concept of sole trusteeship truman sided with forrestal stimson retired that very same day his swan song ignored and wallace soon to be forced out of the truman administration for his left wing views described the meeting as one of the most dramatic of all cabinet meetings in my fourteen years of wash ington experience forrestal meanwhile went on to be the country s first secretary of defense in 1947 and is the man who illustrates perhaps more than anyone else how cold war militarism achieved its own coherence and legitimacy by adopting economic logic and criteria that is by envi sioning military power as an independent domain of capital expenditure in the service of a political economy of freedom from his pivotal work in logistics and procurement during world war ii to his assiduously cultivated relationships with anti new deal congressmen and regional business leaders sympathetic to the military forrestal both helped to fashion and occupied the nexus of an emerging corporate military order he only served as defense secretary for eighteen months he committed suicide under suspicious circumstances in 1949 but on the day of that fateful cabinet meeting he won the decisive battle advocating for what he once called a state of ongoing semi war the post world war ii rise of a u s military industrial complex is well understood but it still remains hidden in plain sight today warnings about donald trump s assault on the liberal international order are commonplace while less examined is how we arrived at a point where democratic and peacetime governance entails a global military infrastructure of 800 u s military bases in more than 70 countries the post world war ii rise of a u s military industrial complex is well understood but it still remains hidden in plain sight moreover this infrastructure is under the command of one person supported by a labor force numbering in the millions and oriented to a more or less permanent state of war if a politics of threat inflation and fear is one part of the answer the other more prosaic component is that the system itself is modeled after the scope of business and finance by managing a diverse portfolio of assets and liabilities and identifying investment opportunities it envisions a preeminently destructive enterprise as a series of returns calibrated to discretionary assessment of threats and a preponderance of force this was forrestal s bailiwick a little known anecdote about truman s 1947 call to congress for decisive intervention in the greek civil war generally viewed as the official declaration of the cold war illustrates this point truman s speech is famous for its emphasis on political freedom particularly the idea of protecting peoples rights to self determination against armed minorities the terrorist activities of several thousand armed men led by communists one of the primary objectives of the foreign policy of the united states truman said establishing the characteristic linkage between world war ii and the cold war is the creation of conditions in which we and other nations will be able to work out a way of life free from coercion our victory was won over countries which sought to impose their will and their way of life upon other nations the moral and rhetorical heightening of the opposition between democracy and communism and incipiently terrorism was a conscious choice truman was famously advised by republican senator arthur vandenburg that securing public and congressional support for unprecedented and costly peacetime intervention into european affairs entailed scaring the hell out of the american people another less visible choice however was to downplay the role of the accountant s ledger which was more overt in an early draft of truman s speech that draft argued that emergency financial support for greece and turkey was now a requirement of world capitalism two great wars and an intervening world depression have weakened the system almost everywhere except in the united states if by default we permit free enterprise to disappear in other countries of the world the very existence of our democracy will be gravely threatened acknowledging the less than compelling purchase of this argument secretary of state dean acheson remarked derisively that it made the whole thing sound like an investment prospectus the moral and rhetorical heightening of the opposition between democracy and communism was a conscious choice truman s delivered address by contrast made use of the words free and freedom twenty four times in a few minutes as if talismanic repetition were enough to hinge the defense of private capital accumulation to the maintenance of popular democracy the world over yet despite the inflated rhetoric economic considerations remained the skeletal core of the truman doctrine buried inside the address was the acknowledged collapse of british imperial policy in the region along with an invitation from a dubiously democratic right wing greek government for financial and other assistance in support of better public administration the imperatives of democracy and self government preeminent political values understood by the u s public were subordinated to building an economy in which a healthy democracy can flourish in a final nod to the bean counters truman noted that the amount he was requesting was a mere fraction of what the united states spent during world war ii and no less justified as an investment in world freedom and world peace the challenge for u s policy makers going forward was to reconcile a lofty rhetorical and moral emphasis upon the principle of political self determination with the necessity of investing military force i e other assistance whose paramount end was securing the market freedoms of national and international capitalists the teleological and tautological proposition that a substratum of properly capitalist economic relations organically yielded a democratic harvest would be the farmer s almanac of a rising generation of modernization theorists but the reality on the ground in a world where the main provenance of self determination was defined by the bloody rearguard defense of colonial prerogatives on the part of the united states most important allies and industrial partners was bitter and far less susceptible to universalizing nostrums straight talking u s policy makers particularly those at the center of the military apparatus knew it the following year for example george kennan author of the containment doctrine a protégé of forrestal and the single most influential strategic foreign policy thinker of the moment offered a strikingly candid version of the task at hand in a classified memo that consciously punctured the universalist ambit of the truman doctrine we have about 50 of the world s wealth but only 6 3 of its population this disparity is particularly great as between ourselves and the peoples of asia in this situation we cannot fail to be the object of envy and resentment our real task in the coming period is to devise a pattern of relationships which will permit us to maintain this position of disparity without positive detriment to our security to do so we will have to dispense with all sentimentality and day dreaming and our attention will have to be concentrated everywhere on our immediate national objectives we need not deceive ourselves that we can afford today the luxury of altruism and world benefaction emphasis added when thinking about nations and peoples particularly those outside of europe kennan again foregrounded a logic of investment and risk management and he advised restraint and limitation of liability espe cially with respect to the peoples of asia are going to go ahead whatever we do with the development of their political forms and mutual interrelationships in their own way kennan warned that the coming period would be neither liberal nor peaceful and that such countries were likely to fall for varying periods under the influence of moscow whose ideology has a greater lure for such peoples and probably greater reality than anything we could oppose to it our people would ever willingly concede to such a purpose in this light he concluded that the united states needed to dispense with commitments rhetorical and otherwise to unreal objectives such as human rights the raising of living standards and democratization the day is not far off when we are going to have to deal in straight power concepts despite the rhetoric of freedom economic considerations remained the skeletal core of the truman doctrine this view is sometimes depicted as an exemplary instance of realism wiser and more in tune with the messy uneven world that emerged from world war ii and a point of view that had it been heeded may have prevented the costly overreach of global cold war especially blunders such as the vietnam war which kennan long retired to academia opposed the concept of realism however fails to grasp the functional logic of risk and threat assessment the insistent and anxious hedging and speculation that made the careers and fortunes of kennan forrestal and many that followed them forrestal fretted obsessively in his diary along these lines i am more impressed than ever as things develop in the world today that policy may be frequently shaped by events unless someone has a strong and clear mental grasp of events strong enough and clear enough so that he is able to shape policy rather than letting it be developed by accidents this recurrent epistemic anxiety initiated an insistent demand for anticipatory policy abiding mistrust and the maintenance of a preponderance of force as forrestal bluntly put it power is needed until we are sure of the reign of law despite his long period of service within a new deal liberal political milieu forrestal like kennan was disinterested in universalizing the scope of political self determination overseas recognizing as more press ing the preservation of a capitalist economy built on uneven development and asymmetric military power at a world scale electrified upon reading kennan s long telegram 1946 forrestal viewed his fellow princeton man as a kindred soul one who had intuited similar grounds of orientalist menace inscrutability and immunity to anything but the language of force in soviet conduct it was forrestal who brought kennan to washington d c from moscow and into the policy making apparatus both men were solicitous toward the value of rank and privilege tolerant of authoritarian deviations from liberal standards and assured that freedom from coercion was the provenance of those who in kennan s words were already imbued with anglo saxon traditions of compromise forrestal framed his own deference for hierarchy in terms of the prerogatives of corporate capitalism the idea that practical men of business rather than reformers and intellectuals had won world war ii and needed to be running the world going forward among his more forceful conclusions was that liberal globalism would be disastrous if it were not steeled with counterrevolutionary animus as he confided to diplomat stanton griffiths between hitler your friends to the east and the intellectual muddlers who have had the throttle for the last ten years the practical people are going to have a hell of a time getting the world out of receivership and when the miracles are not produced the crackpots may demand another chance in which to really finish the job at that time it will be of greatest importance that the democratic party speaks for the liberals but not for the revolutionaries forrestal used corporate capitalism to frame his own deference for hierarchy practical men of business rather than reformers and intellectuals had won world war ii for these realists even more than the wooly moralists they sometimes ridiculed it was the credibility of u s threats of force that ensured the freedom and mobility of productive capital and supported its resource needs and allied interests across an ever widening sphere of a more aristocratic and consciously anti democratic mien kennan likewise recognized that the animating logic was not strictly anti communist but counterrevolutionary indeed even racial the inevitable dissolution of the colonial system meant that the challenge of u s policy in the coming period was broader than the struggle with soviet communism as all persons with grievances whether economic or racial will be urged to seek redress not in mediation and compromise but in defiant violent struggle inspired by communist appeals poor will be set against rich black against white young against old newcomers against established residents by eliding soviet designs with those of heterogeneous movements demanding effective sovereignty and challenging material deprivation forrestal and his colleagues contributed to a perverse recasting of the dynamic of european colonial disintegration as the field of soviet imperial expansion this rhetorical and ideological frame practically demanded the militarization of u s foreign policy with u s counterforce the only alternative to a world ruled by force as such along with arthur radford forrestal was instrumental in developing the central intelligence agency cia and that agency s work soon echoed his in 1948 for instance a cia document entitled the break up of colonial empires and its implications for us security defined expressions of economic nationalism and racial antagonism as primary sources of friction between the colonial powers and the us on the one hand and the states of the near and far east on the other the cia s analysts suggested that poverty and a legacy of anti colonial grievances rendered colonized and formerly colonized peoples peculiarly susceptible to soviet penetration and warned that the gravest danger facing the united states was that decolonizing nations might fall into alignment with the ussr at the same time they faulted europe s colonial powers for their failure to satisfy the aspirations of their dependent areas and advised them to devise formulae that will retain their good will as emergent or independent states envisioning u s responsibility to author such formulae in the future the classified brief concluded that the united states should adopt a more positive and sympathetic attitude toward the national aspirations of these areas including policy that at least partially meets their demands for economic assistance otherwise it will risk their becoming actively antagonistic toward the us including loss of access to previously assured sources of raw materials markets and military bases the rheotric of counterforce practically demaded the militarization of u s foreign policy while the emerging u s foreign policy clearly accepted the un resolvable antagonism toward the soviet union the challenge of the future as the cia argued was how the united states should address the increasing fragmentation of the non soviet world or in a word decolonization the means for assessing risk and reward in this expansive and heterogeneous terrain of imperial disintegration were by no means clear but it is revealing that the possibility of potential alignments between decolonizing nations and soviet power was far less concrete and worrisome to the united states than the more definite and delineated material losses faced by the united states and the colonial powers with which it had aligned itself namely being deprived access to formerly assured sources of raw materials markets and military bases in other words the challenge of the future as kennan had underlined was to devise formulae to buttress the forms of political authority that sustained economic inequality at a world scale in the face of inevitable revolt and revolution against such authority and the social conditions it supported despite his later misgivings kennan had authored the concept whose rhetorical elasticity and ideological indeterminacy proved crucial to fashioning a nemesis that suited this consciously expansionist vision of u s economic and military power with the creation of the cia the national security council and forrestal s own new position of secretary of defense these years saw the growth of a national security bureaucracy that was divorced from meaningful oversight and public accountability for its actions including myriad moral failures and calamities a covert anti soviet destabilization campaign in eastern europe for example greenlit by forrestal and kennan enlisted ukrainian partisans who had worked with the nazis this type of activity would become routine in latin america asia and africa where kennan derided respect for the delicate fiction of sovereignty that undeserving unprepared peoples had been allowed to extend over the resources of the earth over the next quarter century fewer than 400 individuals operated the national security bureaucracy with some individuals enjoying decades of influence that the top tier was dominated by white men who were ivy league educated lawyers bankers and corporate executives often with ties to armament related industries lends irony to official fearmongering about armed conspiracies mounted by small groups let alone the idea that the role of the united states was to defend free choice against coercion imposed by nonrepresentative minorities this fact perhaps more than any other suggests that as much as the cold war represented a competition between incompatible if by no means coeval or equally powerful systems of rule i e communist and capitalist it was marked by convergences too the soviet empire of justice and the u s empire of liberty engaged in mimetic cross national interventions clandestine counter subversive maneuvers and forms of clientelism that were all dictated by elite ideologically cohesive national security bureaucracies immune from popular scrutiny and democratic oversight those charged with governing the controlling seat of u s globalism consistently doubted the compatibility of normative democratic requirements and the security challenges they envisioned including distrust that often bordered on contempt for the publics in whose name they claimed to act we are today in the midst of a cold war our enemies are to be found abroad and at home remarked bernard baruch coining the term that names this era in this context the survival of the state is not a matter of law acheson famously declared an argument similar to one being advanced by former nazi jurist carl schmitt vandenberg echoing defenders of roosevelt s accretive accumulation of war powers was positively wistful lamenting the heavy handicap that the united states faced when imperiled by an autocracy like russia where decisions require nothing but a narrow executive mandate for forrestal the most dangerous spot is our own country because the people are so eager for peace and have such a distaste for war that they will grasp for any sign of a solution of a problem that has had them deeply worried as much as the cold war represented a competition between incompatible systems of rule it was marked by convergences too forrestal felt that the danger at home manifested itself most frustratingly in the threat that congressional budgeting posed to military requirements the preservation of a state of peace was a costly proposition when it revolved around open ended threat prevention the world over upholding the permanent preponderance of u s military power at a global scale required a new type of fiscal imagination one that had to be funded by the future promise of tax receipts during his final year in office forrestal s diary records in mind numbing detail his worries about acquiring pentagon funding adequate to his projections for global military reach in forrestal s view budgetary considerations were captive to the wrong baseline of peak of war danger and combatting aggression rather than to maintenance of a permanent state of adequate military preparation a fascinating aspect of these budget wrangles is forrestal s manic efforts to translate future oriented geostrategic needs into precise dollar values just months before his forced retirement and eventual suicide he confided to walter g andrews our biggest headache at the moment of course is the budget the president has set the ceiling at 14 billion 4 against the pared down requirements that we put in of 16 billion 9 i am frank to say however i have the greatest sympathy with him because he is determined not to spend more than we take in in taxes he is a hard money man if ever i saw one despite his grudging admiration for the stolid truman forrestal s wall street background had left him at ease in a more speculative or liquid universe at that precise moment he was devising accounting gimmicks to offset near billion dollar costs of stockpiling raw materials as a capital item that could be removed from the budget the important point to emphasize is the relationship between two interrelated forms of speculation and accounting economic and military in which an absolute inflation of threats tempted a final break with lingering hard money orthodoxies and a turn to deficit spending forrestal did not live to see the breakthrough but his work paid off as acheson described it the korean war the first hot war of the cold war era saved the fledgling national security state with its outbreak the dream of eternal military liquidity was realized when leon keyserling the liberal economist serving as truman s chairman of the council of economic advisors argued that military expenditures functioned as an economic growth engine that theory then underpinned nsc 68 the document that justified massive u s defense outlays for the foreseeable future and which was authored by another forrestal protégé paul nitze by yoking dramatically increased federal spending to security prerogatives military keynesianism thus achieved a permanent augmentation of u s state capacity no longer achievable under appeals to keynesianism alone the embedding of the global priorities of a national security state which sometimes appears inevitable in retrospect was by no means assured in the years leading up to the korean war it was challenged by uncooperative allies a war weary or recalcitrant u s public and politicians who were willing to cede u s military primacy and security prerogatives in the name of international cooperation but by 1947 men such as forrestal had laid the groundwork for rejecting the rooseveltian internationalist inheritance arguing it was necessary to accept the fact that the concept of one world upon which the united nations was based is no longer valid and that we are in political fact facing a division into two worlds although the militarization of u s policy is often understood to have been reactive and conditioned by threats from the outside his ruminations illustrate how militarized globalism was actively conceived as anticipatory policy in advance of direct confrontations with the soviet union by just a few architects and defense intellectuals men under whose sway we continue to live and die the cold war says more about how u s elites imagined their freedom than it does about enabling other people to be free ultimately the declaration of the cold war says more about how these u s elites represented and imagined their freedom and envisioned the wider world as a domain for their own discretionary action and accumulation than it did about enabling other people to be free let alone shaping the terms of a durable and peaceful international order as early as 1946 forrestal began taking important businessmen on tours of the wreckage of pacific island battles which also happened to be future sites for u s nuclear testing forestall described these ventures as an effort to provide long term insurance against the disarmament wave the shadows of which i can already see peeping over the horizon the future of the bomb and the empire of bases were already on his mind forrestal recognized that force and threat are always fungible things to be leveraged in the service of the reality that truly interested him the reality made by men who own the future for those of his cast of mind international order was never more than the fig leaf of wealth and power as he noted in a 1948 letter to hansen baldwin of the new york times it has long been one of my strongly held beliefs that the word security ought to be stricken from the language and the word risk substituted i came to that conclusion out of my own business experience it was the job after all of these east coast lawyers and moneymen to make sure all bets were hedged and forrestal knew that speculation could turn into an investment gone bad as a leading investor in the cold war project he wanted a guaranteed return even if the rule of law never arrived and even when the price was ruin

sudanese president omar al bashir since he took power in a 1989 coup protesters have been taking to the streets frequently across sudan since dec 19 the protests were initially triggered by price rises and cash shortages but evolved into demonstrations against bashir and his national congress party monday s protesters carried a large banner that read free press or no press as they walked down

governors of sudan s 18 states and replacing them with military and security officials the statement also called on bashir to end the state of emergency end torture and release all political prisoners

security services to act with impunity against peaceful protesters the latest attacks against unarmed students in the university of medical sciences and technology and against peaceful protesters in

opposition human rights defenders and other protesters in detention some of those with whom the dialogue is set to take place have been arbitrarily detained for over two months now an independent

million or 14 respectively compared in 2017 this decrease was due to lower sales from both segments partially offset on a year to date basis by higher foreign exchange rates impacting translated revenues from the advanz pharma international segment the advanz pharma international segment revenue for the year ended december 31 2018 decreased by 61 7 million or 13 due to 79 6 million lower revenue primarily as a result of volume declines on key products including liothyronine sodium trazodone and carbimazole partially offset by higher revenue due to volume increases for nitrofurantoin and argipressin combined with favourable foreign exchange rates positively impacting translated results by 17 8 million the advanz pharma north america segment revenue for the year ended december 31 2018 decreased by 27 4 million or 17 when compared to 2017 mainly as a result of lower volumes on key products including donnatal dibenzyline authorized generic and plaquenil authorized generic partially offset by higher revenue on certain other products including dibenzyline and orapred gross profit for the year ended december 31 2018 decreased by 74 4 million or 17 compared to 2017 primarily due to the revenue declines described above gross profit percentage for the year ended december 31 2018 decreased by 3 compared to 2017 primarily due to a 3 decrease in gross profit percentage within the advanz pharma international segment partially offset by a 1 increase in gross profit percentage within the advanz pharma north america segment the change in gross profit percentage for both segments is due to a shift in the mix of product sales within each segment operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2018 decreased by 1 1 billion or 67 compared to 2017 operating expenses were lower primarily due to 1 1 billion lower impairment charges recorded during 2018 excluding impairments operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2018 increased by 61 1 million or 15 compared to 2017 the increase in operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2018 excluding impairments is primarily due to 54 2 million higher restructuring related acquisition and other costs mainly associated with the company s recapitalization transaction which concluded in september 2018 and 24 0 million higher amortization charges on intangible assets partially offset by 6 2 million lower share based compensation expense and 6 5 million lower general and administrative costs general and administrative expenses reflect costs related to salaries and benefits professional and consulting fees public company costs travel facility leases and other administrative expenditures general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2018 decreased by

promotion and sale of the company s broad portfolio of products across the company s segments selling and marketing costs for the year ended december 31 2018 decreased by 1 4 million or 4 compared to 2017 the decreases consisted of a 1 5 million or 6 decrease within the advanz pharma international segment partially offset by a 0 1 million or 1 increase within the north america segment the decrease within the advanz pharma international segment is primarily as a result of lower costs associated with sales promotion and advertising activities as well as reduced salaries and benefits costs due to

of donnatal partially offset by lower bad debt expenses research and development expenses reflect costs for clinical trial activities product development professional and consulting fees and services associated with the activities of the medical clinical and scientific affairs quality assurance costs regulatory compliance and drug safety costs pharmacovigilence of the company research and development costs for the year ended december 31 2018 decreased by 1 8 million or 6 primarily due to refunds of regulatory fees timing of various non recurring projects and lower consulting costs related to ongoing projects these lower research and development costs are partially offset by higher costs associated with validation and stability testing activities within the advanz pharma international segment adjusted ebitda for the year ended december 31 2018 decreased by 65 1 million or 21 compared to 2017 these declines are primarily due to lower sales and gross profits from both

recognized measures under international financial reporting standards ifrs these non ifrs measures are not recognized measures under ifrs and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by ifrs and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies when used these measures are defined in such terms as to allow the reconciliation to the closest ifrs measure these measures are provided as additional information to complement those ifrs measures by providing further understanding of the company s results of operations from management s perspective accordingly they should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute to the company s financial information reported under ifrs management uses non ifrs measures such as ebitda adjusted ebitda and adjusted gross profit to provide investors with supplemental information of the company s operating performance and thus highlight trends in the company s core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on ifrs financial measures management believes that securities analysts investors and other interested parties frequently use non ifrs measures in the evaluation of issuers management also uses non ifrs measures in order to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period prepare annual operating budgets to assess its ability to meet future debt service requirements in making capital expenditures and to consider the business s working capital requirements readers are cautioned that the non ifrs measures contained herein may not be appropriate for any other purpose adjusted gross profit as used herein adjusted gross profit is defined as gross profit adjusted for non cash fair value increases to the cost of acquired inventory from a business

sufficiency of our existing capital sources our ability to raise additional capital to fund cash requirements for future operations the uncertainties involved in prospect development and property acquisitions or dispositions and in projecting future rates of production or future reserves the timing of development expenditures and drilling of wells the impact of natural disasters on our present and future operations the impact of government regulation and the operating hazards attendant to the oil and natural gas business initial production ip rates are discreet data points in each well s productive history these rates are sometimes actual rates and sometimes extrapolated or normalized rates as such the rates for a particular well may decline over time and change as additional data becomes available peak production rates are not necessarily indicative or predictive of future production rates or economic rates of return from such wells and should not be relied upon for such purpose the ability of the company or the relevant operator to maintain expected levels of production from a well is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including those referenced and discussed above in addition methodology the company and other industry participants utilize to calculate peak ip rates may not be consistent and as a result the values reported may not be directly and

we didn t know it at the time but 10 years ago this week things started looking up on march 9 2009 the s p 500 closed at 676 53 the lowest point it hit over the course of the great recession today the index stands at around 2750 although the implosion of the subprime real estate market is most frequently cited as the catalyst for the recession that historic downturn actually was the result of a perfect storm of economic occurrences said dan north chief economist at euler hermes north america you had a bust in an asset bubble an inverted yield curve and an oil price spike he told nbc news on top of that a sudden unavailability of liquidity froze banking activities and precipitated a global financial crisis the federal reserve responded with the extraordinary steps of dropping the benchmark interest rate to 0 percent and embarking on quantitative easing programs that would eventually grow its balance sheet to 4 5 trillion both steps were radical ones calculated to pour money into the economy and jump start lending in addition to monetary policy congress passed a number of stimulus programs aimed at helping people dealing with foreclosures and job losses the first step in all this was arresting the decline with government programs that tried to take the position of the lender of last resort and basically trying to step in when private capital was too fearful said sameer samana senior global market strategist for the wells fargo investment institute there s kind of an inherent tendency for economies to recover said bruce mccain chief investment strategist for key private bank but the economy of late 2008 needed an extra push to get that momentum going at the early stage the monetary backstopping the federal reserve provided during the crisis was crucial it s less clear that the stimulus they ve provided since then has been effective for the economy as opposed to the market mccain said although the recession was officially over in june 2009 just three months after the stock market hit its trough many ordinary americans remained in dire financial straits consumers have been the key to growth said mark zandi chief economist of moody s analytics and until that spending rebounded the rest of the recovery remained muted too the missing ingredient jobs i think the tricky part is that main street is largely dependent on employment prospects samana said when businesses are uncertain about the future they re very reluctant to add additional workers he said it took an unprecedented six years before the record 9 million jobs that vanished in the recession reemerged north said we went through the slowest recovery since world war ii he said a lot of that may have been that people just stayed on the sidelines aided by expanded unemployment insurance and frustrated by employers who would only commit to filling jobs on a part time or temporary basis now a decade after the market trough unemployment is at a historic low and wage growth is managing to keep abreast of inflation albeit barely financial industry reforms and improved confidence among business leaders as well as consumers have lent stability to the nation s economic growth we re in a better place than we were 10 years ago zandi said the changes post crisis will make it less likely that we ll have the booms and the busts the banking system for example holds a lot more capital that makes it safer the system has much more liquidity than it did pre crisis we ve certainly come a long way with respect to the overall outlook of businesses and investors mccain said economic expansion for much of the recovery was muted but mccain suggests that this pace might have ultimately been critical for the longevity of our current growth cycle it s been a difficult time getting to here but when you have slower growth you can have growth for a longer period of time he said there s nothing inherently that says this cycle for the u s in particular has to end any time soon

this week the trump administration released another irresponsible unserious budget that doubles down on exploding the deficit and giving tax cuts to the wealthy while cutting medicare medicaid and investments in our nationâ s future it has been swiftly dismissed as dead on arrival hereâ s a look at what the presidentâ s own party editorial boards and the press are saying about the presidentâ s irresponsible budget the reception among republicans has been lukewarm senate appropriations chairman richard shelby r al â most of the presidentâ s budgets and i have been here a while are mainly suggestionsâ you know we look at them but i donâ t know any of them that have been enacted into law â editorial boards are dismissing the budget proposal washington post even by trumpâ s standards this yearâ s budget stands out for dishonesty â â the best that can be said for president trumpâ s 4 75 trillion budget plan for fiscal 2020 is that it has no chance of becoming law this is almost always true of presidential budgets because ultimately congress does the nitty gritty work on spending legislation even by the standards of previous nonstarter white house blueprints however mr trumpâ s effort this year stands out for dishonesty and warped prioritiesâ thereâ s more cuts to refugee assistance while asking 8 6 billion for a border wallâ you get the picture â â amid all of the outrages of the trump administration and congress the fact that the federal budget deficit has surged by 77 percent above the same period last year somehow got lostâ which is another way of saying our goose is cooked the growing red ink in the federal government can and will erode the economic advantages the united states has from its entrepreneurial culture and rule of law the tax cuts not only made matters worse they also have triggered a kind of arms race in irresponsibilityâ for the past 30 years democrats have been more responsible â or perhaps less irresponsible â than republicans on budgetary matters the last time the budget was balanced was during the administration of president bill clinton â â the budget is a major statement about presidential priorities and trumpâ s are dishearteningâ to partially offset the tax cuts and military spending increases the budget proposes to take a chainsaw to a number of federal benefit programs including food stamps state welfare block grants disability benefits and the earned income tax credit on medicaid and several other healthcare related programs the administration seeks to save money not by bringing down the cost of care but by making it available to fewer people all these cuts would disproportionately affect poor people â â trump s budget blueprint which includes billions of taxpayer dollars for his vanity wall on our nation s southern border steep cuts to medicare medicaid education and the environmental protection agency to name but a few is deader than most spending proposals that come out of 1600 pennsylvania ave â â â trump is plowing ahead as if the past two years never happened a questionable strategy exemplified by his request for 8 6 billion to build more than 700 miles of the border wall that congress has repeatedly rebuffed trump was so frustrated in his efforts to spend considerably less than that on the southern border that he forced an unprecedented 35 day federal shutdown and declared a false national emergencyâ trumpâ s unbalanced budget certainly serves as a useful and troubling statement of his values fortunately it wonâ t serve as the budget â â it should come as no surprise that the 4 7 trillion spending plan released monday by the office of management and budget is a messâ and thatâ s not even mentioning that there is of course an extra 8 6 billion to build a wall along the nationâ s southern border a project that congress just weeks ago voted to dial down in favor of a more rational approach to border securityâ in short this is not a serious budget by a serious administration this is a political document and as has become commonplace with this administration it is mostly a signal to far right conservatives that mr trump stands by their priorities â tax cuts that skew toward the wealthy and spending cuts that skew toward the 99 percentâ that the budget does so little about debt that now totals more than 22 trillion is just another indicator that republicans have largely abandoned the old â fiscal restraintâ mantra that served them so well when there was a democrat in the white house â â the presidentâ s fiscal year 2020 budget proposes record high outlays of 4 75 trillion in 2020 a 4 8 percent increase following about a 10 percent increase this year the budget projects taking in 3 65 trillion in taxesâ failing to slow debt growth will depress economic expansion and wages and drive up interest rates it is a disservice to future generationsâ republicans when in full control of congress during trumpâ s first two years ignored the deficit after having hounded obama about it for eight years they passed a massive tax cut targeted at the rich without any corresponding spending reductions â â the trump administration unveiled its fiscal 2020 budget proposal this week but it will never become law it is useful however as a snapshot of white house priorities the vocal critics of president donald trump wasted little time chortling about the projected deficits and rising debt this spending plan would require particularly given the president has bragged in the past about his commitment to balancing the budget the criticism has merit mr trump has abandoned all pretense â and the news coverage has highlighted how the budget is dead on arrival usa today â dead on arrival trump s 2020 budget an unlikely wish list in divided congress â unlikely to gain any traction in congress â â president donald trump called for deep cuts in environmental and safety net programs billions more for his border wall and a huge boost for the military in a 4 75 trillion proposed 2020 budget that isâ â â trump has proposed many of those same changes before without much success â last yearâ s budget which came at a time when republicans controlled both the house and senate included 18 billion for the border wall his 2017 budget proposed eliminating 62 federal agencies entirely congress largely ignored those requests and many othersâ that partly reflects a politically divided congress but also the fact that the president s nonbinding budget has always been viewed mostly as a wish list â â but even republicans remained noncommittal about the white house proposals â us news â 2020 plan is being treated by capitol hill as a presidential campaign rally speech designed to appeal to the president s base and having no chance of actually getting enacted â â â theâ â trump s budget late this year because of the record 35 day partial government shutdown seeks to get a project that was trump s signature promise in his campaign â a southern border wallâ â the plan is going nowhere on capitolâ hill â â missing from the budget blueprint is a path to reduce the nations crippling record 22 trillion debt and the federal budget deficit which was up 77 percent in january from a year previous â washington post â trumpâ s gop allies received the budget plan with a lukewarm embraceâ â â â â â â according to trumpâ s budget the spending cuts would do little to reduce what is shaping up to be a colossal deficit in the next several years the budget would spend much more money than it brings in through revenue and that gap is called the deficit â politico â a new battle over how to fund the government that sets up the nation for an even more destructive shutdown when money runs out later this year â â president donald trump sent his annual budget vision to congress on monday startingâ â â the presidentâ s plan seeks deep cuts from agencies like the department of health and human services the environmental protection agency and the state department at the same time it would spend 8 6 billion on a border wall with mexico and boost defense spending to 750 billionâ calling for a total of 2 7 trillion in reductions over 10 years the trump administration is also taking aim at safety net programs including hundreds of billions in cuts to medicare and a request to drum up savings by imposing new restrictions on food stamps housing assistance and aid to families that donâ t make enough money to provide for their children â cnn â â president donald trump delivered a 2020 budget to the democratic controlled house on monday that cuts spending across the board yet still isn t projected to balance for 15 years even with ambitious economic growth forecasts â follow leader hoyer onâ

otherwise be distorted by the effect of certain expenses that we include in net income we believe that adjusted net income provides useful information about our operating results enhances the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects and allows for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision making adjusted net income should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to net income basic and diluted net income per share attributable to ordinary shareholders of huami corporation

final s president and chief executive officer david g hirz president and chief executive officer thanks laura and good afternoon everyone in 2018 smart final recorded a year of solid operational performance across both of our store banners despite continuing challenges from a very low inflation rate sales environment in the fourth quarter we grew sales by 3 2 and 1 9 comparable store sales rate 170 points above our rate of inflation and our seventh consecutive quarter of comp sales growth we also increased merchandise margin in both store banners continue the strong pace of e commerce sales growth selectively open new stores and grew both comparable transaction counts and average ticket in both store banners our strong 1 9 comp sales growth in the quarter was achieved despite approximately 40 basis points of negative impact from the shift of new year s eve sales into the 2019 fiscal year on a two year stacked basis comp store sales were strong up 5 1 we believe that we re achieving these results by maintaining our strong value proposition continuing to increase our assortment of warehouse club pack and private label items and through improving store in stock condition customer service standards and focusing on our key business customer segment our cash generation from operations and reduced capex levels enabled us to significantly reduce overall financial leverage with 51 million debt pay down in the year while maintaining a strong cash position for the full year 2018 net sales were 4 7 billion led by 1 2 comparable store sales growth we estimate inflation in product cost for the full year was less than 0 2 much lower than the historical 2 or higher over the past decade and much lower than the inflation of about 1 we expected as we entered 2018 while we are again seeing some modest product cost inflation early in 2019 in both store banners we re being cautious in our inflation expectations managing environment with low rates of product cost inflation against the backdrop of rising operating costs in all areas of our business including wage rates has been a significant headwind to earnings growth our response has been to focus on transaction and sales growth including e commerce in controlling operating expenses while continuing to focus on great customer service we also continue to focus on our key business customer segment our efforts are paying off in the smart final banner comp sales growth in our business segment grew almost double the rate of overall banner sales in the fourth quarter we re pleased with the sequential improvement in our comparable store sales metric and the solid positive contribution from both the smart final and smart foodservice store banners sales growth was well in excess of the underlying product inflation rate and we had average traffic and ticket growth in both store banners for the first time in six quarters in the fourth quarter of 2018 overall product cost inflation was 0 2 comprised of 0 1 deflation in the smart final banner and 1 3 inflation in the smart foodservice banner an improvement from the 0 7 deflation in the third quarter of 2018 it was much lower than the 1 7 inflation rate in the 2017 fourth quarter in the fourth quarter of this year our overall gross margin rate was stable with growth in merchandise margin largely offset by increases in distribution and occupancy costs our gaap operating results in the fourth quarter and the full year were impacted by valuation charges of approximately 120 million after tax with the goodwill impairment charge as the largest factor rick will discuss the charges in more detail in support to note that these are non cash charges and do not reflect the change in our view that there are substantial future growth opportunities for the smart final store banner in the fourth quarter adjusted ebitda of 41 5 million and comp sales growth of 1 9 were in line with our guidance in today s operating environment we remain focused on enhancing customer shopping experience in both our store banners through online channels in store merchandising and customer service initiatives continuing to invest in our people service and infrastructure to strengthen our competitive position and maintaining a disciplined approach to capital spending prioritizing our strong operating cash generation to reduce balance sheet leverage i d like to spend a few minutes discussing our progress on these fronts we ve been successful in our efforts to enhance our customer shopping experiences the customer service initiatives we launched in the third quarter began to take hold we continue to focus on engaging with our customers reducing front end wait times and maintaining strong in stock levels the combination of these efforts resulted in the highest mystery shopper scores we ve ever received as well as new record level in stock rates in the smart final banner both of these initiatives help support positive strong comp sales and year over year comparable traffic increases for the first time since the second quarter of 2017 in the smart final banner our club size offerings continue to resonate with our customers delivering comparable store sales growth well above our banner comp sales rate both among our business and household customers these strong comp sales were a result of new merchandising initiatives the addition of almost 300 new club size items in 2018 investments in competitive pricing and strong execution of retail private label sales were again strong in the quarter with comp sales accelerating to 2 with the strong 28 penetration rate driven by multiple sales initiatives focused on new item innovation in store merchandising brand consolidation to our flagship first street label and an exciting label refresh of over 2 400 existing first street items sales to our business customer remain strong representing more than 29 of total banner sales business customers are one of our key differentiators in the market and our sales efforts around this customer segment are resonating delivering comparable store sales growth it was almost doubled the overall smart final banner growth rate given us confidence in our ability to continue to accelerate this highly profitable segment we see continuing potential in building online sales both in delivery and to the buy online pickup in store channels in the smart final banner we recorded 65 increase in e commerce sales for the fourth quarter with a primary focus on delivery where the average order remains approximately 80 more than double the average in store sale and with the higher margin mix than the typical in store sale in the smart foodservice banner we saw over 500 growth in e commerce sales for the second consecutive quarter led by our buy online pickup in store next day offering our average e commerce transaction is more than 7 times the average in store sale with a similar margin mix in 2019 our focus in e commerce is to leverage the investments we ve made in our it infrastructure during the past two years by expanding our customer facing profile this year to include our own e commerce order insight for both banners our goal is to control more of the customer interactions to better market our assortment and to build customer loyalty while controlling e commerce costs and leveraging promotional revenue opportunities through cpg monetization we look forward to updating you on our progress throughout 2019 additionally our investments in digital and it infrastructure over the past couple of years has resulted in many improvements throughout the company including a major upgrade in supply chain systems new master data systems new product buying systems and new core sap financial and analytics systems in 2019 we ll rollout five new major systems sap gk register software a shelf tag and sign program computer assisted ordering enhanced labor scheduling systems and an updated mobile app to leverage the new in house digital platform for both delivery and click and collect customers we also continue to selectively invest in brick and mortar operations and believe the combination of our unique merchandising value pricing and investments and customer focus initiatives will continue to support customer traffic in today s environment during the fourth quarter we opened our 200 smart final extra store in long beach california relocated the legacy smart final store to the extra format and opened two new smart foodservice stores we ended 2018 with 326 stores including 260 smart final banner stores and 66 smart foodservice stores for 2019 we continue to be cautious about new store development for our smart final banner stores given the challenging industry environment this year we plan to open one new smart final extra store and complete one or two legacy the extra store relocations in the smart foodservice banner we plan to open four new stores in 2019 all within our existing footprint we continue to be optimistic about growth prospects for this banner which is strong fundamentals good food away from home growth trends and a robust small business environment rick will provide more detail on our guidance for the first quarter and full year of 2019 but thus far in the first quarter we re seeing some continued improvement in inflation in both of our store banners and continued strength in average ticket partially offsetting these positive trends much of the west coast is experienced above average in fact record levels of rain and snow which have been a headwind to sales and transaction growth so in summary i m pleased with our overall performance in 2018 in 2019 we ll maintain our focus on the strength that keep our store banners unique in our market segments providing quality merchandise and customer service to support continued growth in traffic and transaction size and making measured investments in our people systems and infrastructure and with that i ll hand the call over to rick rick phegley senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you dave and good afternoon everyone today i ll discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2018 results along with our outlook for 2019 there s a lot to discuss in the financial statements today and i ll break the discussion into three parts first i ll review the numbers as reported on a gaap basis and outline the process and results of the non cash impairment in valuation charges taken in the quarter which drove an overall gaap net loss for the quarter and year second i ll focus on adjusted net income and adjusted ebitda results which we believe are the most useful metrics in understanding our operational results and third i ll detail our guidance for the 2019 year so let s begin with the gaap statements and sales as noted in today s release consolidated net sales in the fourth quarter were 1 1 billion up 3 2 versus the fourth quarter of 2017 net sales growth was driven by the sales contribution of stores that opened over the last 12 months as well as consolidated comparable store sales growth of 1 9 comparable store sales growth was supported by positive traffic and strong average ticket growth in both store banners in the smart final banner sales increased by 2 7 over the prior year and average ticket in the fourth quarter increased by 1 1 despite an underlying estimated deflation rate of 0 1 comparable store traffic in the smart final banner improved to a positive 0 2 an improvement of 160 basis points from the prior quarter and represents the first quarter of positive traffic in the banner in over a year the gross margin rate in the smart final banner was 15 6 slightly lower than the fourth quarter of 2017 as improvements in merchandise margin were offset by increased distribution and occupancy costs in the smart foodservice banner sales increased by 5 from the prior year quarter with a comparable store sales growth rate of 4 3 average transaction amount in the fourth quarter increased by 3 5 with an underlying estimated inflation rate of 1 1 store traffic on a year over year basis improved by 0 7 an improvement of 90 basis points from the prior quarter including the impact of cannibalization from new stores the smart foodservice banner gross margin rate in the fourth quarter was 15 2 an improvement of 60 basis points compared to the prior year quarter a stronger merchandise margin accounted for most of the increase with distribution and occupancy expense rates fairly flat as a percentage of sales on a gaap basis our fourth quarter net loss was 121 8 million and full year net loss was 112 2 million these results include the unfavorable effect of non cash impairment charges and tax valuation allowances taken in the fourth quarter in total these charges amounted to 119 6 million on an after tax basis the largest of the charges was a 94 million impairment charge related to goodwill goodwill on our balance sheet was established in 2012 when the company was acquired and by gaap rules is not amortized the accounting standard asc 350 requires an annual assessment of the carrying value of goodwill in light of external factors such as equity market valuations and internal factors such as projections of future sales and cash flow in light of the ongoing declines in industry market equity values during 2018 we have taken a non cash impairment charge related to the smart final banner only it s important to remember that this was simply an accounting judgment within the context of asc 350 and as dave noted this is not an indication that we have changed our view of the attractiveness of future store investments in either of our banners we also recorded other non cash impairment and valuation charges related to certain assets including store fixed assets and deferred tax assets of 25 6 million after tax the same overall factors which led to the goodwill impairment led to these charges as well it s important to note when viewing the segment reporting detail presented in today s release that these impairment charges have been allocated to the reporting units and the store fixed assets impairment charges impact the operating and administrative expense line in both store banners we will more fully detailed all of these charges in our report on form 10 k which we expect to file by this friday now moving on to the second part to better understand operating performance we focus on adjusted ebitda which by excluding unusual and certain other charges is more useful for comparison and analysis in conjunction with sales trends in the fourth quarter adjusted ebitda was 41 5 million and for the full year adjusted ebitda was 181 8 million in line with the guidance provided on our last quarterly call as anticipated in that guidance adjusted ebitda on a year to year basis was pressured by the low sales inflation rate particularly in the smart final banner adjusted net income was 6 0 million or 0 08 per fully diluted share in the fourth quarter and was 31 4 million or 0 42 per fully diluted share for the full year 2018 adjusted eps was below our guidance range as a result of a change in the effective tax rate from our prior assumption turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow statements we ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of 67 2 million our working capital remains well controlled and in line with our expectations with investment in inventories of 301 9 million for the full year 2018 we projected capital expenditures of 80 million to 90 million approximately 40 lower than the prior year and actual spending was about 86 million after adjusting for landlord and other third party allowances and reimbursements our cash flow allowed us to pay down 51 million of revolving credit debt for the full year this reduced our total debt balance to 648 3 million at year end as of the end of the year we had borrowed 30 million under our 200 million revolving credit facility and the net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio at the end of 2018 was about 3 2 times in line with our expectation for the year we ended the year with cash generated from operations of 141 2 million and we remain in a solid liquidity position now for the third part of today s discussion turning to 2019 guidance factored into our guidance for 2019 is slight inflation in product costs in the range of 0 8 and a stable competitive environment at this level of product inflation we expect that we will continue to experience income statement pressure from inflation in operating administrative costs at rates higher than product cost inflation for the fiscal year 2019 we expect to see net sales growth in the range of 2 5 to 3 5 including the effect of new stores and relocations we expect to see comparable store sales growth for fiscal 2019 in the range of 1 5 to 2 5 capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of 65 million to 75 million including expenditures related to new stores store maintenance remodels and relocations and infrastructure and digital investments and we expect our effective tax rate for 2019 to be approximately 27 based on this we expect adjusted ebitda in the range of 185 million to 195 million for the full year 2019 adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of 32 million to 36 million and adjusted eps is expected to be in the range of 0 41 to 0 46 per share for the full year on a fully diluted basis based on an assumption of 77 million to 78 million fully diluted shares and while we don t normally give quarterly guidance our expectation is that the first quarter of 2019 will produce overall sales comps in the 1 75 to 2 range and adjusted ebitda in the 25 million to 28 million range and with that i ll turn the call back over to dave for some concluding remarks before we turn to q a david g hirz president and chief executive officer thanks rick as we ve discussed i m very proud of the solid operational execution our teams achieved in 2018 in spite of a difficult operating environment we re confident that our plans for 2019 will continue to build solid growth in both the smart final and smart foodservice store banners and provide the opportunity for continuing earnings growth and financial deleveraging while maintaining our strong value position in the market i d like to thank our 12 000 associates for their hard work and dedication every day to making both of our store banners attractive places for business and household customers to shop both in store and online before i open up the call for questions i ll note that there have been recent press reports and market speculation regarding our equity ownership and a potential for ownership change we ve consistently maintained a no comment posture regarding market rumors and we won t comment today regarding any such speculation we appreciate your participation in today s call and with that we look forward to taking your questions questions and answers operator at this time we will be conducting the question and answer session operator instructions our first question comes from the line of rupesh parikh with oppenheimer company please proceed with your question erica eiler oppenheimer company analyst good afternoon it s actually erica eiler on for rupesh thanks a lot for taking our questions so first i was hoping maybe you could touch a little bit more on gross margins and maybe just walk us through some of the key puts and takes for the year that we should be thinking about just any color you can share with regards to your outlook for the year would be super helpful david g hirz president and chief executive officer let me talk about product margin a little bit and then i will have rick talk about few gross margin product margin we are pretty happy in the quarter it was up about 40 points so i think from the prior quarter the smart final banner we re really benefiting from leverage and strategic sourcing now the private label is over 28 of our sale strategic sourcing plays a more important role but as you saw in some of the prepared remarks our sales to business customers which are really profitable for us high margin high private label penetration our penetration in private label and club size all grew at about 2 times the comp rate of the rest of the stores so that really really helps the other thing that s benefiting product margin as we continue to benefit from the continued maturation of new stores our new extra store over the course of the first three years their product margin goes up about 300 points right because their first year is just such an aggressive promotional year for the new stores and we had 14 stores open in 2017 a lot of those store is the end of the store so that maturation is helping us a little bit and then just the mix of extra stores in general if you look at our extra stores the margin in an extra stores 100 points product margin is a 100 points higher than a legacy store and as we ve transitioned over the last several years we ve actually have a 132 more extra stores than we had five years ago and just that mix shift into extra while having a negative impact in og a is a positive impact in the margin so i think all those things are increasing product margin but gross margin rick rick phegley senior vice president and chief financial officer so erica as you know our reported gross margin is product gross margin our merchandise margin as dave has just talked about less three factors less the cost of buying the product that small cost of distribution and cost of occupancy and where we ve seen good growth in product gross margin and actually growth in overall gross margin across the years in the last couple of years we ve seen erosion of the product gross margin increases by the inability to leverage the increases in overall inflation in distribution cost and including fuel and distribution labor as well as inefficiencies in passing through increases in the overall occupancy cost line so we do think that we ll see some improvement in overall gross margin on a reported basis this year but the inflation assumptions are key to being able to see more efficient pass through erica eiler oppenheimer company analyst okay that s helpful and then just last one for me i mean there s obviously been some reports that amazon s going to be opening up new brick and mortar grocery concept in some of your markets i was just curious how you re thinking about the potential for this new competitive dynamic if there s any initial thoughts you can share on that that would be great david g hirz president and chief executive officer yes i would say there is not really and we saw the same articles we understand they re going to open one store in los angeles initially so it s hard to driven what impact if any that could have on smart final i tell you smart final had a number of new entrants in the market over the years starting five years ago and walmart opened 100 supercenters and neighborhood stores all these entered the markets and all of the new market entries the impact in our stores is regardless with their supercenter neighborhood and all the impact in our stores have been very similar but one less than 2 on any individual store and in the year later as we cycle the stores turned positive and we think it really speaks to our differentiated strategy the business customer is so unique the club size customer the club side sales in the quarter of smart final hit 30 of our sales really unique we carry 2 times the number of the club stores and far more than the conventional guys and in private label keeps building we think is adding a component of loyalty to our customer base and that s just helping us with new market entry so while we don t know what you expect we feel really good about our position in the market erica eiler oppenheimer company analyst okay great thank you so much operator our next question comes from the line of karen short with barclays please proceed with your question karen short barclays analyst hi thanks just a couple of questions in terms of the reduced unit growth for fiscal 19 i m assuming that s a function of these other initiatives like sap shelf tag and things that you called out but any color on that and then i wanted to find out i mean on one hand it would seem that reduced unit growth would actually help ebitda dollars for fiscal 19 but there will obviously be an offset from these initiatives so if you could kind of triangulate those david g hirz president and chief executive officer sure our new stores in the smart final banner were going to open one store this year and in last year we opened a few so it s down a little bit and we think again in this market environment that we re in now waiting for inflation to come back every new store we ve opened in 2015 16 17 and 18 in the last four years none of those new stores have existed in inflationary environment so we think it s prudent to open a really small number of stores and we picked a great location for this year and in smart foodservice so we re targeting four stores we think it still makes sense to grow their banner they re doing well we ve opened seven in the last couple of years they re doing good it really isn t trying to balance with digital investment the digital investment this year is i talked in the prepared comments about all the programs coming online during the course of 19 and some of that came online in 18 it really for us wasn t either or we just think the store growth is prudent and again even in this environment of investing in digital we ve reduced our capital last year by about 40 and now in 2019 down again to again 65 million to 75 million so we think it s the right strategy and the lower store count makes sense for us karen short barclays analyst okay but just on the unit count so that is a reduction just from your call back in november so i guess what i m wondering what s changed since november because it didn t appear in november that we are going to be in an inflationary environment in 19 rick phegley senior vice president and chief financial officer so karen i think we are just being cautious about exposing additional capital dollars to what feels like an increasingly uncertain industry environment uncertainty primarily because of the long term view of inflation so while our view of the current year may not have changed much i think we are more cautious about thinking about a return to higher rates of inflation in years beyond 2019 karen short barclays analyst okay rick phegley senior vice president and chief financial officer not to say that it can t happen or won t happen but there seems that there is more uncertainty karen short barclays analyst okay and is there any way to frame what the potential expense headwind could be from the initiatives like you called out the sap shelf tag just because as we look at your ebitda guidance obviously you had consensus on the high end but it s probably a little bit later then people would have expected david g hirz president and chief executive officer sure it s still an investment year for us as we look at the need for e comm growth and digital investments we did an awful lot of work in 2017 and then lot of the heavy lifting 2018 and again in 2019 it looks like expenses on digital and it infrastructure in general would be similar to last year about 8 million in operating expense and probably close to 15 million in capex and again it s all supporting the programs that i talked about and the ones that we rolled out already and the ones coming to 2019 i think e comm and digital will continue to evolve will probably always be evolving with it but the heavy lifting really is in 2018 and 2019 for us karen short barclays analyst okay and then just last question for me any update you can give us on the progress with your relationship with nielsen and i guess i want to elaborate on that specifically you re kind of testing different price gaps on different categories i guess and is there a wide range on where you are shaking out on price gaps meaning some categories may you may not have price gaps in some categories you may have very wide price gaps or are you trying to average out that six to 12 across all categories is that david g hirz president and chief executive officer yes the nielsen relationship really is still a work in progress and we re working with them in three different areas and the one you re talking about is just optimizing everyday pricing and that really has been with two focus one is to look at the items that they believe based in their data are smart final strengths where we really should be priced right the items that are sensitive to our customers and then items that are market strengths right they may not be ours but they re to continue to build traffic looking at better that are market strength so to make sure that group volumes are really priced well today we have our own list and we ve had for few years now of really sensitive items those are the 2 000 everyday low price tag items where we priced really competitively with mass on those items in every store so based on their market intelligence the list is changed is still a couple of thousand items but there were items that we thought were sensitive it s apparently no longer to the customer nielsen feels there is a different set of numbers so the pricing policy while those 2 000 items switch they are different items it s still about the same investment in 2 000 items the different price zones we re testing is really based on competition our goal at least initially is to probably take some margin on items that are inelastic and items that are important to our customer but also to be more aggressive on items that are smart final strength our market strengthened our goal would be continue to price check all the competitors every week like we do today and maintain the similar gaps to competition that we have today karen short barclays analyst okay that s helpful i ll get back in the queue thanks david g hirz president and chief executive officer thanks operator our next question comes from the line of judah frommer with credit suisse securities please proceed with you question judah frommer credit suisse securities analyst hi thanks for taking the question maybe just to follow up on the square footage growth first and i m trying to square kind of your commentary that there is a goodwill impairment but that doesn t change the growth prospects for the business along with slower growth given the inflationary and competitive environment can you just help us with all those pieces rick phegley senior vice president and chief financial officer sure so judah i think the way to think about this is and it s a great question is that asc guidance around store impairment and goodwill impairment it s very formulaic it s very mechanical and it looks at the near term and long term earnings prospects of the store or of a banner and it looks at historic investment in that banner and included in that is a reconciliation to what s happening in the overall market values of equities within the relevant industry and that whole process at the store level has led us to impair some or all of the assets of only nine stores out of 326 stores and to take an impairment in the banner for the smart final banner really as i say very mechanical formulaic but it s reconciling back to how the banner is viewed within the industry and valuations as you know in the industry are lower than they were a year ago that is separate and distinct to get back to your question separate and distinct from whether an individual new store can produce an acceptable return on capital on a cash on cash basis we believe that there are lots of opportunities for new stores the near term challenge is do we want to invest capital in an uncertain environment even though we believe that long term there are good growth opportunities and the challenge has been resolved in our mind to say in 2019 let s be more cautious than we might otherwise be and constrain capital use that cash to pay down debt and to maintain the opportunity set for the future judah frommer credit suisse securities analyst okay that makes sense and then it seems clear that smart foodservice is more of a focus maybe it just happens to be more of a growth vehicle right now but is there anything beyond kind of the under penetration of that concept and its markets is it the inflation prospects being better is it the online activity being much better that maybe gets you more excited about that banner near and medium term than maybe the extra banner david g hirz president and chief executive officer yes let s say smart foodservice is really attractive banner to us number one it s much less exposed to this digital disruption now that we re having in fact i think smart foodservice is actually more upside on digital disruption because they re already their competitive set already is into the delivery business and delivery and click carry is new for us we think it s adding incremental sales and helping to drive traffic and growth the banner is really benefiting from the strong food away from home trend food away from home expenditures the last couple of years are actually higher than expenditures food at home so we re benefiting from that trend from the help of small restaurants and we just think it s got a lot of legs and has a lot of room for growth again the economics also to open a new store versus a smart final store at about 2 8 million to open a new smart foodservice store at about 1 million makes a lot more economic sense in today s environment we just think it s got a lot of our opportunity and a lot of wide space judah frommer credit suisse securities analyst thanks david g hirz president and chief executive officer thanks operator our next question comes from the line of edward kelly with wells fargo please proceed with your question edward kelly wells fargo analyst hi guys good afternoon can we just start on the ebitda guidance i m just kind of curious as to one the cadence of the ebitda guidance for next year it looks like q1 it looks like it ll be down a little bit then as we think about sort of like the full year you have full year ebitda up and to a level actually that 190 million at the midpoint you kind of haven t seen for a few years despite the fact that there s not going to be or at least in the guidance much inflation so i m just kind of curious if you could help us bridge to return i guess to some ebitda growth next year particularly if q1 s going to be down rick phegley senior vice president and chief financial officer sure so i think it s less complicated than you might into it in q1 we have sort of a normal expectation in q1 a little bit of inflation and a couple of factors that are weighing contra to that one is as dave said proportionately a little more of the digital investment in q1 than the average quarter in the back half of the year and second some weather effects and we don t as dave said we don t like to cite weather as an effect on a normal basis but we really have had an extraordinary amount of weather in all of the western states including in the smart foodservice banner in the pacific northwest the heart of their country an unusual amount of snow in the major cities which depressed customers dining out and so those are factors that are kind of weighing on the q1 guidance but on the overall guidance i think it s a confluence of many factors a little bit of inflation a little bit of margin growth and maturation of stores and when you put all of that together it gives us some confidence to be in the guidance range of 185 million to 195 million and obviously we were in that ballpark on the lower end in 2018 david g hirz president and chief executive officer building growing traffic in the smart final banner in q4 and even a little more in q1 obviously gives us more confidence and plus the penetration that we ve achieved recently with our business customers and our private label the comps that we ve had in q4 and now especially in q1 really really drives average transaction size it drives a higher margin and again gives us even in an 0 8 inflation environment which is what we re projecting for 2019 it s still hard to leverage those fixed costs and that s why we re north of the 185 million to 195 million but we think it s right in the range where we ought to be edward kelly wells fargo analyst i just wanted to follow up dave on what you re just mentioning on the comp side q4 comps particularly on a two year stack basis actually did take a bit of a step up could you just maybe speak a little bit more about what s driving that particularly on the foodservice side and then as you think about comp guidance for next year how do we think about the expected performance at each of the banners david g hirz president and chief executive officer okay yes q4 was actually strong comps in both banners the two year comp is really strong if you go back to q4 2017 that quarter it seems like forever ago but we had 1 7 inflation in that quarter so that was an especially powerful quarter in fact in q4 of 2017 ebitda was up 30 in that quarter so cycling that in q4 of 2018 was a challenge but happy with comps happy with where trends are going quarter one i would tell you start now good and gives us confidence in the guidance that we just gave rick talked about weather we don t like to use weather as an excuse but it s had a negative impact in quarter one because of the record rainfalls in southern and northern california the record snows in oregon washington salt lake city reno et cetera it s had over a 1 negative impact on comps in quarter one but with that we re still pretty comfortable with quarter one you can see we guided 1 75 to 2 i would tell you that smart final banner in quarter one we re about 10 weeks into the quarter but smart final banner is still running about 2 comps and about a third of that is from traffic and about two third is from ticket so i think we have a lot of momentum that really started building at the beginning of the quarter four continues to strengthen in spite of the weather headwind in quarter one and gives us confidence in that 1 5 to 2 5 comp for 2019 smart foodservice started out really strong out of the gate i don t like 4 5 comps or something in p1 the snow in oregon and washington six snow days this year already had a huge impact probably cost them almost 5 million in sales we re still going to finish positive for the quarter the weather is cleaned up cleared up in both places and smart foodservice is getting right back on track to the trends they had before the snow hit and we think that we have good momentum in both banners that will take us into quarter two here in a couple of weeks edward kelly wells fargo analyst great thanks guys david g hirz president and chief executive officer thanks operator our next question comes from the line of tom palmer with jpmorgan please proceed with your question tom palmer jpmorgan analyst hi thanks for the question wanted to start off just following up on the inflationary environment it s been a few years since we ve seen on shelf inflation in the food retail industry running at 1 but we did see it in february are you seeing a similar uptick in the pricing environment in your regions over the past month and if so could you talk about what s driving it specifically are we starting to see list prices tick up or do you think it s more temporary factors in that david g hirz president and chief executive officer no we think we saw again we measure inflationary cost we saw inflation ok in the first period call it january in the second period we saw an uptick in both banners probably in line with what you see in cpi in february so we feel pretty good about that but if we look at on a retail environment in the smart final banner retail inflation is almost the same as cost inflation so we don t see a big uptick in retails it just seems to be kind of moving with the cost inflation tom palmer jpmorgan analyst okay thanks for that also just wanted to ask about capital deployment you ve slowed down unit growth a couple of times now you had talked in the past about 3 times net debt to ebitda kind of being your target based on your guidance it looks like you might get there like mid year are you willing to go lower than that is your target kind of a lower number or is it some other use of cash we should be thinking about rick phegley senior vice president and chief financial officer so tom at the moment you would be correct to think that our priority is to continue to reduce debt over time to be closer to 3 times at the end of this year whether it s just over or just under and we made very good progress last year we are not clearly saying that we won t invest in new stores we think we have a lot of new store opportunity we re particularly excited by the opportunity to find and develop more smart foodservice stores and we do think there s a day that we will come back to developing additional smart final extra stores in greater numbers than we re projecting for this year so i think absent the presenting of those opportunities for new store growth the alternate use is to continue to pay down debt but i wouldn t want you to think that that s just the only use of capital and that we would not be open in the right environment to resuming a posture of store growth tom palmer jpmorgan analyst okay thank you operator operator instructions our next question comes from the line of andrew wolf with loop capital markets please proceed with your question andrew wolf loop capital markets analyst thanks i was wondering if you d like to give some visibility into your profit projections by banner qualitatively i guess is it fair to assume that the foodservice banner kind of has accelerated profit growth given where your numbers have been and how you talked about your competitive positioning and the smart final banner will either stay flat or start to grow well not stay flat get to flat let s say and i m just trying to comport with like how you get to your guidance at the midpoint which is almost mid single digit growth or roughly mid single digit growth and how that decomposes for the two change rick phegley senior vice president and chief financial officer sure andy i think the factor that you are intuiting is one that we should emphasize which is that we ve had more on a proportional basis we ve had more new unit growth in the smart foodservice banner in the recent years than we ve had in the smart final banner and so on a full year basis we will expect more proportional growth in ebitda in that banner in 2019 but we also look for growth in the smart final banner as well for all the factors that we ve outlined and dave has talked about and the things that are positively influencing margin we re looking for ebitda growth in both banners in 2019 andrew wolf loop capital markets analyst got you and the other thing i just wanted to ask one other question on the i think dave you commented on i believe this was at the foodservice smart foodservice that the average internet order was 7x the normal order just wanted to confirm that and then was it you said at the similar margins is that gross margin or is that a current david g hirz president and chief executive officer no that s product margin but it s probably gross margin the 700 we re talking about is our click and collect program it s click carry we call it and that s there is some delivery through instacart in the smart foodservice banner but the majority of their digital sales really is coming from click and collect and in click and collect the average order size is over 700 and the reason it makes sense for us from a productivity standpoint because again productivity is so important to both banners we run very low labor rates relative to our competitive set whether it s in foodservice or here in smart final banner with our conventional grocer competition and mass competition our labor rates are much lower and we want to keep it that way so the only reason that click and collect works in the smart foodservice banner is everything we do is next day so the orders come in today we will pick those orders for the customer it saves them time away from their restaurant we ll pick those orders for the customer during the day we ll finish it overnight if we need to so when they show up the next day it s ready for pick up so it s very low labor for us to pick those orders because we kind of do it during downtime and it works really well the average order size in store is right under 100 and on click and collect it s around 750 andrew wolf loop capital markets analyst got it that s great and it sounds like that s just an amplification or expansion of the business practice you are doing right you re already staging orders they just might have come in over the phone or the internet before i mean whatever is that accurate david g hirz president and chief executive officer yes we ve always had some form in both banners where some of your best business customer is giving your order by fax or over the phone or email but on a much smaller scale the penetration that we re achieving in click and collect in the smart foodservice banner is much stronger than when we were doing the old manual process and like i said when we get on our own app e comm site this summer it ll make it so much easier for our business customers to be able to place those orders today it s just a little bit clunky a little bit cumbersome and this new app is going to i think really accelerate growth in e comm in particular in that banner andrew wolf loop capital markets analyst great thank you david g hirz president and chief executive officer thank you operator our final question comes from the line of vincent sinisi with morgan stanley please proceed with your question vincent sinisi morgan stanley analyst hi awesome thanks guys for fitting me in here just wanted to ask i know it s early of course with the work with nielsen but just kind of thinking of the balance between pricing driving traffic what you re starting to learn maybe by category just the basic question is are you seeing so far that there s a lot of room in certain areas and where do you think that you do price all the time of course do you think ultimately we re going to see more of almost like a category by category by store by store level type of pricing or where do you kind of maybe just early thoughts i think that where that can go david g hirz president and chief executive officer sure we re working with nielsen in three different areas and shelf pricing is really only one of them they re helping us optimize shelf pricing with their market analytics around individual items but also though sku rationalization they re really helping us understand that we have a right product in the shelf for their shoppers and then third one is to build circular so i think what you ll see in pricing you ll see us maintain similar gaps to what we have in today s competition but be more relevant to our customer i think you ll see more price regions we only have a couple of price regions today the nielsen analytics tells us we should probably have more price regions depending on the competition set whether it s northern california or southern california or vegas or arizona from the assortment front i think there s a lot of upside there our category managers today have weekly assortment strategy meetings with the nielsen teams and now they can really quickly assess as they re looking at their categories really much much more streamlined than before assess key items that are missing from the sets or items in their sets that they don t need to carry and then the third one their promotional piece i m really excited about nielsen over the last couple of months now has been immersed in our pre planning process for ad development and they ve developed a post analytical tool that s helping us to measure success of tests that we re doing either in ad or at the shelf and so there s a lot going on but i would still say it s a work in progress and we re early stages we re just we re optimistic about where it s going to take itself vincent sinisi morgan stanley analyst okay dave that s helpful thank you and then maybe just a quick follow up just back on store growth for a second obviously getting more comfort with the foodservice banner i guess just kind of fast forwarding should we think when you do maybe at some point go into more of kind of unit growth overall again should we think that maybe there s a good chance that more will come from foodservice in the future as well or as you mentioned there s still good opportunities maybe for extra too how should we just kind of think about that longer term any thoughts there rick phegley senior vice president and chief financial officer i think vinnie the way i would mentally model it is to think that for the foreseeable future the percentage allocation of capital would be to a greater extent unit growth in smart foodservice and in smart final so as a numerical example if for instance we went to 10 units a year in each banner that would be 10 divided by 66 in the smart foodservice banner and 10 divided by 260 in the smart final banner so we think we have good opportunities in both but from a capital allocation standpoint we view a future where that allocation of capital on a percentage basis to smart foodservice is higher is likely where we re headed vincent sinisi morgan stanley analyst okay and maybe just one super fast so at this point is it fair to say that since you are starting to put more numbers of units out in foodservice the last few years worth of work around that you do feel like the basic kind of prototype go to market strategy is kind of down path now david g hirz president and chief executive officer yes i don t know if it s a down path but yes it s going well overall we re happy with the results you re going to always going to have a couple of outliers and those are the ones that we re focused on and learning from but on average we feel like the seven stores that we ve opened in the last two years so 2017 and 2018 on average so they re achieving their pro forma results both sales and ebitda but again just as with most growth there s outliers that we continue to focus on and i ll tell you every time we open a new store in especially in a new market there s new learning s for us and i think it s making us better at opening new stores looking for ways to faster ramp up that customer acquisition that really is the key in a foodservice store versus a more conventional grocery store is those foodservice customers are so loyal at their existing location and the key to success is accelerating growth and get them to make that change faster than they normally would but it s working well and we re learning with every store we open vincent sinisi morgan stanley analyst okay great best of luck guys thank you david g hirz president and chief executive officer thank you operator ladies and gentlemen since we have no further questions left in the queue this does

lifetime brands fourth quarter and full year financial results full year 2018 financial results our fourth quarter and consequently our full year performance were below our expectations and previously provided guidance on a pro forma basis including the filament results for both 2017 and 2018 the fourth quarter was basically flat with prior year however we had anticipated growth in top and bottom line while our gaap results for the full year showed growth related to the acquisition of filament brands as a result of the fourth quarter performance we saw a noticable decline for the full year in both pro forma and our net sales and ebitda simply put we are disappointed in these results and they are not what we expect to deliver to shareholders we believe this underperformance was due to a combination of factors but primarily the adverse impact of certain unforeseen macroeconomic events which i will discuss before turning over the call to larry who will go over the numbers i ll also discuss with you important achievements from throughout 2018 as well as highlight some positive indicators we are seeing in the first couple of months of 2019 it s important for me to emphasize that we are optimistic these macro events while meaningful in impact are predominantly singular in nature they include european softness primarily due to brexit and the inconsistent implementation of a new us tariff program that hindered our ability to pass along timely price increases additionally our sales were adversely affected by stocking levels and inventory management decisions by retail customers including our largest e commerce customer in europe as you know in the second half of 2018 we announced a plan to reorganize our european based operations including the consolidation of our european operation into a single more profitable business we expect this reorganization to create profitability starting in 2019 however in 2018 our european business was adversely impacted in the fourth quarter by meaningful softness in the retail markets in europe primarily due to the uncertainty and instability of brexit as well as the yellow vests protests in france with regard to tariffs on our earnings call last quarter i addressed the newly announced us tariff program that was expected to affect 20 of our company s revenue despite taking proactive steps to mitigate the potential impact such as reducing the cost of goods sold and resourcing our products to countries who exports were not subject to the tariffs the inconsistent implementation of the us tariff program hindered our ability to pass along our planned timely price increases in turn creating a more impactful outcome on our revenue and margin than initially expected and resulting in meaningful losses in the affected lines of business and additional unforeseen consequence of the tariff program was an inability to book adequate containers to ship our products from asia and the inability to move goods delivered to us ports to our customers in a timely manner these situations resulted in missed shipping windows and consequently reduced revenues for lifetime finally certain of our north american distribution channels delivered disappointing sales due to a combination of poor holiday sales from certain channels and a change in policy regarding stocking level and inventory management by several large customers including our largest e commerce customer both in the us and europe this customer noticeably reduced inventory and in stock levels even though sell through of most products to the consumer remained high at this retailer our average in stock levels reduced from over 20 weeks at the end of 2017 to under six weeks at the end of 2018 significantly as just mentioned across all of our markets our sell through to consumers at this customer has remained strong with substantial year over year growth we also saw a combination of canceled and postponed orders from our largest food service customer as a result of our reorganization of their merchandise program which has led to a downsizing of their offerings combined these issues resulted in a meaningful miss ph compared to our expectations that were based on product sell through to consumers the unique headwinds experienced in the fourth quarter have not continued into 2019 and we are encouraged by the early results of 2019 as our shipping and supply chain has normalized and as we now have successfully implemented the planned price increases designed to mitigate tariff impacts we feel confident that these initial results indicate a normalization of customer ordering and promising performance of our newer products with these events in the rearview mirror we were eager to refocus on serving the needs of our customers and providing high quality houseware products while driving growth for shareholders notably we accomplished our primary 2018 goals of seamlessly integrating the filament business into lifetime reorganizing our european operations and executing our opportunity to reduce the cost of infrastructure to achieving synergy cost eliminations in excess of 11 million now that we have successfully integrated the filament business we expect to realize the many benefits of the merger including leveraging our expanded portfolio of brands products and distribution platforms and forging partnerships in new channels furthermore we laid a strong foundation for repositioning our product portfolio which as you may remember reaccelerated during the third quarter of 2018 in an effort to achieve greater cost saving benefits and provide for a revised platform to pursue organic growth opportunities the associated erp systems integration that went live in january is already off to a great start and we expect to see a substantial impact from our implemented 11 million in annual savings beginning in 2019 which represents an increase of more than a third from our original projection in addition we are currently executing our wholesale restructure of our e commerce operations focused on more efficiently promoting our products and brands and designed to grow our e commerce revenues and product recognition and ratings we are also continuing with investment in our brand equity development process as a way to increase our visibility and recognition of brands among consumers these efforts have begun to show results in the first quarter of 2019 so as i ve mentioned we expect our 2019 results to show meaningful top and bottom line growth this expectation is supported by our results for the first two months of the year we plan to release 2019 full year guidance on our q1 2019 s earnings call this may at which point we ll be able to provide benchmarks of targets and opportunities created by our strategic review of the newly integrated filament business we are confident that the path we re on to create a leaner and more growth oriented lifetime brands will be strong drivers of enhanced results profitability and value creation for lifetime as we move forward larry laurence winoker chief financial officer thanks rob as we reported this morning net income for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 10 million or 0 49 per diluted share as compared to net income of 1 3 million or 0 08 per diluted share in the 2017 period adjusted net income for the quarter was 11 2 million or 0 55 per diluted share as compared to adjusted net income of 7 1 million or 0 40 per diluted share in 2017 a table which reconciles this non gaap measure to reported results was included in this morning s release income from operations was 22 9 million for the 2018 quarter compared to 10 9 million for 2017 adjusted ebitda a non gaap measure that is reconciled to our gaap results in the release was 65 5 million 64 9 million reflecting the credit agreement limitation that s for the year ended december 31 2018 this included permitted pro forma adjustments for filament and projected unrealized synergies of 8 5 million as a result of reorganizing certain management responsibilities the us wholesale segment now includes the us retail direct channel therefore our comments today and in the future will reflect this reorganization including on a comparable basis with prior periods net sales for the quarter increased 45 5 million to 228 3 million this reflects the acquisition of filament which added 51 6 million organically net sales decreased 6 million the us wholesale organic sales decreased 3 4 million this decrease reflects as rob noted retail and inventory reductions and transportation difficulties due to tariff concerns a decline in kitchenware and tableware products was offset partially by an increase for home solutions products in international sales declined by approximately 2 6 million but that s 1 8 million decline in constant us dollars this reflected retail inventory reductions and consumer concerns about the potential impact of brexit gross margin was 37 2 in 18 compared to 39 in the comparable 2017 period us gross margin was 37 3 million in 2018 versus 40 2 million in 2017 this reflects both product and customer mix as well as approximately 40 basis point decline associated with the effect of the tariffs for international gross margin improved from 33 2 to 36 from tableware products on fewer off price sales and portfolio repositioning distribution expenses as a percent of sales shipped from our warehouses including filament and this has largely been integrated with the rest of our us operations during the quarter were 9 3 in 2018 versus 10 4 last year this excludes warehouse relocation expenses for the us wholesale distribution expense as a percent of shipments also excluding relocation improved to 8 8 from 9 8 last year due to increase in products shipped for international expense and the distribution improved approximately one point 12 4 the 2017 period reflected an additional lease of termination expense recorded in connection with the planned warehouse move sg a expenses were 40 6 in the fourth quarter of 18 versus 41 3 million in the 2017 period us expenses including corporate unallocated were 34 4 million versus 34 6 million last year the 2018 period includes filament that was offset by lower employee compensation and acquisition expenses as well as an estimated reduction in contingent consideration related to an acquisition as so much of filament s operations have been integrated with lifetime there is no stand alone filament expense to identify except for purchase accounting amortization which added 2 4 million international sg a expenses decreased by approximately 600 000 which largely represents a benefit for the change in the mark to market of foreign currency contracts and foreign currency statement translation interest expense was 5 6 million in 2018 quarter as compared to 1 2 million last year the increase in interest is attributable to the financing obtained to acquire filament the effective tax rate for 2018 primarily reflects non deductible expenses and reserves for uncertain tax positions while in the 2017 period the rate reflects the charge for the remeasurement of deferred taxes related to the tax reform act at december 31 18 liquidity under the revolving credit agreement net of cash liquidity net of cash was 7 6 million liquidity was approximately 112 million this concludes our prepared comments operator please open the line for questions questions and answers operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of frank camma of sidoti frank camma sidoti analyst hey guys good morning thanks for taking the questions rob kay chief executive officer good morning frank frank camma sidoti analyst i know larry you called out the organic but could you just give us if you have them handy the numbers for filament for the quarter and for the year the revenue laurence winoker chief financial officer yeah so yeah it was 51 7 million last year it was about 49 million and so that s and obviously inaudible frank camma sidoti analyst that was the revenue in the quarter laurence winoker chief financial officer yeah that s 51 6 million last year approximately 49 million so that was up about 2 5 million for the year it s on a full year basis we only had 10 months but it was 154 5 million frank camma sidoti analyst okay but how much of that 154 5 million did you actually book those laurence winoker chief financial officer yes thanks yes that s 12 months so we based on the 10 months it was about 129 million frank camma sidoti analyst okay good all right so filament i mean year over year in the quarter actually did ok correct i mean like because last quarter that was actually down year over year rob kay chief executive officer yeah the same trends we saw across the business were related to all of our lines of business equally but yeah filament had a good fourth quarter frank camma sidoti analyst yeah i guess where i m going with that is i mean i know you re not rob kay chief executive officer but it was lower than our expectations frank frank camma sidoti analyst sure sure rob kay chief executive officer for the year over year but it was lower so as we said the fourth quarter year over year were flat on a pro forma basis but our expectations were for more growth multiple speakers that s what we were addressing but we were filament was a bit opposite frank camma sidoti analyst okay now my concern though is with filament was the fact ph and i know you didn t mean customers but you did say the largest food service we know who that is now so what can we expect i know you re not giving guidance but what can we expect from that customer going forward does that mean you lose that customer does it mean they greatly scale it back can you give us like some color on that rob kay chief executive officer so we did not lose that customer but year over year there was a noticeable decline as they dramatically changed what they their merchandise strategy and therefore their purchases so no it s just a decline not it s still a big customer frank camma sidoti analyst but that will flow into i guess where i m going is that will flow into next year right i m assuming and is food service is q1 typically a decent quarter for food service is that not at seasonal i guess rob kay chief executive officer that is not as seasonal as the retail business frank there as we mentioned some of the transportation issues both on getting containers added china and then actually getting goods out of port well in this case what you re referring to is only added china that was also impact because it s all di added china so some of that rolled over into the first quarter frank camma sidoti analyst so you would actually benefit from that in q1 now because it s just sort of a timing issue rob kay chief executive officer you would frank camma sidoti analyst okay and then i guess the other item and i know you didn t call the customer again but like you said 20 weeks for e commerce customer down to six weeks that sounds like they almost didn t order in the quarter at all i mean given that dramatic decline in the stocking rob kay chief executive officer this is across the industry everyone has agreed this and a matter of fact this is a big customer of us in europe as well and they did the same thing so they operated globally along these lines as we pointed out we re able to track sell through to the consumer which is quite good which is also contributing to why the in stocks went down so much it happened and there s a lot of press on it a lot not for the full quarter but it started in november a lot of analysis and press in it again that is a customer which he came really six weeks is too low so we ve seen some nice order flow year over year so far in 2019 frank camma sidoti analyst but aren t they changing their business model somewhat so that they don t actually hold the inventory in that the whole point like they want you to sort of be they just want to take a inaudible i mean it s sort of their shop and the shop model if you will i mean can you address that like does that change your model rob kay chief executive officer yeah i mean two things first of all you know look if there is if anyone doesn t matter brick and mortar e commerce changes their inventory strategies and it happens last forever because as you know in this case you can t run out of stock right you need inventory so the impacts are finite that being said you re talking about someone who changes strategies often so it s really hard to comment on that and i think what you re referring to would really impact people that are smaller than us frank camma sidoti analyst right because you have the ability to hold the inventory and ship direct rob kay chief executive officer for sure we do and we can drive ship and we are certified appropriately so there s all that which creates a different relationship but also if you look at the press you know the sort of eliminations are focused on people doing smaller amounts and does we are not nearer where those cut off frank camma sidoti analyst okay so the biggest shock to me is sort of the gross margin you know larry excuse me if i missed this but you mentioned 2 4 million purchase accounting now did that flow through to the gross margin lowering your gross margin or it was through somewhere else laurence winoker chief financial officer no the purchase accounting amortization goes through sg a frank camma sidoti analyst so that s sg a so that had no impact there laurence winoker chief financial officer i mean there was no frank camma sidoti analyst go ahead i m sorry laurence winoker chief financial officer i just comment it is down for the quarter but it was more pronounced in the quarter than it was for the year rob kay chief executive officer yeah it s a bit of a mix issue and of course in the quarter as larry pointed out we had an impact on the tariffs that would be a fourth quarter impact frank camma sidoti analyst okay so it was really more of the tariffs now have you consequently in q1 started to push through those price increases rob kay chief executive officer so the tariff situation as i tried to explain frank we had reacted and as part of that as we mentioned you can t mitigate all of the tariff without a price increase so we implemented a portion and then we had implemented price increases but unfortunately when the government started moving the target of the tariff from potentially 10 to 25 to 10 and the timing of the implementation of that so it was impossible for us to get a price increase through in the fourth quarter because there was flip flopping and uncertainty as of now we have been able to do that subject to change if the tariffs change percentage and implementation dates or if they go away frank camma sidoti analyst okay fair enough and just may i as i m looking at these adjustments that you put in there is just a housekeeping so like the contingent consideration fair value adjustment that i assume is an sg a issue correct rob kay chief executive officer correct frank camma sidoti analyst okay so the only one that does and it looks like to me that of the ones of top that don t flow through sg a is probably the warehouse relocation is that distribution rob kay chief executive officer yes frank camma sidoti analyst okay and that the bottom three i assume are to effect the tax they flow directly to your tax rate rob kay chief executive officer yes frank camma sidoti analyst okay so then looking at then this will be my last one i will hop off then it looks like your effective tax rate is still pretty high and is that just because your jurisdictions i mean it comes about and this is after i adjusted it to about like 42 for the year is that just because of where you booked the income rob kay chief executive officer it s an anomaly it s inaudible looking at the small numerator that hurts but this is nothing that is let s say is persistent that would cause it to be that high going forward frank camma sidoti analyst okay yeah because i have modeled about much less like 27 5 ph going forward is that sounds like a more realistic model like number rob kay chief executive officer yes frank camma sidoti analyst okay thanks guys i ll hop off rob kay chief executive officer all right frank operator your next question comes from the line of justyn putnam of talanta investment group justyn putnam talanta investment group analyst good morning rob kay chief executive officer good morning justyn putnam talanta investment group analyst my first question is a clarification question the food service customer that you discussed on the call is that the same customer that you mentioned on the last call where you may have sales from that customer going into the new year rob kay chief executive officer correct justyn justyn putnam talanta investment group analyst okay so now the update is not only do they get pushed into the new year there are also a lot less than we were expecting is that right rob kay chief executive officer they ended up for the first time in our relationship over 15 years canceling some orders but there was some orders that got pushed off justyn putnam talanta investment group analyst okay and my next question is i guess larry this is for you i was wondering if i could get maybe a more updated net debt balance and the reason is because i think we talked about in the last call lot of cash flow comes in after the first of the year i was wondering we can get maybe update on the net debt figure laurence winoker chief financial officer yeah that s i have given to you at obviously end of the year so net debt at the end of the year was approximately 307 million justyn putnam talanta investment group analyst what about say january 31st laurence winoker chief financial officer yes i don t know we re not going to comment on going forward but we did say that this is typical for the company year after years because we sell so much in the fourth quarter our debt balance does significantly decline in the first quarter but i can t inaudible but we generally don t give out that information we will get it for you juystyn justyn putnam talanta investment group analyst okay then my next question is i mean obviously you ve got you have a lot of moving parts in this right now transition and macro issues and so forth but just taking a trip down memory lane here looking back at least in the 22nd 2017 when our price is about 50 higher than it is now i think you announced the acquisition was expecting hoping to have around 770 million in net sales and ebitda of 85 million once that settlements the acquisitions is that still fundamentally your expectation for the business or going through this integration process you realize perhaps rob kay chief executive officer yeah you know our expectations are to justyn it s a fair question the expectations are to get there are the same it s just we didn t get there as fast as we thought laurence winoker chief financial officer justyn just one thing maybe you have this but just clarification you re referring to with filament on a 12 month basis there was another 25 million that filament had in sales in the first two months of 18 that are not in our numbers so the 700 million change the full year report is 730 million on a 12 month basis still up what we projected but just wanted to point that out justyn putnam talanta investment group analyst yes the sales figure but ebitda is still even with your adjustment 20 million below that like frank noted rob kay chief executive officer yes laurence winoker chief financial officer yes justyn putnam talanta investment group analyst right okay i think that s my question on high level so thank you rob kay chief executive officer thanks justyn operator operator instructions at this time there are no further questions i will now return the call to rob kay for any additional or closing remarks rob kay chief executive officer thank you operator for everyone on the call thank you again for joining us today we are looking

me from melinta are john johnson chief executive officer and peter milligan chief financial officer so with that iâ ll turn the call over to john johnson john johnson thank you susan good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining us antibiotic resistance in us is becoming a public health crisis and with that our mission at melinta is critical in recent article published by doctors in the society for healthcare epidemiology of america project that more than 150 000 americans die each year due to antibiotic resistance and if proven would make it the third leading cause of death the cdc also reports the resistance problem is growing and has projected has projected that their numbers on this crisis will increase sharply despite this growing crisis market acceptance of new antibiotics has been slower than expected and in the case of melinta has not met our internal or external expectations the roadblocks to acceptance are primarily related to reimbursement and the complexity of the hospital environment i along with members of the melinta team other antibiotic company executives the infectious disease society of america members of academia and members of key government agencies including the fda have begun to educate and ask for reimbursement change to address this growing crisis this is an important step for patients and we will continue to update you on our progress despite the challenges with initial market acceptance given the growing threat of antibiotic resistance we believe that melinta is well positioned for long term growth and success there are three primary topics i d like to address in our call today first i d like to provide some highlights of melinta s accomplishments in 2018 second i will highlight some of the important attributes of each of our drugs and how they fit into the core of our strategy moving into 2019 and lastly i ll provide some details about our financial results for the period specifically product sales as reflected on slide 5 looking back at 2018 it was a very busy year for melinta shortly after closing the merger with cempra in november 2017 we acquired the infectious disease business of the medicines company in early january 2018 which included three commercial products vabomere orbactiv and minocin for injection as a result of these transactions melinta was transformed into a publicly traded commercial enterprise with four marketed antibiotics and in connection with the ibb acquisition we gain and then supplemented an experienced anti infectious field based commercial team which we cross trained over the course of the year on all four products that team s headcount currently stands at approximately 150 key priorities for us last year included expanding our medical affairs organization and enhancing our commercial resources by leveraged our experience marketing market access and analytics team to ensure our products are well understood appropriately positioned and accessible in the market we also expanded our global commercial footprint by licensing the marketing rights to vabomere orbactiv and minocin in europe and asia pac to menarini our partner in addition to scaling our business operations we made significant clinical and regulatory progress in 2018 in the fourth quarter and ahead of schedule we announced positive top line results from our phase 3 trial of baxdela for the treatment of adult patients with community acquired bacterial pneumonia or cabp cabp is a common and potentially life threatening illness particularly among the elderly and immune compromised patients in the study baxdela was compared to moxifloxacin and that all key primary and secondary endpoints would set the stage for our snda filing later this year also in the fourth quarter baxdela received its first marketing approval outside of the united states and argentina through eurofarma our latin america partner moving on to vabomere in november the european commission approved a product for five indications in adult patients complicated intra abdominal infections complicated urinary tract infections hospital acquired pneumonia including hap vap bacteremia that occurs in association with any of these infections and infections due to aerobic gram negative organisms or treatment options are limited results from our phase 3 tango ii study of vabomere were published in october tango ii is the largest pathogen to record study that targeted cre which is recognized by the cdc as an urgent threat and a critical priority by the world health organization and finally in august we announced that the centers for medicare and medicaid services rented a new technology add on payment or ntap designation for vabomere when administered in a hospital inpatient setting to treat adults with complicated urinary tract infections the ntap designation is rarely granted and few antibiotics have ever received it we believe that having it in place vabomere will help them expand medicare patients access to this important treatment option from a financial perspective in connection with streamlining costs and prioritizing resources we developed plans to reduce operating expenses with the goal of achieving 50 million to 70 million in operating expense savings for 2019 in connection with these cost reductions which were in part due to the alignment and integration of the three businesses we reduce the size of our workforce and made the decision to wind down our early stage research and discovery programs i d like to thank dr erin duffy and her team for their tireless work in our discovery program and wish them the best of luck in their mission to discover new antibiotics against these growing threats in late 2018 we continue to take action to strengthen our financial position as we secured 135 million of funding from vatera in the form of convertible loans we drew the first 75 million under this facility last month and we plan to draw the remaining 60 million in the next four months in accordance with the terms of the agreement we are also in the process of securing a working capital revolver for up to 20 million which we expect to complete in the second quarter moving to slide 6 as the largest pure play antibiotics company we have a leading commercial portfolio that offers providers and patients with the range of therapeutic options we believe that each drug has the ability to effectively compete along clinical and operational dimensions let me provide some additional color on the value proposition of each drug in our portfolio with baxdela you have the only fluoroquinolone that is available to treat absssi in adults that reliably covers mrsa this drug has broad based gram positive and gram negative coverage and has evidence minimal drug interactions and allows a straightforward dosing for patients with comorbidities orbactiv iv treatment for absssi in adults with mrsa coverage that allows the treatment in both in and out of the hospital setting in addition the one time dosing regimen helps to ensure patient adherence vabomere is a combination of meropenem and the beta lactamase inhibitor vaborbactam it was specifically developed to address the growing issue of kpc mediated resistance minocin for injection is one of the few options that are available for acinetobacter infections this product formulation has been on the market since 2014 and we have recently seen an uptick in sales we believe our competitive portfolio combined with our ongoing strategic initiatives positions melinta to continue to meet the evolving global threat of bacterial infections and antibiotic resistance moving to slide 7 we were pleased to report product sales of 14 6 million and 46 6 million respectively for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 in addition despite the challenging operating environment net product sales increased 32 compared to the third quarter of 2018 for additional color on our sales performance we have provided the net sales for each of the products on slide 7 as you have requested in their first years of launch baxdela and vabomere together achieved approximately 14 million in product sales while we are pleased to see these products grew throughout the year we know that the overall revenue was less than we originally expected we are taking specific measures to accelerate this growth as we move into 2019 orbactiv and minocin sales were 32 7 million for the year down slightly from the product sales that the medicines company reported for 2017 however based on the trends experienced in the second half of 2018 we expect both of these products to grow during 2019 also as you may remember a required change in the distribution channel relating to the integration of melinta and the medicines company s asset did have a few million dollar negative impact on full year revenues primarily related to orbactiv that said we are pleased with the significant strides we have made in the past year to realign the business and strengthen our financial position the work that we have done in 2018 sets the stage for melinta s future success as a largest branded antibiotics focused company our diverse portfolio of four antibiotics established and leverageable operating infrastructure and experienced infectious disease leadership team provides the foundation for growth and flexibility and with that i ll turn our call over to peter to review the financials in greater detail and to share our views for 2019 peter milligan thank you john beginning on slide 9 i d like to provide some highlights for the fourth quarter total revenue was 35 5 million including 14 6 million in total product sales compared to 11 million in 3q during the quarter we received a 17 7 million milestone payment from menarini as a result of the vabomere approval in europe which we announced in november this milestone payment is reflected in license revenue during the quarter we also recorded 2 8 million in contract revenue which is primarily related to our reimbursements of shared r d expenses from our agreement with our international partners cost of goods sold for the quarter was 9 million of which 3 9 million was comprised of non cash amortization of intangible assets total operating expenses were 66 9 million or 50 5 million when you adjust for impairment charges stock based comp and gain associated with re measurement of the idb related contingent consideration sg a was 31 million in the fourth quarter compared to 34 million in a third quarter this decline in expenses was driven by the 9 million gain from remeasurement i m sorry the change in the quarter was essentially offset 9 million gain from the idb remeasurement is offset by 9 million of severance these items is essentially net out so you can see that sg a expenses decreased slightly as we begin to see the result of implementing our cost savings initiatives on slide 10 you can see the summary for the full year total revenue was 96 4 million including 46 6 million in total product sales and 49 8 million in contract and license revenue our cost of goods sold for the year was 41 million of which 16 million was comprised of non cash amortization of intangibles total operating expenses for the year was 214 million or 190 million adjusting for impairment charges stock based comp and the gain on the remeasurement of the idb related contingent consideration turning to slide 11 in 2019 we expect to achieve full year product sales of approximately 65 million which is the result of double digit revenue growth in each of our products however it is important to note that in our business especially as we move into the cabp market seasonality and beginning of the year reimbursement changes can impact sequential growth so going forward we will be focused on comparisons to the prior year we expect gross margins to be in the 55 range and remind you that 16 million of non cash intangibles is in that estimate from an operating expense point we expect to spend approximately a 140 million as we previously stated this is a significant reduction from the prior year as we benefited from the items you see listed on the slide turning to slide 12 we ended the year with 81 8 million in cash and cash equivalents compared to 83 3 million in the previous quarter in addition to our operational burn the quarter included the receipt of 37 7 million upfront milestone payments for menarini as we discussed when considering our future cash commitments please note that we have not yet made the 30 million payment to the rempex shareholders related to the receipt of the european commission marketing authorization for vabomere nor have we paid the first of the 225 million payments to the medicines company both are related to the acquisition of the id business as you may know we have filed a complaint against the medicines company and this process is ongoing our team continues to move with purpose and focus during this transformative time to reposition melinta and set a new trajectory towards growth and value creation we are executing against the number of our strategic operational and financial initiatives designed to grow our products conserve cash and identify new business opportunities that will drive melinta towards becoming a strong cash flow positive company and with that i ll turn that things back to john to review the catalyst for 2019 and for closing remarks john johnson thanks peter turning to slide 14 in summary we are focused on accelerating product sales practicing disciplined financial stewardship strengthening our balance sheet and on key strategic levers especially around reimbursement each of our approved products has its own unique place in the market and we have a plan to continue to derive growth in each of them for baxdela we are anticipating a label expansion with the approval of baxdela for cabp in late 2019 after filing the snda in the second quarter this year we are expecting our partner to receive approval in europe and we are focusing our sales effort in the us on a specialty pharmacy channel as appropriate to ensure the timely access of our products to a wide customer base for vabomere we are exploring additional international license agreements and are looking to increase our customers utilization of the ntap designation for orbactiv we are continuing to promote the value proposition of this drug acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections are often associated with high economic burdens on institutions due to the nature of the prolonged hospital stays and high rates of infection recurrence we have shown that the overall cost of hospitals can be reduced significantly when patients are kept out of the hospital with this single dose infusion we re also committed to developing a shorter infusion time for this drug which will further enhance the overall experience for healthcare providers and patients with minocin we anticipate publishing results from our registry that will provide additional insights into real world use of the product lastly as a company and a team we are committed and more focused than ever on fulfilling our commitment to delivering anti infective solutions to patients with this focus we believe that we re positioned to achieve sustainable growth and increase long term shareholder value we hope you share our sense of optimism and enthusiasm for the year ahead with that we will now open the call up for q a thank you for joining today s call and thank you for your continued support question and answer session operator our first question comes from louise chen with cantor your line is now open louisechen hi thanks for taking my questions i had a few here so first question i had is there any update on unbundling reimbursement for antibiotic drugs in the hospital the second question is if you will consider pursuing adjacent categories in the hospital to diversify revenue streams third question i had was how much could you expect from ex us license agreements this year or how can we think about it if you don t want to give a number and the last question here on baxdela for cabp what is the opportunity here and how do you differentiate from other cabp drugs in the hospital thank you johnjohnson thank you i ll address parts one two and four and then peter can speak to the x us licensing agreement question and we appreciate the questions so as it relates to reimbursement and unbundling that there has been a wide scale effort that has taken place and it s certainly not melinta and we ve seen other companies really step up and support these efforts what s really been nice to see from my perspective and it just not has not been the companies but we ve had infectious disease society of america with us we ve had members of academia join us we ve had support from folks that are engaged with carb x as well and if you also look at statements that have come out of the fda they realized that there s a need to address these reimbursement issues we ve had meetings with different members of congress we ve had meetings with cms we will be a meeting with the white house and i think everyone s getting to the point that we understand that there needs to be some change and how these products are reimbursed to make sure patients have access to the most effective and in certain cases safe therapies and i think we ll know more as this year unfolds and it s hard to predict what that might exactly be but i ve been pleased with the broad scale support not only from our industry but from all stakeholders so stay tuned for that and we will provide an update on the next call as it relates to adjacent revenue streams we are considering that we re looking at select opportunities where other products could fit our portfolio both in and out of the hospital we re not going to provide any timelines for that but we think it makes sense to leverage the commercial team has been built i mean we have a very strong team in the hospital we know all the formulated committee members we re tied closely to pharmacy and for us to bring on another product would be a natural thing for us to do if we found the right value proposition for that i ll have peter now talk a little bit about the ex us licensing agreements and what you might want to consider in that area peter petermilligan sure thanks so if you think about 2018 we had 50 million from license and other revenue we re certainly not going to have 50 million in 2019 but we will we definitely will have some measurable revenue there hardest to predict specifically but we also have some reinvent continued reimbursement on finishing up one of our trials from one of our partners so that shows up i don t call it license revenue but it shows up instead of reimbursement and it is revenue outside of the revenue guidance in addition to clearly we also have some opportunities to license our products in other regions we re looking at talking to a couple companies about doing that right now so that should be that s a nice opportunity for us and in our existing license agreements are certain milestones on certain approvals in different countries what i can say also is just thinking about the menarini transaction there will be royalty streams from that of course those are out in the future we are being very conservative or at least i am from modeling purposes where we put that so i don t have any royalties really coming in for the next year or so or more really and i think that could represent some upside because we know that they believe as we do that the opportunity in europe is significant especially for a product like vabomere where it s approved for five indications versus the one in the united states so definitely some revenue coming in from those items in 2019 which obviously helps on the cash side in addition to the 65 net product sales johnjohnson and finally louise to your last question around cabp and how do we see the opportunity and how do we think about differentiating there i d say a couple of things while the data is never perfectly clear if you looked at the uses of all antibiotics for cabp and you dollarize that including the generic uses in the baxdela dollar you re looking at something that s in the neighborhood of let s call it 80 million to 100 million per market share point in that trade sales in baxdela dollars so the opportunity is large from a differentiation standpoint the product performs very well in the clinical trials we know the side effect profile of drug looks very good the drug interactions side looks good the qt performance that we ve seen so far looks good we of course are waiting for final labeling to determine our exact positioning but the drugs delivered though certainly the way we thought it would in the phase 3 trial and we would expect that it will be able to gain market share in the years ahead operator our next question comes from david hoang with jefferies your line is now open david hoang hi yes thanks guys for taking my question so maybe first one vabomere can you talk a little bit about a little more color around the launch and where you think it s at is there more work to do from the salesforce in terms of reaching target accounts is it mostly formulary reviews ongoing or is it on formulary but maybe the docs need to become aware of it johnjohnson thanks david and we re really excited about vabomere as you know we have seen it strengthened throughout the year and frankly here into the first quarter the hospital market today is certainly so much more complex than it even was three years ago and i think in that case of ntap effect is even more so you have today hospital pharmacies under significant pressure you not only have antibiotic subcommittees but in some cases stewardship committees as well and you can t forget the cpoe systems the computerized order entry systems that have to be navigated along with the therapeutic guidelines to be in there and then also to match that up to the micro testing and so when you add all those things together it takes time and so what i would say is we re still getting on formularies we re still seeing growth there we have work to do on these we re not through all of these operational issues that you have to get up and going in order for a hospital to use it as efficiently as possible we still have work to go there there s a lot going on in micro testing today break points are changing for the penems and all hospitals have adopted that yet and as they are adopted what you will see is an increase in the number of isolates being appropriately reported resistant and that will increase certainly the share for both vabomere and other products so we re still getting on hospitals we still have operational work to do and they ll take certainly well through the first after year to get through that but we ve been pleased with the strengthening of the drug through the fourth quarter and here into the first quarter our feedback on the product has been really positive when it s been used by physicians and hospitals and so from our standpoint really the best is yet to come for vabomere david hoang great thanks a lot that s very helpful and i think one more on baxdela i think you mentioned previously you saw good usage in an outpatient setting and this was among podiatrists particularly so i guess are you still seeing that trend you think you can push it any further and i know there was some redeployment of the salesforce towards the outpatient setting do you think that can drive further baxdela scripts johnjohnson yes good question david so for many physicians the feedback we ve gotten is one of the real value of propositions for baxdela is keeping patients out of hospital or getting them out of hospital sooner so we see the outpatient arena is really valuable over the long run and while we have seen podiatrists use it in mixed infection our number one prescriber actually is infectious disease specialists and prescribing on an outpatient setting they get these patients with these skin infections that have had one or two courses of other antibiotics and get referred to them and then they go ahead and prescribe back selling to try to keep the patient on the hospital and we ve heard nothing really but good things back on the product is performed really as expected in some cases certainly the physicians mind better than they would have expected so we see that continuing to grow there s still a lot of growth there we really haven t touched primary care and we re looking at what s the most efficient way for us to do that obviously in our situation we re running very lean and we re going to be looking for a capital efficient profitable growth but as i look over the long term certainly i think not myself but we as a company believe that there s substantial growth in the outpatient arena and really helping patients tackle these resistant infections and keep them out of hospital and save the healthcare system the money operator our next question comes from ed arce with h c wainwright your line is now open edarce hi john and peter thanks for taking my questions so i have a few first is around the payments that you mentioned towards the end of your prepared remarks the 30 million due to rempex and 225 million payments to the medicines company i know you filed a complaint but in total that s 80 million presumably that would go out the door sometime this year how are you planning the contingency for that even if not all of that is ultimately required second question is around the 75 million target that was required originally by deerfield has that been reworked for 2019 third is how do you i know you ve discussed this a bit already but how do you drive what do you think are the most important drivers to continue to move forward with sales growth in your two lead products that are still relatively early in launch baxdela and vabomere and then finally do you plan do you expect to break out sales for each of the four drugs each quarter going forward thanks so much petermilligan sure let me try to answer as many of those as i can and then i can hand it off to john so call rempex so that the agreement with rempex came as part of the medco agreement and because we have a complaint against medco we really can t comment on any of that now any specifics on it so as a result i can t give you sort of expectations of when or how much that gets settled that clearly but i can tell you that when we put together the financing with vatera and knowing that we had already drawn the 75 million and we have access to 60 million more and we have as john mentioned started to pursue an abl that we could cover all that and so think about if you look at our ending cash balance plus the cash that we assume that we can raise you re probably into 230 million range and then if you look at our cash usages we are forgetting about anything that happens on the medco rempex side and forgetting about non sort of product revenue so if you just leave those two out just use the two guidance points that we reference which is sales at 65 million and opex at 140 million we talked about a gross margin at 55 million that s true but it s probably almost 70 69 or 70 when you take out the non cash amortization so you just do the back of the envelope math on that and you re probably spending 120 million so if you have 230 million 240 and you re at 120 million you certainly have a fair amount of cash left at the end of the year so sort of more enough to get into 2020 as we talked about that s the first thing on the deerfield target when we made the changes when we did arrange the vatera financing we did have to make a change to our existing secured lending agreement and part of that change was to reduce the sale covenants by 15 each year and there are two the 45 million didn t change but we met that obviously that was for 2018 for 2019 it was 75 million 15 less and for 2020 for the term of the loan it would have been a 100 million and that s now moved to 85 million so those are the new cost sales covenant johnjohnson and then as we look at certainly driving baxdela sales and vabomere sales we re only in about 40 of our target hospitals at this point but remember we re still working through the process on formulary and the operational pieces with the micro lab and cpoe systems at the others so there s a lot of growth there we re focused on that and like i said we are seeing a nice strengthening of that business here in the first quarter in for baxdela what we re really doing is focusing our efforts on those high prescribers in absssi who are quinolone favorable and also have good reimbursement in their area in order for us to be most effective and tim simon our chief commercial officer has put a hyper focus on those folks and we will be looking at other ways to continue to drive them into the outpatient arena in advance of the cabp indication this fall petermilligan i think the last question was on the breakout of sales and of course we ll be honest on every question and that is we don t know yet we hadn t broken them out before and so now we gave the full year break out and it ll be something that john and i and others on the team will discuss as to whether or not we do that that is something that we ll get more thoughtful more thought in edarce all right great thank you for all that and congrats on corralling with this a lot of moving parts and moving forward into this year operator our next question comes from kevin kedra with g research your line is now open kevinkedra thanks for taking my questions first i just want clarification on the opex guidance of 140 million was that i m sure that was a gaap or non gaap number and wondering if you can maybe talk about how that breaks down between sg a and r d we re trying to get a sense of how we should be thinking about guys kind of exiting the year what kind of run rate to think about as you taper that down through the year and then secondly on baxdela we ve seen a couple rounds of class warnings against the fluoroquinolone class wondering if you re seeing any impact there with prescribers or the perception of the product of the class in the market or we at the point now where prescribers who use quinolone are going to use them and those who have seen the warnings and decided not going to use them there s really no change given that there s new things coming out and then finally in the press release you guys talked about increasing your territory your marketing territory i assume that s just something expansion with your partners to some of these international markets or were you looking at some international markets to take the product directly as well like say canada or other places where you have products that aren t necessarily partnered in those markets petermilligan okay i mean i can start on the opex question so yes that s a gaap that s a bit of a gaap number for 2019 when you look at the components r d last year 2018 was 55 million i don t want to give this specific number because obviously we still we have a budget but we re the numbers will move around as we see opportunities throughout the year to either take some expenses out or if we need to add them but directionally you can look at that number sort of being cut almost in half maybe a little bit more and what drives that really is the wrapping up of the cabp trial that s the biggest driver there on the sales side we probably spent the high 80s in terms of sales we ll spend a little less not that much that ll be the area that we want to aggressively protect the most so we will spend some less on sales there was a bunch of recruiting costs and other things that happened in the first year there are upfront marketing costs that don t repeat but clearly we know that that s an area of the budget that we want to do everything we possibly can to protect and then the biggest drop really is going to be in g a and g a has 12 million of severance in it last year we don t expect that to repeat the reductions that we had to take in force were taken in the fourth quarter and we will pay some of that severance this year some of it was paid last year but from a gaap perspective you can expect to see g a drop significantly if you follow some of the things we ve talked about there s been certain assets that we are no longer investing in or i m sorry no longer carrying there s a lot of integration cost that took place in 2018 that were behind there have been significant changes to the leadership team and as a result of all that the one thing that and we spent john and i and others spent a lot of time at the end of 2018 as we prepared for this year to make sure that we were focused as much as we possibly could on only the items that helped drive these four products and so everything in g a to the extent it s not an absolute requirement is going to be pulled down to make sure it s only done to support those products and then lastly i said r d there s really two things driving r d and it s the cabp reduction and also as john mentioned earlier that we re no longer investing in discovery so those are the two drivers there collectively all of that gets you to that 140 million johnjohnson and then as it relates to the question of baxdela and the quinolone class warnings we ve been monitoring total quinolone prescriptions since those warnings have issued and we have not seen a change in the marketplace feedback from customers whether they ve use these products a long time and then they appreciate being informed around that but we haven t seen any impact at all on the class at least to date like i said we monitor that weekly and then peter you want to talk about the marketing rights petermilligan yes and we re talking about expansion we are talking about license rights whether you look at other opportunities to bring our drugs with our own sales force internationally i think right now that the market in the us so it got so much more room in it but we certainly want to make sure we saturate that market first and we have a long way to go before we do that so when we look that comment really is designed to talk about having experts in other countries that we can license it end of q a operator ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation in today s conference it does conclude the program and you may now disconnect everyone have a great day
inside the market s roundup of some of today s key analyst actions early termination of mandated production cuts and associated wcs syncrude differential blowout are the biggest risks to the canadian integrated oil and gas sector according to credit suisse analyst manav guptra in a research note released thursday mr gupta revised his estimates and made a trio of rating changes to companies in his coverage universe in justifying his moves mr gupta pointed to 1 delays in line 3 startup 2 changes in the methodology of calculating production cuts 3 venezuelan sanction and increased tightness in north american heavy sour markets 4 alberta adding to crude by rail capacity and 5 berkshire adding suncor to its portfolio he downgraded his rating for husky energy inc hse t to neutral from outperform with a target of 18 falling from 24 the average is currently 17 43 hse is in the have nots bucket when it comes to alberta mandated production cuts he said even though the government rolled back the level of curtailments for february and march hse will see steeper cuts for the period as new methodology works against those operators that were already curtailing volumes owing to economic reasons hse s free cash flow yield lags peers and investors are skeptical of management s claim it is not actively pursuing another deal after meg fell through mr gupta upgraded imperial oil ltd imo t to neutral from underperform with a 39 target rising from 38 but 86 cents lower than the consensus on the street given imo s contracted pipe 100 mb d and rail capacity 100 mb d and its integrated business model it will be less affected by line 3 delays the analyst said we believe after 4q18 earnings call the market better understands the risk to 2019 volume guidance which was the basis of our initial underperform rating with venezuelan barrels displaced north america is short heavy sour barrels and imo is 300mb d long heavy sour barrels production refinery usage which we view positively imo owns its own rail terminals and is the lowest cost rail operator when diffs do widen modestly imo s rail will be back in the money moving stranded barrels to the gulf coast he also raised his rating suncor energy inc su t to outperform from neutral with a 52 target price jumping from 48 the average is 55 07 suncor s 17 per cent annual dividend hike came in well above credit suisse and street estimates of 12 15 per cent he said besides its dividend hike su reloaded buyback by 2 billion suncor is one of the most shareholder friendly energy companies with an integrated business model no aeco exposure and dividend safety alberta government change in methodology of calculating cuts provides relief to su that was ramping volumes on projects like fort hills in the past 6 9 months or suffered unplanned downtime at syncrude recently brk added 10 8 million shares of su 0 7 per cent outstanding valued at 301 million to its portfolio in 4q18 looking at its investment pattern we expect brk will add to the position which should drive stock re rating at the same time mr gupta maintained an outperform rating for canadian natural resources ltd cnq t and raised his target to 50 from 48 the average is currently 45 88 citing potential upside from recent capital deployment cibc world markets analyst paul holden upgraded great west lifeco inc gwo t to outperformer from neutral in a research note released thursday we have become increasingly positive on gwo as we have worked through various capital deployment scenarios he said our belief is that the announced sib is just the tip of the iceberg and that the company has more than ample remaining capital to complete acquisitions in both asset management and retirement administration in fact we would argue that the sib signals management has line of sight on acquisition targets providing confidence around transaction size and accretion potential we estimate eps upside of 17 21 per cent from completing the sib acquiring wells fargo s retirement admin business and acquiring a u s asset manager that is roughly the same size of putnam sibs completed in canada since the beginning of 2017 show that the offers are fully taken up in more than 90 per cent of occurrences the average clearing price relative to the minimum offer price is 6 per cent applying these figures to the gwo sib implies a clearing price of 31 80 and a 6 4 per cent reduction in shares o s our 2019e eps for gwo increases by 6 per cent to account for our average sib assumptions mr holden raised his target to 37 50 per share from 33 the average is currently 32 78 the stock is trading at 10 3 times price to earnings next 12 month consensus a 13 per cent discount to its five year average and excluding any benefit for the announced sib accordingly we view relative downside risk as limited if management is not able to close acquisitions this year conversely mr holden lowered sun life financial inc slf t to underperformer from neutral we think organic growth will slow following a solid 2018 result and we think that m a price discipline may take longer to execute the analyst said our price target increases but that still implies less potential upside relative to the other lifecos effectively we see more potential catalysts and more potential for multiple expansion for the other lifecos perhaps the greatest risk to our call is that the broader equity markets move lower and slf is able to find better pricing for acquisition targets mr holden s target rose by a loonie to 54 the average is 54 58 barrick gold corp s abx t abx n proposed joint venture with newmont mining corp nem n that combines their assets in nevada is a low risk high reward agreement with positive long term implications according to desjardins securities analyst josh wolfson the partnership secures a long held aspiration to reduce redundancies and improve efficiency among an overlapping asset base said mr wolfson in a research note released wednesday although quantifying synergy upside is challenging we forecast interim abx nevada forecasts improve materially from the jv alone believing the jv improves his interim outlook mr wolfson raised his rating for barrick to buy from hold excluding the benefit of any synergies our 2020 21 fcf improves by a sizeable us 135 302 million as abx benefits from both higher attributable production and lower attributable capital spending due to shared goldrush development costs he said this is partially offset by modestly lower nevada fcf thereafter as prior nevada growth is now also shared within the jv absent the inclusion of any synergies our abx nav increases 2 per cent solely from the jv agreement in its original hostile approach abx detailed us 480 million in initial annual synergies available of which u s 120 million was allocated to a rationalization of duplicated overhead costs potentially uncertain under the new jv structure a conservative combined us 180 million synergy estimate ie 50 per cent realization of us 480 million less us 120 million would increase our prior abx nav by 7 per cent consensus 9 per cent and increase short term abx fcf by 8 per cent consensus 8 per cent our updated published forecasts reflect a similar realization yielding a net 6 per cent to our nav from synergies or 8 per cent including jv benefits mr wolfson maintained a 22 target for barrick shares the average on the street is 18 67 despite the expected material available benefits from the nevada jv and future potential upside from reserves cut off assumptions abx shares responded mildly and now trade at a discount to the group on a spot nav basis 1 66 times vs 1 67 times and at fair fcf ev yield of 4 0 3 7 per cent in 2019 20 he said although longer term declining production and required capital reinvestment remain a challenge for abx in our view the company s intermediate outlook has improved materially empire company ltd emp a t is seeing early stage traction for its strategic initiatives according to raymond james analyst kenric tyghe noting category resets starting to click on wednesday the grocery retailer reported adjusted earnings per share of 27 cents missing the expectation on the street by 4 cents however mr tyghe said the miss belies a stronger than expected absolute and relative performance by empire given the noise in the consensus estimate in the quarter empire not only reported broader share gains but also share gains excl farm boy in the must win ontario market where its market share was historically low he said the sss growth of 3 3 per cent excl fuel on internal food inflation of 1 8 per cent and tonnage growth of 1 5 per cent reflected a de minimus which we estimate at high single digit to low double digit basis points contribution from farm boy on gross margin expansion of 24 basis points which would have been higher if not for the pace of fresh inflation which exacerbates the normal tracking error and negative mix impact on the relative strength of both discount and quebec the team was clearly disciplined in its execution and was not buying share the gross margin performance in quarter reflected the early stage benefits of the category resets which management is confident are passed the pointof maximum risk and accretion from the farm boy acquisition while farm boy today is a small piece of the puzzle in terms of dollars it is quite obviously a critical piece of winning in urban ontario specifically the gta with the results mr tyghe raised his 2019 2020 and 2021 eps projections to 1 46 2 02 and 2 18 respectively from 1 41 1 95 and 2 04 keeping a market perform rating for empire shares mr tyghe increased his target by a loonie to 32 which is 65 cents lower than the consensus while the customer centric transformation of empire focused on delivering the right experience at the right cost is gaining traction faster and with fewer missteps to date than we expected given the innate complexity of the transformation we remain on the sidelines he said the continued traction of the category resets and discount strategy would further improve our increasingly positive bias badger daylighting ltd bad t delivered surprising fourth quarter results and now possesses an attractive valuation according to canaccord genuity analyst yuri lynk on wednesday the calgary based environmental services company reported revenue and adjusted ebitda of 179 million and 48 million respectively representing jumps of 35 per cent and 39 per cent year over year and exceeding mr lynk s projections 147 million and 41 million
