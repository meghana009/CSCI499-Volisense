usmca unlocked working under the new nafta ambassador susan esserman arun venkataraman luke tillman and lauren shapiro introduction the trump administration is preparing to submit legislation to congress to implement the us mexico canada agreement usmca designed to replace the north american free trade agreement nafta president trump has routinely referred to nafta as a disaster identifying nafta renegotiation or withdrawal as a priority of his trade agenda based on the perception that trade and investment liberalization under nafta helped drive manufacturing jobs out of the united states furthermore after over 25 years nafta has begun to show signs of its age no longer reflecting the state of the art in foreign economic policy as it did in 1993 for example through its provisions on services trade intellectual property investment protection and state owned enterprises soes notwithstanding the rhetoric surrounding nafta and the new negotiations the usmca does not reflect a fundamentally different approach to us trade agreements nor a wholesale revision of nafta the disciplines governing tariff elimination nontariff barriers and services liberalization remain largely the same and with limited exception any changes address post internet commercial topics and or updated us approaches to trade issues as set out in 2015 trade promotion authority legislation and modern free trade agreements ftas nevertheless these changes and others carry potentially significant implications for business planning across sectors and provide insight into the administration s likely approach and priorities in subsequent trade negotiations although the administration is preparing implementing legislation to be submitted to congress a number of issues are likely to put off a final vote beyond this summer in addition to the delayed economic impact report from the us international trade commission the trump administration will need to address bipartisan concerns with section 232 duties and democratic objections to labor and intellectual property provisions and skepticism about enforcement president trump has threatened to withdraw from nafta to force a vote on the usmca as it currently stands although that appears increasingly unlikely whether the administration negotiates an alternative to section 232 duties with trading partners re opens the agreement or works with members of congress to modify draft implementing legislation significant work remains to be done before congress will be in a position to consider the agreement we discuss below in greater detail certain highlights of the usmca in its current form and offer the following initial takeaways i modernizing nafta the usmca updates nafta and offers meaningful improvements for us commercial interests in a number of ways for example the usmca dramatically strengthens existing rules on state owned enterprises and enhances the labor and environmental obligations of the parties including through labor obligations specific to mexico new disciplines have been introduced in digital trade and e commerce industries barely in existence at the time of nafta and new obligations with respect to exchange rates have been introduced that make oversight of currency policies more effective the administration has even used the usmca to address two of industry s strongest criticisms of the final trans pacific partnership tpp text namely the time period for data exclusivity for biologics and the exclusion of financial services from the scope of data localization restrictions both topics that had little commercial relevance when nafta was signed key policy departures while not having transformed the us approach to trade agreements the usmca still departs from longstanding us policy in certain areas in particular the usmca eliminates rights and market access opportunities negotiated under nafta by severely restricting the availability of investor state dispute settlement isds and reducing access to canadian and us procurement markets this policy reversal reflects the administration s views unique to any administration in almost 40 years that isds merely encourages offshoring and that the us procurement market should be largely reserved for us firms rather than negotiated away for access to foreign procurement markets no new manufacturing approach given the criticism leveled by the president at previous trade agreements and his belief that the usmca would transform north america back into a manufacturing powerhouse we might have expected the usmca to comprise a fundamentally different systemic approach to manufacturing than previous ftas instead those innovative and commercially significant elements introduced by the administration include revised rules of origin primarily for autos as well as the aforementioned limitations on isds and government procurement beyond the rules of origin and isds provisions which alone are likely to have little impact on the manufacturing sector most new disciplines in the usmca bear considerable resemblance to those found in the tpp china on my mind the usmca makes clear that even when negotiating a north american trade agreement china remains front of mind for this administration like the tpp the usmca contains new provisions on currency and state owned enterprises which although the united states has previously had concerns with the operations of stateowned enterprises in canada and mexico appear more directly targeted at china s state led economic model beyond this set of disciplines however the usmca goes further to deny any chinese owned or controlled firm standing to launch an isds ii claim and to expressly identify one party s negotiation of an fta with a non market country as a possible basis for the other two parties to terminate the usmca and replace it with a bilateral agreement effective enforcement contrary to the us push for a stronger dispute settlement mechanism during the uruguay round and for more effective enforcement processes in recent ftas the usmca does little to correct a flaw in nafta that allows a responding party to block the formation of a dispute settlement panel although dispute settlement under us ftas has been limited enforceability has long been viewed by congress and stakeholders as critical to cementing the gains achieved through negotiation of strong substantive disciplines the usmca outcome appears to reflect the trump administration s skepticism of the value of binding dispute settlement perhaps driven largely by the us experience with certain disputes within the world trade organization wto dispute settlement system iii table of contents i strengthening the north american autos sector 1 a rules of origin 1 b exemptions for usmca

north american autos sector ensuring that vehicles traded among the united states canada and mexico contain more regional and us made value was a core trump administration objective in nafta renegotiations rules of origin are used in free trade agreements ftas to determine whether a good originated from within the fta area and can therefore qualify for the agreement s tariff benefits when the good moves among the member countries of the fta if a product imported by one fta partner from another fails to qualify under the applicable rules of origin that product typically receives the importing country s most favored nation mfn tariff rate the mfn rate for a product imported into a particular country is the rate that would apply to that product if it had originated from another wto member with which the importing country does not have an fta building off of the existing high content requirement for autos and auto parts set out in nafta the administration succeeded in strengthening those rules of origin even more in order to further ensure that north american cars would be made primarily of north american components instead of components from asia or europe some of the changes to these rules of origin serve to advantage us products in particular the trump administration s emphasis on strengthening the automotive rules of origin in a renegotiated nafta reflects its prioritization of us manufacturing as a metric of success in trade negotiations a rules of origin under nafta autos and auto parts must satisfy among other things regional value content rvc requirements i e a minimum percentage of value originating from the nafta parties to qualify for nafta duty preferences these include an rvc requirement of 62 5 for autos and light vehicles and their engines and transmissions and 60 for larger trucks large truck engines and transmissions and certain auto parts with the exception of certain bearings and batteries the usmca significantly raises these content requirements across the board to 70 and 75 for heavy trucks and passenger vehicles light trucks respectively and to 70 85 depending on the calculation method used for auto parts in achieving this outcome the trump administration responded directly to concerns expressed by the steel industry unions and certain members of congress about the thresholds in tpp s autos rules of origin at the urging of the trump administration the usmca also introduces two new requirements for imports of autos and auto parts that are unrelated to the regional value content of the imported automotive product as a whole first fresh off the heels of section 232 import restrictions on steel and aluminum the administration secured additional benefits for those industries in the usmca by requiring that www steptoe com 1 for any passenger vehicle light truck or heavy truck to benefit from usmca tariff preferences at least 70 of the vehicle manufacturer s purchases of steel and aluminum over a prescribed time period e g fiscal calendar year quarter or month of export originate in the usmca parties second the usmca introduces labor value content lvc rules for the first time in any us trade agreement these rules require that a significant portion of a car or truck s content including r d and assembly be made by workers earning us 16 or more per hour for passenger vehicles this lvc requirement will begin at 30 of an automobile s content and rise to 40 over three years light and heavy trucks will be subject to an lvc requirement of 45 on day one average auto industry wages in mexico are currently well below this 16 per hour threshold this provision could therefore incentivize automakers to source certain inputs from companies operating in the united states and canada and it may eventually lead to rising auto industry wages in mexico for the big three given a head start with an already well integrated autos sector including longstanding relationships with north american suppliers these rvc and other changes appear to be well within reach if not already capable of being met based on existing supply chains however for european and japanese automakers with natural linkages to intra firm and other suppliers in europe and asia this may force reassessment of their reliance on those linkages particularly if any of their manufacturing facilities in a usmca nation are or were planning to serve as an export platform to other usmca nations initial evidence indicates this may already be underway as companies consider seeking new suppliers or establishing or expanding manufacturing facilities in mexico and the united states simply to meet the usmca requirements at the same time retaining existing procurement strategies may be the economically desirable option for certain firms because american canadian and mexican mfn tariffs on many automotive products are quite low for example the us mfn tariff on passenger cars and many auto parts is just 2 5 the costs of supply chain reconfiguration not to mention the significant compliance costs of performing complex lvc and rvc calculations may discourage manufacturers from reconfiguring their supply chains for certain cars and components b exemptions for usmca parties from potential section 232 autos import restrictions the trump administration s emphasis on automotive rules of origin and the novel elements included in these rules reflects its focus on actively using trade policy instruments to promote the us auto industry in line with this focus the us department of commerce doc conducted an investigation under section 232 of the trade expansion act of 1962 into the national security impacts of automotive imports the doc has submitted a confidential report to the president containing the findings of its investigation and its recommendations for restrictions on automotive imports while the doc findings and recommendations have not yet been made www steptoe com 2 public recent reports suggest that recommended options for import relief may involve tariffs of up to 25 on all vehicle and parts imports tariffs of up to 25 on a broad range of automotive products with a focus on automotive parts or targeted tariffs on certain automotive imports such as automated connected electric and shared aces vehicles and related technologies the president now has until may 18 2019 to decide whether he will implement the doc recommendations for import restrictions take alternative action or opt not to take action aware of the possibility that the trump administration might soon impose tariffs on automotive imports canada and mexico pressed for a commitment to exclude their products from any potential section 232 autos remedy although the usmca offered no resolution to the existing section 232 tariffs imposed on steel and aluminum from canada and mexico it did produce an outcome with respect to the potential section 232 action on autos in side letters to the agreement the united states committed to the exemptions in the table below if impose a measure passenger cars light trucks auto parts canada 2 6 million units annually exempted all exempted 32 4 billion in annual value exempted mexico 2 6 million units annually exempted all exempted 108 billion in annual value exempted these exemptions may indicate that the trump administration recognizes the particularly integrated nature of the north american automotive sector and the correspondingly significant impact that tariffs on mexican and canadian autos and parts would have on us vehicle manufacturers as evidence of extensive regional integration the congressional research service has noted that some motor vehicle parts and components cross the us border more than eight times in the production and assembly process but that nevertheless when compared with canada and mexico us motor vehicle manufacturing retains a large base of us component and assembly operations that has not been displaced by imports notably these exemptions would comfortably cover the number of light autos and value of auto parts currently imported from canada and mexico for 2017 imports of passenger cars and light trucks together amounted to 1 8 million units for canada and 2 4 million units for mexico and imports of auto parts totaled 16 4 billion from canada and 55 3 billion from mexico indeed at these levels the exemptions provide room for trade diversion i e increased imports from canada and mexico in the event of section 232 tariffs on other countries these exemptions would therefore meaningfully reduce the overall impact of those tariffs on american auto manufacturers www steptoe com 3 ii bringing nafta into the 21st century a digital trade and e commerce twenty five years after nafta was signed in a world of growing reliance on the internet cloud computing and artificial intelligence cross border data flows have taken on exponentially greater commercial significance and prompted governmental policy responses in recognition of this fundamental change congress set out trade negotiating objectives on digital trade in the 2015 trade promotion authority legislation calling for duty free building off of the existing high trade in electronic transmissions eliminating discrimination against content requirement for autos electronically traded goods and and auto parts set out in nafta the administration succeeded in strengthening those rules of ori services and cross border data flows and removing other restrictions on digital trade in goods and services data flows and data storage gin even more in order to further ensure that north american cars would be made primarily of north the usmca meets these objectives with rules on digital products data and cloud computing and american components instead of e commerce largely tracking the tpp components from asia or europe digital provisions with respect to digital products the usmca prohibits a party from requiring the disclosure of source code as a condition of market access or discriminating against digital products of another party it also prohibits customs duties on digital products transmitted electronically effectively codifying the wto moratorium that has been regularly renewed since 1998 on data the agreement prohibits a party from restricting cross border business data transfers and from requiring data to be locally stored or processed as a condition of doing business in that party this latter obligation is a notable advance from tpp in two respects first unlike in tpp the financial services sector with limited exceptions is fully subject to the prohibition on data localization requirements in the usmca second whereas tpp explicitly authorized an exception to this data localization obligation for certain measures to achieve a legitimate public policy objective the usmca does not provide this specific exception although the general exceptions continue to apply e g for public morals health the choice not to include an exception for legitimate public policy objective removes a broad exception and reflects the view that there may more reasonably be a number of policy justifications requiring some limits on data transfers than for requiring the use of local computing facilities www steptoe com 4 the usmca facilitates e commerce by encouraging the usmca parties to accept electronic signatures as a valid form of authentication and raising and codifying the monetary thresholds below which customs duties on express shipments do not apply such de minimis levels benefit e commerce platforms their small business suppliers and their shipping companies because higher thresholds mean customers in one party can purchase greater volumes of products from those platforms in another party without triggering any customs duties by setting these specific de minimis levels at 117 instead of 50 for mexico and c 150 instead of c 20 for canada the usmca goes beyond tpp s requirement to simply establish monetary thresholds for customs duties at this time the 800 de minimis threshold set by us law will remain applicable for imports from mexico and canada however the usmca includes a footnote authorizing a party to lower its de minimis level to provide reciprocal treatment for goods from another party that maintained a lower de minimis level this possibility of the united states going backwards and significantly lowering its monetary threshold even if to incentivize favorable action in another party surprised many e commerce businesses and other retailers as well as their supporters in congress prompting letters from a group of industry associations over 40 members of congress and the senate finance committee expressing their opposition to a lower us de minimis threshold most notably the usmca includes for the first time in any us trade agreement a requirement for trading partners to essentially implement their own safe harbor for internet service providers and online platforms in other words the usmca requires canada and mexico to ensure along the lines of section 230 of the communications decency act that internet service providers and online platforms are not treated as publishers of content and accordingly are immune from civil liability for material they display or transmit but do not create this removal of the yoke of potential unlimited liability for third party content has led to section 230 often being recognized as a fundamental pillar of the internet economy at the same time however the scope of immunity granted by section 230 particularly as it has been broadly interpreted by courts has been called into question recently giving rise to a growing debate about whether limits on that immunity need to be introduced or better clarified inserting a section 230 like obligation into a trade agreement in the midst of such a debate will likely prompt concerns among those stakeholders pressing for limitations on the immunity granted by that provision b intellectual property biologics one of the us objectives in recent trade negotiations has been to secure a period of regulatory data protection rdp for biologics that would protect the significant investment in clinical trials and other efforts to produce data needed for regulatory approval in contrast to traditional small molecule drugs biologics are complex medications derived from living organisms e g proteins genes blood biosimilars are medications that are highly similar to original patented biologics in form and function and like generic drugs are not different from the corresponding patented www steptoe com 5 products in any clinically meaningful way consistent with their obligations under the wto agreement on trade related intellectual property rights trips many countries provide rdp for specified time periods for new drugs but in so doing make no distinction between new drugs in the form of biologics or in the form of small molecules in light of the relative novelty of modern biologics and the distinctive aspects of bringing biologics to market including higher r d costs and greater manufacturing sophistication us law provides 12 years of data protection specifically for biologics given the diverse markets involved and particular domestic political issues in certain countries the united states could not secure a clean period of extended data exclusivity for biologics in tpp instead tpp required that parties provide effective market protection for biologics either in the form of a straightforward 8 year term of data protection or through a combination of at least 5 years data protection and other measures that would jointly achieve a comparable outcome in the market this result also allowed for the possibility that in some circumstances the time it would naturally take for a biosimilar to secure regulatory approval might be long enough such that when combined with data protection it would achieve for the original biologic the same effective market protection the failure to achieve a more explicit commitment to a longer period of data protection for biologics immediately became a central criticism of the final tpp text from certain quarters in industry and congress the trump administration succeeded in extending the minimum period of data protection for biologics to 10 years with no suggestion of alternative means of achieving that protection although this outcome still does not reflect the 12 year standard under us law it takes a significant step towards addressing concerns with the tpp outcome at the same time a number of democratic house members have already expressed opposition specifically to the biologics outcome with a letter expected from over 100 democratic lawmakers calling on the administration to renegotiate those provisions with a view to lowering prescription drug prices this increasingly vocal opposition will contribute to the complexity of securing the votes needed for passage of usmca implementing legislation c labor the usmca labor provisions represent a significant advance over nafta s labor side agreement largely tracking the tpp labor commitments but introducing notable new disciplines as well 1 nafta nafta was the first trade agreement in the world to formally address workers rights the parties accomplished this through a labor side agreement known as the north american agreement on labor cooperation or naalc as the first of its kind the naalc approach centered on a party s enforcement of its own labor laws leaving the content of those laws largely to the party s discretion apart from www steptoe com 6 a broad commitment to ensure that its labor laws and regulations provide for high labor standards consistent with high quality and productivity workplaces and continue to strive to improve those standards in that light as such each party s fundamental obligation was to effectively enforce through appropriate government action although the naalc did not prescribe particular labor standards it did identify labor principles that the parties committed to promote including in respect of the freedom of association the right to strike migrant workers equal pay for equal work occupational safety child labor and forced labor the side agreement also introduced novel obligations for parties to establish independent and transparent legal institutions to adjudicate alleged violations of domestic labor laws and to put in place procedures to promote public awareness of domestic labor policymaking the naalc introduced a public submissions process designed to help hold countries accountable for their labor law violations and labor conditions specifically the naalc allowed stakeholders to submit comments related to any labor law matter occurring in another nafta country to their own country s designated naalc office within the labor ministry a submission to such designated office could lead to consultations with the designated office in the relevant nafta party and a report issued by the home country designated office but these actions were taken solely at the discretion of the home country designated office based on the review conducted by that designated office the issue may be elevated to further consultations at the ministerial level failure to resolve the issue in those consultations could lead to review by an expert committee and for certain labor law matters formal dispute settlement proceedings initiated by a party nafta was the first international agreement to subject labor obligations to binding state to state dispute settlement however these procedures were separate from those available for obligations in the main text of the agreement and they applied only to disputes that 1 related to persistent violations by a party 2 of its own occupational safety and health child labor or minimum wage technical standards 3 in situations where the pattern of enforcement failures were trade related covered by mutually recognized labor laws a finding of violation could lead to development of an action plan for the offending party to remedy its failure followed by a monetary fine if that failed and ultimately the possibility of trade sanctions these sanctions were limited to 0 007 of trade in goods between the parties and the complaining party had to limit punitive tariffs to the lesser of the pre nafta levels or the mfn rate no labor dispute under the naalc has actually proceeded to arbitration and therefore fines and trade sanctions have never been imposed under the naalc 2 tpa tpp over 20 years after nafta was signed with its side agreements on labor and environment the political and policy landscape had shifted significantly with respect to the salience of labor and environmental issues in the trade context www steptoe com 7 congress made clear in the latest iteration of trade promotion authority in 2015 its expectation for a much more robust and enforceable set of labor and environment disciplines in any regional trade agreement as to labor congress identified the following among its priority objectives the implementation of specific international labor organization ilo core labor standards commitments not to derogate from or fail to effectively enforce domestic labor laws and coverage of labor commitments under the same dispute settlement process as other commitments consistent with these objectives tpp followed an entirely different approach from the naalc greatly expanding the scope of the labor chapter to include prescriptions on specific laws that parties would need to adopt and maintain the agreement required parties to implement ilo core labor standards on freedom of association the right to collective bargaining compulsory labor child labor and non discrimination tpp also required that parties establish laws relating to minimum wages hours of work and occupational safety and health although it did not further define what those wages hours or conditions should be tpp also adopted a more fulsome public submissions process and greater opportunities for public participation in the implementation of labor commitments all of these obligations were subject to the agreement s standard dispute settlement process finally although not a separate and enforceable set of commitments under tpp mexico did institute a series of constitutional reforms relating to labor courts collective bargaining and union representation seeking to respond to concerns raised in congress and by us labor leaders 3 usmca the usmca largely replicates the tpp s provisions on ilo standards wages and hours health and safety public submissions and participation and applicability of dispute settlement it also goes further to build on the strong tpp labor outcomes in meaningful ways first it makes the passage of new mexican labor rights laws including significant legislation implementing the aforementioned constitutional amendments subject to dispute settlement with this legislation assuming it meets the requirements of the usmca mexico will have taken tangible steps to address some of the strongest criticisms on labor including notably the prevalence of protection contracts in mexico or artificial unions set up by companies without the input of workers these sham unions keep mexican wages artificially low and therefore from the us perspective contribute to the offshoring of us jobs to mexico second the usmca commits parties to uphold a number of new progressive workers rights it introduces an obligation that did not exist in the tpp that requires parties to address violence or threats of violence against workers that are trying to exercise their fundamental ilo rights parties must also provide job protected leave for birth or adoption of a child and care of family members finally as originally negotiated each usmca party would have been required to implement policies that protect workers against employment discrimination on the basis of sex including with regard to pregnancy sexual harassment sexual orientation gender identity and caregiving responsibilities www steptoe com 8 this language created controversy in the united states by highlighting the contentious issue of whether existing federal law in particular title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation the trump administration s position and that of many congressional republicans is that it does not a position generally rejected by democrats us federal appeals courts are split and the supreme court has not yet resolved this matter in response to republican concerns the trump administration renegotiated this provision to limit the obligation to implement policies that considers appropriate to protect workers following a belt and suspenders approach the administration supplemented this self judging standard with a footnote asserting that the provision requires no additional action on the part of the united states including any amendments to in order for the united states to be in compliance finally it is important to note that although the usmca brings labor obligations under the rubric of the same dispute settlement mechanism applicable to all of the commercially oriented obligations that mechanism like in nafta effectively allows a responding party to block the formation of a dispute settlement panel see section vi on enforcement given the particular significance attached by democrats to enforcement of labor obligations see section vii on implementation and the administration s own emphasis on the full enforce of labor obligations this limitation tempers the success of the substantive labor improvements achieved in this negotiation d environment like the usmca labor chapter the usmca environment chapter is more robust than its nafta predecessor much of the usmca environmental chapter is grounded in trade promotion authority objectives and or taken from the tpp but in certain respects the usmca does break new ground on environmental issues 1 nafta the environmental provisions added to nafta were set out in a separate side agreement the north american agreement on environmental cooperation naaec like the naalc the naaec as the first effort to bring environmental disciplines into a regional trade agreement did not seek to directly establish new environmental standards to be implemented by the parties instead it targeted national enforcement of national environmental laws and strengthening institutions to facilitate environmental policymaking and enforcement the principal obligation under the naaec therefore was for each party to effectively enforce its environmental laws and regulations through appropriate governmental action notwithstanding its focus on enforcement the naaec committed parties to maintain high levels of environmental protection and strive to continue to www steptoe com 9 improve those laws and policies as with the naalc the naaec also committed parties to establish independent and transparent legal institutions to adjudicate alleged violations of their domestic environmental laws and to educate the public on environmental laws and the state of the environment in furtherance of the obligation to effectively enforce domestic environmental laws the naaec established a groundbreaking public submissions process that has sought to serve as an additional vehicle of oversight of a party s environmental conditions and enforcement although similar to that set out in the naalc the naaec provided more explicitly for a report to result from the review of a given submission specifically the secretariat of the commission for environmental cooperation cec would receive submissions alleging a party s failure to effectively enforce its environmental law and upon instruction of the cec council i e an affirmative vote by two of the three parties develop a factual record and publish these submissions and factual records for public review the naaec set up a stand alone process for state to state disputes under this side agreement as in the case of labor a complaining party may challenge only another party s persistent pattern of failure to enforce its environmental law and must demonstrate that such failure is related to trade between the parties but there is no limitation on the scope of environmental law that may be the subject of the dispute in other respects such as the constraints on the monetary sanctions and the punitive tariffs that may be imposed the naaec follows the same approach as the naalc 2 tpa tpp like in the context of labor trade promotion authority legislation enacted in 2015 significantly expanded objectives for environmental provisions congress included in those objectives the implementation of specific multilateral environmental agreements including the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer montreal protocol and the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora cites commitments not to derogate from or fail to effectively enforce domestic environmental laws and coverage of environmental commitments under the same dispute settlement process as other commitments tpp addressed these objectives and developed a number of additional obligations requiring action in respect of a series of specific environmental challenges beyond the obligations to implement specific multilateral environmental agreements tpp committed parties to maintain or strengthen government capacity and institutional frameworks to promote sustainable forest management and promote legal trade in forest products for the first time in any trade agreement tpp also prohibited subsidies for fishing vessels linked to illegal unreported and unregulated iuu fishing as well as fishing subsidies that contribute to overfishing in addition tpp committed parties to adopt provisions similar to the us lacey act by requiring parties to prevent trade or transshipment in flora and fauna that had been taken or traded in violation of that party s conservation laws again as with labor each of these commitments would have been subject to the same dispute settlement processes as other obligations in the agreement www steptoe com 10 3 usmca in addition to provisions meeting the objectives set out in trade promotion authority legislation the usmca retains tpp provisions supporting effective enforcement of environmental laws and maintains tpp s commitments in relation to illegal logging forest and fisheries management and fisheries subsidies the usmca also goes beyond tpp in certain ways for example the usmca includes vessel operators in the scope of the prohibition on fisheries subsidies and commits all parties to work towards addressing those subsidies in the wto which is particularly significant given that wto members have been working for 18 years on an agreement on fishing subsidies and illegal fishing and aim to complete such an agreement this year the agreement also includes commitments to adopt restrictions on whaling consistent with existing international conventions and in a manner recognizing the special importance of whaling in indigenous communities finally the usmca introduces a requirement to conduct environmental impact assessments for central government projects that may have an effect on the environment through a side agreement referred to as the environmental cooperation agreement eca the usmca maintains the cec organizational structure and contemplates certain strategic priorities for trilateral environmental cooperation largely tied to the actual usmca provisions that the cec could set the usmca slightly enhances the cec secretariat public submission process by making publication of submissions and related information the default instead of just an option for the secretariat notably absent from the usmca either in terms of commitments or identified areas of cooperation is any mention of climate change the final tpp text also failed to reference climate change explicitly and instead contained a limited provision calling for cooperation in a number of areas supporting the transition to a low emissions economy including renewable energy low emissions technologies and sustainable transport and infrastructure the eca similarly identifies certain areas of potential cooperation relating to low emissions however unlike tpp the eca lists these subjects only as possible areas of cooperation and does not situate this possible cooperative activity in the context of a commitment to transitioning to a low emissions economy furthermore rather than tpp s clean and renewable energy resources the eca lists all clean efficient energy sources that enhance energy security as an area of cooperation in the usmca parties are to bring environmental disputes to the same dispute settlement system applicable to all usmca commitments in the event that the parties cannot resolve the dispute after a panel ruling complaining parties can impose proportional trade measures against the violating party in the same manner authorized for labor and other chapter violations again as with labor the prospect of a party blocking state to state dispute settlement undermines the enforceability of these obligations www steptoe com 11 e standards and regulations the usmca builds on the tpp s provisions related to technical barriers to trade tbt and the development of regulations more broadly while these rule changes are process oriented they improve the ability of american stakeholders to shape rules and regulations drawing from and expanding upon the relevant tpp provisions the usmca s regulatory disciplines constitute a significant advance from those found in nafta and the wto agreement on technical barriers to trade tbt agreement to be sure the usmca like the tpp reaffirms core provisions of the wto tbt agreement such as non discrimination rules regarding standards regulations and procedures establishing compliance with those standards regulations i e conformity assessment procedures as well as provisions aimed at promoting transparency in the rulemaking process however the usmca also includes novel provisions that serve to promote data based policymaking require government rationales for particular regulatory approaches improve transparency and facilitate public participation in rulemaking processes first the usmca requires parties to use the criteria set out in the wto tbt committee decision on international standards as the sole basis for determining whether a standard constitutes an international standard the requirement to use these criteria is critical because under the wto tbt agreement as well as tpp and the usmca a party is generally required to base its regulation on a relevant international standard and provide an explanation if it chooses not to do so the usmca goes further to provide that where multiple relevant international standards exist a party must consider using each of them as the basis for regulation and where no international standard exists a party must consider a standard developed in another usmca party as the basis for regulation in both instances the party developing the regulation must explain why it rejected a particular international standard or standard developed in another usmca party second the usmca like tpp goes beyond the wto tbt agreement to require rather than encourage a party to provide national treatment and mfn treatment to those entities located in another party that evaluate a product s compliance with standards and regulations i e conformity assessment bodies as a result a conformity assessment body located in another party may be eligible to conduct any test or provide necessary certifications of conformity with a regulation as required by the party implementing that regulation and may do so under the same conditions and fees applicable to domestic conformity assessment bodies where a party does not accredit or recognize a conformity assessment body or does not accept test results or certifications from such a body it must explain the reasons for its decision upon request of another usmca party third the usmca reinforces and further specifies the obligations in the wto tbt agreement to publish proposed and final regulations for example the agreement clarifies that the reasonable time provided for public comments on proposed regulations should normally be 60 days and the reasonable interval between publication of a final regulation and its entry into force should generally be at least www steptoe com 12 six months as with tpp the usmca explicitly requires a party to treat firms from another party no less favorably than its own firms when it comes to opportunities to submit comments on proposed regulations and to the government s consideration of those comments the agreement also requires a party to explain when it issues a final regulation how it addressed substantive issues raised in public comments fourth tpp introduced a series of sectoral annexes to its tbt chapter containing a number of disciplines largely borne out of industry experience in various global markets the sectors covered by tpp were cosmetics medical devices pharmaceuticals information and communications technology ict wine and spirits proprietary formulas for prepackaged foods and additives and organic agricultural products the usmca followed a similar approach but limited its coverage to cosmetics medical devices pharmaceuticals ict chemical substances and energy performance standards these sector specific provisions covered a range of disciplines including prohibitions on requiring the transfer of cryptographic keys or algorithms ict restrictions on company data required for marketing approval for medical devices and drugs and requirements to apply risk based approaches to evaluating the safety of cosmetics and medical devices notably absent from these usmca sector specific provisions is the wine and spirits sector a significant traded sector among usmca parties finally the usmca chapter on good regulatory practices expands on provisions set out in the tpp regulatory coherence chapter to provide significant guidance on the approach to developing regulations more generally the usmca requires each party to explain and provide data underlying a proposed regulation use sound statistical methodologies when drawing conclusions from surveys identify what other regulatory approaches it considered including no regulation at all and provide reasons for its selected regulatory approach it also requires a party to consider costbenefit analyses when preparing a regulatory impact assessment and to periodically review regulations to determine whether they should be modified streamlined expanded or repealed www steptoe com 13 iii keeping an eye to china the trump administration pursued certain objectives in the usmca that appear to be driven more by a focus on disciplining or countering china s behavior than addressing specific concerns with canada or mexico state owned enterprises soes in canada and mexico largely do not compete with private firms or are limited to one or two sectors and neither country s policies have raised us concerns of currency manipulation nevertheless negotiating meaningful disciplines on these subjects advances the us interest in promoting rules that push china in particular to avoid distorting its internal market or global markets through soes and foreign exchange intervention similarly discouraging us trading partners from entering into preferential trading agreements with state led economies such as china can help mitigate the potential for us goods and services facing further unfair competition in those foreign markets a state owned enterprises soes the usmca includes the most expansive rules concerning the activities of soes in any us free trade agreement fta to date while the usmca soe chapter uses the relatively robust tpp chapter as a starting point it also strengthens the tpp soe provisions in meaningful ways and is a strong first step towards a broader approach to countering state led commercial activity in the global marketplace 1 previous us trade agreements beginning as early as the negotiations leading to the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt in 1947 the united states has long recognized the need for disciplines to ensure that soes and firms to which the state grants exclusive privileges such as regulatory powers do not distort cross border trade and investment flows the united states has included disciplines on those firms that is firms that the state owned or controlled through ownership interests or which the state designated to hold certain privileges in the market in nafta and most of its free trade agreements since those agreements generally required such firms to provide non discriminatory treatment and to act in accordance with commercial considerations i e make decisions like a private entity in the sale or purchase of goods and services where such firms were endowed with regulatory or other governmental authority those agreements treated them as governmental actors and required them to comply with the state s obligations under the respective agreement the modest disciplines in existing us trade agreements reflect a focus on actions by soes themselves that could discriminate against imported products or foreign www steptoe com 14 invested firms for example through their purchasing decisions or selection of customers however today s concerns with soes driven largely by china s state intervention are more far reaching more challenging than the behavior of these individual firms are the actions and policies of the government that can fundamentally alter the competitive landscape in favor of soes and other chosen firms and because of china s sheer size potentially alter that landscape on a global level 2 usmca as a solid initial step to counter this challenge following the approach negotiated in tpp the usmca significantly expands nafta s soe disciplines to address governmental actions that favor soes and thereby distort competition vis vis goods services and covered investments of other usmca parties the usmca does this by building on the framework of the wto agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures scm agreement including drawing on well established concepts like adverse effects material injury and domestic industry specifically the agreement prohibits a party from providing an soe with noncommercial assistance whether in the form of grants financing or equity infusions that causes adverse effects to another party this prohibition covers assistance provided directly from the government from another soe or indirectly through government direction of a non soe adverse effects include where the noncommercial assistance to an soe has impeded sales of the competing usmca good or service in the soe s market or in the market of another usmca party in addition the usmca expressly recognizes the potential harm from noncommercial assistance provided by a party to any of its soes that operates as a covered investment in the territory of another party given the unique potential for such assistance to effectively distort competition in that other party s market the usmca prohibits a party from causing material injury to the domestic industry of another party through such assistance as with the evaluation of injury as an adverse effect under the scm agreement this injury analysis largely tracks the approach used in countervailing duty investigations the usmca also reflects a meaningful improvement from tpp s soe provisions in three respects first the agreement defines soes more broadly than tpp to include not only firms with a greater than 50 government ownership interest but also firms where the government may hold a minority interest but nevertheless retain power to control the enterprise given the explicit desire of china s communist party to play a more meaningful role in management of even private firms this is a useful expansion of the soe definition second the agreement goes further than tpp in establishing certain forms of non commercial assistance to soes as being prohibited outright this prohibited assistance includes situations where the soes were otherwise unable to obtain market financing or were insolvent with no credible restructuring plan as has been the case with china s zombie firms third the usmca appears to adopt a more flexible specificity requirement that applies to the assistance covered by www steptoe com 15 its disciplines than tpp whereas tpp generally covered only such assistance where the beneficiaries were primarily soes the usmca only requires that the assistance have been limited to a certain set of enterprises as opposed for example to being generally available the usmca thus captures non commercial assistance to soes even where soes form only one part of the particular industry receiving the assistance b currency manipulation the usmca builds on tpp s currency provisions to ensure transparency in governments interventions in foreign exchange markets and establish a consultation process should any government perceive such action as a competitive devaluation because a government can use significant purchases of foreign currency to lower its exchange rate thereby making its products cheaper overseas and artificially boosting its exports exchange rate issues have long been tied to trade concerns and us trade policy in the early 1980s the focus was west german and japanese intervention in foreign exchange markets followed by us led concerted action to counter such intervention in the form of the plaza accord chinese currency practices drew attention in the early 1990s with treasury identifying china as a currency manipulator but china continued intervening in foreign exchange markets through the first decade of the 2000s to suppress the value of the yuan just as it significantly ramped up its export led growth today china still has no floating exchange rate relying instead on the sale and purchase of foreign exchange by the people s bank of china to keep the yuan within a certain band of value although treasury did not designate china as a currency manipulator in its semi annual currency report last fall that report made clear its unwavering focus on china going forward regardless of whether china meets the technical criteria to be labeled a manipulator indeed the trump administration has stated that currency remains a critical part of ongoing uschina trade negotiations and will be reflected in any outcome in light of growing unchecked beggar thy neighbor intervention in foreign exchange markets most prominently by china but also by japan and possibly other tpp parties trade promotion authority legislation in 2015 called for cooperative mechanisms enforceable rules reporting monitoring transparency or other means to ensure that trading partners avoid manipulating exchange rates in order to prevent effective balance of payments adjustment or to gain an unfair competitive advantage over other parties to the agreement the obama administration accordingly negotiated a side declaration to tpp aimed at combatting tradedistorting currency practices in particular government intervention in foreign exchange markets to devalue its currency to make its exports more competitive and imports less competitive whereas nafta did not address exchange rates and notwithstanding the fact that neither canada nor mexico have ever appeared on the monitoring list of treasury s semi annual currency report the usmca incorporates many of those tpp provisions into a currency focused chapter included in the main text of the www steptoe com 16 agreement it includes shared expressions of support for market determined exchange rates and a recognition of respective commitments under the articles of agreement of the international monetary fund imf not to seek unfair competitive advantage by manipulating exchange rates the agreement also requires parties to regularly publish macroeconomic data and monetary policy information including interventions in spot and forward foreign exchange markets which can help ensure meaningful oversight and compliance with those imf commitments the usmca also goes beyond tpp in certain respects it states that a party should promptly inform another party when carrying out a foreign exchange market intervention with respect to the currency of that other arty furthermore in addition to regular meetings of finance officials from all parties the agreement provides for expedited bilateral consultations between finance officials when requested by a party on any issue relating to exchange rate practices and transparency obligations including actions that the requesting party considers associated with competitive devaluation the transparency and reporting obligations are further subject to the standard dispute settlement processes under the agreement including possible trade sanctions but only where the failure to meet those obligations has been in a recurring or persistent manner finally it is worth noting that the usmca includes new language not in the tpp declaration clarifying the scope of this chapter providing that it does not apply with respect to the regulatory or supervisory activities or monetary and related credit policy and related conduct of an exchange rate or fiscal or monetary authority of a arty although this scope language was not included in tpp it does not appear to reflect a change in view about the applicability of these currency provisions at least with respect to the united states indeed the explicit exclusion of monetary policy is consistent with the view of the united states that the currencyrelated behavior that lies at the heart of trade concerns stems not from monetary policy which is focused on price stability and full employment in the domestic economy but from government interventions in foreign exchange markets that are designed to devalue that government s currency and affect export competitiveness c non market country provision the trump administration succeeded in securing an unprecedented provision in the usmca that allow the other parties to terminate the agreement and enter into their own bilateral agreement if another party into a free trade agreement with a non market country a non market country is defined as one that on the date of signature of a party has determined to be a non market economy for purposes of its trade remedy laws and with which no party has signed a free trade agreement china and vietnam are the two largest countries so designated by the united states but only china would be subject to this provision because canada and mexico have already signed the comprehensive and progressive trans pacific partnership cptpp with vietnam www steptoe com 17 because any party to the usmca can terminate the agreement on six month notice for any reason this right existed within nafta as well this provision does not provide the parties with any specific new authority still by building into the newlynegotiated usmca an explicit threat to terminate the agreement it serves as an unquestionable effort by the united states to discourage its trading partners from entering into a free trade agreement with china this possibility was most likely to arise in the context of canada which had held exploratory talks with china but after failing to announce the launch of fta negotiations in 2017 was focusing instead on sectoral discussions with china recent developments regarding huawei have put such talks on hold should talks resume however wto rules would allow canada and china to take only limited steps to enhance bilateral trade on a sectoral basis without a comprehensive agreement that would trigger this usmca provision the trump administration has already stated its intention to push for a similar nonmarket country provision in future trade negotiations beginning with japan the eu and the uk if negotiations on the regional comprehensive economic partnership rcep involving japan and china do not conclude in time japan may confront a similar choice in any event merely including this provision which as noted provides no new legal authority has already raised the pressure future administrations will be under when faced with the decision whether to withdraw from a trade agreement because of a trading partner s decision to enter into its own separate agreement with china www steptoe com 18 iv breaking from tradition a investor state dispute settlement isds in a marked departure from trade agreements negotiated under republican and democratic administrations for more than two decades and from over 35 years of investment treaty negotiations the usmca phases out investor state dispute resolution entirely for canada and greatly curtails this option in respect of mexico going forward it will only be available in most sectors for a subset of the investment protections provided by the agreement and even then only after the investor has first exhausted domestic remedies in mexico or the united states nafta s investor state dispute settlement isds mechanism was a first of its kind the first such mechanism to be included in a trade agreement as opposed to a bilateral investment agreement bit the first such mechanism covering mexico historically a staunch opponent of foreign investors seeking remedies in international arbitration in lieu of domestic courts and the first such mechanism agreed to between developed countries canada and the united states instead of the typical developed capital exporting and developing capital importing country agreement the full complement of nafta investment protections and access to isds to enforce those protections was generally available to a wide range of investors and their investments nearly all us trade agreements and bits since then including the modified isds provisions found in tpp have built on the nafta approach the usmca fundamentally upends this well established us approach to foreign economic policy by significantly narrowing the availability of isds for us investors with investments in canada and mexico with respect to canada the usmca terminates the isds mechanism altogether after a brief transition period however us or mexican investors who made investments covered by nafta will have three years from the date nafta is terminated to submit new claims against canada under the nafta isds procedures those arbitrations as well as those that have already been commenced under nafta will proceed to their final disposition no other isds claims may be filed against canada or the united states by investors from the other party leaving them at that point to rely exclusively on domestic judicial recourse mexican and canadian investors will continue to be able to seek remedies from the other party for investment violations but will now need to rely on the isds mechanism established by the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership cptpp www steptoe com 19 with respect to us mexico investment disputes the usmca retains the isds mechanism but greatly limits its applicability in three ways first as a general matter certain substantive investment protections will no longer be enforceable through isds claims of indirect expropriation and a breach of the minimum standard of treatment common grounds for isds claims submitted under nafta are no longer subject to isds obligations relating to performance requirements and transfers are similarly excluded claims may still be made on the basis of direct expropriation as well as national treatment and mfn commitments but even those non discrimination claims no longer cover pre establishment that is conditions governing the entry and establishment of foreign investment in the host country market therefore an investor is limited to claims alleging discrimination with regard to the expansion management conduct operation and sale or other disposition of investments second the usmca does retain the traditional broad scope for isds in disputes involving government contracts in certain sectors that are heavily regulated by the government of mexico oil and gas energy telecommunications transportation and infrastructure only with respect to government contracts in these five sectors can an investor seek isds recourse for infringement of any of the substantive investment protections provided for in the usmca the agreement introduces an additional unique qualification to this right namely requiring that the respondent country be party to another agreement that provides for isds as such if either the united states or mexico decides to withdraw from all other isds agreements isds would automatically no longer be available under the usmca in the specified sectors in respect of that party in that circumstance isds would appear to remain available for all other sectors in the limited manner described in the preceding paragraph finally the usmca introduces a requirement to exhaust domestic remedies precluding any isds claim until the investor has first challenged the particular governmental action in a domestic court or agency and either the investor has received a decision from a court of last resort or 30 months have passed these 30 months count against the four year time period within which an isds claim can be initiated and can significantly delay the resolution of an investor s claims introducing this requirement goes some way to responding to concerns about us measures being challenged by foreign investors in unaccountable tribunals which is ironic given that such arguments were at the core of the calvo doctrine pressed by mexico and other latin american countries for decades and that avoiding potentially arbitrary or discriminatory local processes was one of the principal motivations behind isds the trump administration s push to depart from longstanding us policy to significantly limit isds stands in stark contrast to its decision to leave largely untouched the nafta chapter 19 binational panel review process which is the only other mechanism for private parties to challenge the actions of a nafta government the usmca retains this mechanism for any party to challenge another s imposition of antidumping and countervailing ad cvd duties before a binational panel to replace judicial review in the importing party retaining this mechanism was a major objective of canada whereas the united www steptoe com 20 states initially pushed to remove it from any renegotiated agreement as such agreeing to keep ad cvd review in usmca constitutes a particularly significant us concession reportedly the administration agreed to maintain this mechanism in exchange for canada agreeing to provide increased market access for us dairy poultry and egg exports which was a key administration objective vis vis canada b government procurement the usmca also departs significantly from the longstanding us negotiating approach to government procurement in previous trade agreements again by excluding canada entirely since the tokyo round the united states has consistently supported negotiations on government procurement disciplines and market access at the multilateral level in the gatt wto and in most of its ftas including nafta upon signing the tpp the united states canada and mexico agreed separately for the tpp government procurement chapter including its market access commitments to replace the government procurement provisions of nafta effective on the date of tpp s entry into force in all three countries now however the usmca does not incorporate the tpp outcome into nafta instead it excludes canada from the government procurement chapter entirely canada s relationship with the united states will be governed by the wto agreement on government procurement gpa and canada s relationship with mexico will be governed by the comprehensive and progressive agreement on trans pacific partnership cptpp the exclusion of canada from the usmca has more limited impact in practice because of the level of market access that canada provides under the revised gpa that said relying on the revised gpa rather than the tpp as planned to be imported into nafta could still result in meaningful changes to us firms access to canadian procurement with regard to coverage of services and covered entities canada s thresholds the values at which procurement is opened to foreign suppliers are identical under the tpp and the revised gpa in respect of all covered entities 130 000 special drawing rights sdrs the unit of account for the imf based on a weighted average of a basket of global currencies for central government entities 355 000 sdrs for sub central and other entities i e government enterprises and 5 million sdrs for construction services for any covered entity however canada s list of covered entities is broader under tpp which includes 95 central government entities and 22 government enterprises instead of 78 and 10 respectively under the revised gpa furthermore tpp covers far more service sectors than the revised gpa including telecommunications technical testing and business network services for central government entities with respect to the united states and mexico to which the usmca government procurement chapter still applies the scope of access to each country s procurement market is largely the same as it was under tpp and even nafta the united states and mexico each identify the same covered federal entities and government www steptoe com 21 enterprises as they did in tpp the thresholds are the same as they were in tpp and nafta though updated to reflect the latest biannual adjustments for 2018 and 2019 given the prospect for a federal infrastructure initiative and the trump administration s interest in strengthening domestic preference requirements one notable aspect of the usmca procurement outcome is how those requirements might be affected by non discrimination commitments under the usmca for mexico and the revised gpa for canada pursuant to the trade agreements act of 1979 ustr would ensure compliance with those commitments by waiving application of buy american preferences which cover direct procurement by federal agencies however by excluding non contractual agreements or any form of government assistance from those commitments the united states maintains the right to keep buy america and other indirect procurement preferences these cover domestic content requirements tied to federal assistance provided to sub federal governments to carry out infrastructure projects because many infrastructure projects that have been the focus of recent proposals would be achieved through procurements made by recipients of federal assistance neither the usmca nor the revised gpa commitments are likely to impede those domestic preferences c sunset clause in the early stages of the usmca negotiations the trump administration insisted that the agreement include a five year sunset clause which meant the usmca would expire after five years unless each country agreed to renew it following significant resistance from canada and mexico the final text now includes a sunset clause that would terminate the agreement after 16 years unless each party affirmatively decides to continue the agreement specifically the usmca sunset clause provides that six years after the agreement enters into force the parties will reconvene to review the operation of the agreement and confirm their desire to extend the agreement for another 16 year period in that case the parties will conduct another review at the end of six years however if any party does not so confirm at that time the parties will continue to review the agreement annually until they either reach agreement on extending the usmca for another 16 years or the original 16 year term ends and the usmca terminates in the absence of such an extension to be sure this is the first time a us trade agreement will include a sunset clause but as a legal matter it provides no additional authority given that any party could always withdraw from the agreement at any time furthermore other agreements have included the helpful notion of regular reviews or built in agendas for future negotiations indeed tpp explicitly called for the parties to review the agreement within three years and every five years thereafter in so doing however it made clear that such review was to be undertaken with a view to updating and enhancing agreement through negotiations as appropriate as in other www steptoe com 22 agreements that contemplated future negotiations the tpp review provision was premised on an assumption that the agreement would endure and therefore conveyed an implicit commitment to the viability of this partnership the usmca review provision evinces at best an ambivalence towards the continuation of the agreement emphasizing explicitly the prospect of termination and thereby giving rise to the very uncertainty that trade agreements have traditionally tried to counteract in addition to this shift in tone the usmca does effectively provide what the trump administration was seeking namely a short time period in which each party would have to make a determination as to whether to keep the agreement in place by putting a spotlight on the decision of each party after six years the administration has virtually ensured the sort of renewed high profile politicized debate that prompted canada and mexico to push back on its original proposal including such a decision as part of the regular review of the agreement also raises the question of whether a president can unilaterally withdraw the united states from a trade agreement which has emerged again recently as president trump has threatened to withdraw from nafta in an attempt to force a congressional vote on the usmca as is to what extent the implementing legislation speaks to this authority and whether congress will take steps in that legislation or otherwise to ensure itself a voice in such a decision remains to be seen www steptoe com 23 v enforcement the usmca largely tracks nafta s state to state dispute settlement procedures that effectively allow one nafta party in a dispute to block the formation of a panel to hear the challenge this flaw flows from two aspects of the process set out for the disputing parties to propose individuals to serve on the panel first the usmca like nafta may allow a defending party in a dispute to prevent the appointment of a panel chair this is because under both agreements where disputing parties cannot agree on a panel chair the party chosen by lot is to select the chair if that party is the defending party and declines to make such a selection the process is stalled and no panel is formed to hear the dispute second the usmca like nafta may allow a defending party in a dispute to prevent the appointment of other panelists this is because under both agreements consensus of the parties is required to establish a roster of qualified individuals to serve as panelists and panelists must normally be selected from roster if for whatever reason the parties fail to establish a roster by consensus a complaining party may still propose individuals to serve on the panel that are not on the roster in that case however the usmca generally allows the defending party unlimited peremptory challenges to reject those proposed panelists thus if any usmca party blocks the consensus needed to establish a roster a defending party could prevent a dispute from going forward by refusing to accept any off roster candidates proposed by the complaining party the usmca does improve upon nafta by allowing a roster to remain in effect until the parties constitute a new roster rather than requiring the parties to reappoint the roster by consensus every three years this means that so long as the parties meet their obligation to establish a roster at the outset under the usmca a complaining party will generally be able to propose individuals on the roster as panelists and the defending party will not be able to object in contrast the three year duration under nafta meant that the opportunity to prevent the creation of the roster arose three years after approval of the original roster the mexico us nafta sugar dispute in the late 1990s in which the united states prevented the formation of a dispute settlement panel by failing to appoint a chair or other panelists in the absence of an agreed upon roster made these flaws inherent in the nafta dispute settlement process well known to trade officials in all three countries yet rather than correct these flaws and incorporate a number of other procedural improvements included in more recent ftas the trump administration pushed to preserve the ability to block panels this new us posture reflects the administration s view as seen across a number of its trade policy initiatives that www steptoe com 24 us interests are better served by exercising leverage including the threat of trade actions under section 301 to compel compliance rather than relying on more legalistic or rules based dispute settlement processes this new posture may also not be surprising given ambassador lighthizer s negative perception of wto dispute settlement and his expressed fondness for the prewto system under the gatt where consensus among gatt parties including acquiescence of the losing party in a dispute was required to adopt a panel report it is difficult however to square this result with the negotiating objective set out in 2015 trade promotion authority legislation to seek provisions in trade agreements providing for resolution of disputes in an effective timely transparent equitable and reasoned manner furthermore dispute settlement under ftas has rarely been invoked by the united states but stakeholders and congress have long believed that the enforceability of fta provisions has been helpful to ensure compliance even without recourse to litigation this belief would apply even more forcefully with respect to those disciplines that go well beyond existing trade agreements and could not be enforced for example in the wto such as those on digital trade biologics labor and the environment finally even assuming the existence of sufficient leverage to regularly compel favorable outcomes it is not clear that businesses and other stakeholders would see such an overtly political and antagonistic process as supporting their longterm goals in foreign markets other than in exceptional cases www steptoe com 25 vi implementation although negotiations on the usmca have concluded and president trump canadian prime minister justin trudeau and former mexican president enrique pena nieto signed the agreement on november 30 2018 the agreement must still go through ratification and implementation processes in all three countries before it can enter into force a united states in the united states congress must pass implementing legislation pursuant to 2015 trade promotion authority legislation before that however the administration will first need to resolve concerns and objections raised by members of congress from both parties making any vote on the usmca challenging before the congressional summer recess and given the dynamics of presidential primaries especially following the rhetoric on trade in the 2016 election congress is unlikely to consider the usmca at any point beyond the fall section 232 democratic and republican lawmakers supported by stakeholders including the united steelworkers are pressing the administration to remove the section 232 steel and aluminum tariffs imposed on canada and mexico before congress considers implementing legislation canada and mexico have also made clear that neither government is likely to move forward with usmca ratification until the administration ends the section 232 duties discussions among the governments before the signing of the usmca as well as discussions held more recently have failed to reach any resolution with respect to those tariffs the possibility of new section 232 tariffs on automotive imports opposed by many in congress on a bipartisan basis further complicates timing for congressional consideration of the usmca democrats substantive concerns even more challenging for prompt implementation of the usmca in congress may be the concerns raised by democrats after taking over control of the house of representatives a number of democrats have emphasized the need to reopen the negotiations in certain areas such as pharmaceutical intellectual property or labor to address their concerns with the outcomes on those subjects the administration as well as the canadian and mexican governments oppose reopening the agreement but with democrats seeking a way to put their imprimatur on the usmca and given speaker pelosi s track record of exercising democratic leverage in the house to force a white house to renegotiate trade agreements this remains a distinct possibility democrats enforcement concerns separate from concerns about certain substantive disciplines in the agreement are democrats concerns about the enforceability of the agreement from the outset of these negotiations ambassador lighthizer has sought www steptoe com 26 to ensure bipartisan support for the final text in part by aggressively pursuing farreaching outcomes in areas traditionally highlighted by democrats including labor and the environment while some democrats have acknowledged progress in these areas the fact that these new disciplines might not be effectively enforceable see section vi on enforcement risks undercutting the value of what ambassador lighthizer achieved although ambassador lighthizer has expressed a preference for relying on implementing legislation and or section 301 of the trade act of 1974 as enforcement mechanisms for the usmca questions remain about how the administration could address these enforcement concerns without reopening the text threat of nafta withdrawal in december president trump announced that he intended to withdraw from nafta as a means of forcing congress in particular democrats to choose between voting for the usmca or no north american trade agreement at all the administration has since backed off this threat more recently seeking to pursue constructive engagement with house democrats to find a path forward given the need for extensive negotiations between congress and the administration and the probable need for resolution of the section 232 tariffs among other things a number of members of congress have already indicated that passing usmca implementing legislation will likely extend well into the summer if not longer b canada and mexico mexico presents the most straightforward scenario for implementation where the agreement must be ratified by a majority vote of the senate with no opportunity for amendment before it becomes directly applicable although mexico s senate majority leader has voiced certain concerns the support of president andrs manuel lpez obrador is likely to ensure ratification as his party commands a majority in the senate and opposition parties also support the usmca one factor complicating this scenario is the fact that mexico must adopt certain labor reforms to fulfill its usmca commitments which the government expects congress to do before it adjourns at the end of april 2019 us stakeholders have already begun to express doubts about the bills currently under consideration by the mexican congress even if the mexican congress passes the necessary reforms in april it will not be able to consider the agreement for ratification until it reconvenes in september canada s government has already begun the ratification process by tabling the agreement before the house of commons in december now that the house of commons has considered and debated the treaty for the prescribed time period under canadian law the cabinet must formally ratify the agreement the government then will submit implementing legislation to parliament to be passed by both chambers before receiving royal assent and becoming law however if parliament does not approve the usmca implementing legislation by the end of june when the house and senate adjourn for summer recess the bill will have to await consideration by the new parliament after federal elections in october waiting for the us congress to act on the usmca first

kyung pil kim is a lecturer in the department of sociology at korea university in april 2014 more than three hundred passengers were killed when the ferry they were on sank in south korea s west sea grieving families began a hunger strike in response demanding the creation of a law allowing a special investigation of the disaster claiming that the government was not revealing the truth a news report in july 2014 which shocked koreans showed members of multiple organizations as well as those in an online community mocking those participating in the hunger strike and even eating chickens and pizza in front of them nearly four years later in april 2018 an investigative journalism television program exposed the federation of korean industries fki an association of korean conglomerates for funding those who were eating in front of the hunger strikers the program also made it widely known that the fki has been funding right wing organizations on a large scale since 1997 in the republic of korea conglomerates are called chaebols 1 a chaebol is a diversified and large scale conglomerate form of capital governed dynastically by an owner and the owner s family chaebols have grown quickly in korea dominating the korean market and substantially contributing to the korean economy since their structuring in the 1970s some chaebol affiliates grew into leading corporations in the global market within a mere thirty to forty years on the 2018 fortune global 500 list which ranks the world s largest companies samsung electronics and hyundai motors ranked twelfth and seventy eighth respectively and thirteen other affiliates were also on the list hence some chaebols have grown into global economic powers however the fast growth of the chaebols in korea has also been associated with some crises as with any capital accumulation the chaebols economic expansion has been characterized by inherent problems in trying to manage such problems and associated crises chaebols have changed the ways in which they accumulate capital with the overarching goals of successfully competing among capitalist firms and continuing to make profits in this sense the chaebols growth can also be considered a history of crisis and crisis management interestingly this has meant much more than changing or reshaping the way the chaebols procure the elements required for business including capital raw materials physical structures and equipment labor power and distribution and marketing mechanisms more fundamental issues of hegemony over civil society have arisen the crisis of the chaebols in the 1980s and 90s encompassed a crisis of authority as suggested by antonio gramsci as well as an economic crisis the chaebols discovered that they had lost consensus the great masses have become detached from their traditional ideologies 2 the chaebols therefore had to implement a hegemonic strategy in civil society to reestablish their authority and legitimacy while managing their economic crisis at the same time their strategy has been to construct a consensual basis for their dominance amongst the mass population utilizing the leverage offered by their economic power while also instilling the belief that the interests of the chaebols are everyone s interests when did chaebols start employing this strategy in response to the crisis what has it entailed and how has it changed over time i intend to provide answers to these questions by focusing on the fki the only capitalist association in korea that represents both the chaebols and civilian organizations since its foundation in 1961 the fki has had considerable influence on korean society on behalf of the chaebols capitalist crisis management and hegemonic strategy in civil society a capitalist for whom profit is the most important goal has to have the elements required for capital accumulation located within specific spatiotemporal conditions while commercial and financial capital accumulate outside the production process industrial capital the representative form of capital generates profit through production distribution and sales leading to the accumulation of capital however any problem in this procurement or the value flow may threaten profit making moreover a problem in the production and circulation of capital in a particular conjuncture may develop into a full scale accumulation crisis a crisis in accumulation at the level of the corporation means that the existing capital accumulation system has exposed a problem but there is no immediate way to solve it the crisis consists precisely in the fact that the old is dying and the new cannot be born 3 this is likely to accompany a crisis of authority which gramsci defined as the great masses becom detached from their traditional ideologies as the ruling class has lost its consensus and is exercising coercive force alone 4 this also applies to the analysis of a company a crisis of authority for a corporation can be specified as a situation in which the company has lost its consensus and is reduced to economic power only losing its ideological hold on the masses the chaebols are more likely to face crises of authority than other corporate entities due to their unique characteristics first the chaebols are directly managed by owners in typical corporate governance ownership and management are separate however this is not the case for chaebols moreover chaebols mobilize their resources in the direct interests of their executives and control them through bodies such as the secretariat second until the 1980s chaebols relied on authoritarian regimes and foreign capital to obtain elements of capital accumulation and carry out production and distribution third chaebols as conglomerates are diversified corporate entities drawing on government resources and taking over the domestic market as a result they control the korean economy with tens of major affiliates since the chaebols have relied on the government for their growth mobilizing resources for owners interests and control and monopolizing the domestic market through diversification it is relatively easy for people to identify the problems caused by the chaebols and to raise questions about their legitimacy civil society is a critical terrain in which corporations seek to implement their hegemonic strategy while civil society is a contentious concept without a single definition i will define it as a realm of autonomous association that exists in hegelian terms somewhere between the state and individuals families 5 civil society is considered to be largely composed of interest groups as well as activist and nongovernmental programs and organizations i analyze civil society separately for three groups 1 activist and nongovernmental organizations ngos and public interest groups 2 the media and publishing sector including newspapers and broadcasting companies and 3 the academic and educational community ultimately the chaebols hegemonic strategies are aimed at constructing consensus in civil society that corporate interest is a universal benefit however this hegemonic strategy necessarily evolves along with the development of capital accumulation and crisis management emergence of the chaebols hegemonic strategy in the 1950s large korean corporations made money as the government privatized raw materials and facilities through ties with ruling elites the corporations monopolized the raw materials required for flour sugar and cotton industries and made profits by processing them they owned financial institutions with governmental license however in 1961 the situation changed with the advent of the military the regime set development and economic growth as its goals and ordered corporations to invest their capabilities in the industrial sector rather than the financial and commercial sectors but corporations found the costs of procuring resources needed for industrial production including obtaining needed global inputs constructing large factories and building effective distribution networks too prohibitive therefore in addition to building networks with japanese and other foreign capitalist interests the military regime was the means of procurement of these resources sometimes based on corporations performance and plans and sometimes based on their direct relationship with the regime this compelled corporations to keep up with the regime s development polices and maintain good relations with it in the 1960s and 1970s the large corporations grew quickly not only was there a global economic boom but the united states provided economic support and made its market available to korea in an effort to win the cold war in addition korean companies with their lower wage costs were sometimes handed over industries from japanese companies when those industries were no longer considered profitable or had negative effects that is one of japanese companies profit making strategies was to provide korean companies with technologies and capital goods necessary for the production export and sale of products to the united states and other western markets 6 in the development process large corporations gradually began to take on the current form of chaebols resembling in some ways the japanese keiretsu in the 1960s starting with samsung corporations began building a new form of organization with a large bureaucracy and a secretariat at the top moreover they entered the industries that the regime targeted emerging as conglomerates with diversified holdings in both related and unrelated areas thereby dominating the entire domestic market consequently the number of affiliates of the top thirty korean corporations reached 126 in 1970 and soared to 429 in 1979 by the end of the 1970s corporations were clearly very similar to the chaebols of today in 1979 following a recession resulting from the oil crisis a global downturn of capitalism and excessive investment in the heavy chemical industry the chaebols managed to recover in only a few years due to fast improving conditions such as a moderation of oil prices and more favorable exchange rates in particular the plaza accord by the group of 5 countries france germany the united states the united kingdom and japan to depreciate the u s dollar against the japanese yen and german deutsche mark by manipulating exchange rates was implemented in 1985 under these circumstances the korean chaebols were able to increase their international price competitiveness up through the 1980s however with progress in democratization through social movements in 1987 the situation began to change significantly with the institution of the direct presidential election system as a result of the democracy movement of 1987 the military regime could no longer control society through the previous authoritarian approaches as soon as the regime s control weakened chaebols faced unprecedented resistance from workers previously chaebols were able to manage labor forces through alliances with the government however when the alliances between the chaebols and the government deteriorated labor strikes took place workers could no longer tolerate the chaebols military style control high intensity labor low wages and poor working conditions since the chaebols controlled labor through direct and extremely harsh repression workers had to employ equally militant strategies they demanded the right to assembly democratic labor unions wage increases and general labor rights there were over three thousand labor struggles between july and september 1987 and production in most large businesses came to a standstill from the chaebols perspective this labor insurgence threatened their profitability by undermining their price competitiveness which was their absolute advantage in international trade they immediately struck back the incumbent fki chairman stated that members would move their business to thailand because they could not do business in such an environment however with a presidential election approaching the government and ruling party decided not to intervene directly in the conflict between labor and capital as companies needed labor which was being withheld from them by the strike movement they had no alternative but to accede to some of the workers demands as a result new unions were created in affiliates of the chaebols and there was an improvement in the degree of workplace control at the same time the seniority wage system was established and wages were raised in fact the average real wage in manufacturing increased by 12 5 percent between 1987 and 1991 more than twice the 5 4 percent average increase between 1982 and 1986 which negatively affected the companies operating profit 7 in response to these changes the chaebols went into crisis management and began to shift their accumulation strategy facing labor resistance and heightened competition due to changes in global and east asian orders the chaebols attempted to make profits through new approaches they made intensive investments at the global level they also employed flexible strategies that crossed boundaries between industrial commercial and financial sectors toward labor the chaebols struck back in full force instead of negotiating with workers the chaebols tried to decide wages in ways that ensured only their own interests a system of meritocracy was added to the existing seniority wage system the chaebols sought to control labor by introducing a japanese style production method mechanization and automation and pursued numerical control and flexible employment starting in 1988 the new administration also helped chaebols by intervening in their labor relationships promoting goals of public safety and law and order people s perceptions of the chaebols were very negative even before the advent of the democracy movement according to the 1983 fki survey of five thousand respondents nationwide 75 0 percent of all respondents thought that korean companies growth was due to government support rather than their own capacities and only 12 3 percent of all respondents disagreed with the statement that korean companies made profit through fraudulent means with democratization such discontent could potentially be incorporated into the constitution and political parties at the time people considered the chaebols and military dictatorship as a package and voiced the view that both economic and political democratization were needed political parties translated such aspirations of the people into institutional form by adding the so called economic democratization clause on income inequality and economic control to the 1987 constitution the new administration with the president elected in 1988 also instituted policies related to transparency in the corporate governance and control over the economic concentration of chaebols while advancing liberalization in order to break through the drastically reduced legitimacy of capital accumulation in civil society the chaebols had to implement a hegemonic strategy to manage their crisis of authority in 1981 the fki acquired a financial newspaper company to disseminate their voice the fki also held a number of events with academic and media leaders and published a variety of public relations materials for companies however it was in 1987 that the fki set up programs and dedicated organizations to their new hegemonic strategy the fki began to allocate a large budget toward creating friendly public opinion and supported various volunteer cultural and art activities to appeal to people the founding of the korea institute for socio economic affairs kisea in 1988 signaled that the chaebols were serious about their hegemonic cultural strategy created with the chaebols public relations budget kisea was founded to address the perceived problem from the perspective of the chaebols that people had developed the wrong ideas resulting in criticisms of the chaebols as korean society leaned left and union power grew according to the fki not only politicians intellectuals and mainstream news but also television dramas novels and comics misled people about corporations as a result it was argued that in addressing the chaebols people talked only about money in politics inequality and lack of social responsibility consequently the chaebols sought to provide so called accurate information about the beneficial roles of corporations for the korean economy while striving at the same time to create an unregulated business environment 8 as previously indicated the chaebols hegemonic strategy was largely carried out in three areas of civil society the first area included ngos activist and civic organizations and interest groups in fact ngos and civic organizations were underdeveloped in korea because of the power concentration of the central government over several centuries followed by a military dictatorship therefore the chaebols strategy in this area was simply to promote organizations that fit their preference the leading organization supported by the fki was the korea freedom federation famous for its anticommunism they received 4 5 million and 2 8 million in 1989 and 1990 respectively from the fki 9 the second area was the media and publishing sector the fki actively engaged with opinion leaders in media and academia to broaden their support base the fki often held meetings with television producers playwrights novelists and cartoonists because of their profound impact on people these efforts were intended to prevent negative portrayals of the chaebols in television programs and literary works they sponsored television programs devoted to legitimizing their role they arranged opportunities for journalists government employees academics and prominent labor figures to study and be trained abroad 10 the fki was also active in directly disseminating their ideas attributing people s negative sentiments toward the chaebols to inaccurate understandings of the chaebols and economy the fki published public relations materials including over twenty thousand copies of a book that compiled media reports skewed toward the chaebols at the time the chaebols emphasized their legitimacy using the idea of a free market economy a term used in south korea in contrast to north korea s planned economy the phrase was not exactly applicable considering that the chaebols were not the product of a free market economy and they consistently opposed the government s liberalization policy that is the liberalization of exchange and interest rates the opening of the capital market and elimination of government subsidies to get around these obvious contradictions they sought to frame the cold war with north korea as the source of their legitimacy the fki even held the free market economy forum until 1991 in addition they created the free economy publishing culture award in 1989 claiming that the publishing market was filled with books that criticized the korean economy the award was part of their project to select books that advocated for a free market economy and distribute them to libraries and colleges throughout korea the third area was the academic and secondary and higher education community the fki interacted with prominent figures in the academic community on an ongoing basis to build a network with those who were friendly toward the chaebols they also published materials against socialist and antiestablishment theories including dependency theory based on their assessment that these ideas were gaining significant popularity among college students at the time in addition they released a report arguing against criticisms of concentrated economic power and conglomerates in the korean economy the fki even provided 2 5 million in support for a government led study abroad program for college students 11 in relation to secondary education the fki developed economic educational materials in 1986 and has since disseminated them to schools as an educational aid the fki provided social studies middle and high school teachers around korea with training in the neoliberal free market economy while disseminating comic books with content on the free market economy for students 12 in the crisis management process the chaebols extensively implemented the strategy of shifting public perception with the goal of creating a general consensus that their interests are everyone s interests specifically the fki created kisea as an organization dedicated to the task of implementing its strategy of cultural hegemony in the various areas of civil society once their hegemonic strategy was implemented systematically it remained an ongoing effort after the crisis with the support of budget lines and organizational structures however the chaebols soon faced another large crisis in 1997 the asian financial crisis in korea often called the international monetary fund imf crisis broke out 1997 asian financial crisis and development of the hegemonic strategy the chaebols and the korean economy faced a crisis in 1997 the globalization of finance led by the united states since the 1980s brought instability to the world economy the reverse plaza accord of 1995 marked a watershed in korean history as the united states allowed devaluation of the yen at japan s request the chaebols rapidly lost market competitiveness in the export market additionally the chaebols aggressive moves toward overseas production and investment utilizing large scale short term loans from the international financial market failed to generate expected profits because the chaebols did not have a unique advantage in the global market beyond their investment capabilities 13 as semiconductor prices plummeted globally beginning in 1996 several chaebols and the korean economy were hit hard despite signs of a coming recession the chaebols and the korean government failed to take appropriate measures and some chaebols including daewoo then the second largest chaebol in south korea after the hyundai group went bankrupt when the financial crisis erupted in southeast asia in 1997 korea also faced a crisis and the korean government had to turn to the imf for a bailout as desired by the united states the korean government pledged to implement the program of the imf and received bailouts the program incorporated the interests of the imf the u s treasury department wall street and the korean government s economic officials 14 the part of the program directly related to the chaebols was created by the economic officials in the korean state they generally shared the imf s claim that the severity of the korean crisis was the result of the chaebols governance structure and inefficiency which required correction thus they ordered the reorganization of the chaebols governance structures to make them similar to u s corporations that is separation between ownership and management as well as increased shareholder rights they also instructed the chaebols to reduce debt ratios while allowing layoff and dispatch work systems that chaebols had long wanted the chaebols argued that the imf program had driven them into crisis and resisted the restructuring however most chaebols decided to comply partially with the orders for the time being because since power was concentrated in the government they would likely go bankrupt if they did not conform they quickly reorganized their accumulation strategy by increasing transparency in management reducing debts and unrelated diversification while prioritizing cash flow and short term returns the chaebols had formerly employed a management strategy of large debt and large investment for a strong push for growth based on owners top down leadership style however such a strategy was no longer successful chaebols like daewoo which insisted on continuing previous practices even after the crisis broke out ended in bankruptcy nevertheless the chaebols did not completely conform to the imf program over time they resisted the government s direction and eventually defeated the plan to reorganize their governance structure meanwhile they began a total offensive against labor they were finally able to slow down the wage increase rate strengthen meritocracy in the wage system which they had pushed for since 1987 and achieve greater numerical control and flexibilities in employment like the previous crisis the 1997 crisis included a crisis of authority as well as an economic crisis while the chaebols had systematically implemented a hegemonic strategy since 1987 to gain legitimacy the 1997 crisis damaged this legitimacy significantly many people at home and abroad listed the chaebols as the primary culprit of the crisis and an unprecedented amount of criticism directed at the chaebols was published between 1998 and 2002 it was the broadly shared negative public opinion that allowed the blue house the ruling party and economic officials to implement a program designed virtually to break up the chaebols faced with a crisis of legitimacy the chaebols quickly proposed an increase in exports and launched the 50 billion surplus campaign the intention was to increase their legitimacy by highlighting export as the solution to the crisis and reminding people of the importance of the chaebols they thus tried to disseminate a new discourse to dodge the issues of chaebol reform that were unfavorable to them including their responsibility for the crisis and issues of corporate governance and transparency in the face of the crisis of authority the chaebols had to implement a more extensive and intensive strategy of cultural hegemony than before in 1999 the fki created the social contribution committee for networking among conglomerates and developed and implemented specialized programs aimed at altering the public relations position of the chaebols under the fki s leadership the chaebols were quick to create departments and programs ostensibly dedicated to philanthropic social contributions and started to invest various resources in the effort in fact according to a survey by the fki the average expenditure of social contribution activities of 202 korean companies surged from 1 89 million in 1998 to 4 48 million in 2002 the case of samsung shows how much attention the chaebols paid to social contribution at the time in 2000 samsung increased its social responsibility contributions donations and support for volunteer activities from 41 6 million in 1998 to 138 1 million in 2000 15 in just two years their budget increased more than three fold the fki also announced the corporate ethics charter in 1999 to avoid growing criticisms of corrupt businessmen and demands for transparency the chaebols declared they would solve the problems of money in politics and corruption through transparent and ethical management following the late 1990s economic crisis chaebols had to cope with a strong ngo movement against them as distinguished from the past when there was no need for chaebols to pay much attention to organizations in civil society due to their underdevelopment the influence of ngos was growing quickly with democratization unlike in europe where political parties reflected institutionalized social cleavages and conflict korean political parties were incapable of representing the concerns of the people laying the structural basis for the rise of the ngos the people s solidarity for participatory democracy pspd was the leading organization that demanded improvement of the chaebols governance and transparency in management primarily consisting of academic experts the pspd contended that increased shareholder rights and corporate management for shareholder value was the best alternative accordingly they launched the minority shareholders movement in 1998 which targeted the lack of transparency in corporate governance regarded as one of the big reasons behind the 1997 financial crisis demanding reform and relying heavily on legal channels as its tools 16 the pspd movement was viewed by the chaebols as a significant threat because it raised questions about governance structure the chaebols biggest concern and drew support from many people complementing the pspd s legal strategy hence the chaebols issued a counteroffensive through organizations operating under the fki criticizing the minority shareholder movement as having a socialist orientation that opposed private ownership and market order the fki s organizations held a weekly rally in protest in front of the pspd office the chaebols also created organizations that spoke for their interests in civil society according to a report of the munwha broadcasting corporation network a public network in korea the fki had been building ultraright organizations since 2001 these groups organized rallies filed complaints and accusations and obstructed and caused serious trouble at events 17 citizens united for better society is representative of the organizations founded with fki involvement and regularly funded by the fki since its foundation in 2002 citizens united for better society has dismissed as socialist and populist the policies of the administrations that implemented chaebol reforms and has continuously developed arguments in support of chaebols social contribution activities activism and building ngos constituted the chaebols new hegemonic strategy developed while managing the 1997 crisis in other areas of civil society such as media publishing and education the chaebols strategy assumed more advanced forms in 1997 the chaebols created the korea center for free enterprise kcfe which advocated for small government capitalism and corporations to conduct public relations research and educational activities the organization highlighted the economic freedom index along with various liberal research organizations around the world and conducted seminars symposia and educational projects to disseminate their ideas arguing that an anticorporate sentiment is prevalent in korea the fki implemented ongoing cooperation projects with prominent media figures in an effort to soften such a sentiment the fki also actively carried out the love for corporation love for country campaign with the maeil business newspaper the largest financial newspaper in korea in another initiative the fki built the new comprehensive information system focused on digitalization for online public relations activities the fki provided online public relations content directed at and for use by opinion leaders and those occupying prominent positions in the national assembly government and companies in 1998 the fki also founded fki media a publishing company to facilitate dissemination of periodicals and publications featuring economic and management content from 1997 to 2000 the kcfe issued a series of works including forty five books that introduced the works of liberal theorists they also held a book essay contest among college students in the same period the fki published a series on the importance of export led development and chaebols as the means of ending the crisis 18 the chaebols made continuous efforts to build networks with the academic community to disseminate their ideas in universities claiming again that left wing and antimarket ideas were spreading in higher education the chaebols jumped to build networks of college students who agreed with them the fki began to support college student organizations and representative councils in the name of spreading the ideology of a free market economy in 2002 and 2003 the fki sponsored the development of two national college student networks the young leader s club and elite intensive course after 1997 it expanded its efforts to influence economic studies in partnership with many agencies it provided education programs on neoclassical and neoliberal economics for opinion leaders including teachers journalists government officials and soldiers as well as students educating eighteen thousand people in forty three new programs since 2003 the fki also introduced the u s council on economic education to korea in 2003 while continuing economics classes for students teachers and parents in and out of middle and high schools it continuously sought to design and implement regular college courses for credit that would represent their interests 19 what lies ahead the chaebols hegemonic strategy which as we have seen was significantly enhanced after 1997 has now been upgraded still further many right wing groups are now organizing large movements and propaganda activities with support from the chaebols those networking with the chaebols have contended for influence both online and offline in the areas of media publishing and education the chaebols power now reaches virtually every corner of korean civil society however no matter how sophisticated and elaborate the chaebols hegemonic strategy is not all koreans think that the chaebols interests reflect their own instead a significant number of people practice everyday forms of resistance rejecting the legitimacy claims of the chaebols there are also many people who raise questions about the chaebols and vote for the politicians and parties that pledge to reform or break them up the struggle between social forces and the chaebols is still very much ongoing in korean political and civil society the case of the chaebols presents several theoretical issues when we discuss cultural hegemony we often consider it a macrosocietal concept and assume the government or a ruling class bloc as its subject however hegemony can also be seen as a strategy of a type of capital or a specific capitalist group in addition the content of the strategy may vary extensively depending on how civil society is defined in a given setting accordingly discussion on the crisis of capital and crisis management also needs to be expanded to various forms of monopolistic capital due to the influential crisis theory state theory literature of the 1970s when we discuss a crisis of society or the state we tend to think of accumulation and legitimacy crises together but we generally refrain from doing this when we discuss capital itself however we need to give more consideration to the complex nature of the crisis of capital s hegemony the case of the chaebols in the 1980s and 90s may not be directly applicable to other societies as it was a product of a distinctive spatiotemporal conjuncture however as the case of korea shows it is important to learn what happens when a government is unable to impose discipline on capital in an ostensibly democratic society and how concentrated corporations themselves seek to achieve hegemony in civil society as a means of maintaining their power vis à vis the state and society as a whole notes
27 march 2019 growth is back in the cards after a seemingly sluggish 2018 however much depends on the outcome of ongoing trade conflicts deleveraging efforts and the central bank s ability to inject some flexibility into the renminbi exchange rate regime without causing instability the consensus is that in 2019 china s economy despite sizeable challenges such as trade tensions and the unfinished deleveraging campaign will see its gdp grow at a respectable rate of around 6 2 percent there are two main reasons for this first barring a severe correction in the housing markets of major cities growth in domestic consumption will probably be close to the double digits second even if there is a shortfall in exports due to trade tensions this can easily be made up through a measured dose of fiscal stimulus thus allowing domestic investment to make up for the shortfall in the external sector the government has stepped up its efforts on the fiscal front already and in 2019 china will probably have a moderate current account deficit but the side effects of underwriting an unrealistic economic growth target and the risky appeal of fiscal stimulus which also comes from external parties must not be underestimated a slow but steady 2018 china s economic deceleration which started in q2 2018 became more apparent in q4 there are several reasons for this first the deleveraging campaign has greatly reduced access to bank lending with much reduced access to credit private enterprises have had to resort to other funding avenues such as stock mortgage loans but even here because investor sentiment is low private investors have been slow to come forward one cause of this could be that recent government discussions on mixed ownership have only reinforced the idea that state owned enterprises soes must stay big and strong thereby fanning fears of quasi nationalization 1 however the government has since made it clear that the key policy focus this year will be reassuring private enterprises and bolstering their confidence 2 second the housing market has seen significantly reduced transactions on the back of a slew of restrictive policies during the year third the automotive sector a bellwether industry in china has encountered some serious difficulties in 2018 as auto sales saw their first ever decline the end of year slowdown in the housing and auto sectors figure 1 may well prompt policymakers to introduce a fiscal stimulus package simply to kickstart economic growth where the housing market is concerned an easing of restrictive policies is clearly in the cards despite official reiteration of the homes are for shelter not for speculation line 3 this is because stagnation in the market is a far greater worry than worsening affordability for policymakers but when it comes to the auto industry whether the government will unveil more tax rebates there too really depends on the outcome of the next round of us china trade talks so far washington has continued to defer its plan to raise the tariff on 200 billion of chinese imports to march 2 while china is going ahead with its rollback of tariffs on us cars and auto parts 4 in addition china has stepped up the purchase of us soybeans and other agricultural products 5given these encouraging signs it is conceivable that a truce may be on the cards in q1 2019 moreover if the us equity market turns bearish owing to fears of a possible slowdown in china think apple s recent announcement6 president trump might be more inclined to strike a deal with china please click on the image to enlarge trade tensions easing the real challenge for china is how it will manage trade tensions with the united states there are both short term issues imbalances and market access and long term ones the possible spill over effect of china s industrial policies and alleged forced technology transfers and the two need to be addressed separately short term issues could be resolved through greater imports of us products and limited deregulation in certain sectors such as financial services health care and auto however greater purchases of us imports may also result in trade friction with other trading partners therefore in the short run the best policy response for china is to slash import tariffs significantly in the medium term it must address the thorny issues of intellectual property rights ipr protection and the alleged forced technology transfers but there are no easy answers to how this can be done because progress in ipr protection is hard to quantify the challenge of measuring progress in terms of ipr protection however could be compensated by a faster pace of liberalization especially by relaxing jv requirements in sectors where profits remain sturdy the automotive and services sectors would be great places to start where fiscal policy is concerned a lower gdp growth target is one easy and efficient way to avoid worsening over capacity and other spill over effects of china s industrial policies with the benefit of hindsight one can see that china s massive fiscal stimulus package in 2008 did indeed save the world economy by boosting commodity prices and market sentiment 7 but china s rapid gains of market share in the manufacturing sector may also have fanned the fires of protectionism in the west 8 therefore if policymakers do feel compelled to rely on an expansionary fiscal policy to cushion external shocks the emphasis should be more on social development health care education and low income housing rather than on infrastructure in terms of monetary policy even if the fed turns less hawkish china is likely to face greater constraints in 2019 which will have repercussions in the region in the medium term interest rate differentials between china and the united states will likely widen which will again put more pressure on the renminbi how china manages its currency exchange rate will be watched closely by global policymakers if china wants to reflate the economy and yet wants to avoid a 2008 style fiscal stimulus given the relatively benign inflationary outlook and the pullback of crude oil prices beijing could consider lowering the value of renminbi against the dollar whose strength appears intact in 2019 so far outlook for the renminbi and regional implications so far in 2019 the renminbi has performed strongly as a result of the ongoing trade talks even a temporary suspension of conflict would improve the rather subdued sentiment in china and the region triggering equity rallies and bolstering battered regional currencies unfortunately the renminbi exchange rate is often affected more by politics than by economics the decision taken by beijing to keep the currency stable during the asian financial crisis 1997 to 2002 propelled china into a position of leadership in the region as long as trade talks continue beijing will be likely to keep the renminbi exchange rate steady as a gesture of goodwill meanwhile the fact remains that despite the various mechanisms that enable the people s bank of china pboc to have a managed floating exchange rate regime policy biases have been increasingly favoring a stable renminbi exchange rate since the second half of 2018 9 rightly or wrongly an exchange rate of 7 0 rmb to the usd is being seen as a key psychological threshold10 in terms of confidence even though the pboc s reserves stood at 3 07 trillion at the end of 2018 11 this was why usd cny ended at 6 99 in 2016 amid mounting depreciation pressures the real issue is whether a stable renminbi exchange rate would come at too high a price that is lead to sub par growth or become a drag on corporate profitability our long held view is that china does not need a major revaluation of the exchange rate in order to restore competitiveness however a slightly weaker renminbi will support the pboc s accommodative monetary policy and reduce some of the pains of deleveraging looking at the currency through the lens of the us china trade conflict the best case scenario to avoid trade tension escalation would be for china to accept the 25 percent tariff on 50 billion of us exports which was levied last year as 50 billion only accounts 2 percent of china s total exports 12 however depending on a successful outcome from the trade talks also implies that china has to keep the renminbi exchange rate relatively stable amid persistent downward pressure the worst case scenario is a continued impasse that will weigh heavily on both stock market sentiment and private investment in addition such a situation would make it increasingly difficult for beijing to execute certain much needed domestic reforms such as relaxing jv requirements in certain sectors and increasing foreign ownership in the financial sector in this case it might be tempting for china to use a lower renminbi exchange rate to boost exports and loosen monetary condition but china s trading partner may misunderstand the fact that the pboc would like to keep monetary conditions loose simply for reasons of business cycle we foresee two cuts of reserve requirement rates in 2019 what if additional monetary easing is required interest rate cuts are clearly not an option in theory china could engineer a moderate revaluation of the renminbi in such a way that the expectation of depreciation could be met or even exceeded in practice however it is almost impossible to know where to stop to maintain a stable currency exchange rate while allowing interest rate differentials with the united states to widen will bring about distortions in the economy and increase the administrative cost of implementing capital controls another factor affecting the renminbi outlook in 2019 is deleveraging as this will be a multiyear project and can by no means be done in a painless manner in the end the debt gdp ratio has to come down through a combination of economic growth inflation and debt workout other countries experiences of debt reduction suggest that a slightly higher inflation will make this process less painful a slightly higher inflation will imply a weaker exchange rate to sum up china has many tools to stabilize the renminbi in 2019 and beyond but the real question is at what cost on balance a slightly weaker renminbi will bring greater economic benefits than maintaining a stable exchange rate this may worry the other economies in the region but if the renminbi exchange rate depreciates by 5 percent against the dollar in 2019 the impact on regional economies will certainly be manageable if china could avoid an abrupt revaluation unlike 1997 when emerging asia was severely hit by drastic outflows of capital most economies are in much stronger positions in terms of balance of payments and fiscal position if beijing can at the same time strike a balance between deleveraging and economic growth a softer renminbi exchange rate so long as it is not a significant revaluation as in 1994 will have little impact on regional economies see also link to the original source here a chinese law firm and a member of the deloitte legal global network we

by independenttrader when in 2017 we have begun to mention the upcoming us china trade war the largest media have not yet been interested in this topic the situation has changed a year later when the tariffs imposed by washington has dominated the headlines trade war and its negotiations have become a convenient subject explaining all changes on the markets everything indicates that we are experiencing a similar pattern in the event of an upcoming recession last friday we were dealing with the reversal of the yield curve in the united states this is a situation where the interest rate on short term bonds is higher than in the case of long term bonds last week the yields of 3 month and 1 year us bonds turned out to be higher than 10 year yield such a phenomenon is usually treated as a signal of an impending recession as in the case of the trade war mainstream media needed a strong impulse a specific event to inform that the recession is on the horizon when the yield curve started to reverse at a rapid pace markets suddenly became paralyzed by the fear of the upcoming recession meanwhile from the investor s perspective such information is belated and of a lower value therefore we will take two steps forward again we will check whether the economic data also indicates a slowdown and we will consider whether the recession must mean the bear market appearance on the trading floors ultimately during these times central banks are trying to keep the market away from panicking treasury yield curve let s first begin first with the us bond market as part of a small reminder most of the time bond yields are higher the longer their maturity ultimately lending money for a longer period of time bears higher risk however this does not change the fact that sometimes the demand for long term 10 or 30 years us bonds is so large that their yields drops and are lower than in case of the short term bonds such a phenomenon generally means an increase fear among investors as a result there is a reversal of the yield curve which can be seen on the left on the graph the light gray color shows the yield curve from two years ago the dark gray one from the last year and the blue one current situation as you can see the latter no longer shows the growing trend like the other two but slowly begins to turn in turn on the right side of the graphic is a chart showing the difference between the interest rates of 1 year and 10 year us bonds when the spread falls to zero as it is now it indicates an upcoming recession this indicator has worked well for the last 7 recessions anyway the details from the bond market do not have to immediately convince anyone that the recession is on its way and you must run to the safest assets furthermore many analysts responsible for maintaining good moods have already managed to say that this time the market reacts differently and one should not worry about the yield curve the more it is worth to look at other important indicators global weekly leading index observation of the gdp of various countries allows us to state that we are dealing with recession however there is a so called leading indicator that monitors changes in many macroeconomic data including gdp sales employment when its value in annual terms begins to drop it should be treated as a significant warning not every descent below zero means a recession but in the current situation a glance at the graph tells us a lot global weekly index is today almost 3 lower than last year what will happen to the index in the coming months nobody will answer this question but we can look for clues analyzing the situation in different regions of the world asia let s begin with a country which for several decades has had a huge impact on the economic growth rate all over the world a lot depends on china while the local industry informs that the country experiences lower and lower demand for their products the below pmi index last time was so bad at the bottom of the recession in 2009 official figures for china still shows economic growth at 6 while statements suggesting it is rather 0 or 1 are immediately censored the exports of south korea also look dramatic as we have just mentioned this is an indicator that should not be disregarded because it often works as a reflection of the global economic conditions and future profits of companies currently export of south korea falls every month in february it was a decrease of 11 5 compared to the same month a year earlier in turn the result for the period 1 20 march is a decrease by a further 5 there are also areas in the industrial sector where incoming orders for asian products are 30 40 lower than a year ago europe manufacturing pmi in the euro area speaks for itself source tradingeconomics com as a reminder above 50 indicates growth and below 50 means the economic sector s contraction in nominal terms without inflation now european industry is below the key level in addition the services pmi looks better and amounts to over 50 on the other hand it is an indicator that reacts with a slight delay to the manufacturing pmi and generally behaves more gently i e does not adopt such extreme values as manufacturing pmi there is nothing to be excited by data from italy which has been in the economic downturn for a long time the real problem to worry though are the signals from germany in this case we can already talk about entering recession and yet it is probably the most important economy on the continent germany among others suffers due to the deteriorating situation in the automotive sector which is usually one of the first to be affected by the weakening consumption demand in many euro area countries gdp growth is below 1 per annum while the unemployment rate is low compared to the historical data this situation creates a pressure on employers to raise wages this in turn increases the cost of goods and services prices are rising and consumers have less and less financial opportunities the scale of danger is also showing in the bond market german 10 year bond yield has dropped below zero last week in other words people are looking for a safe haven for their funds and choose government bonds even if they guarantee loss usa after fed has resigned from the regular interest rate hikes in january there has been a slight easing in place and again we have seen the stock market rally optimism has returned and donald trump could once again proclaim that the american economy looks great and would look even better if interest rate hikes has not hapened before the problem is in the us economy which reached a certain level and there are problems related to its overheating the first example is labor costs which are measured among others by a special organization associating small entrepreneurs so far every time their index reached around 8 10 points the recession has hit the us the next year at the latest source bloomberg also famous record low unemployment in the us is slowly growing in effect the average unemployment rate for the last 3 months is higher than for the last six months over last few decades every such type of event has preceded a recession we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us as for gdp growth in the us the first quarter of 2019 will still be positive it can however negatively surprise the market many large entities assess that gdp will be between 1 5 and 2 5 on the other hand much more calm and credible in its forecasts the fed from atlanta forecasts from 0 2 to 1 2 needless to say gdp far below forecasts will mean hundreds of news about the recession and further shocks in the market let s not forget about the fed statement from march the total exclusion of any rate hikes this year fairy tales about a rate hike next year and premature termination of the balance sheet reduction this means that the federal reserve is already preparing for the first hit of the recession after which tools of exceptionally loose monetary policy will be automatically applied canada data for the last quarter of 2018 shows that the canadian economy practically stood still overall the economic growth for the previous year was 0 4 it has to be noted that in this country a key role plays the real estate market the inflow of chinese capital and speculative activities have been raising housing prices to the record levels which we have mentioned several times before as a result the value of real estate and activities related to this market e g construction insurance have started to have a huge impact on gdp at the same time flats and houses became inaccessible to the ordinary citizens of canada what caused considerable dissatisfaction the society protests over time have brought desired results vancouver and toronto have decided to introduce special property taxes for real estate purchased by foreigners in this way the market was cut off from the new capital and the bubble began to burst which now translates into worse macroeconomic data in order to make you aware of the scale of the bubble in canada we will make a small comparison perhaps some of you have heard about the incredible high prices of real estate in san francisco where even high earners like programmers have a problem with buying a flat now let s compare the increases in real estate price indexes in san francisco and several canadian cities since january 2002 san francisco case shiller index increased by 121 montreal bank house price index increased by 158 toronto bank house price index increased by 205 vancouver bank house price index increased by 300 this gives a certain point of reference how dramatic effects on the canadian economy may have a bursting bubble in the real estate market and now one important point after world war ii the united states fell into recession and canada was able to avoid it in turn when canada fell into recession the united states always fell into it in summary the situation in europe canada and asia looks very poor in case of the united states inferior data just makes themselves known does that mean sharp drop in the stock market we will certainly be witnessing events similar to those from last friday sharp drops in share prices and strong increases in bond prices it is much harder to say in what scale they will be when central banks have started purchasing shares and bonds 10 years ago the market did not know what the effects of these actions might be today thousands of investors believe that the appropriate scale of purchases has the chance to keep the assets at high levels this is one of the factors that supports optimism in the us in this way the fed has led to an absurd situation in which the market prices completely dispersed with expected profits of the companies this can be seen in the chart below where the s p 500 index is shown in green and the profits of the companies included in the index are denoted as a red line source zerohedge com the last decade in japan could be a measure of what can happen to the stock market with shrinking economy and central bank interventions purchases of the bank of japan have made the stocks growing despite today s dramatic conditions of its economy and today they are significantly above the peaks of 2007 source stockcharts com however until the recession is officially confirmed central banks of us and china have no pretext to introduce gigantic printing and negative interest rates when that happens and the bankers confirm their announcements more events will be likely to be assessed up to now two opposing forces will act on the stock market on the one hand fear of recession and information about companies poor results will deter from investing in shares on the other hand hope of imminent printing launch will cause some investors sitting on the market to take advantage of the first strong rebound after the announcement of the printing donald trump has a strong motivation to keep high prices on the stock exchanges the better the quotes the more americans in a good mood will approach the next year s elections summary with the current involvement of central banks it is extremely difficult to determine where the markets will be in the next three months however we are convinced that another bad data coming from the economy will sometimes increase volatility in the markets central banks will certainly try to save the situation however one can not rule out a scenario in which one of their interventions will be perceived by the market as a total loss of control over events what will happen then in a moderately pessimistic scenario the stock market will be massively shaken capital will flow to bonds in an extremely pessimistic scenario very low probability capital will start to evacuate from both main markets which could be a threat to the further functioning of the financial system in our opinion the most likely scenario is a printing on two fronts on the one hand we mean keeping high prices on the stock markets to avoid panic on the other hand the economic recession will lead to a strong rise in unemployment governments will be forced to spend more on benefits some countries will bring guaranteed income in the context of the markets the result will be a repeat from the 70s high inflation and increases in tangible assets prices extremely expensive shares in the us in nominal terms will fall in the sideline trend or slightly increase but after taking inflation into account it will turn out that they were hopeless and only bonds performance were worse than them however before central banks officially face the recession it is worth to hold your funds mainly in cash the best in us dollar and swiss franc i e safe haven currencies independent trader team

interview with der standard interview with sabine lautenschläger member of the executive board of the ecb conducted by andrás szigètvari on 27 march 2019 and published on 1 april 2019 can you enlighten us is the ecb stealing interest income from savers are savers being dispossessed many german economists and politicians are convinced of exactly that leading them to harshly criticise the ecb leadership under mario draghi i appreciate that people are concerned it s true that putting money into a savings account these days will earn you very little interest but it s also true to say that people can only save if they have a job and earn enough money to put some savings aside our monetary policy has made an important contribution to boosting employment and wage growth and people are not only savers but also entrepreneurs and home buyers who benefit from low interest rates so the question we need to ask ourselves is if the ecb had not taken certain measures in the past what state would the economy be in today and how would you answer that there was a high risk of deflation in the euro area deflation would have meant falling prices with people therefore postponing their purchasing decisions in anticipation of prices falling even further at the same time firms would have reined in investment and there would have been job cuts that is a vicious circle so it was absolutely right to counteract this danger by lowering interest rates and to generally loosen monetary policy in order for us to bring inflation to a level below but close to 2 the ecb has now bought government bonds and other securities amounting to 2 6 trillion interest rates have been at zero for years you are offering banks unlimited credit as long as they can back it with appropriate collateral the official motivation for taking all these measures was to bring the inflation rate up to just below 2 that is the ecb s inflation target but inflation is currently at 1 5 and the ecb has fallen short of 2 for years so what is the point of it all again we had to respond to the risk of deflation and we have come nearer to our aim of maintaining an appropriate level of inflation over the medium term our actions have had an effect lending to households has been boosted just as much as lending to companies so we have seen an overall rise in the propensity to invest the negotiated wage agreements also show that our measures are having an impact wage growth in the euro area stands at more than 2 and it is even slightly higher in germany that will push up prices but it is slower than we had thought why the level of economic growth is one factor but another is the labour market as far as economic growth is concerned there have been repeated setbacks over the past few years geopolitical uncertainties such as brexit and the threat of protectionism are currently weighing on economic sentiment that is also why inflation remains subdued moreover it has taken a long time for the decline in unemployment to be reflected in higher wages the number of people who lost their jobs in the crisis but never registered themselves as unemployed has been underestimated when the economy revived these people returned to the labour market a great many people above all part time workers began to work longer hours when the upswing set in in brief the labour supply was underestimated it s only when the labour market has thoroughly cleared that wages start to climb more steeply we re seeing that in germany for example one serious criticism of the ecb s programme is that it is effectively only subsidising the southern crisis countries the central bank has pushed interest rates down without this life saver italy would have gone bankrupt long ago and the euro would have been history hold on a moment all have benefited from the measures the savings for taxpayers resulting from lower interest rates were nowhere as high as in germany but isn t it also true that the ecb is indirectly financing governments here any creditor who invests in italian or spanish government bonds knows that the ecb will buy these bonds off them in the future even though i am not the strongest advocate of our government bond purchases we do not finance individual governments with them directly or indirectly our aim is to maintain price stability thanks to our bond purchases interest rates go down and loans become cheaper primarily benefiting households and businesses besides we have a very clear set of criteria for the timing selection and volumes of our government bond purchases our parameters ensure that the private market for government bonds remains intact one sign of the continuing relevance of this market is the divergence in the prices for german italian and spanish government bonds another criticism is that the ecb defers problems rather than solving them owing to the low interest rates cheap credit is even available to firms that are no longer competitive and would otherwise have gone under long ago these zombie firms tie up capital and employees all of which is harmful to economic efficiency we have only bought corporate bonds with high ratings this has indeed improved financing conditions predominantly for the companies in question but also indirectly for the firms with lower credit standing however banks lending to companies must take the risk involved into account in their financing conditions so basically the higher the risk the more expensive the loan moreover european banking supervision requires more capital to cover the risk and looks very closely at credit standards and indeed not every group in the euro area can borrow for five years at less than 3 interest there are differences not only across countries but also across firms within the individual countries the role of government debt is now the subject of heated international debate one argument that comes up more and more often is that the significance of debt has been systematically overestimated large countries with their own central banks have no need to worry japan and the united states two countries that are highly indebted but nonetheless pay low interest rates often serve as examples that is impossible in the euro area for purely legal reasons if nothing else we have set maximum limits on the member states levels of deficit and debt and the ecb cannot buy government bonds on the primary market for example bonds which other market participants no longer want because of say doubts about the sustainability of a country s debt we can only purchase government bonds on the secondary market to a limited extent and only if such a purchase is absolutely necessary to maintain price stability these are the legal conditions and what are the economic ones in the recent debt crisis we had a front seat view of what happens when individual countries build up too much debt these states lose the confidence of market participants and their access to credit or can only borrow at extremely high rates of interest moreover i think we have to reflect on the burden we are leaving to other generations you can t keep on building up debt sooner or later you will have to repay it but you are not putting it correctly ideally we would not only pass on our debts to future generations but also assets that were created from that debt that can t work if you are living permanently above your means when a crisis breaks out we are pleased if countries have a buffer enabling them to make anticyclical investments and stimulate growth only countries that have previously pursued sound economic policies have that buffer

of canada the government on march 19 2019 budget day as expected in an election year budget 2019 spoke directly to the young the elderly the middle class and those working hard to join it and federal government employees who continue to be impacted by the phoenix pay system of note the largest single tax expenditure is anticipated to be the canada training credit with a cost of 815 million over 5 years investors and employees holding lucrative stock options may be disappointed due to proposed limits on benefits on the business side there will be increased support for research and innovation and for canadian journalism there are a few anti avoidance measures targeted at the investment industry which seem par for the course given other recent budgets in addition canada has reaffirmed international commitments to combat tax avoidance improve beneficial ownership transparency and strengthen canada s anti money laundering and anti terrorist financing regime despite pressure from industry the government made no commitment to engage in meaningful or comprehensive tax reform to enhance canada s tax competitiveness business income tax measures characterconversion transactions in 2013 the government introduced rules to the income tax act canada the income tax act aimed at financial arrangements character conversion transactions which use derivative contracts to convert the returns on an investment from ordinary income to capital gains under those rules gains arising from a derivative forward agreement were treated as ordinary income rather than as a capital gain a derivative forward agreement was defined to include any agreement to purchase or sell a capital property where the term of the agreement or series of agreements exceeds 180 days and the difference between the fair market value of the property delivered on settlement of the agreement and the amount paid for the property is derivative in nature i e it is attributable in whole or in part to an underlying interest other than certain excluded interests one important excluded interest is where the economic return from a purchase or sale agreement is based on the economic performance of the actual property being purchased or sold this exception is intended to exclude certain commercial transactions such as m a transactions from the scope of the rules transactions have been developed which arguably fit within the commercial transaction exception but they are considered a misuse of the exception as their purpose is not tied to the type of situations to which the exception was intended to apply generally these transactions involve the forward purchase of an income generating asset where the income is rolled up into the asset value and realized as a capital gain when the transaction is closed out budget 2019 proposes an amendment that introduces an additional qualification for the commercial transaction exception in the definition of derivative forward agreement as the exception applies to purchase agreements in general terms this amendment will provide that the commercial transaction exception is unavailable if it can reasonably be considered that one of the main purposes of the series of transactions of which an agreement to purchase a security in the future or an equivalent agreement is part is for a taxpayer to convert into a capital gain an amount paid on the security by the issuer of the security during the period that the security is subject to the agreement this measure will apply to transactions entered into on or after budget day it will also apply after december 2019 to transactions that were entered into before budget day that extended or renewed the terms of the agreement on or after budget day this grandfathering will incorporate the same growth limits used under the transitional relief provided under the derivative forward agreement rules introduced in 2013 mutual funds allocation to redeemers methodology in order to support unitholder fairness in the mutual fund industry the income tax act provides the capital gains refund mechanism which is a formula that reduces the amount of realized capital gains that would otherwise be payable to unitholders at the trust level by the amount of gains realized on the redemption of units during the year due to the perceived inefficiencies of the formula the mutual fund industry developed a methodology of allocating capital gains to unitholders on the redemption of their units the allocation to redeemers methodology which was sanctioned by the canada revenue agency the cra in a number of advance income tax rulings under the methodology a unitholder s proceeds on redemption was reduced by the amount of capital gains allocated and the mutual fund trust was able to claim a corresponding deduction the department of finance believes that certain mutual fund trusts have been using the allocation to redeemers methodology to allocate capital gains to redeeming unitholders in excess of the capital gains that would otherwise have been realized by these unitholders on the redemption of their units resulting in an inappropriate deferral of tax on the excess amount for these remaining unitholders to address this perceived abuse budget 2019 proposes to introduce a new rule that would deny a mutual fund trust a deduction in respect of the portion of an allocation made to a unitholder on a redemption of a unit of the mutual fund trust that is greater than the capital gain that would otherwise have been realized by the unitholder on the redemption if the following conditions are met the allocated amount is a capital gain and the unitholder s redemption proceeds are reduced by the allocation in addition budget 2019 proposes to introduce a new rule that will deny a mutual fund trust a deduction in respect of an allocation made to a unitholder on a redemption if the allocated amount is ordinary income and the unitholder s redemption proceeds are reduced by the allocation both of these measures will apply to taxation years of mutual fund trusts that begin on or after budget day and they are expected to have a significant impact on the etf industry scientific

group is gradually reduced where i taxable income for the previous taxation year is between 500 000 and 800 000 and ii taxable capital employed in canada for the previous taxation year is between 10

result small ccpcs with taxable capital of up to 10 million will benefit from unreduced access to the enhanced refundable sr ed credit regardless of their taxable income provided their taxable capital does not exceed 10 million this measure will apply to taxation years that end on or after budget day capitalcost allowance cca rules for zero emission vehicles budget 2019 proposes to provide a

individual or trust makes an investment in a foreign affiliate accordingly budget 2019 proposes to extend the application of these rules to crics that are controlled by a non resident individual a non resident trust or a group of persons that do not deal with each other at arm s length comprising any combination of non resident corporations non resident individuals and non resident trusts the proposals include an extended meaning of related that applies for the purpose of determining whether a non resident trust does not deal at arm s length with another non resident person this measure will apply to transactions and events that occur on or after budget day cross bordershare lending arrangements securities lending is a practice commonly used in capital markets a securities lending arrangement may involve a non resident lending a share to a canadian resident and the canadian resident agreeing to return an identical share to the non resident in the future providing collateral as security over the term of the arrangement the canadian resident is obligated to make payments as compensation for any dividends paid by the issuer of the lent share dividend compensation payments the arrangement intends to put the non resident in the same economic position with respect to the lent share as if it had continued to hold the lent share the income tax act contains rules that deem a dividend compensation payment made under a fully collateralized securities lending arrangement to be a payment made by the canadian resident to the non resident of a dividend payable on the lent share which is subject to withholding tax for the purpose of these rules a securities lending arrangement is fully collateralized if the canadian resident provides collateral to the non resident in the form of money or government debt obligations with a value of 95 per cent or more of the lent share if a securities lending arrangement is not fully collateralized the dividend compensation payment is instead deemed to be a payment of interest made by the canadian resident to the non resident which is generally exempt from withholding tax provided the parties deal at arm s length budget 2019 introduces a number of measures intended to prevent non resident taxpayers from avoiding canadian dividend withholding tax on compensation payments made under cross border share lending arrangements with respect to shares of canadian resident corporations canadian shares either through securities lending arrangements that are structured not to meet the fully collateralized test or by entering into securities loans that are designed to fail the requirements of the securities lending arrangement definition the government contends that existing rules may be used to challenge these types of arrangements in certain circumstances however for the sake of efficiency the government is proposing specific measures in budget 2019 under the proposed amendments a dividend compensation payment made under a securities lending arrangement by a canadian resident to a non resident in respect of a canadian share will always be treated as a dividend under the characterization rules and therefore always subject to withholding tax budget 2019 also proposes an amendment to apply the characterization rules not only to a securities lending arrangement under the income tax act but also to a specified securities lending arrangement which includes securities loans that are substantially similar to securities lending arrangements finally complementary amendments are proposed to ensure that the securities lending arrangement rules cannot be used to obtain other unintended withholding tax benefits these proposed amendments will apply to compensation payments that are made on or after budget day unless the securities loan was in place before budget day in which case the amendments will apply to compensation payments made after september 2019 in addition budget 2019 proposes to broaden an existing canadian dividend withholding tax exemption to circumstances where the securities lending characterization rules would otherwise result in inappropriately taxing compensation payments made under certain securities lending arrangements in respect of shares of foreign corporations this proposed amendment will apply to dividend compensation payments made on or after budget day review of base erosion and profit shifting beps large multinational enterprises in canada and elsewhere are now required to file country by country reports that include information on their global allocation of income and taxes as well as the nature of their global business activities these reports are exchanged between the cra and other tax authorities with whom canada has exchange agreements country by country reports are an important tool in addressing beps by providing the cra and other tax authorities with new information to better assess transfer pricing risks in conjunction with other international tax authorities canada is now participating in a review of these reporting standards to ensure that they provide tax administrators with information that allows for proper assessment of transfer pricing and other beps risks this review is scheduled to be completed in 2020 personal income tax measures employee stock options budget 2019 announces the government s intent to limit the use of the current employee stock option tax regime and move toward aligning the tax treatment with the united states for employees of large long established mature firms the current tax rules provide preferential tax treatment to employee stock options in the form of a deduction which effectively results in the benefit being taxed at a rate equal to one half of the normal rate of personal taxation the same effective rate as for capital gains in the government s view the tax benefits of the employee stock option deduction disproportionately accrue to a very small number of high income individuals to address this perceived inequity the government intends to move forward with changes to limit the benefit of the employee stock option deduction by applying a 200 000 annual cap on employee stock option grants based on the fair market value of the underlying shares that may receive tax preferred treatment for employees of large long established mature firms for start ups and rapidly growing canadian businesses employee stock option benefits would remain uncapped any changes would apply on a go forward basis only and would not apply to employee stock options granted prior to the announcement of legislative proposals to implement any new regime further details of this measure will be released before the summer of 2019 additional types of annuities under registered plans

vplas will be required to comply with certain existing tax rules applicable to prpps and dc rpps as well as additional requirements the government will consult on potential changes to federal pension benefits standards legislation to accommodate vplas for federally regulated prpps and dc rpps to the extent that provinces wish to accommodate vplas for provincially regulated prpps and dc rpps they may need to amend their provincial pension benefits standards legislation these measures will apply to the 2020 and subsequent taxation years registered disability savings plans rdsps where a

from bloomberg the first official glimpse of saudi aramco s financial performance confirms the state run oil giant can generate profit like no other company on earth net income last year was 111 1 billion easily outstripping u s behemoths including apple inc and exxon mobil corp but accounts published before the firm s debut in the international bond market also show aramco an organization that produces about 10 percent of the world s crude doesn t generate as much cash per barrel as other leading oil companies like royal dutch shell plc because of a heavy tax burden the bond sale being pitched to investors this week in a global roadshow has forced aramco to reveal secrets held close since the company s nationalization in the late 1970s casting a light on the relationship between the kingdom and its most important asset both fitch ratings and moody s investors service assigned aramco the fifth highest investment grade the same as saudi sovereign debt but lower than oil majors exxon shell and chevron corp the company is preparing to raise debt in part to pay for the acquisition of a majority stake in domestic petrochemical group sabic worth about 69 billion the deal is a plan b to generate money for saudi arabia s economic agenda after an ipo of aramco was postponed in effect crown prince mohammed bin salman is using the firm s pristine balance sheet to finance his ambitions aramco will pay 50 percent of the sabic acquisition cost when the deal closes and the rest over the subsequent two years according to a person who saw a presentation made to potential investors on monday aramco declined to comment the 470 page bond prospectus filed with the london stock exchange detailed a litany of risks for prospective investors including missiles falling on aramco s installations the impact of proposed u s antitrust laws on opec the fight against climate change and even the risk that saudi arabia will break the peg between its currency the riyal and the u s dollar it also revealed the saudi oil giant was the victim of a successful cyber attack in 2012 that forced the company to move some operations into manual mode while the prospectus revealed the richest company on the planet it also showed how reliant aramco is on high oil and natural gas prices in 2016 when the price of brent crude plunged to average 45 a barrel and opec cut production the company struggled to break even net income for the full year was just 13 billion and free cash flow a tiny 2 billion the kingdom s dependence on the company to finance social and military spending as well as the lavish lifestyles of hundreds of princes places a heavy burden on aramco scash flow aramco pays 50 percent of its profit on income tax plus a sliding royalty scale that starts at 20 percent of the company s revenue and rises to as much as 50 percent with the price of oil aramco reported cash flow from operations of 121 billion and 35 1 billion in capital spending and paid 58 2 billion in dividends to the saudi government in 2018 according to moody s in a presentation to potential bondholders the company said its ordinary dividend last year was 52 billion there wasn t an immediate explanation about the gap between the two figures fitch said its a rating reflects the strong links between the company and the kingdom and the influence the state has on aramco through regulating the level of production taxation and dividends over time a low oil price environment could cause a sustained fiscal deficit for saudi arabia that could result in changes down the line for aramco s fiscal regime said neil beveridge an energy analyst with sanford c bernstein co in hong kong you can t disassociate the sovereign government from aramco given the very close relationship and the contribution aramco makes to the overall funding for saudi arabia aramco reported funds flow from operations a measure closely watched by investors and similar to cash flow from operations of 26 abarrel equivalent of oil last year according to fitch that s below what big oil companies such as shell and total sa enjoy at 38 and 31 per barrel respectively funds from operations which is operation cash flows before working capital changes is the best measure to compare oil companies profitability since ebitda does not take into account taxation dmitry marinchenko senior director at fitch in london said in an interview aramco told potential bondholders it generated operating cash flow of 121 billion in 2018 although that s significantly higher than oil majors produce the difference isn t a large as the ebitda or the net income shell for example reported cash flow of 53 billion despite a significantly lower oil and gas production than aramco exxon reported cash flow last year of 36 billion fitch s a rating for aramco is one level below the aa for both shell and total the moody s rating is well behind exxon s top aaa level the oil giant has mandated banks to hold a roadshow for dollar denominated notes from april 1 potentially including tranches from three to 30 years according to a person familiar with the matter fitch said that aramco planned to pay for the 70 percent stake in sabic in installments over 2019 21 the company will hold meetings with investors in coming days in cities including london new york boston singapore hong kong tokyo los angeles and chicago aramco picked banks including jpmorgan chase co and morgan stanley to manage the debt offering the bond plan credit rating and the publication of the first extracts of aramco s accounts are all part of the ambitions of prince mohammed who controls most of the levers of power in the kingdom and wants to pursue an ipo as part of his plans to ready the country for the post oil age yet his ambition to secure a 2 trillion valuation has faced pushback from global investors prompting a delay in the ipo for all the shock and awe in aramco s big reveal the published numbers appear to leave that valuation a long way off implying a dividend yield about half of what shell pays from reuters saudi aramco the world s biggest oil producer made core earnings of 224 billion last year almost three times as much as apple figures from the state owned company showed on monday ahead of its debut international bond issue previously reluctant to disclose its financials aramco had to reveal them in order to obtain a public rating and start issuing international bonds despite the huge profit the state owned oil giant was rated by credit agencies at par with saudi arabia meaning the kingdom s sluggish economy will weigh on aramco s cost of borrowing as it prepares its bond market debut aramco s core earnings surpass those of apple ranked by forbes as the world s top company in terms of profits last year which had normalized core earnings or ebitda of 81 8 billion saudi energy minister khalid al falih said earlier this year aramco s planned bond sale would raise around 10 billion but banking sources said the transaction could be larger rating agencies fitch and moody s rated aramco a and a1 respectively but both said that without sovereign rating constraints it would be in the same league as oil companies like exxon mobil chevron and shell saudi aramco s rating is constrained by that of saudi arabia a stable fitch said this reflects the influence the state exerts on the company through taxation and dividends as well as regulating the level of production in line with its opec commitments however aramco s bond prospectus said the kingdom would not guarantee aramco s notes and was under no obligation to extend financial support to the company fitch put aramco s standalone credit profile at aa credit ratings allow investors to compare and assess the credit quality of bond issuers and their debt securities and are important in determining how much borrowers have to pay minimal debt the planned bond deal is aramco s inaugural transaction in international markets it still plans to launch an initial public stock offering or ipo in 2021 expected to generate 100 billion having postponed its flotation from 2018 saudi aramco has many characteristics of a aaa rated corporate with minimal debt relative to cash flows large scale of production market leadership and access in saudi arabia to one of the world s largest hydrocarbon reserves said rehan akbar senior credit officer at moody s the group has 257 billion barrels of oil equivalent representing more than 50 years of reserves based on current production levels according to a company presentation aramco will start meeting international bond investors this week for the much anticipated debt transaction the planned bond sale follows the announced acquisition of a 70 percent stake in saudi basic industries corp sabic from saudi arabia s public investment fund pif in a deal worth 69 1 billion aramco said the bond sale which may be split into tranches with maturities ranging from three to 30 years is not linked to the sabic acquisition aramco intends to pay for the acquisition in tranches with 50 percent at the closing of the transaction and the remainder over a two year period from internal cash generation and potentially other resources the company said the sabic deal will be completed in 2020 aramco said separately in the prospectus adding it will fund half of the acquisition with promissory notes issued to the pif extremely liquid saudi aramco has an extremely strong liquidity position moody s said with 48 8 billion in cash against 27 billion in reported debt the company s balance sheet leverage has been conservatively managed said the agency adding it has 46 8 billion of bank facilities of which about 25 5 billion was still available aramco representatives will meet with investors in asia europe and the united states through friday april 5 according to a document issued by one of the banks leading the deal the roadshow has no planned stop in the middle east showing the deal is mostly aimed at international buyers the blue chip company is extremely profitable free cash flow positive has low leverage and strong reserves for the future making it a compelling investment case for global investors said parth kikani fixed income director at emirates nbd asset management aramco had a net income of 111 billion last year revenue from upstream operations stood at around 217 billion while downstream revenue was 139 billion it had 86 billion in free cash flow at the end of 2018 the firm is presenting itself to global investors as an anchor of global energy and a global energy provider of systemic importance producing one of every eight barrels of global crude according to its presentation aramco has hired lazard as financial adviser for the bond deal and jp morgan and morgan stanley as global coordinators they are joined by citigroup goldman sachs hsbc and ncb capital as bookrunners from the wall street journal saudi arabia on monday for the first time revealed details to investors that show its national oil company is the world s most profitable business demonstrating that the cloistered kingdom is willing to undergo unprecedented scrutiny to tap international cash with 111 billion in net income in 2018 saudi aramco as the firm is known had bigger returns last year than apple inc and exxon mobil corp combined before taxes and other expenses the firm said it made 212 billion a figure similar to the combined military budgets of the 28 member states of the european union the financial information on monday was disclosed in a prospectus for a planned bond sale of at least 10 billion to help fund the acquisition of a 69 1 billion stake in saudi arabia s national petrochemicals firm the 470 page document provided the first look under the hood of aramco s finances since the once american run firm was nationalized over three decades ago and its profits became state secrets by disclosing aramco s profits and other detailed financial information some saudi officials hope they will quell any doubts about their determination to list aramco publicly by 2021 in what would likely be the biggest ever ipo saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman the kingdom s day to day ruler wants to use the ipo to raise tens of billions of dollars to build new futuristic new cities diversify the kingdom s oil dependent economy and fund a host of non oil industries like technology entertainment and mining the 33 year old prince first broached the ipo in early 2016 but concerns over disclosing aramco s finances helped delay it for years to the point that many bankers and saudi officials working on the plan believed it would never happen these financials have not been open to the public it is an important issue and this is probably a steppingstone to an ipo said theodore holland a senior portfolio manager at zurich based fisch asset management ag who aims to participate in the debt raising he said there would be strong demand among investors for aramco debt the financial figures audited by pricewaterhousecoopers public accountants painted a picture of a company with unmatched financial heft the oil firm s 2018 net income shot up from 284 billion saudi riyals or the equivalent of 75 9 billion in 2017 by comparison apple s equivalent most recent full year profit was roughly 60 billion amazon com inc was 10 billion and exxon mobil corp was 21 billion aramco s massive earnings numbers come despite taxes of roughly 50 to the government which is highly reliant on contributions from the oil firm aramco also pays a royalty to the saudi government of 20 of revenues up to 70 a barrel of oil and the rate increases on a sliding scale at prices above that level fitch ratings estimates that from 2015 to 2017 aramco accounted for around 70 of saudi arabia s revenues but the three years of financial information contained in the prospectus illustrate how tightly aramco s profits are tied to oil prices aramco reported a significantly lower net profit in 2016 of 13 2 billion the prospectus said when oil prices fell to an average monthly low of 31 90 a barrel in january that year its 2018 profits grew almost ninefold in a year when oil prices rose to over 80 a barrel opening up aramco s books doesn t necessarily mean the company will go ahead with an ipo prince mohammed previously announced he would list 5 of aramco in 2018 at a valuation of roughly 2 trillion though that process was delayed due to concerns that the company s worth wasn t close to the royal s estimate the figures released monday indicate a lower potential valuation for aramco up to about 1 5 trillion assuming oil prices around 70 a barrel according to bernstein research and saudi officials familiar with internal calculations brent crude was above 68 a barrel on monday nevertheless the disclosures to obtain a large foreign bond marked a coming out party for aramco aramco has chosen banks including jpmorgan chase co and morgan stanley to manage its first debt offering and hold a roadshow beginning monday in at least eight cities in the u s europe and asia investment bank lazard is also an independent adviser on the bond sale the proceeds would be used for as a down payment on its 69 1 billion purchase of 70 of saudi basic industries corp or sabic with the remainder of the acquisition paid in installments over time the wall street journal has reported aramco said monday in the bond prospectus that it would pay 50 of the acquisition price at the closing of the deal sometime next year and the rest in installments up to 2021 aramco is buying the sabic stake from saudi arabia s sovereign wealth fund public investment fund which is expected to use the proceeds to drive prince mohammed s agenda the fund has already invested or committed nearly 100 billion to partnerships such as softbank group corp s vision fund and stakes in technology firms such as uber technologies inc ahead of the aramco bond sale agencies published ratings on the oil firm for the first time fitch rated aramco at a the fifth highest investment grade level and the same as saudi arabia s sovereign bonds the firm also said it assessed the company s stand alone credit profile ignoring sovereign related risks at aa or one notch above the level at which the saudi government itself can raise debt moody s likewise rated aramco a1 a similar level to that given by fitch and noted that the oil firm s ties to the government meant it couldn t be assessed higher by comparison exxon is rated aaa by moody s its highest level moody s said saudi aramco s bond rating was lower than exxon s and others because it is constrained by the rating of the government of saudi arabia given the broad credit linkages between the two saudi aramco is the world s largest oil producer by volume fitch said the oil firm s 2018 total hydrocarbon production averaged 13 6 million barrels of oil equivalent a day including natural gas output ahead of global and regional producers such as abu dhabi national oil company royal dutch shell plc total sa and bp plc the ratings agency said saudi aramco estimates its proved liquids reserves at 227 billion barrels and its total hydrocarbon reserves at 257 billion barrels of oil equivalent aramco s net cash position at the end of last year was 48 8 billion and total borrowings were 27 billion according to the bond prospectus it made 69 of revenues last year from upstream oil and gas and the remainder from so called downstream operations

as the first quarter ends equities are sitting on solid gains even as a rally in government bonds has left yields in germany negative for the first time since 2016 the decline in yields has quickened this week allowing germany to sell 10 year bunds with a negative yield in the us the 10 year treasury yield has fallen below that of the three month treasury bill a warning that the clock is ticking on a us economic expansion that by sheer length almost rivals the fabled run of the 1990s there is a legitimate debate as to whether global economic weakness is temporary or evidence that the expansion since the financial crisis is truly waning but the message the yield curve has started to send in recent days is hardly comforting this debate previously played out in 2015 and early 2016 then hefty fiscal stimulus from china allied to bond buying from the bank of japan and the european central bank managed to end the soft patch the election of us president donald trump and the tax cuts that followed added momentum to global growth that eventually peaked early last year the double digit gains for many equity markets this year have been helped by the signals sent by central banks still struggling to hit their inflation targets that they are willing to ease policy or in the case of the federal reserve sit on the sidelines it has had the effect of loosening financial conditions helping equities and credit stock markets are fairly forgiving about weak earnings growth or even a fall in profits so long as there are grounds for an eventual bounce if the global economic data improve in coming months and washington and beijing strike a trade deal then financial markets could be soothed for a while but even in such a scenario do not expect a dramatic reversal of the trend for falling bond yields it is notable that the decline in bond yields has been across developed economies suggesting a slowing china is leaving a mark two of the bond markets spearheading the move lower in yields have been canada and australia while the housing markets in both countries are under pressure their role at the vanguard of the bond rally suggests that beijing s stimulus is a pale shadow of past efforts the volume of negative yielding debt rising back above the 10tn mark also makes the treasury market a magnet for investors seeking higher yields there is an argument that this is distorting the bond market and that 10 year yields are too low given the us economy s growth prospects for 2019 the fact that falling bond yields is a global phenomenon also eases the selling pressure on the us dollar as we have seen in recent weeks a firmer reserve currency tightens financial conditions too hardly a welcome development for us companies given the exposure of s p 500 blue chips to the global economy with the fed stuck on policy pause and still trimming its balance sheet until september at some stage and perhaps soon the equity market may start fretting about tight policy particularly if the dollar appreciates further all of which is central to the debate over the significance of the 10 year yield sliding beneath the rate for a three month bill it certainly sends a signal to fed officials that policy is too tight as recently as october the 10 year note yield stood 100 basis points above the implied three month bill yield which was cited by many as a good reason for not worrying about the risk of a recession those questioning the meaning of the first inversion since 2007 will be silenced if it becomes sustained and deeper the bond market is not forecasting a recession it is simply flagging a higher risk of one clearly the market turmoil of late last year showed the limits of the world s most important central bank s effort to tighten policy the recent clamour for sovereign bonds is also a sign that tension is building across markets the rationale is not hard to fathom a decade since the previous global recession equities and credit are expensive and now likely to rise further courtesy of lower bond yields at the same time the weight of debt that requires servicing is far heavier global debt has climbed by 100tn from just before the financial crisis and sits around 240tn the bill is coming just as global growth is slowing corporate earnings growth is stalling and profit margins are contracting it was popular to downplay the significance of the inverted curve in 2000 and 2006 but on both occasions the bond market s warning was eventually vindicated that help explains the confidence of fixed income investors who are looking beyond the current cycle and already anticipating the next move from the fed will be to cut rates

hurdles ahead testing crucial resistances read the index outlook in full here april 1 9 05 am weekly trading guide for week beginning april 1 2019 sbi 320 8 the uptrend in sbi is gaining momentum the stock surged 7 6 per cent last week breaking above the key resistance level of 305 resistance is near current levels at around 321 a pull back from that can trigger a corrective fall to 315 a break below 315 can drag the stock lower to 305 however the bias continues to remain positive so a further fall below 305 looks less probable a bounce from 305 will have the potential to take the stock above 321 in such a scenario a rally to 350 is likely the indicators on the charts are positive the 21 day moving average has crossed over the 55 100 and 200 day moving averages this is a strong bullish sign indicating that the downside could be limited and the uptrend is likely to remain in place short term traders can wait for dips and go long at 315 and accumulate at 308 stop loss can be placed at 295 for the target of 350 revise the stop loss to 325 as soon as the stock moves up to 335 itc 296 7 itc was volatile last week the stock fell initially to a low of 291 2 and bounced back to make a high of 302 95 however it fell in the final trading session of the week giving back all the gains and closed on a flat note the resistance at 302 is holding well itc has to make a decisive close above this hurdle to regain strength and move higher the next target is 309 the level of 309 is a key long term trend resistance inability to rise past this level can trigger a corrective fall to 302 or 300 but a strong break above 309 will increase the likelihood of the rally extending to 320 and 322 over the medium term on the other hand if itc continues to trade below 302 a dip to 293 or 290 is possible investors can continue to hold the long positions taken at 282 278 and 272 with a revised stop loss at 289 move the stop loss further higher to 301 as soon as the stock moves up to 305 book profits at 310 infosys 742 3 infosys tumbled 3 per cent intraweek and made a low of 719 6 however the stock reversed sharply higher recovering all the loss the bias remains positive on the chart the 21 day moving average at 726 is a key support the quick bounce from 719 indicates that the stock is getting fresh buyers below 726 so as long as the stock trades above the 21 day moving average support there is a strong likelihood of it moving higher to 750 755 a further break above 755 will then increase the likelihood of the uptrend extending to 780 the short term outlook will turn negative only if infosys makes a decisive close below the 21 day moving average a fall to 705 or 700 is possible a further fall below 700 looks less probable at the moment medium term traders can hold the long positions taken at 725 720 and 715 retain the stop loss at 680 for the target of 790 revise the stop loss to 735 as the stock moves up to 755 ril 1 363 ril opened the week with a gap down and fell to a low of 1 317 15 however the negative sentiment was short lived and ril clawed back recovering all the loss and closed 1 5 per cent higher for the week the support at 1 316 mentioned last week has held very well this leaves the bullish outlook intact a near term resistance is at 1 385 which is likely to be tested in the coming days inability to breach this hurdle can drag the stock lower to 1 350 initially a further break below 1 350 will then increase the likelihood of the downmove extending to 1 315 or 1 310 but if ril manages to break above 1 385 it can gain fresh strength in such a scenario ril can surge to 1 400 a strong break above 1 400 will be very bullish from a long term perspective this will pave way for 1 450 and 1 500 over the long term the outlook for the stock will turn negative only if ril declines below 1 300 such a break can trigger a corrective fall to 1 260 and 1 250 tata steel 520 8 tata steel continued to consolidate for the fourth consecutive week the stock has been stuck between 505 and 532 a breakout on either side of 505 or 532 will decide the next move if tata steel breaks the range below 505 it can fall to 495 or 490 but such a fall looks less likely as the price action on the chart leaves the possibility high of the stock breaking above 532 the stock is well above the 21 week moving average level of 507 as long as it trades above this support the bias will remain positive a strong break above 532 will take tata steel to 540 a further break above 540 will then increase the likelihood of the stock targeting 560 over the medium term traders can hold the long positions taken at 518 and 512 retain the stop loss at 487 for the target of 555 revise the stop loss to 515 on a rally to 525 the writer is chief research analyst at kshitij

one of the u s government s biggest beefs in its trade war with china is forced technology transfer when an american company or investor wants to do business in china s domestic market beijing requires them to partner with a chinese company inevitably and conveniently for china that means handing over technological know how and trade secrets to the chinese partner but this system s days may be numbered as trade negotiations make headway talking about forced technology transfer in a way that they ve never wanted to talk about before both in terms of scope and specifics one u s official recently told reuters squashing this practice is an obvious win for companies in america and the west more broadly but what if we expanded our view beyond china to the entirety of the developing world

enters the global market and opens itself up to rich foreign investors but what does it have to offer sometimes it s oil minerals or other natural resources but mostly it s low skill labor western investors want those cheap inputs from developing countries so they can better compete against other wealthy americans and europeans in the end products market at the same time if developing countries actually want to raise their living standards they need those advanced end products too so they have to buy them back from the west most developing countries specialize in cheap labor and low value added manufacturing and end up importing high value added content fadhel kaboub an associate professor of economics at denison university and president of the global institute for sustainable prosperity explained to the week but if developing countries export low cost stuff and import high cost stuff they re constantly in danger of falling into trade deficit the overwhelming bulk of international trade is done through u s dollars and since no one can create dollars except the u s government developing nations have to get dollars through exports these trade flows put developing countries at perpetual risk of running short of the dollars they need to buy high end imports inevitably they borrow more dollars to close the gap but those debts have to be paid in dollars too eventually setting off a default crisis the standard fix advised by western economics is austerity the developing country hikes its domestic taxes cuts its domestic spending and increases its domestic interest rates this drives up the value of the developing country s domestic currency so it can buy more dollars and pay off its debt usually with the help of an imf bailout but austerity also crushes the domestic economy leading to mass joblessness and recession the opposite of the initial goal of raising standards of living once the developing nation puts itself through enough agony to pay off its debts it sets about deregulating its labor and environmental rules and its capital controls to attract another round of wealthy foreign investors wash rinse repeat as kaboub explained to get out of this trap and balance their trade flows long term developing countries need to build their own domestic ability to produce the complicated high value products whose import produces a trade deficit in the first place bringing in foreign investors is neither the only way to do that nor the best when foreign investors bring their money to a developing country they already have the advanced stages of the supply chains in place they don t need more instead they want input for the early stages those cheap resources and labor the developing country can provide from a market perspective this is efficient but it also means that to build up its domestic industries a developing country must protect itself from foreign competition and trade flows which requires tightly regulating the fickle interests of foreign investors to quote alice amsden a political economist who wrote a history of industrialization in korea development requires getting prices wrong to put it crudely if a foreign investor helps a developing country advance its own industries the investor creates competitors for itself investors are unlikely to do that willingly so if developing countries are to rely on foreign investment kaboub says they need to ensure investment benefits the people and institutions in the developing country long term investors can t be permitted to come in use the developing country for its cheap resources and labor and leave you have to be selective and set conditions that actually enhance your technological innovation domestically that enhance the transfer of skills and transfer of technology kaboub told the week in other words you have to make sure foreign investors share their know how business models and technological ideas with domestic partners this gets us back to china insisting on technology transfer as the price of entering china s domestic market isn t the only way to ensure this sharing takes place but it s certainly a way to do it more to the point it s a practical policy model other developing countries could emulate whether china itself now the world s second largest economy still needs to rely on forced technology transfer is debatable but lots of other countries do need to build themselves up the way china has it s no coincidence that china a pioneer of forced technology transfer is modern history s biggest success story for raising living standards in the developing world

prime minister abe to postpone again the sales tax increase for october 1 but because the government has enacted other incentives to offset the tax increase the bar to increase it is high the larger

is the most important data point today autos and gas weighed on the headline report in january and excluding them retail sales rose 1 2 rather than retreat after such a heady gain a modest 0 3 rise is expected the same is generally true of the components used for gdp after rising 1 1 in january they are expected to have risen by 0 3 in february on the other hand construction spending which jumped 1

approaching the us navy but the us quietly removed missiles from turkey venezuela is not just about the people suffering there it is also a chip on the great chessboard of geopolitics russia and china

recently the world steel association wsa has revised the october 2018 forecasts of country wise steel consumption and these figures are being formally announced in april 2019 meeting the global demand for finished steel at 1 711 6 mt in 2018 is slated to reach 1 734 mt 1 3 and 1 750 mt in 2020 the volume growth in steel consumption during 2018 was 54 mt and the anticipated growth in consumption for the current year is around 53 mt this growth in global demand would originate largely from the asian region in such a manner that the demand in asia forms 69 of the total global steel consumption in 2019 in asia the revision in china s demand growth has made all the difference it is felt that falling gdp growth in china resulting from consumption led growth as opposed to the investment led one would not decrease steel consumption thus it has been estimated that chinese demand for steel in 2018 has increased by 54 mt from the substantial investment in real estate that has boosted steel demand india has been projected to consume 96 mt of steel in 2018 which would rise up to 102 8 mt in the current year and would grow up to 110 2 mt in 2020 the latest steel demand estimates for india are not much of a revision of the earlier ones made in october 2018 infrastructure growth would continue to remain india s primary driver of demand for the commodity in the next few years slowdown in the pace of construction in roads rail and metro rail connectivity dedicated freight corridors industrial corridors upgradation of existing major airports and the construction of minor ones ports upgradation and mechanisation shipbuilding rural and urban infrastructure real estate etc in the next few months would imply a hindrance to the projected demand volume of steel for a short period and then picking up the pace again this feature has been a regular phenomenon in the economic growth of many countries this only implies that the incremental consumption growth of 14mt of finished steel in the next two years may not follow a uniform pattern of growth this may overshoot if the pace of construction is speeded up after the election process completes indian economy is exhibiting a substantial growth and it is heartening that gross fixed capital formation as a percentage of gdp current prices has moved up to 29 in april december 2018 from 28 7 in the corresponding period of last year india is however facing a wider current account deficit at 16 9 billion at the end of the third quarter of fy19 that stands at 2 6 of gdp though the net foreign direct investment rose to 7 5 billion in q3 the portfolio investment recorded a net outflow of 2 1 billion along with the depletion of foreign exchange reserve in q3 the global financial scenario is uncertain with renewed efforts by the us to cut down its trade deficit with china the stimulus measures in china usa and japan are providing more capital investment for capacity building this is also pushing up exports india needs to monitor its steady import growth steel imports during the first 11 months at 8 03 mt is 2 5 more than the previous year while steel exports during the period at 7 77 mt is much lower at 27 2 compared to the previous year wsa report summarises a country wise assessment of steel intensity of gdp arrived at by dividing the apparent steel usage volume by millions of real gdp in us dollar according to this at an average 59 6 china continues to have the highest steel intensity in gdp other than vietnam a country with poor gdp level and is much above the global average of 20 7 south korea has 34 9 turkey has 31 2 and russia has 29 0 india with average 36 5 steel intensity has to enhance consumption to reap the benefits of higher gdp growth in the coming years based on the estimated demand figures for 2019 and 2020 it has been estimated that per capita steel consumption in india is likely to exceed 75 kg by 2019 this is against the global average of 225 kg and chinese figure of 594 kg the current steel making capacity in the world has been assessed by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd at 2 234 billion tonnes by december 2018 a marginal reduction from the previous year with global crude steel production at 1 818 tonne in 2018 the current capacity utilisation stands at 81 4 which is quite respectable and minimises the adverse implications of excess capacity the oecd estimates also indicate about 88 mt of fresh capacities involving 107 proposals are planned to be activated asian region holds the maximum 61 of the total of these followed by west asia a region in the midst of geo political uncertainty the global steel market is seized with trade uncertainty fuelled by the us china conflict europe is not immune to steel imports diverted from the us market with internal demand showing little signs of upward movement while india needs to enhance its steel exports meeting the domestic demand should be the basic determinant of capacity augmentation efforts views expressed are personal

sovereign debt is a janus faced asset class in the best of times it relaxes the domestic constraint on saving smooths consumption and finances investment investors see it as a safe haven as delivering alpha and as a means of portfolio diversification in the worst of times it is associated with debt overhangs banking collapses exchange rate crises and inflationary explosions in a world still reeling from the global crisis the policy debate has been dominated by the downside risks from excessive debt accumulation be these growth slowdowns panizza and presbitero 2013 financial instability brunnermeier et al 2016 or debt default imf 2013 eichengreen et al 2018 although now there may be renewed appreciation of the uses and scope for accumulating debt blanchard 2019 in a recent paper eichengreen et al 2019 we use history to illuminate both side sides of the story historical evidence helps because defaults on sovereign debt are not as frequent as on say corporate bonds history can enrich our understanding of those features of sovereign debt that are associated with crisis resolution since there are variations over time in the structure of debt contracts their enforceability and costs of default but history also illustrates how governments have used sovereign debt to shape economic and political development it shows how they have used it to build states provide public goods and complete infrastructure projects the long sweep much early borrowing by sovereigns was motivated by the need to secure borders and fight military campaigns foreign military campaigns or the need to repel incursions by foreign troops could overwhelm existing revenue streams the decline of feudal obligations for military service led sovereigns to create armies for hire such as the condottieri of venice florence and genoa these soldiers had to be paid sovereign debt thus developed as a means of state survival stasavage 2011 it enabled the state to finance expenditures of uncertain size and duration the 19th century was a transitional period when governments while still borrowing to prosecute wars issued debt to provide public goods domestic public debt took the turn first with the issuance of bonds to finance education and public works as incomes rose manufacturing developed and cities grew demands arose for clean water sewers and still more extensive public education by the mid 19th century sovereign debt was being used to finance everything from water and sewer works to railroads ports and canals the 20th century then saw sharp increases in debt burdens as a result of major wars but also as a result of recessions banking panics and financial crises as well as public policy responses to these events the late 20th century also saw for the first time a secular increase in public debt to gdp ratios in response to popular demands on governments for pensions health care and other unfunded social services dealing with debt countries have resorted to a variety of expedients to lower their debt burdens from the insidious debasement and inflation to the extreme default and restructuring the prevalence of defaults has had a clear cyclical component figure 1 shows how before wwi the incidence of defaults was concentrated around major financial crises 1826 1873 1890 a pattern repeated in the following centuries figure 1 sovereign default prevalence 1800 1913 in percent sources reinhart and rogoff 2009 and authors calculations notes countries in default refers to the number of independent nations in default in a given year over the total number of independent nations incidence refers to the unconditional probability of new defaults p a but the 18th and 19th centuries also saw governments going to extraordinary lengths to service and repay heavy debts incurred as a result of expensive wars in order to lower their debts relative to gdp countries can do three things generate primary surpluses reduce the real interest rate or grow their economy and debt servicing capacity prior to wwi debt consolidation was mainly achieved by running budget surpluses great britain achieved primary surpluses for the better part of a century and the us for the five decades after the civil war after wwii in contrast the growth rate interest rate differential played a major role in reducing debt ratios the favourable differential reflected both strong growth as a result of reconstruction efforts and successful catch up and negative real interest rates supported by restrictive domestic financial regulations capital controls and persistent inflation as emphasised by reinhart 2012 and shown in figure 2 figure 2 interest growth differential in advanced economies difference in percentage points notes g 20 advanced countries included are australia canada france germany italy the u k and the u s source abbas et al 2014a toward the good equilibrium in part this commitment to responsible debt management and debt reduction in the 19th century reflected the fact that the franchise was not yet universal and that contemporary perceptions of the role of government were different from today it also reflected recognition by decision makers that the maintenance of debt service payments even when difficult could deliver lower borrowing costs in normal times and aid with the mobilisation of resources in the military and economic crises not least it reflected good luck great britain was not confronted with an equally costly war between 1815 and 1914 nor was the us between 1865 and 1917 and no economic slump as deep and long as the great depression of the 1930s occurred grossman and han 1993 as a result governments following this path found were able to issue debt at favourable interest rates long maturities and in their own currencies bordo et al 2003 not all governments were able to implement this good equilibrium however some countries repeatedly defaulted and restructured their debts among advanced economies inflation and financial repression were used to reduce domestic claims on the public sector rendering debt consolidation through a combination of rapid economic growth and budgetary discipline the exception figure 3 g20 advanced economies debt structure shares in percent of total public debt debt ratio in percent notes g20 advanced economies included are australia canada france germany italy japan the u k and the u s ppp gdp weighted averages source abbas et al 2014b the change in debt consolidation strategies also reflected on the structure of debt ownership figure 3 shows how the shares of advanced economy sovereign debt held by central and commercial banks rose in periods of stress when governments leaned on their banking sectors from the mid 1980s however banks reduced their sovereign exposure reflecting portfolio diversification facilitated by capital account liberalisation and regulatory changes under the basel accords this decline coincided with a rise in non resident holdings during the great accumulation period driven partly by the growth of nonbank investment funds but while rising foreign participation can reduce borrowing costs and spread risks more broadly it can also increase external funding risks since foreign holdings are less sticky in a sense these developments mark a return to the prewar world of securitised sovereign debt with ownership dispersed internationally implications for policy this means among other things that financial repression is unlikely to be as effective as after wwii repression in that earlier era relied on tight financial regulation capital controls and limited investment opportunities today a much larger share of advanced economy debt is held by non residents making it more difficult to maintain a captive investor base that accepts debt offering sub market returns in addition regulatory measures compelling banks to hold domestic government debt and then inflate it away could threaten financial stability in the financially competitive low growth environment of the 21st century the value attached to price stability by central banks and retail investors in government bonds in turn limits the political viability of surprise inflation higher inflation would also have indirect costs in the form of a persistent departure from less risky long duration debt governments would be trading off lower short run debt servicing costs for higher costs and heightened volatility in the future thus not only would financial repression be difficult to implement under present circumstances but its negative side effects would persist

earlier this year the armed coalition led by eastern libyan based commander khalifa haftar took most of his country s southwest an oil rich desert expanse three times as large as syria called the fezzan this military operation has fueled speculation as to whether the aging general and former dissident is now considering a similar offensive into tripoli the capital on the mediterranean coast haftar has not recognized the u n backed government of national accord in tripoli its prime minister fayez al serraj and his cabinet coexist with a set of powerful militias there but do not control them although the seizure of the fezzan has bolstered haftar s profile a military takeover of tripoli would be riskier haftar could increase his chances at ultimate victory by asserting greater sway over libya s oil money to understand why this is we need to look at the full picture to include links between libya s petrodollars feuding factions and the foreign states backing them libya s eastern based army moves west the idea of haftar s self proclaimed libyan national army invading the southwest before moving to the much prized capital has been the subject of speculation for more than two years in january things came to a head from northern cyrenaica where he is headquartered the 75 year old field marshal sent reinforcements materiel cash and some of his most senior lieutenants into an airbase located near sebha the fezzan s largest city from there using a combination of peaceful entente deals pecuniary promises and brute force the libyan national army sometimes assisted by darfurian mercenaries proceeded to declare the allegiance of almost all cities in the long neglected province as well as that of its two main oil facilities including the vital sharara field libya s largest haftar s coalition has not however achieved full territorial control in every part of the fezzan after meeting resistance late february in the murzuq basin north of the border with niger many of the eastern libyan battalions moved back north into jufra district in the center of the country leaving a diminished level of security behind including in the city of sebha while not a capitulation the libyan national army s partial withdrawal from the southwest is a reminder that haftar s hybrid tactics peaceful co option mixed with the use of violence consumes a considerable amount of resources not only military but also financial concretely this means that the psychological effect of the fezzan operation may taper off if the libyan national army does not move to take advantage of it soon in tripolitania friends and foes await haftar in tripoli and its wide periphery a tense mosaic of local armed groups could see local flashpoints flare up if haftar is perceived to be progressing some actors have already assured their loyalty to his libyan national army others are undecided and are likely to side with haftar if offered a small concession still others remain resolutely opposed to him and will fight his advance certain cities could slip into internecine violence those most at risk include zawiyah gharyan and sirte qaddafi s hometown in the central region in tripoli proper select militia leaders are poised to suddenly turn pro haftar while their peers don t have that option as a result clashes among neighborhood militias could happen there too given the above a shrewd way for haftar to make headway may be to focus on tripoli s financial institutions while avoiding unnecessary risk taking in the military sphere for the time being the current frenzy on libya s financial frontline including meetings abroad and white collar arrests in tripoli indicates that such a logic may already be afoot indeed the financial heart of the country is the central bank of libya domiciled in the populous capital despite haftar s army holding eastern libya s main oil fields and terminals since 2016 the bank has thus far evaded his control the paradox is a product of muammar qaddafi s legacy as a result of a system put in place under the late dictator all proceeds from legal exports of hydrocarbons are received in u s dollars and funneled straight into accounts held at western financial institutions sadiq al kabir the incumbent governor based in tripoli has held the keys to those hard currency accounts for more than seven years and claims the central bank of libya currently has more than 70 billion of foreign exchange reserves in them the cash that would come with greater influence over the central bank of libya combined with his existing army would offer haftar the ability to coerce and co opt powerful brigades in tripolitania by modulating their access to public funds by the same token without affecting change at the helm of the bank haftar may not be able to seize power and rule what happens next depends to a large extent on what western powers and gulf states agree on when haftar took the fezzan the united states was mum eight years ago the united states led a wide ranging coalition of allied and partner states to intervene in libya s burgeoning rebellion against qaddafi s rule nato members italy and turkey initially dissented but the united states pushed them into line the first weeks of the campaign revealed further disagreement among america s arab friends as to what post qaddafi libya should resemble those fault lines only deepened in 2014 when the country descended into civil war france unlike italy is not affected by irregular migration via libya it is also not nearly as dependent as italy on libya s crude oil natural gas and other products these and other asymmetries explain why rome has been substantially more averse to a military solution to libya s problems than paris the latter sees in libya an opportunity to enhance france s prestige in the arab world in a way that complements its existing sphere of influence in africa in contrast the united states is leery of being dragged into the fratricidal conflict between libyans and does not wish to see libya destabilized or partitioned since the united states helped install the government of national accord in tripoli four years ago it has supported it diplomatically the pentagon has tended to carry out its counterterrorism airstrikes in partnership with that particular government not its eastern rival wary of disruptions washington has issued statements calling for restraint whenever either side has attempted to alter the balance of power by force but this year has been different washington opted for silence as haftar s offensive unfolded the growing retrenchment of the u s government opens a previously obstructed avenue for france last spring president emmanuel macron s diplomatic push for swift elections in libya was resisted by london rome and washington many policymakers in those capitals had seen in paris unilateral rush towards elections a premature ploy to help install a military autocracy headed by haftar faced with much less western dissent on libya this year france applauded haftar s military campaign for eliminating major terrorist targets near sebha and disrupting human traffickers activities in the murzuq desert south of the border in chad paris carried out airstrikes against rebels opposed to president idriss déby after they quit libya a relatively safe haven for non state actors prior to the libyan national army s push the timing and location of the french military intervention suggests tight coordination with haftar whom paris has backed militarily since early 2015 italy usually a haftar skeptic has stayed out of the way rome s new policy embraces the strongman and is in part attributable to the fact that the number of irregular migrants arriving via libya into sicily has become almost zero down from thousands per month two years ago before the drop in migrant statistics the italians resisted haftar because they feared his military approach would disrupt the arrangements they had struck with a motley array of local armed groups in the western half of the country nowadays rome although still issuing token calls for caution fully accepts that the anti islamist camp is winning an eventuality it has been preparing for since 2016 as for italy s substantial energy interests its right wing populist government has utilized its rapport with russia to help ensure they be looked after by the libyan national army moscow too has assisted haftar for more than three years and has his ear also the giuseppe conte government exempted a 1 4 billion subsidiary of libya s sovereign wealth fund from a u n freeze in place since 2011 a move bound to indirectly increase the eastern libyan faction s ability to raise cash through the sales of real estate holdings in italy the united arab emirates a leader among libya meddlers more consequential and more determined than every other foreign state interfering in libya is the united arab emirates the gulf federation has been propping up khalifa haftar militarily since late summer of 2014 a few months after egypt and saudi arabia had helped him and his domestic allies launch operation dignity against revolutionaries moderate proponents of political islam and jihadi salafists alike the emiratis want the muslim brotherhood gone from libya a former western policymaker familiar with both countries told me in january alluding to an ideological war crown prince mohammed bin zayed initiated in his own country on the eve of 2011 s arab uprisings and then expanded abroad the emiratis cannot bear seeing oil money go into the hands of actors who sympathize with political islam the official added choosing to highlight the money aspect rather than the military one to illustrate the emirati rationale international officials often cite a june 2018 incident whereby abu dhabi encouraged haftar as he sought to export libya s oil outside of u n approved channel and france certainly didn t mind him trying adds another western diplomat privy to the libyan file amid haftar s oil blockade last summer the field marshal expressed his desire to see a change of leadership at the central bank not at the national oil company in that instance and several previous others washington thwarted eastern libyan actors in their attempt to force kabir out of the bank or weaken his control over the financial system based in tripoli the united states acted as a bulwark against change partly out of prudence the conflict torn country was dislocated enough as it was the thinking went in washington any abrupt overhaul at one of the libyan economy s most vital linchpins was feared as yet an additional source of anarchy more generally the u s government long championed an inclusive government in tripoli i e it tolerated within the machinery of the libyan state a diverse array of political currents including the muslim brotherhood and its allies a philosophy the united arab emirates has deemed unacceptable soon after becoming president donald trump made clear his unwillingness to continue u s engagement in libya nevertheless both the pentagon and the state department maintained remnants of the obama administration s libya policy including support for the officially recognized authorities in tripoli after the mid term elections in 2018 however an already aloof washington appeared more inclined to farm libya out to the numerous states betting on an ascendant haftar the opinion of the united states is of paramount relevance to libya s finances because of their dollar based and highly centralized nature it is in effect difficult for libyans to replace their central banker unless and until washington approves of it a clear example of this reality was on display four years ago in the autumn of 2014 the eastern libya government which at the time was internationally recognized sacked kabir yet the united states carried on dealing with him and his signature remained the only authorized signature capable of releasing hard currency funds an american businessman familiar with the obama administration s attitude towards libya s economy circa 2015 confided to me kabir would be invited to washington as a mere subordinate of the official governor but once here he was talked to as the real boss washington s unwavering support for kabir has frustrated libya s eastern faction aref ali nayed an electoral hopeful former ambassador to the emirates and vocal critic of the muslim brotherhood described the central bank of libya chief as an islamist facilitating governor the characterization is simplistic and anachronistic but it captures the long standing determination of the eastern libyan camp to take hold of the national purse strings one governor several periods sadiq al kabir did begin his tenure at the helm of central bank of libya as a revolutionary close to the muslim brotherhood in the autumn of 2011 influential brotherhood figure abdurrazag mukhtar abdulgader played a pivotal role making sure the then chairman of the national transitional council mustafa abdel jalil put forward no candidacy other than kabir s to the central banking job that year abdulgader became the libyan ambassador to turkey a position he still holds today according to a u n panel of experts ankara has supported haftar s enemies militarily during the first few post qaddafi years the abovementioned officials and others used the financial system of libya as a means of supporting islamist leaning causes the central bank of libya deposited 2 billion with its egyptian counterpart during muslim brother mohammed morsi s embattled presidency and gave money to the syrian national council an anti assad structure in which the muslim brothers were the strongest component libya s public funds were also used to purchase weapons directly delivered in southern turkey for the purpose of being handed to anti assad rebels next door in libya itself a large number of militias including islamist militias of varying degrees of extremism were formed thanks to the willingness of state authorities including the central bank of libya to pay gunmen civil servant salaries among the groups benefiting from those salaries some formed the shura council in june 2014 to fight the libyan national army in benghazi and others attacked the country s oil terminals in december 2014 that era is over however as of today it would be inaccurate to depict the central bank of libya as an islamist haven or imply the dynamic hasn t changed at all since the immediate wake of the arab uprisings after libya s newly elected parliament and the executive associated with it chose in 2014 to be based in cyrenaica the eastern part of the country the central bank of libya did not discontinue the payment of state salaries and subsidies for the province politically governor kabir felt he had to pay both sides in order to keep the country together opined a turkish diplomat familiar with libyan affairs in a 2016 interview a few months later kabir enforced austerity measures that helped reduce overall public expenditures greatly he also weakened several revolutionary and islamist militias by slashing the funds allocated to them after the u n backed government of national accord arrived in tripoli in march 2016 a specific set of armed groups there have grown stronger by among other things penetrating the process whereby the central bank of libya distributes hard currency despite their fraudulent schemes said militia leaders have received relatively little criticism from the international community because they have provided local security and combated the islamic state those actors aren t connected to the muslim brotherhood in fact the most powerful armed groups in the capital today are committed enemies of political islam and as such have been in dialog with the united arab emirates saudi arabia and france for the last three years at least one of these super militias is radaa or deterrence known for its saudi inspired salafist ideology and fierce opposition to the muslim brotherhood while other tripoli militias dominate their own swath of the black market for dinars and dollars radaa s own currency trading operation is somewhat different members of radaa have sway over how the country s main official issuer of hard currency is run also a radaa commando provides daily personal security for governor kabir in addition meytiga the capital s sole operational airport is in part controlled by the same militia according to informal market operators interviewed last year radaa uses its advantages to convert large sums for haftar aligned actors based in eastern libya sizeable transactions of this kind require the complicity of managers within the official banking system taken in sum the above dynamics paint a far more complex picture of the central bank of libya than the oft peddled image of an institution beholden to the muslim brotherhood or complacent with jihadism to be sure several brotherhood linked figures still hold senior positions in the central bank of libya including on its board of directors moreover kabir refused to allocate additional salary money to help haftar grow his self styled army interviews conducted in 2016 with international monetary fund and world bank officials familiar with libya s state budget confirmed that kabir opposed any increase in the wage bill yet the central banker has also been a pragmatist and an opportunist vis à vis haftar s camp he never forcefully impeded the libyan national army when it resorted to unorthodox often illicit schemes to fund itself these include the eastern executive s issuing of 32 billion dinars worth of debt over the last four and a half years and its importation of 10 billion dinars in the form of russian manufactured banknotes over the last three years in responding to these ventures kabir walked a careful line between protesting their illegality rhetorically and allowing them on a de facto basis in light of this nuance eastern libya s current demonization of kabir must be seen as no more than a calculated attempt by eastern politicians to achieve supremacy over state coffers a scenario that is now a distinct possibility the groundswell of psychological and political momentum wrought by haftar s campaign combined with the passivity of washington one of kabir s longtime backers have thrust the central bank of libya onto new terrain a replacement of the governor or even the mere restructuring of the bank s cadres with kabir staying on terms more favorable to the anti islamist camp backed by the united arab emirates would have far reaching ramifications for the tripoli area haftar s inner circle would become able to curb the rent capturing activities of its adversaries it also would be tempted to cultivate more clients based on political and tribal criteria a practice already manifest in the east domination of public finances would furthermore boost haftar s controversial attempt at militarizing the reconstruction of libya inspired by the egyptian army s outsized role in the economy these trends combined not only fail to curtail corruption but also run the chance of stoking conflict since they are bound to create new sets of losers as washington offloads libya to european and gulf powers its ability to influence the conflict torn country may diminish irreversibly lack of leverage is a policy challenge that faces the european union and its member states too the e u out of eagerness to see a strongman hold libya may let haftar and his faction control the state coffers without checks or balances once that hegemony falls in place what diplomatic tool will remain to help promote transparency accountability and the rule of law in libya jalel harchaoui is a research fellow at the clingendael institute in the hague his work focuses on libya s politics and security image photo from central

kingdom of the netherlands aruba staff concluding statement of the 2019 article iv mission a concluding statement describes the preliminary findings of imf staff at the end of an official staff visit or mission in most cases to a member country missions are undertaken as part of regular usually annual consultations under article iv of the imf s articles of agreement in the context of a request to use imf resources borrow from the imf as part of discussions of staff monitored programs or as part of other staff monitoring of economic developments the authorities have consented to the publication of this statement the views expressed in this statement are those of the imf staff and do not necessarily represent the views of the imf s executive board based on the preliminary findings of this mission staff will prepare a report that subject to management approval will be presented to the imf executive board for discussion and decision economic activity in aruba is slowly recovering and the outlook is broadly positive but risks are skewed to the downside facing a severe deterioration in the fiscal position in the decade since the global financial crisis the authorities have embarked on an ambitious fiscal consolidation plan that pinned down targets for 2019 and the medium term the authorities have made good progress on the fiscal reforms they are encouraged to sustain reform momentum to achieve the targets they have set and to put public debt on a downward path at the same time priorities should include maintaining reserve buffers and safeguarding financial stability removing structural impediments to sustained and inclusive growth and enabling effective policy making by bridging data gaps a gradual improvement in economic activity 1 aruba s economy is slowly recovering following two years of weak growth real gdp expanded by 2 3 percent in 2017 on the back of strong public consumption and buoyant tourism growth with cruise visitors and u s tourist arrivals more than offsetting the effects of falling tourism from venezuela despite increasing tourism growth is estimated to have slowed to 1 2 percent in 2018 largely because of weaker public consumption and a pick up in import growth inflation was in negative territory in 2016 17 but rose to 3 6 percent in 2018 mainly due to increases in the turnover tax rate mid 2018 and oil prices 2 growth is projected at 0 7 percent in 2019 and 1 1 percent over the medium term the fiscal consolidation plan while essential to put debt on a downward trajectory will lower real gdp growth in 2019 this effect will be mitigated by continued strong growth in tourism from the u s and the implementation of multiple large investment projects including the airport utilities hospital and hotels during 2019 21 over the medium term real tourism exports are expected to grow steadily at around 1 2 percent and together with contributions from domestic demand growth is expected to increase to 1 1 percent inflation is projected to fall to 1 7 percent in 2019 as the base effect of the turnover tax rate hike disappears and oil prices decline given the currency peg inflation is expected to follow that of the u s over the medium term and gradually rise towards 2 2 percent 3 risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside aruba is susceptible to a possible downturn in the u s economy risks from the crisis in venezuela have largely materialized over the last few years as bilateral trade saw disruptions and venezuelan tourist arrivals declined sharply nevertheless aruba has managed to absorb the crisis impact by diversifying both suppliers and tourist markets the venezuelan refugee and immigrant influx appears to have been limited so far a worsening crisis that leads to sizable refugee inflows would put pressure on labor markets infrastructure and tourism the planned fiscal consolidation would address important medium term downside risks but could have greater than expected effects on growth in the near term on the upside the implementation of needed structural reforms would boost potential growth albeit a remote possibility a re opening of the refinery would bring associated investments and employment gains maintaining the momentum on fiscal reforms 4 several recessions over the past decade have weighed on aruba s fiscal position the effects of the global financial crisis and the end of oil refining in 2012 depressed activity and increased fiscal deficits and public debt in 2014 the authorities undertook significant entitlement reforms to address the fiscal challenges nonetheless the sustainability of public finances remained a concern in 2018 the authorities focused on crisis management increasing turnover tax rates which helped reduce the fiscal deficit in 2019 they began a longer term effort to reform the tax system and contain the wage bill 5 the team supports the authorities fiscal consolidation efforts the adjustment needs to contain a mix of tax reforms and expenditure rationalization tax reform efforts could follow previous imf advice and emphasize broadening the base and shifting towards indirect taxation expenditure reductions should minimize adverse growth effects and protect essential government services the team emphasized the importance of sustaining the implementation of reforms to achieve the government s medium term fiscal targets it encouraged the authorities to identify and execute a few easy to implement measures first while ensuring that reforms are equitable transparent and well communicated to ensure their durability 6 additional reforms are needed to achieve the authorities targets this is based on the team s assessment of the measures which have already been implemented the mission discussed with the authorities a set of possible options there is scope to increase revenues and efficiency through indirect taxes the introduction of a value added tax could replace the current indirect tax system efforts to improve revenue administration would also yield tangible benefits the efficiency of public spending can be improved the mission recommends that the authorities undertake a comprehensive review of the wage bill to understand its main drivers and to put in place lasting measures that address its structurally high level the authorities need to consider further measures to ensure that the healthcare system azv does not pressure the government s budget given population aging there is a particular need to contain increasing healthcare costs 7 the envisaged fiscal consolidation while sizable is not likely to be a major drag on growth over the medium term empirical work on aruba and other caribbean countries shows medium term fiscal multipliers to be small partly because of their highly open nature attention should be given to ensuring that social safety nets remain effective throughout the adjustment process 8 a robust medium term fiscal framework would bolster policy credibility and ensure durable gains from the adjustment preparing a medium term budget is a step in the right direction but the process would benefit from formalizing a medium term fiscal framework and eventually adopting a formal fiscal rule to safeguard sustainability broadening the coverage of fiscal data beyond the central government would ensure a more complete assessment of the government s impact on the economy and any attendant risks 9 there is a need to coordinate across the government on and codify the strategies for fiscal financing and debt management financing should avoid crowding out private sector credit or unduly pressuring reserves the mission emphasized the importance of an asset liability management framework that would help clarify the desired government debt portfolio capture cost risk tradeoffs provide more predictability to the financial system and reduce macro financial risks preserving reserve buffers and financial stability 10 the banking sector remains sound but credit growth is modest banks enjoy healthy profits have declining non performing loans and maintain elevated levels of capital and liquidity while such levels mitigate financial sector risks they could indicate anemic demand or lack of viable business projects discussions with the authorities and stakeholders suggest that credit outside of large scale tourism projects is difficult to acquire the upcoming results from the financial inclusion survey could shed more light on possible issues and policy solutions 11 international reserves are currently adequate to safeguard the peg but should be increased over the medium term to maintain sufficient coverage and build buffers sustained fiscal consolidation and the implementation of growth enhancing structural reforms as discussed below would support reserve accumulation 12 the monetary policy stance remains appropriate the central bank of aruba cba recently announced an increase in the reserve requirement ratio to 12 percent of deposits effective may 2019 from 11 percent this was to bolster international reserves especially given the central government s decision to finance all of 2019 s borrowing needs domestically the mission sees this move as prudent and does not expect any potential negative effects on activity as banks have excess liquidity going forward further tightening would be warranted if incoming data or expectations point to downward pressures on international reserves unlocking the potential for high and sustained growth 13 aruba should maintain its high end tourism brand while striving to diversify tourism sources the team s empirical analysis shows that tourist arrivals have a positive effect on growth however it also identifies an exhaustion effect pointing to potentially diminishing returns from additional tourists aruba should therefore focus on offering high quality services and physical tourism infrastructure to maximize spending per visitor continued efforts to diversify the tourism base to latin american countries are encouraged 14 the authorities are making efforts to diversify the economy the team welcomes the promising sectors initiative an additional focus on increasing renewable energy use and energy efficiency will bolster competitiveness and the economy s resilience ongoing efforts to expand and modernize the health care system will benefit aruba and could create opportunities for medical tourism 15 there is a pressing need to address structural challenges for the authorities diversification plans to reap dividends aruba will need to address several structural impediments to growth related to the business environment governance and labor markets reforms to improve the business climate need to be reinvigorated the priorities are to remove red tape and reduce the cumbersome procedures associated with starting a business and getting permits and licenses the e government initiative to simplify and speed up the permit granting process is a step in the right direction addressing potential governance vulnerabilities including corruption is paramount the recent cba conducted survey on perceived corruption raises some concerns in october 2018 the government established a bureau of integrity which will become operational during 2019 initially it will focus on corruption prevention awareness and training subsequently it will become a reporting agency the mission encourages the authorities to proceed with their plans to fight corruption by establishing an integrity chamber a corporate governance code and an ombudsman policy should protect the worker not the job and bolster human capital labor market regulations are rigid procedures for terminating employment contracts appear cumbersome and costly creating disincentives for voluntary resignations and hiring thereby impeding labor mobility and job growth policy should promote labor market flexibility and at the same time provide effective protection to workers severance pay could be replaced by an unemployment insurance program additionally there is a need to strengthen vocational training and better align education curricula with private sector job needs closing data gaps to better inform policies 16 bridging data gaps would make policy making more effective the team welcomes the good progress made in revising the national accounts it encourages the authorities to seek imf technical assistance if needed while recognizing limited capacity to make quick progress aruba should aim to be covered in key comparative indicators such as the world bank s doing business and worldwide governance indicators and transparency international corruption perceptions index the mission team is grateful to the authorities and other counterparts for their gracious hospitality and the highly cooperative and candid discussions specifically the cost to real gdp over 4 5 years from higher consumption taxes or lower government consumption of 1 percent of gdp is estimated to be close to zero on impact though the multipliers are estimated to be larger
presentation of the ecb annual report 2018 to the committee on economic and monetary affairs of the european parliament introductory remarks by luis de guindos vice president of the ecb brussels 1 april 2019 mr chairman honourable members of the committee on economic and monetary affairs ladies and gentlemen i am honoured to appear for the first time before this committee in my capacity as ecb vice president and i am delighted to present the ecb annual report for 2018 the annual report is the ecb s main vehicle for discharging its accountability obligations as stipulated in the eu treaties but of course our relationship with the european parliament has long evolved well beyond the treaty requirements as part of this healthy and constructive relationship and in line with what is now well established practice we are today also publishing written feedback on your resolution on our previous annual report among other issues we report the full amounts of profit made through the securities markets programme in response to the resolution s request for the ecb to disclose them in my remarks today i will discuss the monetary policy decisions taken by the ecb in 2018 and their impact on the euro area economy as stated in the annual report ample monetary stimulus is still necessary for inflation to converge to levels that are below but close to 2 over the medium term in this context i will also provide a brief overview of the decisions taken by the ecb s governing council on 7 march this year i will then discuss key issues on the european financial agenda as we approach the end of this parliament s term and the beginning of a new legislative cycle the ecb s monetary policy in 2018 and its impact on the euro area economy our monetary policy measures continued to contribute to very favourable financing conditions supporting the euro area expansion throughout 2018 lending rates for euro area firms and households remained close to their historical lows and growth in bank lending volumes continued the gradual upward trend observed since the beginning of 2014 firms in particular benefited from our purchases of bonds from the non bank corporate sector via the corporate sector purchase programme this programme has made market based financing more affordable for corporations and freed up lending capacity in banks balance sheets which has had a positive impact on credit supply in particular for small and medium sized enterprises while monetary policy supported domestic demand the growth momentum moderated in 2018 for the year as a whole gdp rose by 1 8 compared with 2 4 in 2017 this was mainly due to weaker global trade as well as some temporary factors at both the domestic and global levels one such factor was the transition to new car emissions standards which caused some bottlenecks in the european car production sector measures of underlying inflation remained generally muted throughout 2018 but there was no risk of deflation and inflation was projected to be on a gradual upward path the underlying strength of the domestic economy underpinned by our accommodative monetary policy and tighter labour markets which were pushing up wages supported our confidence that inflation was indeed on its way to converge to levels below but close to 2 over the medium term against this background we decided to end net asset purchases by december 2018 at the same time we moved back to using our policy interest rates and the forward guidance on their likely future path as the principal tool for preserving the ample degree of policy accommodation that was still needed as a result we enhanced our forward guidance on policy rates adding an explicit date based component to the state contingent component this anchors interest rate expectations more firmly in particular the combination of the two components reflected our commitment to provide the accommodation needed to deliver on our mandate of price stability our forward guidance on the key ecb interest rates has been reinforced by our ongoing reinvestments of the sizeable stock of acquired assets these reinvestments will maintain the size of our securities portfolio and together with the forward guidance on the reinvestment horizon continue to support favourable financing conditions the ecb s recent monetary policy decisions in the second half of 2018 the pace of the euro area economic expansion started to moderate more strongly than expected incoming information continued to disappoint in early 2019 suggesting that the moderation would extend into the current year the impact of the temporary domestic factors dampening growth has turned out to be longer lasting than anticipated and the global economy has become less supportive the persistence of uncertainties related in particular to geopolitical factors the threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets has appeared to dent economic sentiment in our latest staff projections the euro area growth outlook for 2019 has been revised down substantially to an annual growth rate of 1 1 the effect of the adverse factors weighing on growth is expected to unwind over time growth is expected to come in at 1 5 in 2021 unchanged from previous projections supportive financing conditions further employment gains and rising wage growth and the ongoing albeit slower expansion in global activity will continue to underpin the euro area expansion nevertheless the weaker growth momentum will leave its mark on domestic price pressures slowing the adjustment of inflation towards our aim underlying inflation continues to be muted and our staff projections see a somewhat slower path for headline inflation which is now foreseen to reach 1 6 at the end of 2021 significant monetary policy accommodation therefore remains essential at our march meeting we decided to adjust the date based leg of our forward guidance by confirming that rates would remain at their current levels at least through the end of 2019 we extended the period of very low interest rates further by minimising expectations of a rate hike before the end of this year of course the second state based leg of our forward guidance continues to provide additional accommodation furthermore we observed that while bank lending conditions remain very favourable the weaker outlook could affect the terms and conditions under which banks extend credit to businesses and households it was therefore essential to preserve bank lending conditions by making sure that the refinancing needs of banks stemming from maturing bank bonds and outstanding targeted longer term refinancing operations tltros would not jeopardise the transmission of monetary policy we therefore launched tltro iii a new series of quarterly refinancing operations starting in september 2019 and ending in march 2021 each with a maturity of two years banks will be entitled to borrow up to 30 of the stock of eligible loans at a rate indexed to the interest rate on the main refinancing operations over the life of each operation like the current tltro programme tltro iii will feature built in incentives for credit conditions to remain favourable for the euro area economy overall the measures taken in march signal our determination to provide the accommodation needed to underpin the economic expansion and ensure that inflation remains on a sustained path towards our inflation aim key issues on the european financial agenda over the course of 2018 the financial stability environment became more challenging which was reflected in systemic stress indicators the ecb annual report highlights the fact that some developments supported financial stability including a continued economic expansion and improved bank resilience however high risk taking activities in some financial market segments reflected generally low risk premia moreover the absence of clarity related to the outcome of the brexit process contributed to higher political and policy uncertainty thanks to the preparations made by public authorities and the private sector a no deal scenario poses manageable risks to overall euro area financial stability however some vulnerabilities remain which could generate more adverse effects if they interact with risks currently affecting the euro area outlook looking back at this legislative term the eu s co legislators have taken important steps in the area of financial regulation which have helped to make the european financial sector more resilient many of the main regulatory reforms prompted by the outbreak of the global financial crisis have now been completed nevertheless european banks cannot yet operate within a truly integrated framework and european citizens and firms cannot yet reap the full benefits of a genuine single banking market further efforts are also needed to develop truly integrated capital markets while at the same time strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework for the non bank financial sector for these reasons completing the banking union and fostering the capital markets union will remain of paramount importance in the new legislative term as discussed in the annual report the ecb continued to provide expertise and technical advice in these areas in 2018 the next few months before the start of the new legislative period provide a perfect opportunity to reflect on the steps that need to be taken to complete the reforms we have undertaken so far a genuine capital markets union and a complete banking union are crucial to the better functioning of economic and monetary union emu more integrated markets would deliver meaningful cross border private risk sharing which is currently lacking in the euro area by comparison with the united states on the institutional side operationalising the common backstop to the single resolution fund and advancing political discussions on a european deposit insurance scheme are essential steps to bolster the resilience and credibility of the banking union the eurosystem is also playing its role as a catalyst for change by fostering the harmonisation of market standards and directly contributing to the removal of barriers to financial market integration in order to facilitate the pan european reach of instant payments the eurosystem launched an innovative service target instant payment settlement tips in november 2018 tips allows individuals and firms to transfer money by settling electronic payments in less than ten seconds but for private risk sharing and market integration to be effective they need to be supported by policies on other fronts fully applying the budgetary rules and coordinating economic policies more effectively remain vital to strengthen the resilience of the euro area and create the confidence among member states that is needed to proceed towards further integration in parallel to this the institutional foundations of emu need to be fortified on the one hand it is important to strengthen the governance and operational capacity of the european stability mechanism while fully respecting eu law this will better protect euro area countries against severe shocks on the other hand establishing a budgetary instrument that supports convergence and competitiveness would help to strengthen the resilience of the euro area as a whole as well as the resilience of each of its member countries conclusions let me conclude as we are approaching the end of this parliamentary term let me take the opportunity to thank this committee for the very constructive relationship our two institutions have established over the past five years these have not been easy times and the public has rightly asked for effective and tangible responses to economic and financial challenges you have played a vital role in relaying those expectations and in ensuring that the ecb s accountability the necessary counterpart of its independence was effectively discharged moreover as co legislators you drafted and adopted the reforms that made it possible to have a stronger union today you know better than i that reform is a continuous endeavour and that the benefits of these efforts are not always easy to communicate still the december eurobarometer showed that support for the euro rose to 75 in 2018 this provides a solid basis on which to build and advance along the path towards a deeper and more complete emu i am now at your disposal for questions

china s manufacturing sector unexpectedly returned to growth for the first time in four months in march in a sign that government stimulus measures may be gaining traction and amid indications of progress in us china trade talks the caixin markit manufacturing purchasing managers index pmi a private business survey released on monday expanded at the strongest pace in eight months in march as it rose to 50 8 from 49 9 in february it was the first time in four months that it rose above the 50 point mark that separates growth from contraction and marks the highest level seen since july 2018 economists polled by reuters had forecast the reading for march would stay unchanged at 49 9 the caixin markit data comes from a separate survey to the official government pmi which was released on sunday government data also showed that both the official manufacturing and non manufacturing pmis for march had beaten forecasts the official manufacturing pmi rose 1 3 points in march to 50 5 while the official non manufacturing pmi gained 0 5 points to 54 8 the improvement in china s manufacturing sector appears to indicate that the government s infrastructure investment stimulus has begun to kick in analysts said earlier this month china announced increased public spending on housing and infrastructure development as well as massive tax cuts to shore up manufacturing and other sectors the government s policies which aim to boost lending to small and medium sized enterprises are apparently bearing fruit although this needs to be borne out by a few more months of data said raymond yeung greater china chief economist at anz business sentiment is also improving on the news that china has reportedly made concessions in trade war talks with the united states on a range of issues including forced technology transfer and intellectual property protection as the two sides work to strike a deal to end their protracted trade war the pickup in the caixin markit data was supported by strong demand from both domestic and external sides according to sub indexes the sub index for new orders climbed to a four month high and the gauge for new export orders also returned to expansion overall with a more relaxed financing environment government efforts to bail out the private sector and positive progress in sino us trade talks the situation across the manufacturing sector recovered in march said zhong zhengsheng director of macroeconomic analysis at cebm group a research organisation affiliated with caixin while fiscal stimulus has been credited with helping boost manufacturing in march analysts are unclear as to whether that marks a real turning point or rather it is purely a result of the injection one part is the additional demand produced by more projects another part is the result of proactive re stocking by companies said li bei founder of shanghai banxia investment management both the parts are unsustainable and in the future will drop again the overall economy will go down again as well china s economy slowed to its lowest growth point for almost 30 years in the midst of a deleveraging campaign that looked to remove debt from the economy however the government has reversed tack in a bid to boost sluggish demand looking ahead there is now a decent chance that growth in china may bottom out slightly earlier than we had previously anticipated said julian evans pritchard senior china economist at capital economics that said we still think growth could weaken again in the near term the recent trajectory of credit growth still points to a slowdown in the coming months analysts expect more stimulus measures over the next few months since the capital released by previous measures has already dried up and industrial profits in china are declining ming ming head of fixed income research at citic securities in beijing said the chinese central bank was likely to cut the reserve requirement ratio again in april in an effort to fill the liquidity gap the state council china s cabinet said on sunday that the country continue to suspend additional tariffs on us cars and parts after april 1 after the world s largest two economies said to have made progress in the trade talk last week chinese vice premier liu he will head to washington this week for another round of negotiations with us trade officials following last week s negotiations in beijing source south china morning post

oppenheimerfund s director of emerging market equities justin leverenz shares his view on china s economy oppenheimerfunds justin leverenz director of emerging market equities sits down for a q a to discuss the implications of chinese slowdown on emerging markets are you concerned about a slowdown in china the slowdown in china has been the main culprit for the recent market panic but against the backdrop of economic challenges and ongoing trade conflicts china s circumstances are manageable its transition toward a service oriented consumer economy is creating concerns due to the resulting growth deceleration but it is a necessary step for achieving sustainable levels of growth looking forward any stimulus in china will proceed in dribs and drabs but the credit taps are unlikely to be opened as wide as they were in past slowdowns since that would go against the country s need to rebalance the economy and clean up the financial sector rather china might implement reforms focused on redistribution of wealth and resources within the economy targeting the hundreds of millions of people in urban areas living without access to healthcare and education even at a slower 5 pace over the long term china will still account for 30 40 of global gdp growth making it the world s single largest growth engine behind the united states however the future drivers in china are going to be quite different from those of the past 30 years just a decade ago china was running a nearly 10 current account surplus relative to gdp a number that is now closer to zero this externally fueled supernormal growth is largely evaporating private sector companies are now the major employers in the economy in 2017 china created one third of new unicorns globally and 7 of the top 10 in terms of valuation these companies will continue to grow in importance and many are likely to generate strong returns for opportunistic investors after a significant market correction do you believe fragilities in the emerging market landscape may be exaggerated sentiment has turned excessively bearish as investors fled emerging markets but we believe the emerging market fragility is overrated for many reasons current account imbalances across countries have narrowed overall since their pre financial crisis peak china with its exporting prowess has long been considered a leading culprit in generating these global economic imbalances but has now essentially rebalanced its economy away from exports toward domestic consumption in a remarkable way that doesn t get media coverage indeed it has recorded its first quarterly current account deficit in nearly 17 years we also believe that turkey and argentina are anomalies inflationary pressures have subsided across emerging markets the problems in places like argentina and turkey are not representative of other emerging market countries as most do not have significant structural funding problems like argentina and turkey do while turkey may need a massive recession for several years to pare its debt and deal with its fiscal imbalances we don t foresee a contagion effect the risk is just not there in terms of foreign debt current account deficits or an overheating economy what we are experiencing is a u s dollar versus the world circumstance rather than just vs the emerging markets can emerging markets take the lead on technology the emerging world has largely become an incubation center for powerful themes such as technology over the past 5 10 years technology has had a profound effect on economies across the globe but the impact is felt most in the emerging markets the lack of development in the physical world allowed for a leapfrog effect directly to the virtual world in areas like internet search e commerce and financial services this is a unique circumstance that supports massive scale in certain technologies there is also a wealth of talented tech professionals much of them located in china that will enable emerging market companies to develop new areas like artificial intelligence and machine learning the economy is slowing today because the historic growth engines of investments and exports are fading but the consumer is taking up the baton despite current economic weakness this trend will inevitably bring exciting opportunities for investors as real options emerge from sectors outside of the traditional exporters selling cement steel or commodities sectors and companies with nuance and differentiated options will emerge another legacy issue being resolved in china is the misallocation of capital caused by a decades long real estate boom overdevelopment of the real estate sector has long inhibited private investment with the ongoing deleveraging measures credit tightening and curbs on speculative property purchases we are seeing a transformational shift of capital allocation out of real estate and a boost in the vitality of private investment that promotes real economic growth in addition china has fiscal capacity like no other nation on earth a low fiscal deficit relative to gdp and huge reserves of assets to bail out banks if needed china has achieved a level of urbanization in four decades that the west took two centuries to accomplish but the economic restructuring in china is not yet complete we are optimistic that further structural changes including soe and supply side reform will transform traditional industries and reinvigorate the economic system through earnings growth improvement what does the future hold we believe china will be fine as the country transitions toward slower but more sustainable growth while still contributing 30 to 40 to worldwide growth the emergence of u s growth challenges will largely alleviate the worries about dollar strength and rate hikes and with big swings in structural reforms across emerging market be it more prudent macroeconomic efforts deregulation and privatization aimed at productivity enhancement or social reforms focusing on boosting social mobility and reducing dual track challenges in growth big leapfrog opportunities emerge we are most optimistic about the emerging markets for their

morocco s industrial policy is unquestionably one of the most important issues currently facing the public authorities given its impact in economic financial and social terms reflecting on its future the various threats undermining it the serious shortcomings plaguing it and its very future itself in light of a series of recent events is therefore a priority which needs to be rapidly resolved if it is to be given the best possible chance of success indeed faced with the hollowing out of our country s industrial landscape over the last decade which has result in the loss of tens of thousands of jobs we urgently need to consider a number of key factors if we are to provide a pragmatic response to the challenge of unemployment especially among youngsters donald trump a champion of protectionism first there is an evident need to strongly promote and orient investment towards industrial projects that provide jobs and ensure a degree of self sustainability in meeting the country s needs with a view to reducing the country s trade deficit but there is also a need to preserve at all costs what already exists that is to say the existing industrial units that are struggling hard to survive and thrive in an international environment that has become deeply hostile this is characterised in particular by highly developed dumping practices as well as the policy of safeguarding national interests by major industrial powerhouses which to a certain extent have revived interest in a form of protectionism despite the wto s directives and recommendations a number of industries are now impacted even threatened by these latest developments particularly the steel industry which is the subject of a fierce war waged by major producers as well as by a number of states and their leaders one of the most telling examples is unquestionably that of the united states as typified by president trump s actions aimed at blocking entry into his country of steel produced in china russia turkey ukraine latin america or anywhere else these producers which have been denied access to the us market are shifting their attention to other regions and countries and are increasingly resorting to dumping measures targeting those that are perceived as being the weakest these countries like their large counterparts therefore need to preserve their existing units and ensure that local production is to a certain extent protected as provide for by the wto policy s general safeguard and anti dumping provisions it is well known that the steel market is a global industry but the growth dynamics in terms of global demand and the pace at which new capacity is being installed make it highly cyclical since the beginning of the decade however the sector has experienced significant overcapacity and many analysts do not envisage a return to equilibrium before 2025 given that the steel industry is considered strategic for industrialised countries the latter began to adopt as early as 2012 an arsenal of trade defence measures making it by far the most protected sector in the world and low cost producers engaging in dumping practices have seen the major markets in america and europe shut their doors to their exports in addition major industrialised countries have exerted strong pressure on china obliging it since 2015 to embark on a closure programme for many steel mills and while steel together with aluminium was the first product to incur additional duties imposed by the trump administration the european union has acted similarly by imposing provisional safeguard measures on a wide range of steel products and in both cases the additional 25 duty came on top of the previous protectionist measures such is the international backdrop against which morocco s public policy needs to be analysed a policy which aims to protect domestic steel production in all its forms morocco s open door policy given what is happening internationally it is abundantly clear that morocco currently has one of the most liberal lax policies when it comes to protecting its domestic production as well as being one of the least protected countries within the region among those with steel production capacity in fact for hot rolled steel for example only european and turkish steel incurs an anti dumping duty of 11 imports from other countries which have a free trade agreement with morocco are exempt all duties as a result us exports to morocco are exempt while moroccan exports to the us incur duties of 25 imports from other countries incur a 10 charge under the common customs tariff system as a result a suitably low cost ukrainian exporter will see its cargo taxed at the rate of 10 in morocco versus 25 in the us 77 in canada 25 15 in mexico eur 60 25 in europe and 20 in iran its russian counterpart equally low cost will see its cargo taxed at the following rates depending on the destination morocco 10 us 25 74 185 mexico 21 15 europe eur 96 25 thailand 128 iran 20 south africa 20 india 10 minimum price incurred for a chinese exporter of cold rolled steel the following rates apply morocco 16 us 25 266 256 canada 92 12 mexico 15 66 103 europe 25 20 it must be understood however that given these rates and international market prices there is no gain to be had from morocco protecting an obsolete steel sector with production units below international industry standards indeed the steel industry is a heavy industry requiring a high level of mastery when it comes to production processes as a result to achieve the best possible results the industry needs to invest in people leverage its know how and adopt rigorous production systems today morocco can take pride in having industrial flagships that have progressed rapidly along the learning curve while improving performance in line with international standards for example at one of maghreb steel s sites processing costs fell by 20 40 at constant prices between 2014 and 2018 for its various lines furthermore at sonasid s and maghreb steel s steel mills consumption ratios for the main consumables are lower than the international average we re not suggesting protecting an underperforming industry or adopting a rent seeking approach but rather preserving the kingdom s national interests its industrial fabric and the jobs that it generates mention could be made for example of maghreb steel whose past difficulties are well documented for more than three years the steel maker has been implementing a business recovery plan which has involved restructuring its production facilities with the government s support it has also enjoyed a moratorium on its high levels of debt from a number of local banks as part of this rescue operation maghreb steel has recruited more than 400 executives and engineers their jobs and those of other group employees would be under threat if the public authorities which have until now turned a deaf ear to pressure from local lobbies were to endorse the pro dumping measures of importers partnering low cost producers from central europe or russia it must also be clearly recognised that despite its industrial performance the domestic steel industry remains fragile and is penalised by the country s limited domestic market in this industry economies of scale are needed to ensure a return on assets similar safeguard measures to those adopted by other industrialised countries within the region regarding processed products would allow producers to focus their efforts on their main challenge which is to expand their market and promote steel usage like the other countries that preceded morocco in adopting a successful development model focusing on national interests developing the country s industrial fabric and its steel industry is something which must be done in parallel with a long term vision government support and the disqualification of unfair competition because no country has industrialised without having a strong iron and steel industry neither more nor less than the others morocco s development model must incorporate its industrial sector if it is to escape the middle income trap and as mentioned above the stakes are enormous in terms of jobs value added and the trade balance not to mention the social impact and the contribution to economic development from having a strong middle class with a knock on effect on other productive sectors that is why protectionist mechanisms as permitted by the wto must be maintained to give sufficient time to emerging industries to improve their cost structures and their productivity to be able to build a genuine industrial base as has been done by every developed country in the past contrary to the allegations and posturing by a handful of importers of steel products which have only their own narrow interests in mind and which demand an end to the safeguard measures for steel the government must continue to provide provisional and temporary protection this must be the sole criterion which should be legitimately considered when it comes to the domestic steel sector s sustainability as the basis for a global and national industrial development model the effective protection that sonasid has enjoyed in its speciality segment that of long steel should continue to be implemented for maghreb steel s flat steel segment so that the nation s steel production is sheltered from international predators which know only too well how to activate their local networks at the risk of jeopardising the nation s successful industrial

u s retail sales unexpectedly fell in february but a rebound in factory activity in march and strong increase in construction spending offered hope the economy was not slowing as sharply as previously feared the mixed reports on monday prompted economists to raise their growth projections for the first quarter still the economy s improving prospects were not expected to have any impact on the federal reserve s decision last month to abruptly end its three year campaign to tighten monetary policy the u s central bank abandoned projections for any interest rate hikes this year after increasing borrowing costs four times in 2018 acknowledging rising headwinds including a fading stimulus from 1 5 trillion in tax cuts trade wars slowing global growth and uncertainty over britain s exit from the european union the economic downslide may be over but there are no clear indications that an acceleration in growth is at hand said joel naroff chief economist at naroff economic advisors in holland pennsylvania the fed has reason to watch and wait retail sales dropped 0 2 per cent as households cut back on purchases of furniture clothing food and electronics and appliances as well as building materials and gardening equipment but january s sales increase was revised up to 0 7 per cent from the previously reported 0 2 per cent economists polled by reuters had forecast retail sales rising 0 3 per cent in february retail sales in february advanced 2 2 per cent from a year ago the surprise drop in sales in february could partly reflect delays in processing tax refunds in the middle of the month tax refunds have also been smaller on average compared to prior years following the revamping of the tax code in january 2018 cold and snowy weather could also have hurt sales excluding automobiles gasoline building materials and food services retail sales fell 0 2 per cent in february after an upwardly revised 1 7 per cent surge in january these so called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product they were previously reported to have rebounded 1 1 per cent in january consumer spending accounts for more than two thirds of economic activity while the upward revision to core retail sales did not reverse december s 2 2 per cent plunge it put consumer spending for the first quarter on a slightly higher growth trajectory than before there was a further boost to first quarter gdp prospects with a second report from the commerce department showing construction spending rose 1 0 per cent to a nine month high in february after surging 2 5 per cent in january a third report from the department showed business inventories increased 0 8 per cent in january matching december s gain though the strong inventory build suggests demand is slowing it lifted gdp forecasts for the first quarter manufacturing stabilizing consumption however is likely to remain weak and the inventory build is getting ominous said chris low chief economist at ftn financial in new york goldman sachs raised its first quarter gdp estimate by four tenths of a percentage point to a 1 2 per cent annualized rate the economy grew at a 2 2 per cent rate in the october december quarter the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies while u s treasury prices fell stocks on wall street were trading

reading of 55 3 in march from 54 2 in february which had marked the lowest level since november 2016 the reading was slightly above expectations of 54 5 from a reuters poll of 69 economists a reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector which accounts for about 12 per cent of the u s economy the ism said 16 industries including machinery computer and electronic products furniture and electrical equipment appliances and components reported growth last month apparel and paper products industries reported a contraction manufactures in the computer and electronic products industry said the sector seems to be slowly coming out of crisis mode chemical producers said brexit continues to be a concern despite the fact that our organization has already rolled out a plan to minimize its impact the ism s new orders sub index increased to a reading of 57 4 last month from 55 5 in february but a measure of export orders fell likely reflecting softening global economic growth factories reported hiring more workers last month with a measure of manufacturing employment racing to a reading of 57 5 from 52 3 in february that bodes well for a rebound in job growth in march after hiring almost stalled in february march s employment report is scheduled for release on friday overall we think that things are stabilizing following the earlier deterioration

via russia insider by tyler durden nine months ago as us treasury yields were drifting lower from a seven year high reached in may of last year we pointed out a curious development in the market for us sovereign debt that to our complete lack of surprise had been overlooked by the mainstream financial press in april and may russia s central bank liquidated 81 billion in treasurys nearly its entire holdings the drop was so significant that russia fell off the treasurys list of the 30 or so largest treasury holders and in the months that have followed as the us has imposed more economic sanctions and feuded with putin over the fate of venezuelan leader nicolas maduro vladimir putin has turned instead to alternative reserves as the country s de dollarization push continued over the same period of time russia was a conspicuously large buyer of chinese yuan as goldman sachs noted and as we highlighted well earlier today helping contribute to a spike in yuan buying by reserve managers last year as the imf pointed out in a recent report but given the yuan s still limited convertibility it has its limitations as a reliable reserve for foreign central banks which is probably why moscow has relied on another reserve option that s popularity has endured for most of the history of human civilization gold data from the russian central bank cited by bloomberg show that its gold reserves have nearly quadrupled over the past ten years and that 2018 marked the most ambitious year yet for russia gold buying which coincided with the central bank of russia s mass dumping of its treasury holdings and in a rare if muted acknowledgement from the american financial press that de dollarization is a contemporary threat that should be taken seriously bbg said that analysts who have coined the term de dollarization speculate about the global economic impacts if more countries adopt a similar philosophy and what it could mean for the dollar s desirability compared with other assets such as gold or the chinese yuan while russia s dependence on exporting commodities like gold means it must continue to depend at least in part on the greenback three quarters of russia s 600 billion of trade is conducted in dollars per bbg this voracious gold buying is setting an example for other countries in the west as well as in the east last year russia s gold buying outstripped its gold production for the first time and as relations with the us continue to deteriorate as longstanding arms control treaties are torn up and belligerent rhetoric spouted by both trump and putin the russian central bank might start importing more gold which could have a positive impact on the global price per two analysts russia has ingle handedly put a floor under the price of gold though some suspect that since the cbr is now a known quantity in international gold markets it would need to markedly accelerate its purchases to have a material impact on the price though few expect russia to stop buying now central bank buying has helped strengthen gold from a weak hand to a strong hand and supported gold prices in recent years according to ronald peter stoeferle managing partner at liechtenstein based asset manager incrementum ag bullion has risen more than 20 percent since the start of 2016 it traded up 0 5 percent at 1 297 15 per ounce at 12 40 p m in london if it wasn t for russia s central bank last year would have been the worst year for gold buying in a decade so it helped put a floor on the price said adrian ash head of research at gold brokerage bullionvault ltd however russian buying is now well known so it would take a significant increase in their purchases to materially impact the gold price but perhaps the most notable aspect of putin s rhetoric about de dollarization is how it s apparently influencing leaders of states that are still at least nominally friendly toward the us french president emmanuel macron said in an interview late last year that europe is too dependent on the greenback declaring it an issue of sovereignty this from one of the most ardently pro eu politicians on the continent and last year poland and hungary surprised the market by making the first substantial purchases of gold by eu member states in more than a decade so the next time you hear an analyst on cnbc categorically dismiss the notion that the loss of the dollar s reserve currency status isn t something that markets should take seriously even as several credible voices have warned that it should be you d do well to remember this chart nothing lasts forever

by lucia mutikani washington reuters u s retail sales unexpectedly fell in february but a rebound in factory activity in march and strong increase in construction spending offered hope the economy was not slowing as sharply as previously feared the mixed reports on monday prompted economists to raise their growth projections for the first quarter still the economy s improving prospects were not expected to have any impact on the federal reserve s decision last month to abruptly end its three year campaign to tighten monetary policy the u s central bank abandoned projections for any interest rate hikes this year after increasing borrowing costs four times in 2018 acknowledging rising headwinds including a fading stimulus from 1 5 trillion in tax cuts trade wars slowing global growth and uncertainty over britain s exit from the european union the economic downslide may be over but there are no clear indications that an acceleration in growth is at hand said joel naroff chief economist at naroff economic advisors in holland pennsylvania the fed has reason to watch and wait retail sales dropped 0 2 percent as households cut back on purchases of furniture clothing food and electronics and appliances as well as building materials and gardening equipment but january s sales increase was revised up to 0 7 percent from the previously reported 0 2 percent economists polled by reuters had forecast retail sales rising 0 3 percent in february retail sales in february advanced 2 2 percent from a year ago the surprise drop in sales in february could partly reflect delays in processing tax refunds in the middle of the month tax refunds have also been smaller on average compared to prior years following the revamping of the tax code in january 2018 cold and snowy weather could also have hurt sales excluding automobiles gasoline building materials and food services retail sales fell 0 2 percent in february after an upwardly revised 1 7 percent surge in january these so called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product they were previously reported to have rebounded 1 1 percent in january consumer spending accounts for more than two thirds of economic activity while the upward revision to core retail sales did not reverse december s 2 2 percent plunge it put consumer spending for the first quarter on a slightly higher growth trajectory than before there was a further boost to first quarter gdp prospects with a second report from the commerce department showing construction spending rose 1 0 percent to a nine month high in february after surging 2 5 percent in january a third report from the department showed business inventories increased 0 8 percent in january matching december s gain though the strong inventory build suggests demand is slowing it lifted gdp forecasts for the first quarter manufacturing stabilizing consumption however is likely to remain weak and the inventory build is getting ominous said chris low chief economist at ftn financial in new york goldman sachs raised its first quarter gdp estimate by four tenths of a percentage point to a 1 2 percent annualized rate the economy grew at a 2 2 percent rate in the october december quarter the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies while u s treasury prices fell stocks on wall street were trading

reading of 55 3 in march from 54 2 in february which had marked the lowest level since november 2016 the reading was slightly above expectations of 54 5 from a reuters poll of 69 economists a reading

furniture and electrical equipment appliances and components reported growth last month apparel and paper products industries reported a contraction manufactures in the computer and electronic products industry said the sector seems to be slowly coming out of crisis mode chemical producers said brexit continues to be a concern despite the fact that our organization has already rolled out a

economic growth factories reported hiring more workers last month with a measure of manufacturing employment racing to a reading of 57 5 from 52 3 in february that bodes well for a rebound in job

by rose hoban medicaid expansion has the potential to add thousands of health care jobs to the north carolina landscape expand opportunities for care to hundreds of thousands of north carolinians and bolster the fortunes of smaller rural hospitals while at first providers might be strained by the addition of these new patients to the health care system according to a review of six years of data and interviews with officials from states across the country that have already expanded the program most health care systems were flexible enough to meet these additional demands and were also left on stronger financial footing the facts are that we re running a 3 billion surplus with covering 600 000 people and we ve reduced the growth in medicaid said former ohio governor john kasich who was in raleigh last week to speak at an event convened by the nc rural center when pressed further about purported problems with the medicaid expansion he pushed through in 2015 while governor he retorted so then why is ohio doing so well in recent weeks nc health news looked at dozens of medical and economic studies and spoke to officials providers and academics in primarily republican led states that chose to expand medicaid the data are overwhelming in states that have expanded the move has been a boon both for the health of patients the strength of local economies bolstered by thousands of new health care jobs and increased stability in particular for rural hospitals that have been buffeted by changes rocking the health care system there s more data that s showing a link to employment overall better economic conditions said hemi tewarson director of the health division at the national governors association there have been studies done that show rural hospitals have done better in expansion states compared to non expansion states primarily because they have another stream of reimbursement that has kept them more stable and while many of the 36 states as well as the district of columbia have had challenges implementing all the changes created by medicaid expansion according to tewarson we haven t seen any state reverse its position partly that s because of an enhanced payment rate from the federal government medicaid is paid for by a mix of state and federal funds north carolina receives about 66 cents from federal coffers for every dollar spent on regular medicaid patients but for any patients qualifying for the program under the expansion the federal government will be covering 90 cents of each dollar spent at first strain it was about a half million dollars a year in uncompensated care that we were providing from seeing so many uninsured patients said jill marie steeley head of pureview health center a community health center in montana s capital helena as well as in rural lincoln 60 miles away we were already seeing them she said we just weren t getting paid for them many of steeley s patients are the people who have fallen into the so called coverage gap created by the affordable care act and the lawsuits that subsequently altered the law initially the aca mandated that all states cover people who made too much for medicaid up to about 135 percent of the u s federal poverty level about 33 500 for a family of four which includes many low income workers such as farmers ranchers and others whose employers do not provide insurance at that point people became eligible for large subsidies to buy health insurance on federal exchanges but a 2012 supreme court decision upended those plans instead making the mandatory expansion voluntary thus leaving the decision of whether to cover millions of low income workers up to individual states steeley recounted that when montana passed its medicaid expansion in january 2016 her clinic initially saw a surge something that s typical according to greg tung a health economist from the university of colorado it does further strain the system tung said frequently the state s medicaid system is not able to expand as quickly as the number of people who are enrolled but in many cases the money that follows those new patients helps deal with the problem we saw an immediate shift in our revenue because of now having a payor for those patients who didn t have one before steeley said i think over the last two years we ve seen a steady flow of new medicaid patients finally being able to access services last year steeley said she had 1 800 patients added to an existing patient population of about 5 200 but only about a third of them were the new medicaid patients so steeley did what businesses do when facing more demand she hired more people we monitor our wait times very closely and we know that when they get too far out we know we need to add a provider so we ve been successful in doubling in size she said because her patients have been doing better too steeley s been getting grants to bring more people into her clinics in the past year her experience mirrors the findings of researchers from boston and iowa who looked at rural community health clinics in expansion states and found changes in quality and volume were consistently observed in rural in expansion states which had relative improvements in asthma treatment body mass index screening and follow up and hypertension control those researchers concluded that expansion may be particularly important to rural patients who have access to fewer primary care providers and may serve as a mechanism for reducing disparities that persist between urban and rural regions unintended consequences for rural hospitals initially maggie elehwany had high hopes for the aca as the vice president for governmental affairs for the national rural health association she saw the law as helping stabilize the providers she represents in washington d c she explained that prior to the aca congress had passed a bill cutting the amount of bad debt that hospitals could write off on their taxes it sort of made sense at the time because congress was saying hey hospitals guess what we ve got great news for you you re gonna have all paying customers they re gonna have to have to buy insurance or they ll get medicaid expansion so you won t have any more bad debt elehwany said so her people supported that tax bill but that same 2012 supreme court ruling upended everything in the aftermath when some states didn t expand medicaid rural hospitals faced a double whammy they still had lots of non paying patients and no way to write it off what we re seeing is there s this weird magnification for rural hospitals and seeing these closures escalate especially in non expansion states elehwany said tung who spends a lot of his time thinking about rural hospitals confirmed elehwany s overall impression our analysis is based off of data and real hospital financing and closure data tung said clearly in states that have not expanded medicaid their hospital closure rates are significantly higher than in states that have expanded medicaid both tung and elehwany went further noting that these closures hamstring surrounding communities they pointed to research showing that when a rural hospital closes per capita income in the surrounding county drops the unemployment rate rises and the poverty rate climbs elehwany said that she s worried about north carolina s rural hospitals referencing an internal non public analysis of rural hospital finances elehwany said she could see multiple hospitals operating with negative margins one that was 13 2 percent in the hole who can survive with that she asked in contrast steeley said that once montana expanded medicaid the rural providers she knew had more financial stability which i think is why the republicans support it because they have to go back to those small communities and if they vote on something that s going to bring down their hospital they re not going to get elected again she said having your finances protected in contrast to the economic malaise generated by rural hospital closures an economic analysis done by researchers at columbia university found that because of additional medicaid coverage the country s overall poverty rate both rural and urban dropped just under one percentage point of the population or almost 700 000 people were lifted out of poverty as a result of attaining coverage said researcher naomi zewde and what we also found that it was among those groups that were eligible for the aca the effect was concentrated among them she said a large part of the poverty relief came from people being able to save because they weren t paying so much out of pocket for care also zewde said people benefited by having their finances protected in the event of a medical catastrophe financial protection plus access to health services was important she said in addition it appears that being able to address health problems helped people get jobs if they weren t already working montana case study in january 2016 montana expanded medicaid to residents earning less than 137 percent of the federal poverty level more than 96 000 have enrolled to date with the federal government paying 100 percent of the cost phasing down to 90 percent of the cost in 2020 and beyond all but the lowest income enrollees have some cost sharing in the form of premiums and copays according to health consulting firm manatt which evaluated the program for the state savings to date have exceeded 36 million reduced uncompensated care to the state s hospitals by about 100 million and allowed montana s rate of uninsured to be reduced to half of it s 2013 rate research from the kaiser family foundation found that about 6 in 10 people in the medicaid expansion populations across the country were already in the workforce while 3 in 10 of new medicaid enrollees were exempted because of caregiving disability going to school or being in drug treatment tanya theriault a nurse practitioner working in new orleans said these are her patients they have a couple of different jobs like uber or lyft they re retail and food service and they re all part time bartenders you know this city loves its bartenders and bars are not famous for their benefits she said everything that makes the tourism industry run a legislatively mandated study commissioned in ohio link to methods here found that new medicaid recipients reported having an easier time paying for groceries housing and being able to pay down debt than before receiving medicaid benefits and almost nine in 10 reported that having medicaid made it easier to keep working former ohio governor john kasich was upbeat about what the program has done for workers in his state if you want people to work they ve got to be healthy kasich said i think it s a system that has been very very effective and efficient in montana legislators forged a path for helping out of work adults eligible for expansion coverage find work by creating help link a job services program that connects expansion enrollees with workforce training employment services and job openings since 2016 help link helped more than three quarters of people using it find work out of 96 000 expansion enrollees montana had only 4 percent or 3 600 people who were not able to find work or who were exempted from work requirements many of those folks looked for work in the health care sector which had stronger employment growth than other industries swelling by 15 3 percent compared to the state s overall job growth of 6 9 percent in 2016 17 in addition a number of states louisiana colorado kentucky michigan and pennsylvania all studied what happened in the wake of expansion and also found that medicaid expansion added jobs to their economies research confirmed in practice the kaiser family foundation s offices in downtown washington d c have the look of a high priced attorney s offices with wood paneling and recessed lighting but much of the analysis conducted there focuses on some of the poorest americans and kff has tracked the progress of the affordable care act closely our mission is to put out information and analysis to inform the debate and we let the data speak for itself said rachel garfield a senior researcher there we don t have any particular position on what a state should or shouldn t do last year garfield helped compile a literature review of the effects studied in the wake of the aca that consisted of more than 200 peer reviewed journal articles there have been other types of studies that have been put out by advocacy groups or people with a particular interest we excluded those from our review of the literature garfield said that in her research the studies on health effects have been mixed with some studies showing a big effect on health outcomes while others showed a weaker correlation some of those health effects take time to show up she said so having blood pressure under control as a result of being in regular care that you re in as a result of getting health insurance coverage there s many steps along that pathway that has to happen and that can take time to show up a thousand miles away from garfield s comfortable washington office nurse practitioner tanya theriault says she doesn t need research to see the difference in health outcomes her practice is in the daughters of charity clinic tucked under a highway causeway next to the railroad tracks in metarie a suburb of new orleans she recounted the story of one of her many low income patients from the neighborhood a mechanic with asthma who used the emergency room as his primary care just like other chronic conditions if you leave asthma sort of always coming to crisis then you deal with this constant inflammatory state and a near critical experience every time she explained for him it was that he really couldn t afford the visits he d get a couple of inhalers from the er and every time they d say you really should see a primary care person and he was not going to be able to do that once he got insurance through expansion he started coming to her clinic pretty regularly he saw me for the first year or two after he got medicaid but then he could find a place that was closer to him she said once he had medicaid other places would take him in a much touted instance before implementation of the aca oregon randomly assigned 30 000 additional people to their medicaid program and 45 000 others missed out all of them were studied oregon experiment authors concluded this randomized controlled study showed that medicaid coverage generated no significant improvements in measured physical health outcomes in the first 2 years but it did increase use of health care services raised rates of diabetes detection and management lowered rates of depression and reduced financial strain on patients theriault said that rings true for her sometimes the weight of years of untreated disease makes it difficult for people to improve once they do get care she recalled the story of one of her diabetes patients she s in her early 40s and she s going to be on dialysis she said in the two years that i ve seen her her diabetes has been great but before that it was terrible and you know the damage is already done is what her nephrologist recently said to her the good news for that patient is that among kidney disease patients who started renal dialysis researchers writing in the journal of the american medical association found the aca medicaid expansion was associated with significant improvements in 1 year survival but once a patient is on dialysis the cost is covered by a different government funded program and patients find it hard to work because the treatment is three days a week for most of the day she s got young kids she s got a job she s got to find a way to live around this very time consuming now critical procedure theriault said after the state expanded louisiana s department of health created an online dashboard to track how much care has been delivered to newly eligible medicaid recipients one of the metrics cited is 13 154 newly diagnosed and treated cases of diabetes the dashboard also tracks rates of breast and colon cancer screenings and the number of people who ve been able to start treatment for addiction all this jives with what researchers publishing in the policy journal health affairs found about the same type of preventative care for rural patients with more people checking their blood sugars and having annual checkups other research has found that expansion states are seeing fewer critically ill patients end up in intensive care compared to non expansion states because critical illness may be less susceptible to patient and provider decision making than other types of health care utilization they may be better markers of disease control after a complex policy change such as insurance expansion study author dr andrew admon from the university of michigan said in a press release accompanying the release of the study positive balance sheets in many states more people became eligible for health coverage after medicaid expansion than was originally estimated rachel garfield from the kaiser family foundation said it s tricky to talk about what actually happened compared to predictions predictions are just that they re based on an estimate based on collection of information she said it s not a fact it can be off due to several factors so the fact that actual costs may have been above the predictions could mean many things maybe something happened with rollout of enrollment or the predictions had errors in them to begin with her organization has predicted north carolina would see at least 412 000 new beneficiaries on the medicaid rolls few state officials were complaining about it though initial demand in louisiana was higher than expected but in recent months has begun to tick back down according to nick alberes a policy advisor for louisiana governor john bel edwards who expanded the program in 2016 i think a big part of that was there has been so much pent up demand for health coverage he said noting that expansion had cut the state s uninsured rate in half many lawmakers want to know how it will affect their state s balance sheets states have taken different paths to expansion some have paid for it outright betting on savings outweighing costs others created revenue streams to support the cost in montana revenue generation took the form of some cost sharing by the newly covered the state saved money by moving some traditional beneficiaries into the populations served by the enhanced federal matching rate that included 10 5 million saved in the state s prison system where some inmate care was moved over to medicaid according to a study done by a national health care consulting firm the montana expansion cost the state 29 4 million in outlays while earning the state more than 36 million in extra federal reimbursement in louisiana lawmakers imposed a premium tax on the managed care companies that run the state s medicaid program we negotiated with them in order to get that in place albares said of course they see a benefit in providing that revenue as a statutory dedication for the medicaid expansion program because of course they have a number of new enrollees coming into their insurance program he also pointed out that the prior administration had left the state with deficits but alberes said their last session budget resulted in a surplus it saves our state general fund money it s brought hundreds of millions of dollars into our state general fund albares said we ve had about a half million people who have accessed health insurance coverage many of them for the first time in their lives we re still spending zero dollars in state general fund for the medicaid expansion population he added similarly a review in governing magazine found states using cigarette liquor hospital and premium taxes to pay the costs of expansion it was 18 million we saved from the department of rehabilitation and the corrections budget said tom betti a spokesman for ohio s medicaid program who ticked off the ways ohio saved from expansion the state paid the extra costs out of its general fund but hired researchers from the university of ohio to track the ways the state saved 163 1 million in net state match provides 5 1 billion in health care services to almost 700 000 ohioans betti said spending about 163 million and getting 5 1 billion in health care services back boils down to the state paying about 21 per person per month about 68 cents per day and betti s former governor john kasich said he put a provision in his state s expansion plan that says if the federal government reneges on paying the higher rate for expansion patients the state pulls out of it we have reasonable ways to protect the financial integrity of the state he told north carolina health news on your own two feet people from expanding states said it s a little harder to calculate exactly how much tax revenue they ve received as a result of the new jobs created by expanding the program but all the states reported increases in the workforce in montana health care employment grew at almost three times the rate of employment in other sectors of the economy according to the consultants study whereas job growth in that sector lagged before expansion kaiser family foundation s rachel garfield noted that people with disabilities were more likely to enter the workforce in states that expanded before the aca would have to keep their income very low in order to qualify for medicaid she explained but now they could earn more income and retain their coverage albares said they commissioned a study from louisiana state university economists who estimated expansion had created or retained more than 19 000 jobs about half of them in health care and generated 3 5 billion dollars in economic activity there are also substantial ripple effects across the economy you know you need people to serve the meals for people restaurants and basic services that support those health care jobs albares said in ohio betti pointed to their research indicating many people have cycled off of medicaid once they get a better paying job we have four years of evidence pointing to the fact that it s working when you re sick who wants to go look for a job or if you re worried about being sick you have diabetes or whatever ailment you may have that s not being treated properly with expansion he said workers are going to doctors if you have substance abuse problems there s help for that you can get on your own two feet republish this story republish our articles for free online or in print under a

victor grossman is an american journalist and author who has lived in berlin for many years his most recent book is a socialist defector from harvard to karl marx allee monthly review press 2019 germany is commonly perceived as a strong dependable island amid a sea of gyrating european uncertainties a down to earth dependable ally in attempts by the better u s presidents to move the world forward as steadily as possible for the past thirteen years this view has been personified in the clear undramatic words and deeds of angela merkel chancellor of germany since 2005 considerable doubts in this appraisal with evidence that germany like every other country has never been a monolith free of class conflict and other contradictions are addressed in germany s hidden crisis social decline in the heart of europe by the economic sociologist oliver nachtwey now a professor at the swiss university of basel in describing west german then all german developments from the end of the second world war until the present it analyzes from the left unafraid to utilize the ideas of karl marx as well as a host of more recent analysts of many shades written in a readable style even a relative layperson like myself was able to understand it but the reader does need to concentrate it is not surprisingly no novel at the start nachtwey recalls that germany has traditions going back to the days of chancellor otto bismarck who combatted the rapid rise of the leftist social democrats by both forbidding them and in 1883 co opting them through the establishment of a limited health care invalidity and pension system these augmented by women s suffrage and jobless insurance were defended during the weimar period between the first world war and even partially in the adolf hitler era after 1945 there were further improvements a foundational aspect of the federal republic was the constitutional protection of the right to join a union to use strikes to improve conditions and in large plants to have worker representation on the ruling board though the owners had final control the establishment of a welfare state a crucial part of postwar democracy influenced development for many years the rapid rise in postwar industrial growth and a shortage of workers in the early years provided the newly formed industrial unions with a strong stand corporations proved willing to accept fairly mild bargaining positions on many issues this led to a remarkable level of prosperity proudly labeled the economic miracle before long most working class homes now increasingly privately owned had modern sanitation washing machines television sets and a car at first often a volkswagen beetle something hardly dreamed of in past generations became possible a vacation trip to southern locations like italy the old proletarian plebeian aspects of working class life were largely overcome there was a new feeling of equality if not in income then in citizenship with class distinctions no longer seeming so impenetrable education which now extended far beyond earlier limitations of simple reading writing and arithmetic opened the way for some from lower classes or their children to ascend from manual jobs in industry into middle class white collar positions often in public service the feeling of greater economic democracy with the associated upward mobility is described by nachtwey as a kind of elevator effect with all groups moving up while levels of prosperity were not the same for everyone they were all higher than they had been in terms of the law as he writes this was not a society of equals but a society of people on equal terms this elevator effect moved many toward a more individualistic approach away from the class consciousness once so strong in germany aside from a fight to achieve the forty hour work week and the truly tough struggles to gain for some the thirty eight or even thirty five hour work week the labor unions overall grew satisfied with sitting peacefully at the negotiating table behind closed doors without any mass participation or action by the membership aside from their yes or no votes parallels with developments in the united states are unavoidable this period of so called upward mobility in much of the western world reached its german zenith toward the end of the 1970s when willy brandt and then helmut schmidt both social democrats headed the west german governments the sudden decision by richard nixon and fifteen government officials at camp david on august 13 1971 to suspend convertibility of the dollar into gold is seen by nachtwey as a turning point the relative equilibrium based on u s domination as agreed upon in 1944 in bretton woods new hampshire was replaced by a state of international financial instability lasting until today and only partially supplanted in europe by the enforced discipline of the european union and its euro currency what developed impelled by lower profit rates was a turn from the priority of producing goods financed essentially by way of the stock market toward a growing reliance on financing by the banks this meant greater stress on making big profits fast less entrepreneurial development but quick sure fire gains with as little risk as possible there was a rapid expansion into eastern europe after the velvet revolutions of 1989 93 where skilled but hungry workforces compelled to find any work were willing to accept very low wages and far fewer rights this applied even more to new workers in the southern continents especially south and southeast asia but the lust for quick profits demanded by the finance market with many large companies directly tied up with banks was also felt at home the welfare state despite some happy op eds had definitely not abolished classes even when permitting increased upward mobility there was less confidence in the trickle down rationale that huge profits for the big shots would bring higher incomes for just about everybody that a rising tide would raise all the boats the growing reprivatization of public services from transportation and energy to health and education much as in the united states the united kingdom and elsewhere meant a turn away from any post keynesian concern for all citizens toward the tough neoliberalism of friedrich hayek and milton friedman fewer workers could rely on the traditional lifetime jobs with a single company the rise in factory status and wages and getting a tolerable pension companies offering security or basic upward mobility in exchange for skills and loyalty nachtwey calls the result a period of regressive modernization also involving electronics and productivity measurement even down to the individual level and describes what pressures this produced not only for production workers next to the ascending elevator now grown creakier there was also a descending escalator though never easy it was still possible for many to get a college degree but with fewer safe government jobs or steady positions in fields like journalism and law that was no longer a guarantee of security even for students from upper middle class families despite their big head start for many especially working class youth their endeavors even with degrees recalled to stick with the metaphor the childhood experience of trying to run up a down escalator as for those at the top since birth they could only be reached with a very exclusive ladder most rungs of which were removed for all those lower in rank as the 1970s moved along and then during the 1980s the economic situation grew tighter from 1969 until 1982 the social democratic party led the government headed at first by brandt who gained fame and praise by ending the total boycott and ostracization of the eastern bloc finally recognizing polish boundaries and paying tribute to the warsaw ghetto resistance this easing of cold war tension including its most overt pressure against the east german democratic republic gdr meant replacing confrontation with seduction it was unhappily accompanied by tightened restrictions on the west german left with hundreds of thousands checked for undesirable ideas and hundreds fired from government jobs such as teaching and postal service joe mccarthy though dead was not fully buried eastward seduction finally worked though the harvest was reaped and german unification achieved by the conservative christian democratic union of germany cdu politician helmut kohl who ruled the roost for sixteen years partly due to the gratitude for his efforts his successor in 1998 was again a social democrat gerhard schröder who shared cabinet posts with the green party a child of the student led protests of 1968 with their revolutionary slogans and sometimes bloody actions the green party was founded in 1980 as a radical protest party but by 1998 had become quite tame partly under the influence of newly absorbed gdr s so called dissidents most of whom were very conservative the social democrat green coalition lasting seven years was marked by two decisive events less than half a year after taking over schröder and his green foreign minister joschka fischer ignored all united nations un rules by joining the north atlantic treaty organization in bombing serbia over kosovo the first military deployment of german soldiers since the second world war this was made possible by unification since there was no critical gdr as a counterpart demanding peace the narrow reelection victory four years later was seen as a result of the controversial decision to stay out of the iraq war which similarly disregarded un rules international law generally and the geneva conventions in particular after earlier cuts in the pension system encouraging dubious private pensions the social democrats and the greens established schröder s mixed bag known as agenda 2010 passed step by step in 2003 and the two years that followed its key section named hartz 4 for the corrupt legislator who framed it cut unemployment assistance hitherto unlimited in length to only one year two years for those over 55 after that jobless workers receive a barely survivable monthly sum plus heating and rent costs up to a certain limit but must accept any and every job offered to them regardless of qualifications wages or working conditions they must present written proof monthly of their constant attempts to find work in some cases they are assigned obligatory job training at the compulsory monthly visits to so called job centers unemployed people must provide total ongoing disclosure of all bank accounts insurance policies and any assets or property of value from cars to jewelry anything above a certain low threshold triggers cuts in the monthly payments anything considered a violation like a missed appointment at the job center brings sanctions that is cuts in the allowance they must always be available by phone and request approval for vacation trips or other travel with all the details for those jobless for over a year this requires radical changes in their way of life perhaps because they have one room too many savings for children or valued objects even when they hope to regain employment in their learned trade the many angry demonstrations against these rulings failed and fizzled out but it was certainly because of agenda 2010 that the coalition lost its majority in 2005 and merkel took over without the greens and now with the social democrats as the junior partners the new cuts and controls brought new widespread fear and a decrease in fightback on wages or working conditions that might mean losing one s job the pauperizing menace of hartz 4 lurked over millions like a terrible ogre or drone the most important result was an increase in half time work work without regular contracts for indefinite lengths and indefinite hours in brief precarious work big business with its risk reluctant trend was all in favor of an increased ability to hire workers rapidly when they were needed and lay them off just as rapidly when they were not strongly affecting labor relations the relatively high german wage level stagnated and receded giving the economy additional advantages in export trading and permitting the government to boast of its low unemployment rate while much unemployment was hidden under a lid of half day work temporary jobs useless schooling at taxpayer expense and enforced beggarly paid jobs currently two million people depend on hartz 4 working people are often split between securer better paid regulars and the precarious staff often rented out by crooked agencies sometimes solidarity developed but all too often the regulars took advantage of their preferred positions looking down on the others a situation facilitated and encouraged by management this split undermines the strength of employees in work councils and in their legally authorized participation in board meetings where precarious workers are rarely represented their frequent willingness to accept any indignity or speed up in hopes of gaining regular status or in fear of losing what they have can also be contagious many regulars fear becoming precarious or losing out fully with even the most famous established corporations cutting down or closing any plants that do not bring in quick enough returns two other key subjects were often discussed by nachtwey in the early welfare state years many women left traditional home seclusion with cribs and pots and pans to get jobs large numbers had to work during the war as well as afterward when large numbers of men did not return or for prisoners of war did not quickly return more women earned work experience by necessity and did not then want to give up their newly won independence or their needed paychecks many branches of industry welcomed them but always at far lower wage levels than men often in the most menial or repetitive jobs discriminated against in every way with almost no chance of upward mobility the situation improved somewhat over the years with new attention aroused under the banner of feminism but all too often this meant improvements for a thin stratum of upper middle class women or higher ranks but little or nothing for working class women in a related way foreign workers were also misused with able bodied men in short supply in the earlier years jobless workers were hired from portugal spain and italy while the southern europeans often left after a few years in germany and after the east german source of job seekers was halted by the building of the berlin wall huge numbers of turkish workers were brought in by government agreement often with peasant backgrounds in poverty stricken anatolia a high proportion of turks and kurds chose to stay and remain today now in their second and third generation despite progress for some with better chances of integration many are still doing the worst paid menial and heavy labor or are being denied jobs as soon as their turkish names are recognized by and large too few of the established labor unions have grappled sufficiently or satisfactorily with these problems but are often content to protect a core of regular workers in privileged islands of great export importance like the automobile industry worrying less about the individualized often isolated jobless and precarious workers male female of immigrant background or native so called bio germans nachtwey is not too optimistic about much future improvement from that quarter there have been various kinds of revolts student uprisings of 1968 and the following years dramatic demonstrations against the storage of atomic waste or to prevent construction of a giant wasteful railroad project in stuttgart against the monopoly ruled transatlantic trade and investment partnership trade agreement planned between the united states and the european union antiwar demonstrations and more recently protests against fascists racists and xenophobes some were big and heart lifting but most such demonstrations aside from those of kurds and pro or anti erdogan turks were organized and attended by middle or upper middle class white collar and professional people and rarely by many from the working class there have been some union battles in recent years too mostly in service and care industry jobs where strikes are especially disruptive and hence effective hospital personnel kindergarten teachers railroad engineers pilots and other airline personnel and postal delivery workers in some of these fights women were at the forefront despite constant pressures toward individualistic struggles for personal well being or survival such signs of fightback provided hope and occasionally displayed some of the old time spirit of mass action any mention of long term goals to address the growing systemic failure however was less than rare and too agitational and extreme to be effective some forces were all too successful in utilizing mass action for years the far right consisted mostly of small groups of elderly hitler lovers and young racist antileftist thugs but after 2014 there were weekly anti muslim marches concentrated in eastern saxony especially dresden they burgeoned into a major force in present day germany a party called alternative for germany afd with ninety two loud nastily racist deputies in the bundestag and others in all sixteen state legislatures not a few veer close to overt fascism in eastern german states the afd has reached third or second place among six parties and threatens to win next year s state election in saxony at first its main target was the european union but it now mobilizes hatred against the many refugees welcomed into germany by merkel in 2015 using chauvinism and xenophobia they misdirect the worries of lower middle class people fearing downward mobility for themselves or their children and growing numbers of workers as well into blaming those foreigners for getting homes jobs and official support of which they too are in need this leads to a rejection of both government parties a weakening of merkel s christian democrats and a far worse decline for the social democrats now down to 14 16 percent in the polls voters who reject the so called grand coalition of the two traditionally ruling parties are commonly taking one of two main paths those infected with xenophobia vote for the afd while those who want change but reject racism for humanitarian reasons religious beliefs or family memories of german wartime refugee suffering now turn in surprising numbers to the greens despite their visible rightward drift joining with the christian democrats in four state governments they at least are not in the unpopular federal government the greens with an eastern based component called bündnis 90 1990 federation defend the rights of immigrants women and the lgbtq community but the party is led by largely intellectual upper middle class professionals with no connections nor great interest in working class problems and the greens lead all parties in their belligerent even bellicose policy toward russia recalling a certain sector of u s democrats die linke or left party was situated to fill the ensuing gaps as nachtwey observes it did for a time becoming the main opposition party and growing accordingly in the eastern states where it won nearly a quarter of the electorate this led to often successful endeavors to join in state level coalition governments with some leaders dreaming of the national level but this very success or endeavors in that direction made many dissatisfied angry voters see die linke as yet another establishment party turning instead to the afd or the greens or staying home on election day germany s hidden crisis was written before recent developments in die linke a possible new insurgency by some further left leaning party members led by its charismatic caucus cochair sahra wagenknecht in the bundestag wagenknecht aims to end the stagnant image of die linke with a new collective movement explicitly not forming a new party but rather appealing to protesters in all parties including her own disappointed social democrats and even nonracist followers of the afd this attempt called aufstehen stand up seeks inspiration from jeremy corbyn in england and jean luc mélenchon in france whether it moves the german scene to the left as hoped by some or causes a destructive split as feared by others remains a burning question with an uncertain outcome and with the oncoming departure of merkel from the political scene and the growth of the afd nothing in germany is very certain nachtwey s book provides a detailed analysis of postwar developments in germany from a left wing working class and sociology based perspective i can highly recommend it to everyone interested in the past present and future of this crucially important country many of whose problems face other europeans and people in the united states as well in particular the danger of some variant of fascism most alarmingly in case of a repetition of the 2008 crisis perhaps a far more serious one nevertheless i would like to express one interesting criticism as someone who spent most of the years described in the gdr i feel that nachtwey disregards the interplay between the two states in germany before 1990 a trait common among those who grew up in west germany he does mention the gdr though rarely while largely neglecting the cold war a major foundation for west germany in achieving its welfare state was the official u s decision with most western countries going along to permit a return of german economic strength and gradually military strength as well it was to be a bulwark against any influence from the gdr a bastion and possible starting ramp in an aggressive balancing policy on the brink of atomic war this meant a comeback for the mighty empires of bayer and basf the guilty engineers and profiteers of auschwitz hitler s financiers deutsche bank and allianz insurance powerful export companies like daimler bmw volkswagen porsche and opel the krupps flicks rheinmetall and others in the military industrial complex which regained power and wealth based on the toil of millions of slave laborers prisoners of war and concentration camp inmates such giants all completely expropriated and nationalized in east germany formed the backbone of the west german economy then too the reparation burden was pushed almost entirely onto far frailer east german shoulders while the marshall plan provided huge additional doses of investment capital in an overt program of confronting socialist influence early attempts to nationalize banks and industry in west germany especially in the key state of hesse were swiftly scotched while washington the pentagon the media and sisterly kinfolk in dupont standard oil general motors ford and a dozen others helped make west germany an enticing model for all in eastern germany and east bloc europe this involved concentrated endeavors to entice east germans with valuable skills doctors managers engineers well trained workers of all kinds to move west until the berlin wall made this extremely difficult and usually dangerous but there were other aspects that were sometimes indirectly positive west german union officials have often described how contract negotiations were affected by an invisible gdr seat at the bargaining table its superior working conditions were never to become so sharply apparent that they lessened the lure of a commodity rich west german market economy for east germans or led to any undesirable comparisons by west germans as long as the gdr existed the corporations remained relatively all things considered lenient after unification with that seat at the table now empty and no more rivalry economic screws could be tightened and benefits reduced this is what is happening after 1990 east bloc markets were opened wide for sales and investment and many west german companies were freed from bothersome rivalry with competing eastern firms the buyout or destruction of all of east german industry always weaker than that of west germany yet still worldwide in the upper ranks brought a giant increase in wealth at the top while the swift strangulation opened up a large source of highly skilled workers desperate for jobs under almost any conditions it also led to the disappointment of millions in east germany who promised blossoming landscapes in 1990 became angry sullen and then suspicious of rival foreigners although the latter were far less numerous in east germany under 1 percent in saxony this mistaken envy opened the door to the growing fascist menace i can understand that nachtwey could not expand his book indefinitely and what he covered he covered well yet i think the cold war aspects the differences and influences in both directions above all in germany deserve great attention examining the gdr experience its attempt to defy all odds and achieve socialism with all the positive and negative results for working people can help those in the united states and elsewhere in search for solutions to problems that are growing ever more grave
