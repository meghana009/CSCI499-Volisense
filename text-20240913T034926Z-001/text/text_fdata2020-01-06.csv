itau bank knows what s on the minds of argentinians with a marketing message that would fall flat in the us are you looking to beat inflation morgan simon i spent new years day on the streets of buenos aires facing what i thought was a simple rational economic decision where to exchange money at the bank the official exchange rate was 60 pesos to a us dollar but on the street it was 70 pesos to the dollar should ve been an easy choice presuming there s no dark alley involved my economist training faltered this was actually a challenging moral decision i couldn t make a choice without knowing why would someone on the street want my us dollars so badly to be willing to pay a premium what made this market so lopsided what would be the societal impact of my fueling that market was it even legal i started reciting one of my favorite verses from pulitzer prize winning artist kendrick lamar that obama incidentally chose as his 2015 best song of the year how much a dollar really cost the question is detrimental paralyzin my thoughts i was getting lost in my quandary and without any pesos to spend longingly staring at the steak and wine filled tables of the summer street cafes i passed by what i encountered in argentina was a classic black market the government tries to set rules about how a market is going to work like the currency market and then the people vote with their feet or their bills in this case in response i think or hope most of us would not buy a clearly stolen iphone on the street in another country at a steep discount but would we view changing dollars in the street in that same way does participating in a black market of any kind make us accomplices to a victimless crime or even worse is there in fact a victim here to unpack this we have to better understand why it is that exchange rates can vary so widely within a country in argentina the difference was not so stark compared to countries experiencing hyper inflation for instance nearby venezuela where the street price hovers at a third over the official rate or uzbekistan which has had street prices for uzbekistan som at close to double the official rate in all cases the same principles apply countries need globally loved currencies like the dollar and euro to be able to trade and service debt they need exports and tourism to get such currencies export a lot like china and you can have what they call a balance of payments surplus import a lot or keep a lot of international debt on your books like argentina and you can get a balance of payments deficit president macri for instance issued 56b of external debt for example from 2016 to 2018 if there s concern that the central bank of a country is running low on foreign reserves and may be at risk of devaluing the currency you can get what s called a balance of payments crisis which may lead a government to put limits on who can access foreign currency and at what amounts just a few months ago the outgoing and increasingly unpopular macri instituted controls that limited argentinians to 100 month in usd the problem is that people too want hard currency they are reasonably terrified that inflation or an overnight devaluation will diminish the value of their money in the bank in local currency for americans this may be a hard concept to grasp we are not used to walking around iowa seeking to change our dollars into mexican pesos or canadian dollars to secure our economic future but that s exactly what many people globally seek to do for instance i spent last january in rural zimbabwe and on an eight hour bus ride saw a school teacher s devastation as over the course of that one ride the government s decision to devalue the currency cut her net worth in half it felt so unbelievably unfair the wealthy are able to get foreign bank accounts in places like switzerland and miami to protect their value while the poor and middle class without such tools suffer the most this has actually fueled a trend towards alternative currencies like bitcoin in far outreaches of places i ve been like brazil and south africa as to the extend bitcoin counts as a virtual but hard currency with utility across borders that can be traded freely with minimal government intervention currency crises are thus vicious cycles governments try to control the currency which makes people even more fearful and desperate to get dollars even if they wind up paying double to triple what those dollars are actually worth at the bank this creates a classic prisoner s dilemma to use another concept from economic theory two actors the state and the people could both benefit from currency stabilization but the incentives are misaligned such that people compete rather than collaborate the perpetuation of the market only makes the crisis worse until like in 2001 in argentina there was a complete meltdown and massive devaluation so should you participate in the black market like many moral questions where you stand depends on where you sit travel company flightfox gave a great analysis of the situation in argentina from varying perspectives government exchanging money illegally is leading to billions of undeclared dollars at play in argentina a lot of these dollars are in the hands of money launderers and those who engage in more risky and illicit criminal activities in addition with argentinians withdrawing billions from their bank accounts there are far fewer resources available for the government to build a sustainable trustworthy economy as such the argentinian peso would be much more stable if everyone wasn t trying to convert to another currency local trading pesos illegally is often the only way that argentinians can get their hands on a more stable currency in riding the wave of an unreliable economy and national currency the right to trade out risk for greater security should be available to residents also with the rate of inflation constantly diminishing the value of the peso freezing assets with a more stable currency is necessary tourist trading in dollars at a better rate than the official exchange in the black market may be a more realistic representation of what the argentinian peso is worth in fact argentina has recently become the first country to be censured by the international money foundation imf for inaccurate inflation statistics with the government published official inflation rate being far too low the fixed exchange is not a proper measure of the pesos worth the point is moral questions always require a multi stakeholder analysis rational choice economic theory states that the starting point for the decision making for an individual is their own self interest hopefully in a more evolved society we can think more holistically about how our economic actions affect actors other than ourselves before just jumping at the outcome that s best for us personally we also need to consider how vulnerable any particular actor might be relative to others if there are going to be winners and losers resulting from a choice who is most prepared to shoulder the loss given that some governments are better to their people than others if given a choice to prop up a government or support individual people which should we choose in a particular country s context ironically in argentina where such fluctuations between official and unofficial rates are not new in the past this has often been called the blue market rather than a black market complete with its own twitter handle launched in 2014 dolarblue according to the guardian even newspapers reported both rates instead of alleys hotels recommend cuevas caves that exchange at the blue rate such places are technically illegal but not particularly policed i appreciate that blue is a more neutral color there is a problematic history of racist overtones factoring into what gets called black black markets black magic black hearts etc and i think it s fair to say for individual argentinians their use of the blue market is really more of a gray zone if the government is not reasonably able to protect the people and their savings for instance by providing a minimum amount of inflation protected accounts it makes sense that people need to seek strategies to protect their families and ensure what enables four to eat today won t only feed two tomorrow as a tourist with just a one night stopover coming from a blissful christmas week in patagonia this is not my concern my concern was can i pay the cash entrance to tango night at el beso 250 pesos equals somewhere between 3 57 and 4 16 usd depending on the exchange rate and get a glass of champagne 90 pesos equals 1 28 to 1 5 usd before using my us based uber account to get to the airport by 5am for my flight and yes given the 5am flight i executed some rational choice theory myself in sticking to just one glass of 1 50 champagne essentially i have the economic power to not have to worry about paying a bit extra in service of argentina s balance of payments how much does a dollar really cost not a lot for me but a lot for argentina hence moral dilemma resolved via multi stakeholder analysis i decided to take cash out from an atm at the official government rate but i couldn t get my card to work so i ultimately made a choice that was hopefully the best of both worlds and regardless the only one available to me at 10 pm on a wednesday i changed 10 usd with a friend at the official exchange rate so that she wouldn t herself have to overpay for dollars the true moral of the story that rational economic theory can lead us to make bad societal choices if we see an opportunity to get a great deal what economists call engaging in rent seeking behavior we might benefit from taking a moment to consider who had to pay more in order for me to pay less this can apply to buying in the black market or any number of day to day decisions for instance it s hard to resist at 20 mani pedi until we stop to realize the reason it s so cheap is the prevalence of forced labor in the industry as my father always used to say when offered a deal one shouldn t refuse if it s that cheap i probably can t afford it full disclosures related to my work here this post does not constitute investment tax or legal advice and the author is not responsible for any actions taken based on

as the 2010s draw to a close the global economy is in a very different place at the decade s end than at its beginning many of the sociopolitical events that took place around the world were reflective of the financial world analysts say the election of donald trump in 2016 was the catalyst for significant change in the u s economy and the global economy but his rise was as much an effect of broader forces at work as it was a cause of these movements and moments that reshaped the economy over the last 10 years eurozone in crisis in the wake of the recession unsustainably high deficit and debt levels in several european countries led to a crisis requiring the intervention of third party financial institutions such as a 2012 bond buying program implemented by the european central bank to tamp down interest rates on sovereign debt which were rising as investor confidence shrank the crisis was most acutely felt in greece which had its bond rating slashed slashed to junk status after it was revealed that the government had seriously misrepresented its debt burden leaders agreed to sharp austerity measures in return for bailouts from the union and the international monetary fund in the subsequent backlash and public protests against greek austerity measures there was speculation that the country might leave the eurozone entirely some say these events were a precursor to and a catalyst of britain s 2016 vote to leave the eurozone brexit is kind of the natural outcome of when greece was basically held hostage said brad mcmillan chief investment officer at commonwealth financial network they were forced into a multi year depression in order to save the euro obviously brexit opens up the possibility more concretely that european countries can leave their union and i m sure that s going to have all kinds of ramifications said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics with nationalism growing in prominence he predicted that the eurozone will face a continuation of these challenges in the coming decade nationalism hits trade the 2010s were marked more broadly by a surge of populist and nationalist sentiment both in the u s and elsewhere around the world a sentiment that is fundamentally reshaping trade between countries and changing the calculus for multinational corporations we ve seen this rise of nationalism which is a political issue reshaping financial markets tremendously said joseph heider president of cirrus wealth management for roughly half a century business and industry labored to build manufacturing and production facilities and supply chains to take advantage of the availability of raw materials cheap labor and lax environmental regulations all in a relentless drive for efficiency now that commercial infrastructure is under strain trump s decision to pull the united states out of the trans pacific partnership and start a trade war with china is the most visible and consequential manifestation of this trend with his on again off again threats to impose tariffs on europe mexico and other trading partners a close second politics is now taking primacy over economics over the past several decades we ve been building an economically optimized world right now that is no longer the case mcmillan said political economy is now being prioritized over economic efficiency and that s something we haven t seen for decades that takes us back to the 50s fed intervenes to prop up the economy in the wake of the financial crisis the federal reserve initiated monetary policy with little precedent in modern times it held interest rates at zero for an extended period of time and undertook enormous quantitative easing programs to pump liquidity into financial markets the decade was really remarkable in the sense that for the first six years of the decade we had zero percent interest rates and for the first five years we had quantitative easing said dan north chief economist at euler hermes north america characterizing the central bank s activities as a wild monetary policy experiment some market observers defend the fed s interventionist streak particularly at the start of the decade with the financial crisis still fresh in people s minds the biggest thing in the last 10 years is the continuation of quantitative easing without quantitative easing i think everything would be drastically different way worse than things are now said mitchell goldberg president of clientfirst strategy in hindsight some question whether the fed was too accommodative a stance that could have ramifications for the next recession when the fed cut interest rates to the unprecedented level of zero to 0 25 percent nobody expected it was going to last the seven years that it did mcbride said we ve had way too much easy money for way too long and at some point it s going to come back and get us north said this leaves the fed with fewer tools at hand to boost the economy he said we re leaving very little room for the next recession tax cuts lead to buybacks republicans sweep of the 2016 election facilitated the passage of a massive corporate tax cut financial experts say the passage of the tax cuts and jobs act at the end of 2017 had positive results initially but those short term gains could come at the cost of long term pain trump got elected and went on a path of reducing regulation north said i think honestly the reduction in regulation has helped the economy and i think the tax cut helped the economy as well he said but he added that since economic growth fell far short of republicans forecasts the stimulative effects of the tax cut have faded and the national debt has ballooned a risky combination it s putting america on a less stable financial future because of the structure of this unfunded non sustainable tax cut crowley said proponents of the the tax cuts predicted that companies would spend their windfalls expanding and investing in production facilities technology and human capital instead the cuts spurred a wave of corporate stock buybacks which helped propel the market to new record highs but also potentially limited the broader impact the tax cuts were intended to have it s in part a reflection of the fact that there may be in some sectors more than others limited investment or acquisition opportunities or a lack of appealing valuations on those that make a buyback a more palatable way to boost earnings per share said greg mcbride chief financial analyst at bankrate com every dollar that s going into buybacks is a dollar that s not being used for another form of expansion he said share repurchases have also contributed to stock valuation gains but investing experts warn that this inflation can distort markets more dollars chasing fewer stocks because of all the buybacks isn t something you want long term investors to hang their hat on said john lynch chief investment strategist at lpl financial stock market highs the increase in buybacks is one factor that has contributed to the record long bull market a meteoric rise virtually no one would have predicted 10 years ago when 2010 began the stock market had already begun the long climb out of its recession era hole but the mood was still pessimistic the decade started off very ominously zandi said we began the decade not knowing that the crisis was over we d just suffered the worst economic downturn since the 1930s depression the recession was over officially by june 2009 but it wasn t quite clear that we were out of it since then of course stocks have smashed through one record high after another with valuations boosted by both monetary and fiscal policy mcbride said the fed s trio of rate cuts in 2019 reversed the correction that took place at the end of last year sustaining the bull market for a record setting 10th year that helped cushion the broader economy but it s also helped juiced the equity markets lower interest rates make other investments less appealing he said that enhances the appeal of equities relative to bonds or cash

units the rupee philipine peso korean won and chinese renminbi were all lower against the dollar while the rand mexican peso brazilian real russian rouble and a range of other currencies were winning back ground previously lost to the dollar monday s performance disparity between emerging market currencies has its roots in the ongoing flare up of tensions between the u s and iran which has lifted prices of brent crude oil futures by 4 97 thus far in 2020 due to fears that a possible conflict will at least hinder the passage of much need barrels of oil through the strait of hormuz a busy waterway in the gulf through which around a third of the world s seaborne oil trade must pass the japanese yen should once again outperform especially against those risk sensitive currencies directly exposed to oil exports via the straits of hormuz i e the korean won and the indian rupee says chris turner global head of strategy at ing above usd inr rate shown at daily intervals alongside brent

importing countries over in asia there s uncertainty about how iran will respond to the u s killing of general qassam soleimani in a missile strike last week although ing says the country s options are limited to disrupting commercial traffic transiting the strait attacking oil tankers of u s allied countries and attacking oil infrastructure like pipelines however any such action might only serve to lift oil prices even further which would bad news for the rupee because prices are already at their highest levels since may 2019 higher oil prices and a weaker inr will increase the import bill which will in turn have a negative impact on both the fiscal and current account deficits all in all a sustained rise in oil prices leaves inr and the rest of asia vulnerable to a further sell

at daily intervals alongside 10 year indian government bond yield blue line left axis oil woes are emerging at the same time as the reserve bank of india rbi uses its financial muscle to squash some government bond yields in the hope of enhancing the transmission of its interest rate cuts into the real economy the rbi cut rates five times last year in an effort to stoke domestic demand and cushion the economy from a slowdown in global growth but commercial banks appear to have passed less than half the cuts on to customers the rbi left its cash rate unchanged at 5 15 in december but noted the marginal cost of funds based lending rate had fallen only 49 basis points in 2019 when the bank had cut its own benchmark by a total of 135 basis points the weighted average lending rate fell just 44 basis points and rates charged on some outstanding rupee loans actually rose the rbi is now intervening in the bond market to enhance the effect of its earlier decisions to cut borrowing costs indian policymakers are now carrying out their own version of the operation twist policy that s sometimes used by the federal reserve and involves the bank buying long term government bonds in order to force down their yields but offsetting the impact of those transactions on its balance sheet by simultaneously selling short term bonds the effect has been to cultivate a modest decline in the indian government 10 year bond yield and expectations in the market of further declines to come those yields represent the primary return earned by large internationla investors who buy the rupee and given that they re in decline the indian currency could now become less attractive to prospective buyers and suffer as a result the usd inr rate often demonstrates a negative relationship with 10 year bond yields although its correlation with oil is stronger so the rbi s operation twist could be yet another headwind for the indian currency to contend with in the weeks and months ahead

also if a war develops between iran and the united states oil prices could spike 20 per cent from the current level to make matters worse the tourism sector in thailand and asia may be affected by a new strain of pneumonia if this becomes as severe as the sars epidemic 17 years ago however the economic situation might not reach 1997 asian financial crisis proportions the economic growth rate this year will be approximately 3 5 3 6 per cent compared to 3 per cent in 2019 the lowest gdp in 10 years said assist prof anusorn tamajai director of the economic and business research centre at the institute of economics rangsit university on sunday january 5 global gdp in 2020 calculated by the imf purchasing power parity will be 149 53 trillion the impact from the trade war has improved but global economic growth is still lower than the average seen between 2001 and 2019 which was 3 9 per cent anusorn said the growth rate of the world economy touched 4 3 per cent in 2000 the latest global economic risk factors stem from the conflict between the united states and iran which is likely to expand the crisis and conflicts in the middle east he said these factors will force oil and energy prices to rise the oil price on the world market has increased by more than 4 per cent reaching the highest level since april last year if iran responds to the conflict by closing the strait of hormuz which connects the persian gulf with the gulf of oman or attacks oil tankers in the strait it will affect the supply of crude oil to asia as 80 per cent of tankers use the channel to transport approximately 22 5 million barrels per day of crude oil to the continent us president donald trump has also announced that the military is prepared to attack 52 key targets in iran if iran takes drastic steps the domestic oil price will increase more than 20 per cent from the current level he said inflation rates in many countries will be higher than expected by the international monetary fund and the world bank however inflation will not hinder the need for easy monetary and fiscal policies us gdp is expected to be at the 1 9 2 1 per cent level the euro zone at 1 2 1 5 japan 0 5 0 8 and china 5 8 6 per cent anusorn said world trade growth should increase significantly by no less than 3 per cent compared to 1 2 per cent in 2019 however when compared to the value in dollars the growth rate will continue to decrease or remain negative from last year s level while trade and investment growth within the region is expected to increase as a result of the changing globalisation system and the diffusion of trade barriers including the influence of commercialism and economic nationalism global stock and financial markets are expected to remain positive from high liquidity and will increase due to quantitative easing measures by the central banks of developed countries and china gold prices and the dollar will rise if the middle east is engulfed in a war investors will seek more safe haven assets such as dollars government bonds and gold one positive factor is that the trade war between the united states and china may not intensify but will see the enforcement of intellectual property laws especially for high tech products in addition there may be trade conflicts on the taxation of digital and online businesses between the united states and europe while brexit could take longer to achieve thailand s economic growth rate this year is very uncertain and highly volatile anusorn pointed out there may not be an economic crisis that many people call the real burn or a twin of the 1997 asian financial crisis but only a long period of low economic growth due to structural problems stiff trade competition the spread of corruption at all levels the decline of faith as a result of not adhering to the rule of law and an inability to keep up with international digital technology these factors will cause more layoffs and unemployment in the first half the country s growth rate in 2020 is expected to be 1 8 2 9 per cent lower than the average gdp growth of the asean region thailand will have the second lowest gdp after singapore this year the average gdp growth rate of developing countries in asia is around 6 per cent however the thai economy may improve slightly if the investment and export sectors recover which could see an expansion of around 2 6 2 9 per cent but there are also expectations that it may grow below 2 per cent according to anusorn investment in financial markets will continue to benefit from low interest rates and high liquidity the rise in the price of risk weighted assets may not reflect the fundamentals of the economy and business performance therefore investors must choose the timing of investment and trading appropriately and in line with rapidly changing dynamics it is expected that the thai stock market index will move in the range of 1 750 1 550 in 2020 he forecast that the baht currency will be highly volatile and may strengthen slightly in the first quarter but could weaken after short term capital outflows the baht will move at the level of 29 31 per dollar in the first quarter 30 50 31 50 during the second quarter 29 50 30 50 in the third quarter and 31 32 during the last quarter
by the mainstream media are carefully sidestepping the method behind america s seeming madness in assassinating islamic revolutionary guard general qassim suleimani to start the new year the logic behind the assassination was a long standing application of u s global policy not just a personality quirk of donald trump s impulsive action his assassination of iranian military leader suleimani was indeed a unilateral act of war in violation of international law but it was a logical step in a long standing u s strategy it was explicitly authorized by the senate in the funding bill for the pentagon that it passed last year the assassination was intended to escalate america s presence in iraq to keep control of the region s oil reserves and to back saudi arabia s wahabi troops isis al quaeda in iraq al nusra and other divisions of what are actually america s foreign legion to support u s control of near eastern oil as a buttress of the u s dollar that remains the key to understanding this policy and why it is in the process of escalating not dying down i sat in on discussions of this policy as it was formulated nearly fifty years ago when i worked at the hudson institute and attended meetings at the white house met with generals at various armed forces think tanks and with diplomats at the united nations my role was as a balance of payments economist having specialized for a decade at chase manhattan arthur andersen and oil companies in the oil industry and military spending these were two of the three main dynamic of american foreign policy and diplomacy the third concern was how to wage war in a democracy where voters rejected the draft in the wake of the vietnam war the media and public discussion have diverted attention from this strategy by floundering speculation that president trump did it except to counter the non threat of impeachment with a wag the dog attack or to back israeli lebensraum drives or simply to surrender the white house to neocon hate iran syndrome the actual context for the neocon s action was the balance of payments and the role of oil and energy as a long term lever of american diplomacy the balance of payments dimension the major deficit in the u s balance of payments has long been military spending abroad the entire payments deficit beginning with the korean war in 1950 51 and extending through the vietnam war of the 1960s was responsible for forcing the dollar off gold in 1971 the problem facing america s military strategists was how to continue supporting the 800 u s military bases around the world and allied troop support without losing america s financial leverage the solution turned out to be to replace gold with u s treasury securities ious as the basis of foreign central bank reserves after 1971 foreign central banks had little option for what to do with their continuing dollar inflows except to recycle them to the u s economy by buying u s treasury securities the effect of u s foreign military spending thus did not undercut the dollar s exchange rate and did not even force the treasury and federal reserve to raise interest rates to attract foreign exchange to offset the dollar outflows on military account in fact u s foreign military spending helped finance the domestic u s federal budget deficit saudi arabia and other near eastern opec countries quickly became a buttress of the dollar after these countries quadrupled the price of oil in retaliation for the united states quadrupling the price of its grain exports a mainstay of the u s trade balance u s banks were swamped with an inflow of much foreign deposits which were lent out to third world countries in an explosion of bad loans that blew up in 1972 with mexico s insolvency and destroyed third world government credit for a decade forcing it into dependence on the united states via the imf and world bank to top matters of course what saudi arabia does not save in dollarized assets with its oil export earnings is spent on buying hundreds of billion of dollars of u s arms exports this locks them into dependence on u s supply o replacement parts and repairs and enables the united states to turn off saudi military hardware at any point of time in the event that the saudis may try to act independently of u s foreign policy so maintaining the dollar as the world s reserve currency became a mainstay of u s military spending foreign countries to not have to pay the pentagon directly for this spending they simply finance the u s treasury and u s banking system fear of this development was a major reason why the united states moved against libya whose foreign reserves were held in gold not dollars an which was urging other african countries to follow suit in order to free themselves from dollar diplomacy hillary and obama invaded grabbed their gold supplies we still have no idea who ended up with these billions of dollars worth of gold and destroyed libya s government its public education system its public infrastructure and other non neoliberal policies the great threat to this is dedollarization as china russia and other countries seek to avoid recycling dollars without the dollar s function as the vehicle for world saving in effect without the pentagon s role in creating the treasury debt that is the vehicle for world central bank reserves the u s would find itself constrained militarily and hence diplomatically constrained as it was under the gold exchange standard that is the same strategy that the u s has followed in syria and iraq iran was threatening this dollarization strategy and its buttress in u s oil diplomacy the oil industry as buttress of the u s balance of payments and foreign diplomacy the trade balance is buttressed by oil and farm surpluses oil is the key because it is imported by u s companies at almost no balance of payments cost the payments end up in the oil industry s head offices here as profits and payments to management while profits on u s oil company sales to other countries are remitted to the united states via offshore tax avoidance centers mainly liberia and panama for many years and as noted above opec countries have been told to keep their official reserves in the form of u s securities stocks and bonds as well as treasury ious but not direct purchase of u s companies being deemed economically important financially opec countries are client slates of the dollar area america s attempt to maintain this buttress explains u s opposition to any foreign governments steps to reverse global warming and the extreme weather caused by the world s u s sponsored dependence on oil any such moves by europe and other countries would reduce dependence on u s oil sales and hence on u s ability to control the global oil spigot as a means of control and coercion are viewed as hostile acts oil also explains u s opposition to russian oil exports via nordstream u s strategists want to treat energy as a u s national monopoly other countries can benefit in the way that saudi arabia has done by sending their surpluses to the u s economy but not to support their own economic growth and diplomacy control of oil thus implies support for continued global warming as an inherent part of u s strategy how a democratic nation can wage international war and terrorism the vietnam war showed that modern democracies cannot field armies for any major military conflict because this would require a draft of its citizens that would lead any government attempting such a draft to be voted out of power and without troops it is not possible to invade a country to take it over the corollary of this perception is that democracies have only two choices when it comes to military strategy they can only wage airpower bombing opponents or they can create a foreign legion that is hire mercenaries or back foreign governments that provide this military service here once again saudi arabia plays a critical role through its control of wahabi sunnis turned into terrorist jihadis willing to sabotage bomb assassinate blow up and otherwise fight any target designated as an enemy of islam the euphemism for saudi arabia acting as u s client state religion really is not the key i know of no isis or similar wahabi attack on israeli targets the united states needs the saudis to supply or finance wahabi crazies so in addition to playing a key role in the u s balance of payments by recycling its oil export earnings are into u s stocks bonds and other investments saudi arabia provides manpower by supporting the wahabi members of america s foreign legion isis and al nusra al qaeda terrorism has become the democratic mode of today u s military policy what makes america s oil war in the near east democratic is that this is the only kind of war a democracy can fight an air war followed by a vicious terrorist army that makes up for the fact that no democracy can field its own army in today s world the corollary is that terrorism has become the democratic mode of warfare from the u s vantage point what is a democracy in today s orwellian vocabulary it means any country supporting u s foreign policy bolivia and honduras have become democracies since their coups along with brazil chile under pinochet was a chicago style free market democracy so was iran under the shah and russia under yeltsin but not since it elected vladimir putin president any more than is china under president xi the antonym to democracy is terrorist that simply means a nation willing to fight to become independent from u s neoliberal democracy it does not include america s proxy armies iran s role as u s nemesis what stands in the way of u s dollarization oil and military strategy obviously russia and china have been targeted as long term strategic enemies for seeking their own independent economic policies and diplomacy but next to them iran has been in america s gun sights for nearly seventy years america s hatred of iran starts with its attempt to control its own oil production exports and earnings it goes back to 1953 when mossadegh was overthrown because he wanted domestic sovereignty over anglo persian oil the cia mi6 coup replaced him with the pliant shah who imposed a police state to prevent iranian independence from u s policy the only physical places free from the police were the mosques that made the islamic republic the path of least resistance to overthrowing the shah and re asserting iranian sovereignty the united states came to terms with opec oil independence by 1974 but the antagonism toward iran extends to demographic and religious considerations iranian support its shi ite population an those of iraq and other countries emphasizing support for the poor and for quasi socialist policies instead of neoliberalism has made it the main religious rival to saudi arabia s sunni sectarianism and its role as america s wahabi foreign legion america opposed general suleimani above all because he was fighting against isis and other u s backed terrorists in their attempt to break up syria and replace assad s regime with a set of u s compliant local leaders the old british divide and conquer ploy on occasion suleimani had cooperated with u s troops in fighting isis groups that got out of line meaning the u s party line but every indication is that he was in iraq to work with that government seeking to regain control of the oil fields that president trump has bragged so loudly about grabbing already in early 2018 president trump asked iraq to reimburse america for the cost of saving its democracy by bombing the remainder of saddam s economy the reimbursement was to take the form of iraqi oil more recently in 2019 president trump asked why not simply grab iraqi oil the giant oil field has become the prize of the bush cheney post 9 11 oil war it was a very run of the mill low key meeting in general a source who was in the room told axios and then right at the end trump says something to the effect of he gets a little smirk on his face and he says so what are we going to do about the oil trump s idea that america should get something out of its military expenditure in destroying the iraqi and syrian economies simply reflects u s policy in late october 2019 the new york times reported that in recent days mr trump has settled on syria s oil reserves as a new rationale for appearing to reverse course and deploy hundreds of additional troops to the war ravaged country he has declared that the united states has secured oil fields in the country s chaotic northeast and suggested that the seizure of the country s main natural resource justifies america further extending its military presence there we have taken it and secured it mr trump said of syria s oil during remarks at the white house on sunday after announcing the killing of the islamic state leader abu bakr al baghdadi a cia official reminded the journalist that taking iraq s oil was a trump campaign pledge that explains the invasion of iraq for oil in 2003 and again this year as president trump has said why don t we simply take their oil it also explains the obama hillary attack on libya not only for its oil but for its investing its foreign reserves in gold instead of recycling its oil surplus revenue to the u s treasury and of course for promoting a secular socialist state it explains why u s neocons feared suleimani s plan to help iraq assert control of its oil and withstand the terrorist attacks supported by u s and saudi s on iraq that is what made his assassination an immediate drive american politicians have discredited themselves by starting off their condemnation of trump by saying as elizabeth warren did how bad a person suleimani was how he had killed u s troops by masterminding the iraqi defense of roadside bombing and other policies trying to repel the u s invasion to grab its oil she was simply parroting the u s media s depiction of suleimani as a monster diverting attention from the policy issue that explains why he was assassinated now the counter strategy to u s oil and dollar and global warming diplomacy this strategy will continue until foreign countries reject it if europe and other regions fail to do so they will suffer the consequences of this u s strategy in the form of a rising u s sponsored war via terrorism the flow of refugees and accelerated global warming and extreme weather russia china and its allies already have been leading the way to dedollarization as a means to contain the balance of payments buttress of u s global military policy but everyone now is speculating over what iran s response should be the pretense or more accurately the diversion by the u s news media over the weekend has been to depict the united states as being under imminent attack mayor de blasio has positioned policemen at conspicuous key intersections to let us know how imminent iranian terrorism is as if it were iran not saudi arabia that mounted 9 11 and as if iran in fact has taken any forceful action against the united states the media and talking heads on television have saturated the air waves with warnings of islamic terrorism television anchors are suggesting just where the attacks are most likely to occur the message is that the assassination of general soleimani was to protect us as donald trump and various military spokesmen have said he had killed americans and now they must be planning an enormous attack that will injure and kill many more innocent americans that stance has become america s posture in the world weak and threatened requiring a strong defense in the form of a strong offense but what is iran s actual interest if it is indeed to undercut u s dollar and oil strategy the first policy must be to get u s military forces out of the near east including u s occupation of its oil fields it turns out that president trump s rash act has acted as a catalyst bringing about just the opposite of what he wanted on january 5 the iraqi parliament met to insist that the united states leave general suleimani was an invited guest not an iranian invader it is u s troops that are in iraq in violation of international law if they leave trump and the neocons lose control of oil and also of their ability to interfere with iranian iraqi syrian lebanese mutual defense beyond iraq looms saudi arabia it has become the great satan the supporter of wahabi extremism the terrorist legion of u s mercenary armies fighting to maintain control of near eastern oil and foreign exchange reserves the cause of the great exodus of refugees to turkey europe and wherever else it can flee from the arms and money provided by the u s backers of isis al qaeda in iraq and their allied saudi wahabi legions the logical ideal in principle would be to destroy saudi power that power lies in its oil fields they already have fallen under attack by modest yemeni bombs if u s neocons seriously threaten iran its response would be the wholesale bombing and destruction of saudi oil fields along with those of kuwait and allied near eastern oil sheikhdoms it would end the saudi support for wahabi terrorists as well as for the u s dollar such an act no doubt would be coordinated with a call for the palestinian and other foreign workers in saudi arabia to rise up and drive out the monarchy and its thousands of family retainers beyond saudi arabia iran and other advocates of a multilateral diplomatic break with u s neoliberal and neocon unilateralism should bring pressure on europe to withdraw from nato inasmuch as that organization functions mainly as a u s centric military tool of american dollar and oil diplomacy and hence opposing the climate change and military confrontation policies that threaten to make europe part of the u s maelstrom finally what can u s anti war opponents do to resist the neocon attempt to destroy any part of the world that resists u s neoliberal autocracy this has been the most disappointing response over the weekend they are flailing it has not been helpful for warren buttigieg and others to accuse trump of acting rashly without thinking through the consequences of his actions that approach shies away from recognizing that his action did indeed have a rationale do draw a line in the sand to say that yes america will go to war will fight iran will do anything at all to defend its control of near eastern oil and to dictate opec central bank policy to defend its isis legions as if any opposition to this policy is an attack on the united states itself i can understand the emotional response or yet new calls for impeachment of donald trump but that is an obvious non starter partly because it has been so obviously a partisan move by the democratic party more important is the false and self serving accusation that president trump has overstepped his constitutional limit by committing an act of war against iran by assassinating soleimani congress endorsed trump s assassination and is fully as guilty as he is for having approved the pentagon s budget with the senate s removal of the amendment to the 2019 national defense authorization act that bernie sanders tom udall and ro khanna inserted an amendment in the house of representatives version explicitly not authorizing the pentagon to wage war against iran or assassinate its officials when this budget was sent to the senate the white house and pentagon a k a the military industrial complex and neoconservatives removed that constraint that was a red flag announcing that the pentagon and white house did indeed intend to wage war against iran and or assassinate its officials congress lacked the courage to argue this point at the forefront of public discussion behind all this is the saudi inspired 9 11 act taking away congress s sole power to wage war its 2002 authorization for use of military force pulled out of the drawer ostensibly against al qaeda but actually the first step in america s long support of the very group that was responsible for 9 11 the saudi airplane hijackers the question is how to get the world s politicians u s european and asians to see how america s all or nothing policy is threatening new waves of war refugees disruption of the oil trade in the strait of hormuz and ultimately global warming and neoliberal dollarization imposed on all countries it is a sign of how little power exists in the united nations that no countries are calling for a new nurenberg style war crimes trial no threat to withdraw from nato or even to avoid holding reserves in the form of money lent to the u s treasury to fund america s military budget notes the article adds in the march meeting the iraqi prime minister replied what do you mean according to the source in the room and trump s like well we did a lot we did a lot over there we spent trillions over there and a lot of people have been talking about the oil michael crowly keep the oil trump revives charged slogan for new syria troop mission the new york times october 26 2019 the article adds i said keep the oil mr trump recounted if they are going into iraq keep the oil they never did they never did

how did banking become so central to the u s economy amid the devastation of world war ii in 1944 delegates from the allied nations gathered in bretton woods new hampshire their aim was to sketch out a global economic system that could aid postwar recovery among other things the conference established that the u s dollar would effectively be the global reserve currency pegged to the price of gold the united states then lent europe 12 billion with the marshall plan which began an unceasing flood of dollars into the global economy as the authors point out at that moment the dollar became the biggest u s export a fact still true to this day this has far reaching consequences for banks the export of dollars also created a global market for dollar denominated financial products such as treasury securities agency municipal and corporate bonds and mortgage backed securities in other words after bretton woods banking and finance started to become big business quietly banking became america s greatest industry before the 1980s finance earned around 15 percent of corporate profits in 2002 it earned a high of 43 percent in 1971 richard nixon untethered the dollar from the gold standard a decision that might have undermined the dollar s global supremacy desperate to maintain power and influence nixon convinced saudi arabia and other oil producing countries to trade oil in dollars in exchange for protection and aid just as the dollar was about to lose its reserve status divested explains it was rescued by a strong global military presence and willingness to maintain trade deficits the new international financial agreement was that the u s would protect oil markets and profits for the u s banks that served those markets even if it came at the expense of workers and the domestic economy in the late 1970s the industrial crisis struck in the u s no one agrees why it happened and the authors of divested are refreshingly honest about this trade deficits surely made it cheaper to import goods and u s industrial production once buoyed by world war and the reconstruction of europe began to decline along with or because of increased global competition it could have been excessive labor power or possibly it was the ascendant financial sector banks positioning themselves in the middle of transactions began to charge higher and higher fees sucking useful capital out of the economy and putting it into the pockets of bankers
facebook ceo mark zuckerberg testified in front of congress pledging that libra would not be launched anywhere else before getting the green light in the us it was a neat idea that ll never happen and i have nothing else to say about it jpmorgan chase ceo jamie dimon didn t mince his words when asked about the fate of libra the digital currency expected to be launched by a facebook led coalition later this year dimon s assessment came after several members of the libra association the geneva based body overseeing the launch of the currency withdrew from the project the timing couldn t have been worse announced just a few days before the group s first board meeting the exodus which started with paypal and soon included stripe mercado pago mastercard visa ebay and booking holdings dealt a heavy blow to the currency s reputation like other cryptocurrencies libra has been accused of being a potential conduit for money laundering it costs the libra project some credibility john sedunov an associate professor of finance at villanova university and an expert on cryptocurrencies told world finance you have institutions that are well versed in processing payments and handling data leaving the project it can survive without these partners but the costs of doing so will be higher quick out of the blocks the mood was very different when facebook announced libra s launch last july kevin weil vice president of product at calibra a facebook subsidiary created to serve as a digital wallet for libra expressed hope that the currency would last hundreds of years one of the project s main goals is to boost financial inclusion by catering to the 1 7 billion adults around the world who do not have access to a bank account the currency s white paper set the tone our hope is to create more access to better cheaper and open financial services no matter who you are where you live what you do or how much you have facebook is far from alone in its attempt to tap into this booming market telegram a popular messaging app is planning to launch its own digital token while other tech powerhouses are rumoured to be experimenting with similar projects but it is facebook s user base of some 2 45 billion people that has raised hopes that digital currencies can finally break the silo of the close knit blockchain community and gain traction with the broader public as sedunov explained in some ways corporate led cryptocurrencies may be beneficial for currencies like bitcoin as they may provide an easier gateway into the cryptocurrency world individuals may change their dollars to libra and then move from libra to bitcoin as they become more comfortable with the idea of a cryptocurrency through a company they already know one reason cryptocurrencies have failed to enter the mainstream is their high volatility bitcoin the first and still best known digital currency has been plagued by abrupt price swings attracting speculators but putting off less tech savvy users in december 2017 it reached its peak price of nearly 20 000 before dropping to 7 754 less than two months later see fig 1 to avoid this pitfall libra has been designed as a stablecoin a low volatility currency backed by offline financial assets such as a basket of fiat currencies and us treasury securities in september 2019 der spiegel reported that libra s reserve basket would comprise us dollars euros yen pound sterling and singapore dollars see fig 2 while each partner would contribute 10m the structure of libra departs in several ways from cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether for example libra units will be issued by partner companies rather than independent miners while partners will be responsible for the reconciliation of transactions and will have exclusive access to transaction data further unlike bitcoin and ether which use public permissionless blockchains that allow all users to validate transactions the libra association is expected to operate as a central authority show me the money one of the key components of the libra venture is facebook s payment service calibra which some pundits believe could bring about a revolution in online commerce by enabling micropayments christophe uzureau a blockchain analyst at research and advisory company gartner told world finance facebook increasingly invests in payment systems with services such as facebook pay and that reflects a fundamental shift of strategy they do not want to be perceived as a media company and they are also trying to reduce their reliance on advertising revenue shifting to e commerce is an important component of this strategy while facebook has stressed this won t be the case a potential combination of calibra and facebook pay could be a catalyst for this shift the withdrawal of important partners may set back these plans however ebay s departure was particularly damaging depriving libra of a global marketplace of 182 million consumers while credit card companies mastercard and visa could have helped introduce the cryptocurrency to older audiences the project would have also benefitted from access to the global network of merchants using stripe or paypal to process payments some experts though believe that calibra could emerge as a competitor to these companies in time the question is whether paypal and the credit card companies can survive without libra sinclair davidson an associate at rmit university s blockchain innovation hub told world finance andreas m antonopoulos an author and educator who has published several books on cryptocurrencies believes there is a generational aspect that favours libra too libra and other corpocurrencies are most threatening to the existing financial system they can serve the millennial demographic much better than existing banks and payment providers it s most useful to think of them as a super paypal than a cryptocurrency others are more sceptical about the threat calibra would pose to payment powerhouses david shrier an expert on financial innovation who leads the fintech and blockchain strategy programmes at oxford university s saïd business school told world finance apple card google s rumoured addition of checking accounts to google pay and offerings out of china like alipay are a more serious threat a crumbling coalition while major partners have pulled out of the project other organisations are jumping on the libra bandwagon in fact the libra association announced in june 2019 that more than 1 500 organisations had expressed an interest in getting involved with the project around 10 percent of which met the preliminary membership criteria however the withdrawal of household names such as visa and ebay has brought the project s viability as well as potential imbalances in its internal governance into question as uzureau explained facebook calibra and the libra association are tightly aligned as of the end of october all the money invested in the libra association comes from facebook none of the other members have contributed so far so facebook is likely to shape libra s governance model according to its own preferences facebook and calibra engineers are behind the libra protocol and the programming language move although no official explanation was given for the libra association exodus it is widely assumed that regulatory concerns played a crucial role sedunov told world finance i think that the companies left the association at least in part because of the high level of scrutiny that facebook is facing from regulators around the world it may end up being just too costly to launch the project there is also risk involved with an innovation like this and perhaps these firms didn t like the level of risk that the project would require in october 2019 senate democrats sherrod brown and brian schatz warned mastercard visa and stripe that their involvement could pose a threat to the financial system if you take this on you can expect a high level of scrutiny from regulators not only on libra related payment activities but on all payment activities and after the companies announced their withdrawal brown commented large payment companies are wise to avoid legitimising facebook s private global currency facebook is too big and too powerful and it is unconscionable for financial companies to aid it in monopolising our economic infrastructure for antonopoulos such regulatory pressure stresses the need for cryptocurrencies were basically threatened with audits for even being part of the that kind of extra legal coercion by regulators and legislators is one of the reasons cryptocurrencies exist and are needed ironically sedunov believes the departure of household names from the coalition will make regulatory approval a thornier process these exits can also make the regulatory hurdles facebook is facing more difficult to clear the credibility loss also matters as individuals may be less likely to adopt libra if it is a facebook only project relative to a project with backing from the full association for his part facebook ceo mark zuckerberg testified in front of congress pledging that libra would not be launched anywhere else before getting the green light in the us he did however warn that if america doesn t innovate our financial leadership is not guaranteed and pointed to china s development of a government backed cryptocurrency as evidence of that fact some think libra may be more successful in laxer regulatory regimes where the need for alternatives to fiat currency is more evident as shrier explained to world finance political resistance is the big obstacle to libra s success with the major countries in the eu lining up to keep you out france notably stating libra will be banned from the country you lose a market of 500 million people china is unlikely for market penetration due to the dominance of baidu alibaba and tencent plus the launch of china s this means libra could be launched but will probably have more traction in emerging markets where the political will to ban them is weaker you shall not pass for the time being facebook faces an uphill battle to overcome regulatory hurdles with critics pointing to its potential threat to national sovereignty as a main point of contention according to davidson cryptocurrencies such as libra could undermine the ability of states to use financial sanctions as a foreign policy tool another risk is that central banks may lose their grip on monetary policy by controlling the supply of money making them toothless when the next financial crisis strikes the advent of corporate cryptocurrencies could force governments and central banks to enter the fray dirk niepelt a professor of economics at the university of bern believes currency exchange rates may also be affected when customers hold libras they indirectly hold dollar or euro securities accordingly the demand for dollars or euros rises if customers who used to hold say rupees switch to libra but the demand for rupees would fall in europe french minister of the economy and finance bruno le maire dismissed libra as an unacceptable venture that would see a private company controlling a common good and taking over tasks normally discharged by states the european commission has also launched an investigation into potentially anti competitive behaviour and like other cryptocurrencies libra has been accused of being a potential conduit for money laundering although juan llanos a new york based expert on fintech compliance dismissed these concerns as scaremongering in an interview with world finance if a digital record keeping system had a way to attach the real world identity of each user to each transaction it would be less attractive to criminals well libra is such a system it s digital traceable potentially indelible for shrier though facebook s leading role in the project is problematic libra has political toxicity around it due to facebook s continued involvement arguably libra can t work without facebook one of the world s largest marketing platforms yet it is that very involvement that makes libra s launch so challenging over the past few years facebook has been embroiled in several scandals concerning privacy and manipulation some of which had serious political ramifications notably the role the company s data played in the lead up to the uk s eu membership referendum and the 2016 us presidential election shrier continued politicians have facebook in their crosshairs due to the numerous and repeated privacy violations mishandling of personal data and suggested impact on sovereign elections making libra s market access problematic facebook has attempted to alleviate these concerns clarifying that it will keep transactional data separate from other facebook services and ensure the identities of users are not tied to transactions many critics take these assurances with a pinch of salt pointing to loopholes such as asking users to accept sharing their libra related data to access other facebook owned apps as uzureau told world finance if calibra is the only wallet available on facebook services including facebook facebook messenger whatsapp and instagram it becomes very easy for facebook to use libra as a reward programme for sharing data so if a user agreed to share more data they could offer them more units of libra the risk is that the customer would be highly dependent on such an ecosystem a swift response the advent of corporate cryptocurrencies such as libra may force governments and central banks to enter the fray a 2019 survey of central banks conducted by the bank for international settlements found that 70 percent of respondents were conducting research on central bank backed digital currencies cbdcs or were considering launching digital currencies of their own central banks in china sweden and thailand for example are expected to issue cbdcs in the coming years while outgoing bank of england governor mark carney has called for an international cbdc to replace the dollar as the global reserve currency although national digital currencies wouldn t compete with the likes of libra due in large part to the fact they would be pegged to fiat currencies and would be centrally controlled they could contribute to the acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate means of transaction shrier believes the announcement of libra s launch may have concentrated minds if anything libra served as a wake up call to governments to move faster libra s biggest threat today is and alipay tomorrow it s possibly a federation of government digital currencies as for commercial banks libra is an enigma wrapped in a riddle by rattling the cages of the financial system it may push them to reconsider some of their practices especially the use of services like messaging network swift which is often dismissed as being antiquated some fear that libra may turn facebook into a competitor with the libra association effectively operating as a private central bank in an interview with the financial times weil acknowledged that calibra could offer services traditionally provided by banks but dismissed speculation that facebook has bigger ambitions we re not a bank we don t view ourselves that way we re not offering interest for example and things that banks do chain reaction for the blockchain community the advent of libra has been equally frustrating some pioneers have hailed it as a major event that will make cryptocurrencies more popular but critics see it as a betrayal of blockchain s libertarian origins bitcoin s greatest selling point was the creation of a decentralised financial system that wouldn t allow any participant to become dominant effectively ending the monopoly of governments and central banks over money supply by rattling the cages of the financial system libra may push commercial banks to reconsider their practices according to llanos though that was a naive vision from the outset they overestimated the capabilities of the technology and underestimated the power of the market constraints on the one hand the technology itself is very immature as are one may argue many of its supporters on the other hand human nature hit the ceiling of the law and indifference of public opinion libra is closer to a centralised model only permitting members of the libra association to process transactions via the blockchain the authors of the currency s white paper express hopes of moving to a permissionless system within five years but acknowledge that no solution currently exists that can deliver the scale stability and security needed to support billions of people and transactions across the globe through a permissionless network many experts doubt that such a transition is feasible or even desirable the white paper was a naive pipe dream antonopoulos told world finance without decentralisation of control you cannot have permissionless operations or any of the other characteristics of cryptocurrency given the amount of research showing that permissionless consensus mechanisms can be improved uzureau believes scale is being used as an excuse to justify a centralised governance structure being centralised or decentralised is not a dichotomy it s a continuum you could move a bit more towards decentralisation but the question is can you reverse it if calibra becomes the main wallet used for libra transactions and facebook has a lot of power on how libra is used as part of its ecosystem they could influence the evolution of libra and reverse the process of decentralisation some go one step further pointing to facebook s track record libra as a cat s paw for facebook has no strategic interest in becoming permissionless or decentralised shrier said zuckerberg swore when he bought whatsapp that he wouldn t break the end to end encryption and run ads and whatsapp s founder left facebook when plans changed to do exactly that so i wouldn t count on much in the way of consistency in libra s strategy but should libra s partners manage to build a cryptocurrency that is permissionless and scalable the rewards could be massive this is a 29trn question davidson said referring to rmit blockchain innovation hub s estimates of the size of the booming cryptocurrency economy i m not greedy i would just like one percent
what s new niger s informal systems for managing violence related to drug gold and people trafficking in the country s north are under strain due in part to european pressure to curb migration and in part to increased competition over drug transport routes the discovery of gold could bring new challenges why does it matter tacit understandings between the authorities and traffickers pose dangers namely the state s criminalisation as illicit trade and politics become more intertwined but the collapse of those understandings would be still more perilous if trafficking disputes descend into strife they could destabilise niger as they have neighbouring mali what should be done niger should reinforce its conflict management systems action against traffickers should focus on those who are heavily armed or engage in violence niamey and external actors should reinvigorate the north s formal economy european leaders should ensure that their policies avoid upsetting practices that have allowed niger to escape major bloodshed executive summary for years nigerien leaders have limited trafficking related bloodshed in the country s north through tacit understandings with those involved but today such tactics are under stress the north s once booming illicit economy took a hit in 2015 when the government banned migrant smuggling under european pressure at the same time heightened competition over drug trafficking routes has upped tensions and now newly discovered gold brings its own risks niamey should shore up its informal conflict management initiatives and strengthen the north s formal economy while simultaneously confronting the most violent traffickers international actors particularly european leaders keen on curbing migration should back this two track approach foreign militaries that now focus primarily on fighting jihadists should avoid getting sucked into efforts to disrupt illicit trade the escalation of trafficking disputes into open armed conflict would almost certainly fuel the militancy and migration that western governments hope to contain over the past twenty years trade in drugs gold and people has generated unprecedented revenue in northern niger to safeguard their interests amid stiffer competition traffickers have hired armed groups some of whom are bandits and others ethnic minority rebels they have also cut deals with state officials whether to shield their business activity from official scrutiny or to buy soldiers services in protecting their convoys some have become legitimate businessmen and even entered national politics for their part central and local nigerien authorities have mostly sought to manage rather than stop trafficking focusing on resolving quarrels between rival kingpins lest they escalate into communal fighting managing illicit commerce has often been an important means of strengthening weak economies and incorporating ex rebels in government many locals regard the new class of politically connected traffickers warily many locals regard the new class of politically connected traffickers warily they worry that these men could ally with particular political factions for mutual advantage hollowing out state institutions co opting state security forces and in effect turning the state into a criminal enterprise these concerns are serious but for now niger is better off continuing to compromise with traffickers provided that these understandings deter violence such accommodation has worked well in agadez where the state has integrated previously disaffected tuareg elites into the state and used dialogue to ensure that illicit commerce yields economic benefits for locals in contrast similar informal systems are lacking in the far north kawar region where tebu elites nurse grievances against the state and trafficking disputes have aggravated friction between tebu and tuareg the area also suffers from conflicts spilling over from southern libya and northern chad adding to the difficulties that national and regional authorities face there an uptick in foreign involvement in the sahel brings another challenge as foreign governments step up campaigns to counter jihadism and seal off migration routes to europe trafficking is under fresh scrutiny not only are european governments determined to stem the northward flow of migrants but they and other foreign actors increasingly cast trafficking as a security risk that bankrolls militants and undermines the state a 2015 law passed largely due to foreign pressure banned migrant transport a lucrative business with little negative impact upon niger itself and threw the northern economy into disarray were it not for a gold mining boom which happened around the same time and absorbed unemployed migrant smugglers the economic damage could have been much worse many of the jobless men might have found their way into armed groups and competition for scarce resources could have taken more lives niger and its partners should focus on containing trafficking s potential to drive violence local mediation initiatives which have prevented clashes among rivals particularly around agadez and deterred communal conflict tied to illicit commerce should continue nigerien authorities should be particularly cautious in attempting to disrupt trafficking in kawar instead seeking to establish similar conflict management systems to those in agadez at the same time the nigerien authorities should confront those traffickers who are heavily armed or engage in violence the state should tailor its tactics from military action to prosecution to stripping of political privileges based on what is mostly likely to work with each individual or network it should also do more to create alternatives in the formal economy starting by investing in road construction electrification and better management of resources the eu and european governments should ensure that policies aimed at disrupting trafficking to do not inadvertently fuel the trends they aim to curtail european leaders appear set to keep placing high priority on curbing migration even if the number of people passing through niger has dropped considerably since 2015 critical is that their policies do minimal economic damage and do not upset the informal systems that have allowed niger to escape major violence even as neighbouring libya and mali collapsed foreign military operations that for now concentrate on tackling islamist militancy should avoid getting involved in efforts to disrupt trafficking which would inevitably embroil them in local politics the eu should also take care that development programs do not give the sense of favouring one community over another and thus exacerbate ethnic competition the collapse of the fragile equilibrium that niger has more or less maintained over the past decade would almost certainly play into the hands of militants and further stimulate northward migration dakar niamey agadez brussels 6 january 2019 loading video crisis group s sahel expert hannah armstrong explains that trafficking has long sustained livelihoods in northern niger crisisgroup i introduction the illicit movement of people and goods has recently become a central concern of the nigerien state and its international partners since 2015 the eu and its member states have set a high priority on stopping human trafficking by which they mean in effect all forms of illegal migration they have focused significant efforts on niger a hub for migrants headed for the maghreb and or europe particularly in the wake of conflicts in libya and mali off the books trade in commodities especially drugs and gold is creeping up the international agenda as well governments increasingly see it as a possible funding source for jihadists operating in the sahel including niger foreign military forces in the region are under growing pressure to treat traffickers of drugs and gold as potential terrorists to some degree nigerien authorities have taken on board the thinking that a modern state cannot tolerate a thriving black market illicit exchange in the sahel is not inherently nefarious or destabilising to the state in reality illicit exchange in the sahel is not inherently nefarious or destabilising to the state some such activities in niger such as importation of semtex explosives from libya or movement of people to be sold into prostitution and slavery are indeed alarming for their part european governments and thus the eu see curtailing migration in all its forms as a priority due to strong domestic political pressure in truth though much illicit activity ranging from the smuggling of algerian spaghetti to subsidised gasoline poses little threat even facilitating the movement of people has a long history in niger only with the rise in migration through the sahel owing in large part to libya s collapse that uptick itself coming on top of european concerns over large numbers of syrian refugees has it generated controversy indeed for years informal trade including migrant smuggling has reinforced niger s stability creating jobs generating revenue and helping link northern political elites to the state thus far niamey has been able to curb escalations in trafficking related violence by informally managing illicit activities through tacit understandings with those involved this report examines the risks in this approach but also the dangers in adopting the harder line that some western governments are pushing for it focuses on the most lucrative illicit businesses in migrants gold and illegal drugs research was carried out in niamey agadez and iferouane in april june and december 2018 and february 2019 as well as in the u s in april 2019 crisis group spoke with actors including traffickers northern elites gold miners central state policymakers security officials western diplomats and humanitarian agency officers the report builds on crisis group s work on drug trafficking and violence in northern mali which highlights the risks and costs of failing to manage illicit trade ii new stresses and risks of violence much of what today is called trafficking in northern niger was considered virtuous necessary for livelihoods and survival often technically legal and threatening to no one until the 1990s subsidised food products and petrol from algeria and libya travelled south driving down the local cost of staples sub saharan migrants rode north via agadez to work in libya and algeria the state considered migrant transit irregular but not illegal such flows sustained struggling communities amid frequent droughts and famine in the 1970s and 1980s they were consistent with the self image of the tuareg and tebu peoples who identify culturally as transporters of goods and people across the sahara the north s illicit economy has boomed since the 1990s in part because of a decline in the licit economy notably tourism and uranium mining tourism was a robust source of jobs and revenues in the 1970s and 1980s but it has struggled to rebound after rebellions in the 1990s and from 2007 to 2010 as well as the 2010 kidnapping of seven foreign workers uranium mining has been hit by volatile commodity prices two mines in the north produced 74 8 per cent of niger s total exports in 2011 but just 36 7 per cent in 2017 with revenues falling by 15 million from 2014 to 2015 regional authorities say they still receive the 15 per cent of uranium royalties the northern communes are entitled to by law but only irregularly since 2015 companies in the uranium sector have laid off more than two thousand salaried workers and subcontractors youth unemployment in the formal sector in northern niger has risen as high as 80 per cent against this backdrop illicit economies are a lifeline but a fraying one trafficking livelihoods have become increasingly unstable and unsafe political pressure from several european countries and the eu has led to a crackdown on niger s migrant transport business competition for control of drug trafficking routes a major factor in the crisis in mali next door has intensified discovery of large gold deposits in the north and far north has created new rents to fight over while attracting the predation of non state armed groups western countries are also pressing niger to take a stronger stance against trafficking that they believe helps finance islamist militancy a the 2015 migrant smuggling ban from the end of the tuareg rebellion in the mid 1990s until 2015 transporting migrants across niger into north africa was a lucrative socially acceptable profession especially for unemployed former rebels around 50 agadez based migrant travel agencies run by mainly tuareg and some tebu former rebels maintained networks extending as far west and south as ghana senegal and nigeria migrant travel agents operated with licences stamped at city hall and military escorts they could make as much as three million west african francs roughly 5 000 per week and employed a myriad of subcontractors vehicle owners drivers drivers assistants guides pullers who fetch migrants from bus stations caterers guards and motorbike taxi drivers beyond the estimated 7 000 people directly employed by the agencies tens of thousands including civil servants soldiers and customs officials benefited from migrant travel s dividends as a technical adviser in agadez said it gave people money in their pockets right away everyone received something banks made money off the transfers the commune earned taxes security forces collected payments farmers and herders sold food it all entered into the economic circuits migration took over where tourism left off military men in iferouane during festival themed security and tourism crisisgroup julie david de lossy the industry had a dark side in niger migrants were often trapped in ghettos waiting for the money or means of transport to continue their journey with some forced into labour and abused those transiting through libya faced high risk of being sold into conditions close to slavery tortured and or sexually exploited particularly after the state s collapse with the 2011 ouster of long time leader muammar al qadhafi but despite the dangers faced by some migrants the nigerien state tolerated people smuggling as a critical source of revenue by 2015 it was contributing an estimated 60 billion west african francs 100 million to the agadez regional economy per year this picture changed in 2015 on 25 may that year in a move officially intended to protect migrant rights and niger s borders but in large part the result of european lobbying to curb migration parliament passed a law banning the passing of migrants the law first enforced in 2016 dramatically reduced the number of migrants travelling north from the agadez region according to figures from the international organization for migration numbers fell from 333 000 in 2016 to 69 000 in 2017 many nigeriens perceive the billion euros that the eu has committed in aid to niger for 2017 2020 as a quid pro quo for this law and its enforcement european officials themselves pressured by right wing populist movements at home justify the pressure exerted on niamey by saying they worry about migrants exploitation northern authorities and residents describe the law s economic impact as devastating according to one estimate the commune of dirkou alone is losing 20 million west african francs approximately 30 000 in revenue every month dozens of travel agencies have closed and thousands who were employed in the sector have suddenly found themselves jobless the 2015 law had other harmful effects it empowered the security forces to stop citizens of west african countries and detain nigerien drivers for no other reason than being together in a vehicle headed north in niger transporting or simply hosting west african nationals can bring penalties of up to 30 million west african francs 50 000 in fines and 30 years in prison the law additionally contravenes the economic community of west african states ecowas free movement protocol promoting borderless movement for citizens of member countries as yet niger has incurred no penalty but the law undercuts regional integration ambitions meanwhile migrant transport persists but has become far more dangerous smugglers avoid the main roads and use tracks across the desert to travel to libya leading to more deaths and more passengers abandoned somewhere in the sands the cost of passage has also increased by as much as four times b more competition for drug runners drug trafficking patterns have also evolved illicit trade across the sahel dates back decades in the 1990s and 2000s the region s traffickers began to move higher value products than cigarettes and subsidised goods such as hashish and cocaine most of these drugs are headed for europe the emergence of the sahel s hashish trade is linked to a rise in moroccan production in the early 1990s increased surveillance along direct routes from morocco to europe also meant that traffickers brought drugs on a circuitous path down and through the sahel before heading further north through libya or egypt in the early 2000s some sahel traffickers began specialising in cocaine which is 25 times more profitable than hashish by weight since the late 2000s other narcotics destined for export and local consumption such as tramadol have also appeared drug trafficking is more closely associated with violence than other contraband flows following the state s collapse in northern mali and southern libya drug runners armed themselves founding militias or paying jihadist and other armed groups for protection and or the right of passage in northern niger similar dynamics are at play though arrangements between officials and traffickers have kept violence to lower levels traffickers clash with each other and sometimes manipulate the police into targeting rivals but the drug trade has not yet generated large intra and intercommunal conflicts as in northern mali or open gang warfare that said competition over drug trafficking routes has become fiercer and the risk of violence has risen since 2016 that year established kingpin cherif ould abidine died due to illness and smaller operators scrambled to grab shares of the market he had controlled armed robberies of drug convoys increased leading traffickers to seek protection some bandits might intercept a convoy and then sell it back to its owner these dynamics could produce a militarised drug economy similar to that in northern mali if the drug runners rivalries heat up further c the gold rush another hot commodity in niger is gold long a fixture in west africa and parts of chad and sudan in early 2014 a nigerien tebu who had mined the precious metal in the chadian tibesti region found deposits at djado a remote 100km long valley in tebu territory in niger s far north the discovery set off a sahelian gold rush pushed along by high gold prices and additional finds elsewhere in the area thousands of prospectors including local tebus zaghawas from chad sudanese and migrants on their way to europe came to djado hoping to strike it rich traditional leaders and regional authorities established a sort of regulation issuing their own permits to miners in exchange for a fee in niamey however the state initially took a laissez faire approach as word of the discoveries spread bandits began preying on both miners and convoys carrying gold to market stealing the gold and then hiding out in the kawar wilderness or across the chadian and libyan borders the first known incident occurred in 2014 when tebus who had been expelled from the djado site battled with zaghawas who were working there in february 2017 in response to escalating violence the government closed the djado mines and transferred thousands of nigerien miners to agadez and sites in the aïr region militants operating along the niger chad libya border had started intercepting convoys hauling drugs cars and gold in northern niger the closure of djado sparked clashes among nigerien security forces zaghawas and tebus a second gold mining site tchibarakaten in aïr near the algerian border opened months after djado in 2014 the miners who flocked to tchibarakaten were chiefly of the ishumar unemployed generation of former tuareg rebels they staked claims and hired southern workers to do the hard digging the gold at tchibarakaten was buried deeper than at djado so extracting it required more labour and special machinery by 2016 up to 10 000 miners were working in more than 600 pits with numerous secondary and tertiary industries cropping up to cater to their needs tchibarakaten thus absorbed some of the people who had lost their jobs due to the migrant smuggling ban as well as laid off uranium miners and returnees from war torn libya man in the aïr desert crisisgroup julie david de lossy the region is distant from the capital and awash in small arms at tchibarakaten unlike at djado the central state regional elites and population cooperated to design a system of management that has kept violence in check miners there have a union that represents them vis à vis the state they pay annual taxes of 15 000 west african francs 26 per pit to the municipal treasury of iferouane the nearest town the town s mayor sends a representative to the site to collect those taxes more than 200 gendarmes and nigerien armed forces troops provide security in return once a week the military escorts a convoy of 50 landcruisers carrying gold to the nearest transit point south arlit both the finance and mines ministers have visited the site as has the agadez governor the mines ministry granted local elites the right to dig on plots where artisanal miners were already active causing tensions but local tuaregs such as the agadez regional assembly president held lengthy negotiations that produced an arrangement that shared extraction rights and was satisfactory to both sides such arrangements which reflect a sophisticated balancing act that straddles formal procedure and informality come with risks the connections among state authorities regional elites and traffickers are key to northern niger s stability but the lack of a formal regime means that powerful actors may be tempted to overturn these arrangements by force if they perceive their interests are seriously threatened that the region is distant from the capital and awash in small arms makes the danger all the more real gold mining at tchibarakaten while less volatile than at djado thus could also be a cause of conflict as mining develops it combines aspects of licit and illicit commerce the state imposes permits licences and taxes at the point of extraction but little to no regulation on exports the mines themselves may be subject to sudden policy shifts that remove miners access to rents they perceive as theirs for instance the government might bring in foreign companies to run the mines in exchange for budgetary subsidies in the form of permit fees and royalties such a move could cause a backlash unless managed carefully d international pressure the footprint of foreign powers in the sahel has been growing since 2013 when france launched operation serval to expel islamist militants from towns in northern mali french forces now operate in niger as well the u s is also expanding its military presence in the country especially the use of unmanned aerial vehicles with three bases in niger including a 100 million air base in agadez where u s officers are training the nigerien air force in addition belgium canada germany russia and the united arab emirates have troops in niger or have signed agreements committing to send them soon officially these are all counter terrorism missions but various unofficial aims are also in play including containing migration controlling borders and securing access to natural resources like the uranium from northern niger that fuels french nuclear power plants the main foreign agency explicitly mandated to fight illicit commerce is the eu capacity building mission in niger eucap a civilian team dispatched in 2012 its core mandate is to train advise and equip nigerien authorities mostly civilian but some military working to combat the nexus of organised crime and terrorism eucap trained niger s central office for the fight against international drug trafficking which provided intelligence that supported a major cannabis seizure in june 2018 its remit expanded in 2015 to assist nigeriens in dismantling migrant smuggling networks and it built facilities and deployed staff in agadez city to be closer to northern trafficking hubs eucap has a non executive mandate which means that it supports niger in investigations but cannot initiate its own the u s embassy has tried to complement this approach by promoting law enforcement and providing the nigerien authorities with capacity training while for now the french and u s militaries target traffickers in niger only when the link to terrorism is clear there is a risk of mission creep debates in paris and washington are circling around the question of the extent to which trafficking helps bankroll islamist militancy some military officials say these activities generate a substantial portion of jihadist groups revenue intelligence agencies may see containing the black market or disrupting certain actors access to its revenues as key to counter terrorism some western officials lean toward expanding their counter terrorism mission in the sahel to disrupt trafficking contraband accounts for perhaps only around a fifth of jihadists income others however are more reticent some foreign military officials recognise that niger s northern population northern elites and to some extent national authorities depend upon the revenues and jobs that illicit trade provides aggressive campaigns against it would risk doing economic harm and provoking local anger some officials add that traffickers are a unique source of intelligence since they regularly traverse spaces where jihadists operate and the state is weak or non existent trafficking they argue is organised crime a problem for law enforcement agencies rather than the military they say contraband accounts for perhaps only around a fifth of jihadists income not an inconsequential amount but also not the main source of financing the costs of targeting trafficking for them outweigh the benefits but even if french and u s military operations against jihadists do not explicitly target criminal networks they are expanding which in itself raises difficult questions about how to deal with traffickers who may have indirect connections to militants the first challenge is the fluidity among many local actors and lack of clarity on who is doing what in northern niger an influential figure may be a trafficker one day a rebel the next and a partner of jihadists the third traffickers themselves may feed foreign forces false intelligence as a way to settle scores in practice it is harder for french and u s forces to avoid getting sucked into confrontation than they admit a second problem is the reliance on drones the u s military has been building drone bases as a substitute for commando raids since the calamitous october 2017 operation in tongo tongo that left four american and five nigerien soldiers dead u s forces often depend on their nigerien counterparts to identify targets for us a guy in the desert with an ak 47 is a terrorist but the nigeriens tell us no banditry is ok for tuareg factions but we don t know which they are unless we capture them and ask them what they re doing feeding their families or funding terrorists in mali to date if the nigeriens tell us they are bandits and not terrorists we have to accept that local teacher in agadez crisisgroup julie david de lossy yet such an approach carries graver risks indeed if anything the main danger is not that nigerien authorities might portray terrorists as traffickers but that they might cast traffickers as terrorists some nigerien officials have their own black market interests senior military officers and low ranking soldiers alike have long been involved in illicit trade doing everything from taking payoffs to letting drug traffickers go to seizing their shipments and reselling the narcotics themselves unless the u s and french militaries devise clear and effective safeguards they run the risk of being manipulated as their partners on the ground try to settle scores aggravating local competition still another concern is that nigerien authorities themselves under observation may feel compelled to arrest traffickers when tips come in from french or u s intelligence networks in the field security forces face greater western pressure to stop and seize leading to higher risks of confrontation by cracking down they may close avenues for negotiation with traffickers making it more difficult for them to mitigate the risk of violence iii how niger contains trafficking related violence over the past decade nigeriens have developed their own ways to regulate black markets and limit the violence they generate in large part thanks to political decentralisation niamey authorities and northern elites who used to fight over the north s resources have learned to cooperate in managing the region s illicit trade co management has helped niamey and leaders in agadez preserve stability in parts of the north despite new pressures and regional disruptions it has also allowed the state to extend its reach into hard to penetrate areas and placate otherwise intractable groups niger has been particularly successful in mollifying the tuareg in the centre north it has struggled to do the same with the tebu of the far north a co managing the illicit economy niger has largely kept a lid on violence related to trafficking over the past decade from 2008 nigerien traffickers interests overlapped with those of rebels against the state as they did in northern mali in the same period during the nigerien movement for justice mnj rebellion drug traffickers began hiring armed guards including bandits but also rebels to protect their convoys the rebels for their part began to see drug trafficking as a financing instrument but whereas in northern mali similar dynamics exacerbated armed conflict in northern niger trafficking related violence has been contained since the mnj revolt ended in 2010 showing how traffickers may sometimes have an interest in tamping violence down to maintain an environment safe for business in niger those who transport particularly valuable illicit goods such as drugs gold and migrants have frequently been a force for stability and even peace in the case of the drug trade cherif ould abidine a particularly powerful trafficker arguably delivered a period of stability notwithstanding the damage done by his criminal enterprise on one hand he paid off security officials to secure safe passage for convoys of drugs across northern niger enriched his inner circle by procuring fat state contracts and through a mix of intimidation and funding removed democratically elected officials who resisted him and replaced them with his own allies on the other he pacified trafficking routes running from the malian to the libyan and chadian borders managed rival interests and kept roving bandits at bay the result was relative calm in northern niger from 2010 to 2016 amid unprecedented regional turbulence including state collapse in neighbouring libya 2011 and mali 2012 as one official says we can t stop the trafficking so it s better to be inside nigerien authorities facing a choice between fighting such prominent traffickers or working with them to reduce violent confrontations between them and competitors have tended to embrace the latter option traffickers and the state have often forged common interest in managing the illicit economy to safeguard stability in pursuit of this goal as well as at times their own personal profit figures within the central state have partnered with powerful traffickers with northerners with access to these networks sometimes acting as go betweens to mediate between them and the state and among the kingpins themselves as one official says we put men inside and we close our eyes to their activities we can t stop the trafficking so it s better to be inside this system has minimised violence in areas where the state is weak and illicit commerce dominates true it is delicate it needs to be constantly rebuilt or renegotiated as new actors emerge or old rivalries reignite it may also leave the state vulnerable to capture by criminal cartels but through their agents inside the trafficking networks state officials have been able to mediate conflicts among the major figures and prevent their disputes from kindling ethnic or other communal tensions for traffickers allying with state officials who can promise some degree of protection is preferable to relying on jihadists or others whom they can hire the payoff of cooperation with the state is entry into the nigerien elite some successful traffickers have gone on to found legal companies and fund political parties others have made the switch from rebel leaders to senior political officials who advise the government on managing the north s security and development challenges committees of northern elites with some support from niamey provide another form of conflict management around 2017 concerned by spiking sahel violence several such committees began organising dialogues many of them private forums to resolve disputes among traffickers and prevent communal fighting on several occasions these committees mediation de escalated quarrels that threatened to blow up into gun battles in 2018 for example the agadez regional peace committee brought together two powerful rival traffickers embroiled in a dispute over a cargo seizure that resulted in one of them narrowly escaping an assassination attempt the committee was able to broker a truce streets of agadez at the end of the day crisisgroup julie david de lossy b cooperation in the centre north while over the past decade niamey for the most part has contained trafficking related risks in the agadez administrative region its conflict management mechanisms are under strain the region is a vast harsh territory the size of france located over 960km north of the capital accessible only via a partially paved road and inhabited by fewer than half a million people its uranium mining revenues are an important prop for the government budget at the same time residents of this underdeveloped area many of whom are tuaregs have a history of revolt against the state many question the idea that it has their interests at heart young tuaregs in particular vie for a greater say in governance and a greater share of the area s resources in the centre north the government reached a series of political agreements with rebellious tuaregs in the early 1990s a 1995 settlement devolved administrative powers to a regional council and mayors offices devolution has helped fill regional government coffers for instance facilitating the tax deal between the miners union and the iferouane municipality at the tchibarakaten gold mines the central government also strengthened ties with agadez by promoting northern elites to senior positions particularly important was president mahamadou issoufou s 2011 appointment of brigi rafini a tuareg and former vice president of the national assembly 2004 2009 as prime minister other northern nomads have filled top posts under issoufou including interior minister mohamed bazoum an arab from the ouled slimane tribe and army chief of staff general ahmed mohamed a tuareg each of them counts various northerners among his advisers these include intellectuals but also ex rebels and men with known links to traffickers who serve as a channel for airing northern grievances as a result niamey could draw on the support of the country s tuareg elites when in mali the national movement for the liberation of azawad a tuareg rebellion took the northern city of gao in 2012 president issoufou held consultations with ex rebel chiefs that produced a nigerien doctrine oriented around dialogue and the containment of tuareg grievances in mali rafini the agadez regional council s president mohamed anacko and the haute autorité à la consolidation de la paix an office of northern intellectuals and military officers that helps carry out the peace agreements of the 1990s all worked with arab and tebu ex rebels to shelter niger from any spillover from the malian conflict later niamey s decision to grant the tuareg rights to artisanal gold mining at tchibarakaten softened the blow of the 2015 migrant smuggling ban such management of resources to benefit local populations has long been the central demand of rebellions in niger and elsewhere in the sahel regional initiatives headed by anacko have helped keep the peace but face new pressure particularly from young tuaregs who feel left out the agadez regional council has extended the state policy of advocating for northern interests launching development and security initiatives focused on the north anacko also heads the agadez based peace and security commission a body formed in 2017 and comprising traditional leaders civil society figures and government representatives this commission has launched a number of dialogues seeking to prevent communal clashes and to resolve disputes between traffickers these efforts like other trafficking management strategies will require constant renewal many young tuaregs complain that they reward an aging elite that capitalised on past rebellions and has not shared the fruits of its accommodation with the state c tensions in the far north strategies for managing trafficking that have worked well in the centre north have been lacking in the largely tebu far north kawar region niamey and tebu elites have not reached any agreement on power sharing resource distribution or collective security like the tuareg tebu in kawar consider transporting goods and people across the desert a cultural and economic necessity they also have long harboured grievances against the nigerien state primarily what they see as its neglect and lack of spending in their home area their exclusion from both political power and the benefits of the country s natural resources and a sense of being preyed upon by state forces unlike the tuareg the kawar tebu have little representation in the capital in part due to the region s remoteness and tebus attachments to other poles of influence in chad and libya niamey s interventions in the region thus often feel peremptory and unjust as in october 2018 when the government abruptly dismissed an influential tebu district chief in djado since 2016 tebu in the far north have come under additional strain many feel that the state is persecuting them by shutting down their gold and migrant trade without offering anything in return they resent what they perceive as the state s preferential treatment of the tuareg tebu relations with army units in kawar which according to a local expert comprise mostly ethnic hausa and zarma from the south remain fraught tebu merchants claim that these foreign army elements insult them and impose excessive customs dues upon them at checkpoints on the way from the libyan border to dirkou at the same time the tebu have faced internal tribal fragmentation as well when barka ouardougou a leader who had organised and presided over various clans died without leaving a successor in this atmosphere more tebu youths are resorting to drug running and banditry tuareg tebu relations have deteriorated in the far north events in libya have contributed both groups trade and fight in libya but young tuaregs feel that tebus have benefited from the conflict at their expense altercations between traffickers and bandits known as coupeurs de route are also stoking tensions between the two groups tuareg traffickers say highway robbery is their foremost security concern and claim that the bandits are tebu other sources say the bandits are chadian or zaghawa and sometimes report them wearing chadian military uniforms in june 2018 young tuaregs involved in transporting goods in the aïr a mountainous region in the centre north demanded that security forces take action against raiders they called foreign bandits soon afterward the military sent units to confront a band of militants thought to be chadian who had been operating in the region for months kidnapping people and stealing vehicles the deployment demonstrated both the government s will to respond and coordination between national and aïr regional leadership but it did little to reverse rising banditry or rising interethnic hostility banditry is an existential threat not only for traffickers who are finding it harder to protect their cargo but also for ordinary people banditry is an existential threat not only for traffickers who are finding it harder to protect their cargo but also for ordinary people merchants drivers passengers whose livelihoods require that they move around coupeurs de route held up an estimated 300 vehicles in kawar in the past two years killing people in some of them a bandit is often a former rebel with no political connections the more bandits take up arms the more the state deploys its own force leading in turn to traffickers running more heavily armed convoys according to a tuareg state official that s what set off the conflict in mali and it s what locals want to avoid in niger the lack of informal arrangements in kawar like those that exist further south to manage illicit economies limit violence and link political leaders to the centre heightens risks of violence and rebellion in the far north facing worsening insecurity as illicit trade becomes more dangerous tebus in kawar have launched new self defence groups several based in southern libya where the state is no longer present in 2016 together with tebus in manga in the south east they founded the mouvement pour la justice et la réhabilitation du niger which demands not only communal rights to revenues from a new oil field at agadem and the reopening of the djado gold mine but also a tebu sultanate camp fire in the aïr desert crisisgroup julie david de lossy d risks in niger s conflict management the downside of niger s pragmatic approach to managing illicit trade is that many state officials have acquired a personal interest in some of its forms the profit motive could come to trump the national interest in politicians decision making ushering in what some call the cartelisation of nigerien politics arguably the gravest danger is that rivalries among state factions arise and merge with violent competition among traffickers alliances between politicians and trafficking barons could aim to corner the market in a high priced commodity with politicians then using preferential access to state contracts and immunity from prosecution to protect their partners traffickers might use state intelligence and security forces to strike at one another such an incident may already have occurred on 14 june 2018 an anti drug unit seized two and a half tonnes of cannabis from a niamey warehouse two weeks after this record seizure went public gunmen tried to kill the would be successor of a powerful trafficker in agadez many suspected that the gunmen were taking revenge against the trafficker for tipping off the authorities about the cannabis the incident was especially worrying because one of those arrested at the warehouse had ties to a malian armed group indicating that the malian conflict could be spilling into niger the rise of traffickers and their proxies within political parties and military and intelligence agencies could also sharpen political rivalries while some senior officials believe these compromises facilitate management of the north others are concerned that they could undermine the state and lead to violence they are particularly apprehensive about the lead up to the 2021 presidential election in which president issoufou having served two terms is constitutionally barred from seeking a third meaning the contest to succeed him will be wide open iv using niger s strengths to its advantage upheavals in the illicit economy the crackdown on migrant smuggling the rise of new drug lords the emergence of semi formal gold markets and the risk that combating contraband is becoming a broader security goal are straining niger s strategies for containing violence linked to the black market the informal mechanisms that have helped keep the country relatively calm during a period of unprecedented regional turmoil remain fragile they face particular pressure as niger prepares for the 2021 presidential election when competition for resources and influence will heighten niamey and its international partners particularly the eu face difficult trade offs disrupting trafficking especially of drugs and people is a strong domestic imperative for european governments but taking further aggressive steps to do so could upset conflict management arrangements already under strain after the 2015 migrant smuggling ban the collapse of a reasonably stable country in the central sahel would almost certainly play into the hands of militants for now therefore reducing violence by targeting only kingpins responsible for bloodshed would be a safer goal than attempting to stop black market activities altogether at the same time niamey and international partners can take steps to develop the north s formal economy foreign powers providing military aid should watch that it does not hurt relations between niger s government and its citizens the eu and others should be careful that none of their interventions appear to favour one community over another and thus stoke conflict a prioritise the reduction of violence attempting to disrupt all forms of illicit commerce would risk creating conditions for rebellion in the north roiling its economy while pulling apart the state s alliance with the tuareg nigerien state and local authorities agree with french and u s commanders that traffickers will remain fixtures in the sahel for some time this reality does not mean rolling back the 2015 migrant smuggling ban but external actors should give space to the government s informal efforts to de escalate disputes among traffickers niamey should focus not on eliminating illicit trade altogether but on containing its potential for violence it should sanction only those with blood on their hands at the same time foreign military and law enforcement actors should avoid being manipulated by traffickers who may seek to misrepresent rivals as terrorists kawar merits particular care given that competition over contraband there has already produced armed movements the agadez based peace and security commission is an example of an effective local mediation initiative its members have intimate knowledge of the actors risks and effective modes of dialogue international partners should be aware of the commission s role in preventing black market disputes from escalating and might want to consult with the commission when developing their own policies for its part the commission should be as inclusive as possible involving more young people and representatives from a range of ethnic groups including tebu mediation initiatives in the agadez area may have succeeded in preventing violence from breaking out between tuaregs and tebus but they remain tuareg dominated the informal integration of traffickers into state institutions helps regulate the black market and contain its potential to produce violence the informal integration of traffickers into state institutions for example by permitting top figures to double hat as politicians or official advisers helps regulate the black market and contain its potential to produce violence this policy undoubtedly has downsides the rise of niger s criminal class could erode the state s integrity and capacity were the risk of conflict lower niger and its partners might want to root out criminal interests from state structures for now however the danger that contraband fuels armed conflict in northern niger is graver than that of state cartelisation niamey should therefore draw a line between those traders who invest in heavy weapons and resort to violence and those who do not and focus on the former the national security council the highest institution responsible for the country s security policy should explore options for holding violent traffickers to account it could use a range of policy tools to enforce a red line on violence depending on what is appropriate in a case by case scenario policies could range from military action to prosecution to stripping political privileges from a trafficker when security forces do arrest traffickers who resort to violence international security agencies with an anti trafficking mandate such as eucap and the g5 sahel joint force can help in contrast the french and u s militaries should stay out of such operations kawar which is already home to heavily armed traders in contraband is an area of particular concern authorities in niamey and kawar should look to agadez city and the aïr region for inspiration and strive to develop a shared system for managing formal and informal trade that addresses the needs of each side the state should look for ways to improve representation in government of kawar tebu who feel maltreated by nigerien security forces and pulled into tebu rebellions in libya and chad it should also deploy security forces to restore law and order while making sure they do not extort or prey upon locals authorities should complement this deployment with dialogue and development oriented outreach to the increasingly fractured and well armed tebu for example by regularly inviting tebu leaders from kawar to niamey to hear their concerns and smoothing over tensions that erupted with leaders at djado security staff at iferouane festival crisisgroup julie david de lossy b invest more in the formal economy although other more populous regions have greater needs niger and its partners should pay particular attention to developing economic opportunities for northerners trafficking and smuggling will likely always be more lucrative than licit activities but the more opportunities exist outside contraband the less likely it is that efforts to disrupt illicit trade leave people without livelihoods and vulnerable to recruitment into militant groups and the easier it would be for traffickers to transfer into more formal economic activities niamey should start by making full regular and transparent payment on the share of uranium revenues it owes to the northern communes and regional assembly transparency will require the authorities to clarify how much ore is extracted from each site how much revenue the government receives from mining companies and how much it is disbursing to the communes these tasks in turn require more effective internal and external auditing mechanisms in general the state should manage northern resources in ways that are self evidently beneficial to northerners which may mean ensuring that mining companies are paying local taxes northern niger needs roads and power actors like the eu could direct more of their funding to much needed but long delayed infrastructure development the government is working on electrification projects and agadez residents are eagerly anticipating a planned solar plant the government should expedite construction of the national road linking tahoua to arlit via agadez which has been plagued by fraud and procrastination for a decade funding national roads and the trans saharan highway initiative will also boost trade and create jobs agadez was an attractive destination for international tourists who now largely stay away due to its red security risk rating the revival of tourism in the regional capital agadez is an economic development priority for local officials and workers for decades agadez was an attractive destination for international tourists who now largely stay away due to its red security risk rating but no terrorist attack on security forces local civilians or foreigners has been reported in agadez since 2013 a better track record than in several european capitals france should lead the way by lowering the security risk rating of agadez city from red to orange when investing in the formal economy state authorities should avoid competing with informal activities and instead work in tandem with them mining in tchibarakaten is a good example of positive synergy between formal and informal management the mines nationalisation absorbed unemployed workers and injected money into a northern economy hit hard by the migrant smuggling ban negotiations among the state northern elites and miners representatives produced a sharing arrangement that moderated elite attempts to control large parts of the mines and thus protected the interests of those involved in informal mining including former migrant smugglers local perceptions that the mines benefit the area have improved security and contained banditry this arrangement balancing state needs and regulations with local ones could serve as a model for reopening the djado site conditions for which are under consideration the government should exercise caution ensuring that it has local buy in before offering licenses to foreign companies c avoid unintentionally destabilising niger particularly important is that foreign governments anticipate the potential trade offs in their policies they should minimise risks that efforts to curb migration and islamist militancy destabilise niger and potentially fuel the trends they aim to counter the need for caution applies especially to migration policy european politicians frame migration as a criminal activity that menaces niger s security but in reality they view it as a domestic security issue that can make or break european governments as one eu official noted we cannot admit that we are in niger to focus on stopping migration we have to demonstrate that our engagement is linked to criminality and factors that destabilise niger european pressure has reduced migration through niger but it has come with costs in one sense the drop off in the number of migrant departures from agadez is a victory for eu policy but smugglers tend to adapt quickly to obstacles finding new routes in fact 2018 migrant departure numbers from agadez had already climbed by 10 per cent compared to the previous year still more dangerously the 2015 migrant ban brought the northern economy to its knees at a time when the risk of conflict was uncharacteristically high it was arguably only a stroke of good fortune the gold rush that absorbed unemployed migrant smugglers and prevented the northern economy and niger s informal conflict management mechanisms from collapsing without that a scramble for scarce resources could well have escalated and threatened niger s stability likely fuelling militancy and violence touareg teenagers at iferouane festival crisisgroup julie david de lossy eu assistance contributed to intercommunal competition and deepened the sense of tebu exclusion other eu programs have also had unintended consequences in some cases programs designed to spur economic development and ease migrant smugglers into less lucrative but more sustainable professions have fuelled ethnic discord the eu meant to apply technical criteria to determine who was eligible for such support the programs aimed to exclude only those smugglers deemed to be major criminals in practice however most job retraining funds went into tuareg majority communes meanwhile tebus perceived that the government s parallel campaign of arrests and vehicle seizures was targeted at them in this case eu assistance contributed to intercommunal competition and deepened the sense of tebu exclusion given that the eu appears set on continuing to pursue policies aimed at containing migrant departures via the sahel it should strive to ensure that interventions do minimal economic damage do not upset niger s fragile conflict management systems and avoid exacerbating intercommunal tension where its interventions will have a disruptive social and economic impact as in the case of the migrant smuggling ban it should strive to anticipate these consequences and ensure that it more evenly distributes the economic assistance and alternative livelihoods it offers to those who lose out where its policies have a punitive element it should make sure that punishment is meted out equitably it should take special care to remove any taint of communal discrimination from its programs v conclusion niger is not like mali where the state s position with respect to drug trafficking in the country s north absent on one hand and complicit on the other has fuelled conflict by contrast state actors and related power networks in niger have managed contraband flows relatively peaceably though some of the compacts between the state and traffickers are fraying the eu has had some success in curbing migration flows but aggressively aiming to eradicate them further and ending other forms of trafficking in niger is neither realistic nor desirable a more pragmatic goal which political elites including northerners integrated into the state have been doing their best to pursue is to curtail violence that competition over illicit commerce produces niger and foreign powers should better coordinate their policy responses they should minimise the risk that interventions upset the delicate balances that often help maintain calm and ensure that conflict sensitive development programs accompany efforts to tackle illicit economies in the north nigerien state institutions and northern elites meanwhile must stay attentive to the risks associated with the rise of a criminal class in national politics they should mitigate these risks by cracking down on traffickers who turn to violence that way the nigerien state can continue managing trafficking rather than being managed by it dakar niamey agadez iferouane

previous political experience no prior political office why are you running for office i was born in baltimore and live in elkridge for more than 15 years i practice intensive care medicine in baltimore city and see more patients admitted from overdose and poor access to medical care than ever before there is gun violence in the city with 300 murders annually the poverty and dilapidated houses has the country believing we are a failed city this is maddening when you love this city and grew up here i didn t jump in this race for opportunity i began my candidacy before mr cumming s passing because i don t believe we ve had enough forceful advocates in congress or city hall the same politicians promise reform but are more focused on fundraising than they are willing to commit to changes that may disrupt political factions or special interests i am not beholden to these relationships and instead have a plan for the problems this district faces i will advance the debate on health care to reduce costs to the voters in our district and reform prescription drug prices i have a specific plan to improve drug addiction in the city and will personally work to bring financial help to improve the infrastructure and the poor housing availability i believe better education options for children and for adults is required as trade skills are in short supply but offer hope i will be present in the district and be seen working with local city leadership and community activists to make sure their voices are heard why am i running for office because just as a career in medicine is a calling my work as a representative will be my passion and obsession as i work for my constituents trump record how do you assess the trump administration so far name at least one positive and one negative in my opinion president trump embarrasses himself and demeans the office he holds his mockery and bullying is pathetic and he has no grasp of america s place as a beacon of hope he rolls over to corporate self interests never divested properly from financial gains from his office and abuses power for political gain or for spite he has driven a wedge between american citizens and widened this divide larger than in any time other than the civil war the turnover in his cabinet is emblematic of the shifting whims of his agenda there is no cohesiveness or coherence to his administration the limited positive results from his term have been prison reform which he can barely take credit for and a ban on bump stocks as you recall this had been promised then reneged then approved after he flipped repeatedly a final positive is the rise in activism spurred on by this president s behavior as a democrat i believe the future is brighter when we embrace inclusion and evolve to become a global leader in industry and humanity america is greater still when a president works to unify the nation appealing to all its citizens 2017 tax cuts what effect do you believe the federal tax cuts of 2017 have had on the economy thus far or will have in the future and why do you support the cuts the 2017 tax cuts were heralded by the president and treasury secretary mnuchin as a windfall for middle class americans now that time has passed it doesn t appear to have manifested quite that way and instead as many predicted became a vehicle for improved corporate earnings and tax savings for millionaires the corporate tax rate dropped from 35 to 21 percent and stocks reaped the benefit economists understand that the health of our economy is more than share prices on the dow and nasdaq most americans don t own stock and aren t reaping rewards of corporate profit taking in addition mnuchin said that not only would the gop s tax plan pay for itself but it will pay for the debt he also claimed it would cut down the deficits by a trillion dollars the deficit has climbed another 1 2 trillion in 2020 this public debt is up to 23 trillion i support cutting spending and reducing waste within the federal government balancing the budget and paying down the national debt one area of cost savings is working to reduce discretionary military funding from endless war and build up this small change alone could shore up the aca and social security income inequality is the level of economic inequality in the united states a problem and why or why not what if anything should the federal government do to address it yes the economic inequality in the u s is a problem because we aren t talking about the difference between one citizen owning a car and another owning a bicycle we are talking about one owning a space program and another suffering from malnutrition i believe the federal government should reduce loop holes in tax codes that have favored billionaires and improve basic support for food and shelter with these savings however the extent of inequality requires more than a quick fix from taxation we need re education for a workforce that has no skillset to find the jobs available i am in favor of improving availability of federal loans with low interest to students or adults seeking an advanced degree my vision includes a two year advanced degree that would be offered by public universities not just community colleges not all careers should require a four year undergraduate degree the degree for nursing computer science and education would focus specifically on course material for the degree and condense the credits within two years also a sector of instructional trade schools would also be subsidized for a two year period of training in these fields plumbing electric construction the jobs in trade would be created in part from the promised improvements in infrastructure i d concentrate my efforts on bringing improved transit to baltimore city and renovation of neighborhoods i plan a bill to revise the definition of an fha loan program to allow rental property investment in our city and drive up available jobs and quality rental home ownership opportunities in fact one of my initiatives for college loan consolidation includes forgiveness of a percentage when the total education loan is consolidated into a first time home loan from a neighborhood in need of rejuvenation gun laws should federal gun laws be changed and if so how and why as long as i am in office i will work to improve the poorly written gun laws the inaction on this issue is not just an indictment of ineffective government but is costing lives a majority of gun owners favor background checks prior to purchases1 but representatives allow loop holes at gun shows to remain we need an enforceable waiting period even for gun show purchases there should be federal red flag laws a person who threatens someone with death by firearm should not be allowed to own one and this is especially true when psychological illness is established we should bring a ban on high capacity magazines to the supreme court and consider including atf regulations that could regulate ammunition stockpiling law abiding citizens will still have access to firearms for hunting target practice and security but competency should be demonstrated with licensing yes illegal guns will remain a problem with these efforts but we will reduce access to weapons favored by mass shooters terrorizing our country specifically for illegal guns they should be destroyed when confiscated and not resold as they are in some districts across the country a pipeline of handguns from bordering states with poor controls fuels a baltimore glut of weapons only with better federal control will we be able to get a handle locally i am in favor of gun buyback programs but would consider whether there would be added incentive if the government not only offers cash for handguns assault weapons but also would consider leniency on future sentencing if there is a history of gun donations a judge often has discretion on jail time and a criminal may decide to gain favorable treatment by turning in a stockpile of weapons rather than leaving them behind 17 facts about guns in the u s by john gramlich and katherine schaeffer pew research center health care what should congress do with respect to the affordable care act how and why if you believe it should be scrapped what if anything should replace it my strength as a candidate comes from more fully understanding how health care can be improved without sacrificing quality care patient doctor satisfaction and cost containment other candidates may have health care or policy experience but haven t been on the front lines for the underserved and destitute to gain perspective on this issue i am not opposed to universal health care coverage but will want to go over the implementation cost and infrastructure with my democratic and republican colleagues in both the house and senate my initial plan would be to enact legislation to improve the affordable care act aca coverage for people over age 55yo and expand admission to the aca for a higher total income above the poverty line this could be paid for by eliminating waste inherent already in the health care system an article in journal of american medicine1 describes multiple functions of waste and cost savings upwards of 300 million annually my initiative to provide citizens with a universal health card would be coordinated with computer cloud data that allows a doctor to review medical records from your primary care physician anywhere in the country this immediately eliminates millions of unnecessary labs and tests performed simply because there is a void of data during a work up for sudden illness my prescription drug approach is similar to legislation under mr cummings name however the bill gives power to the secretary of health and human services the current secretary is a former pharmaceutical company ceo and lobbyist also there is too much emphasis on cost alone on the drugs selected for an annual price negotiation any drug required and proprietary should be reviewed based on not only cost but lives saved finally negotiation of lower cost should not be gifted to all other insurance providers if this negotiation is allowing lower cost then the other insurance providers should be required to assure savings are passed on to policy holders or perhaps that ceo compensation packages are regulated

should the federal government play in helping cities what if anything would you do for baltimore specifically this is misunderstood by many people who have called for investigations into mr cummings and the money allocated to our district over the years the narrative falsely accused him of mismanagement of government funds the president misquoted the amount of money and implied corruption the current federal expenditures include social security to citizens as well as to the social security administration located in baltimore there are also research dollars in the millions sent to the university of maryland and john hopkins university i would ask for the university of maryland and jhu to apply research more heavily into public health initiatives i d want to drive federal spending not only to the hospitals but also to the communities they serve so that real progress can be made in psychiatric care homelessness and hunger i will fight for federal government dollars to our city for subsidies to renovate dilapidated infrastructure i believe the fha loan program could be amended to include renovation of condemned real estate even if it is not the primary residence the result will be an investment opportunity to individuals who now could use the low interest cash to renovate a home that is either flipped for sale or rented the effect is at least three fold first improved jobs in the construction business second a rise in quality rentals for city residents third a renewed tax base for the city to use for improving security and promoting business in baltimore opioids do you back elijah cummings bill which republicans say is too expensive to provide 100 billion over 10 years to fight the opioid epidemic why or why not this is a question i ve considered carefully as a doctor caring for these patients the treatment of the opioid epidemic should include a multifaceted approach that addresses the illicit and prescription drug availability the addiction symptoms and cravings the lack of employment opportunities and the poverty causing citizens to look for a quick fix from drugs the bill introduced would be helpful but unsustainable and i believe impassable with today s republican objections unfortunately there are those on the right that consider drug abuse poor will power rather than a combination of societal ills plus physical needs my approach would be to expand treatment paid for in part from settlements related to false safety promises from the narcotic producing drug companies these multimillion dollar settlements from the makers of oxycodone and probably fentanyl should be directed to the epicenters of drug abuse baltimore city is one of the front lines in this war on addiction i believe we can also subsidize medication given intramuscularly called buprenophrine which relieves cravings and reduces any illegal high for a month once injected the data is sound and my approach already has evidence backed by research1 we can also fast track opioid and narcan antidote combinations2 to the u s market they are available in canada and have far less addiction potential they cannot be crushed or injected i am also confident that thoughtful

preserved why or why not the daca program should be preserved and reformed a pathway to citizenship should not rely on income ability to afford health insurance or country of origin the immigration challenge is felt more strongly on border states i don t reject border control but do expect better regulation of boundaries with smart technology we should not approve a budget for broad expanses of barriers without functionality the republican agenda has been to create panic among border states and throughout the country about a pipeline for terrorists and also demonized a minority in our population that has emigrated for opportunity or to avoid persecution i am in favor of providing this path to citizenship but make the paperwork initially easier and allow time for employment to be assisted the wall street journal makes a point that without more immigration the populations aging will lead to much lower ratio of young workers to old retired baby boomers1 deportation should be enforced when there is criminal activity conviction and we should remember that most violations are from extended stays from expired visas not illegal crossings finally ice as an entity should be

tied to better life for immigrants by miriam jordan may 7 2007 trade how would you rate the trump administration s trade stance with china and why i do believe we had to change the approach with china i would rate his approach a c incomplete and this is because our posture up until these tariffs has been ineffective chinese state sponsored industry and espionage has pilfered technology there has been manipulation of their currency to prop up their economy at the expense of our trade deficit waiting longer to take a tough stance would erode our bargaining position as the chinese economy may start divesting in the american bond market long term this relationship will change as we hope to rely less on the chinese exports and more on other emerging economies iran do you support the president s decision to pull out of the iran nuclear deal why or why not this seems to be a decision based on the president s mistrust of president obama and the iranians i was not in favor of the 1 7 billion in cash included in this deal during the obama administration s negotiation but i do believe there was value in the deal that was worth preserving there is always going to be mistrust and an expectation that iran is not cooperating with the terms of an agreement however iran can now proceed without any chance for international atomic energy association ground inspection i suspect this withdrawal increases the likelihood of an israeli air strike if the iranian program advances enrichment for weapons grade material north korea how should the united states address the rise of north korea s nuclear program this requires more information from the intelligence community unfortunately our president doesn t trust the united states intelligence community and may have already irreparably damaged our credibility across the globe if the north koreans continue to progress in guided missile technology then we must have chinese support and pressure the government to allow negotiation without the typical rhetoric on both sides this is a difficult question as there is already poor information about the north korean infrastructure and ignorance typically leads to poor decisions made from fear by resuming a dialogue with calm language alone we can offer loosening trade restrictions the more these low pressure meetings continue the more the north koreans can focus money on advancing the quality of life for their citizens the citizens in turn will invariably learn more about the west and internal evolution rather than revolution may surprise us climate change how should the united states address climate change we need to separate climate science from politics there should be engagement in the global community with reentry into the paris accord we should work on improvements in reducing nationwide greenhouse gas emissions by regulating industry and insisting on co2 scrubbers for the largest offending industrial polluters and reducing reliance on fossil fuels with federal subsidy of electric mass transit and improved battery technology the solar industry s new jobs were allowing the workforce to redistribute lost employment from manufacturing sent overseas with the proper stimulus we can regain momentum in photovoltaic technology from the foreign market republicans will want to point to solyndra s failure but there was a lot of good in the industry that shouldn t dissuade future investment with better due diligence for example with the investment by bill gates and others there is now a system regulated by artificial intelligence and

open this photo in gallery a flatbed truck placed by an angry lebanese client blocks the entrance to his bank branch in the southern lebanese city of sidon on jan 4 2020 after the establishment refused to allow him to withdraw his savings mahmoud zayyat afp getty images lebanon sailed through the financial crisis now it s lunging toward greek status and signs of a crisis are everywhere on friday a near riot broke out in a bank branch in the northern lebanese town of halba when customers complained that they couldn t withdraw cash lebanon is running short of u s dollars and banks everywhere have restricted their supply and put arbitrary limits on the withdrawal of lebanese pounds lebanon s national news agency reported a 10 hour standoff at the halba bank at one point security forces fired tear gas into the building and one customer was taken to hospital the good times in the middle east s favourite playground are over the cranes are idle in beirut corruption is rampant always has been the banks are in crisis and the debt choked government whose annual fiscal deficit is running at 10 per cent of gdp is starved for cash mass anti government protests since mid october have paralyzed the main cities and forced the resignation of prime minister saad hariri and his cabinet there is no economic salvation plan adding to the gloom is the possibility of war between iran and the united states tiny lebanon bordered by syria and israel and not far from iraq where a u s missile strike killed iranian general qassem soleimani on jan 3 lives in a rough neighbourhood the lebanese stock market is in the tank a recession seems imminent ratings agency fitch predicts a default on some us 88 billion of public debt an imf bailout may be in the works financial collapse while unlikely is not out of the question that s because lebanon where the iran backed hezbollah party and militia are formidable forces doesn t have a lot of friends at the moment on sunday hezbollah leader hassan nasrallah called for attacks on u s military sites in the middle east would u s president donald trump support an imf bailout of lebanon probably not i m very pessimistic about the economy kamal hamdan an economist and executive director of beirut s consultation and research institute said in an interview how did lebanon s apparently resilient largely open and buzzy entrepreneurial economy reach the cliff edge the country is largely the author of its own misfortunes even if the long syrian civil war on its border lebanon took in more than a million refugees didn t help an economic model based on massive consumption and borrowing was always unsustainable it just took a while for the proof to arrive mr hamdan says the roots of the crisis go back to the era of rafic hariri the wealthy businessman and father of saad hariri who was prime minister from 1992 to 1998 the first post civil war leader and again from 2000 to 2004 he was assassinated in 2005 he dropped the income tax rate to 10 per cent and went on a reconstruction borrowing spree at the same time warlords turned politicians bought votes by spending and hiring recklessly in their constituencies public expenditures exploded between 1993 and 2018 the government of this tiny country spent some us 240 billion but the vast majority of it went to current expenditures such as salaries not capital expenditures that could have created economic efficiencies the number of public servants rose fivefold to 300 000 then of course taxes had to rise as deficits widened at the same time foreign direct investment fell as the syrian war raged on angered by the rise of shia hezbollah wealthy sunni arabs from saudi arabia and the gulf states stopped investing in lebanon and even curtailed tourist visits recently dollar remittances from lebanese expats also slowed as faith in the banking sector waned in recent years the government has tried to fund itself through a system dismissed as a ponzi scheme by some economists to maintain the lebanese pound s costly currency peg to the u s dollar the central bank pushed up deposit rates to crazy levels as much as 10 per cent those deposits in turn were loaned to the central bank in 2019 as the inflow of dollars dried up the commercial banks introduced informal capital controls limiting cash withdrawals businesses began to suffer from a credit squeeze the mass riots that started in october and triggered the downfall of mr hariri s government were in good part motivated by the banking and economic crises the currency peg is in trouble and a dollar fetches 2 000 lebanese pounds on the black market the official rate is 1 500 the new government will have to come up with a rescue plan fast the cabinet is to be appointed this week if it doesn t an imf bailout of as much as us 25 billion may be needed the wild card is a war between iran and the u s that could shatter all the economies in the region for lebanon the

as a second and more punishing wave of us sanctions hits iran the islamic republic is dusting off an old playbook for circumventing such penalties and maintaining a crucial level of oil exports and other trade a new issue brief by holly dagres and barbara slavin how iran will cope with us sanctions discusses the myriad techniques iran developed before negotiating the joint comprehensive plan of action when sanctions had wider international support the islamic republic is already redeploying many of these techniques from turning off tracking devices on tankers to co mingling oil with that of other exporters to the use of barter with key trading partners after more than a year of threatening to pull out of the nuclear agreement reached in 2015 by iran and five world powers plus germany president donald trump announced in may 2018 that the united states was indeed leaving the joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa and reimposed unilateral and secondary sanctions on iran the first wave on august 6 2018 targeted automobiles foreign currency and gold the second wave which went into effect on november 5 2018 is more punitive and is aimed at iran s oil exports and banks even before they were reimposed the sanctions had a harsh impact on the iranian economy and in particular the iranian currency the rial which has plummeted compared to the us dollar western companies including major european firms have fled iran to avoid jeopardizing their much more significant ties to the us financial system and the us market but at the same time european governments and iran s major trading partners in asia have underlined their continuing support for the jcpoa and sought to devise mechanisms for continuing to trade with iran with the help of its p4 1 partners britain china france germany and russia iran apparently intends to ride out this sanctions wave in hopes that trump will be a one term president and that his successor will return to the nuclear deal this issue brief will examine the ways in which iran will cope with sanctions by recalling how it survived a more punitive multilateral wave led by the obama administration at a time when iran was more geopolitically isolated banking and currencies countless iranian sanctions stories have made international headlines among the most dramatic is that of iranian turkish businessman reza zarrab who moved billions of dollars from turkey to iran through banks businesses and front companies in november 2017 he signed a plea deal with us authorities that helped them convict the former deputy general manager of turkey s state controlled halkbank of sanctions violations south pars onshore facilities near asaluyeh city december 11 2013 photo wikimedia commons hamed malekpour in april 2018 it was revealed that bahrain s future bank assisted tehran in hiding 7 billion in transfers from 2004 to 2015 by forging documents to conceal trade between iran and foreign partners one of the ways this was done was through wire stripping which removes or changes the identifying information of a bank transfer for example one message from iran s bank melli one of the bahraini bank s iranian shareholders instructed bankers at future to not mention the iranian bank name or code reference number and to avoid routing the transaction through new york wire stripping is a common circumvention scheme similarly pilatus bank a maltese private bank evaded sanctions from 2006 to 2014 pilatus laundered more than 115 million from a western bank to iranian companies via a venezuelan housing project the bank s owner ali sadr an iranian national used a saint kitts and nevis passport with a united arab emirates uae address to get around the 2012 sanctions which affected iran s central bank as well as a number of other iranian financial institutions iran also opened private banks in iraq often technically owned by iraqi lebanese or syrian citizens sadr s story is an example of how wealthy iranians with ties to the iranian government have used passport for investment schemes small countries including saint kitts and nevis the comoros islands and antigua are commonly used to evade sanctions iranian nationals essentially bought passports in these countries to register companies abroad and open bank accounts though the iranian government doesn t recognize dual nationality or formally allow second passports the iranian government quietly permitted high profile businessmen to acquire them the comoros islands a small country off the coast of africa has more than 1 000 passport holders with iran listed as their birthplace many of the passports were obtained from 2008 to 2017 with the majority purchased at the height of multilateral sanctions the comoros government eventually cancelled the passports of more than 100 iranian nationals and broke diplomatic ties with iran in 2016 it sought closer ties to wealthy arab countries such as saudi arabia currency is another major roadblock for iran trade speaking to a small group of journalists and iran analysts in new york on september 29 iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif said iran and its trading partners would use their own currencies in bilateral trade and settle any imbalances at the end of a specified period in a non dollar currency more and more people are interested in avoiding the dollar in their transactions zarif said sell stuff in your own currency buy stuff in the other country s currency and at the end of a specific period balance it out in a non dollar currency it s quite possible and may even be profitable russia which is also under us sanctions because of ukraine and the use of chemical agents in assassination plots among other reasons has often spoken with iran about moving away from the us dollar there have been preparations for a regional integrated payment network including former soviet states in central asia in which turkey might also participate china the biggest purchaser of iranian oil and iran s largest trading partner has recently set up an oil purchasing platform denominated in yuan while iran is not among the top reasons that beijing is trying to launch this contract the bourse may prove useful similarly european commission president jean claude juncker has said that the european union plans to increase the use of the euro in international trade especially for oil and gas purchases for months europe has been looking for an alternative electronic money transfer system that cannot be blocked by the us treasury department since commercial banks can no longer transfer funds to iran s central bank and many other designated financial institutions europe is becoming more reliant on its central banks with the assumption that the trump administration would never sanction a european central bank according to nbc news under that scheme a central bank would collect hundreds or even thousands of planned transactions and bundle them together sending the funds to iran in one lump sum that would then be redistributed to the intended recipients in iran as part of this circumvention mechanism europe is seeking a payment mechanism not dependent on the us dollar europeans have been discussing for months creation of a special purpose vehicle spv to help european countries legally conduct transactions with iran on the sidelines of the united nations general assembly european union eu high representative for foreign affairs and security policy federica mogherini announced plans for an spv after talks with the p4 1 the group issued a statement saying that through this mechanism they could protect the freedom of their economic operators to pursue legitimate business with iran the system would facilitate payments related to iran s exports and imports which will assist and reassure economic operators pursuing legitimate business with iran the statement said while major corporations will be unlikely to use this mechanism the spv could facilitate humanitarian and other lawful trade with iran via small and medium sized enterprises interestingly iran recently authorized mining of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as this issue brief was being written the central bank of iran was drafting a policy framework for cryptocurrencies to be used for foreign trade there was even talk of iran launching its own national cryptocurrency although countries such as venezuela have had disappointing results according to iranian officials it would be similar to bitcoin but would only be available for use by iranian banks and companies iranian nationals also rely on hawala or havaleh in persian a traditional form of banking in which a sarafi or currency exchange transfers chunks of cash to banks typically the money is transferred to banks in countries such as turkey and the uae the funds are then wire transferred to a designated bank account in the west including the united states in this way the iranian origin is untraceable in october reuters reported that turkey had arrested 417 suspects in a money laundering scheme that transferred 419 million in foreign currency to 28 088 bank accounts mostly belonging to iranians living in the united states while major corporations will be unlikely to use this mechanism the spv could facilitate humanitarian and other lawful trade with iran via small and medium sized enterprises iran offers incentives to maintain oil exports the 2012 multilateral sanctions regime managed to suppress iranian oil exports by more than one million barrels a day from june to september 2018 iranian oil exports fell by about 600 000 bpd or more than 25 percent the pace of the reduction is higher than initially anticipated and the total is expected to drop further the trump administration asserts that it would like iran s oil exports to be reduced to zero indeed european companies did completely stop importing iranian oil from 2012 to 2015 when international pressure on iran to negotiate curbs on its nuclear program was at its height and the eu formally banned such imports however this goal is unenforceable in the current situation major iranian oil purchasers are reducing imports but not to zero and waiting to see what sort of waivers the trump administration will grant source bourseandbazaar com iran s oil exports may be more resilient than headlines suggest tehran has offered a variety of incentives to importers it is discounting prices for crude and offering in some cases practically free shipping iran has also resorted to providing its own insurance for oil cargos as major international insurers are now barred from iran by sanctions tehran is also using its own tankers to replace those of the big multinational shipping companies in july iran reportedly insured its india exports on tankers operated by the national iranian tanker company nitc for new delhi giving in to us demands is complicated its close proximity to iran helps reduce transport costs and india s refineries are configured to specifically process iranian oil making it harder to switch to other suppliers according to cnbc other senior officials have said outright that the country will not fully cut their iranian imports and that doing so would be impossible some countries have decided not to give in to us pressure chinese oil companies state oil trader zhuhai zhenrong corp and sinopec group asia s biggest refiner are moving their cargoes onto nitc tankers in july all seventeen tankers carrying iranian crude to china belonged to the nitc interestingly iran recently underwent a gap of not delivering oil to china for eighteen days the longest in three years though it is unclear what the cause was bloomberg speculated it had to do with negotiating better terms something the chinese also did in 2012 large tankers loading at kharg oil terminal which handles significant quantity of iran s crude exports photo credit wikimedia commons national iranian oil company nioc some iranian oil importers have offered to pay iran through barter even the eu is considering an oil for goods scheme according to iranian officials during the prior period payment for iranian oil was frozen in foreign bank accounts or used as credit for purchases of local goods and services this was particularly the case in regard to china russia is considering an oil for goods scheme russia has also contemplated buying iranian oil and renaming it as russian before reselling to third countries these sorts of oil swaps are common in the oil industry even in a non sanctions environment there is also the suggestion that iran could send oil to foreign ports blend it there with non iranian crude and resell it at the height of multilateral sanctions tehran would forge documents that made iranian oil look like it came from iraq iranians would also do business with european companies in turkey and list the uae as the final destination for shipping before the documents were changed and goods shipped to iran s bandar abbas port during the last round of sanctions iran was forced to store unsold crude on offshore tankers to keep production high since it is costly to resume oil pumping once wells are shut down according to bloomberg iran has resorted to this tactic again storing crude on nitc supertankers off kharg island thus far tehran isn t storing the same amount of crude it did under previous sanctions which was millions of barrels as of september 2018 there were two iranian tankers reported floating off the coast of the uae at the height of the 2012 sanctions iranian oil tankers would turn off their tracking devices repaint their ships and even rename them with the help of satellite imagery it has become evident that iran is using this strategy again with at least several tankers a month spotted without their tracking devices turned on during the last round of sanctions iranian tankers would turn off trackers and transfer oil onto foreign tankers in the middle of the sea the financial times reported that at least seven iranian tankers have stopped sending position signals since september 16 2018 these ships are known as ghost tankers babak zanjani an iranian oil tycoon working closely with the islamic revolutionary guards corps irgc managed to evade sanctions during the prior wave through a scheme to disguise the origins of iranian oil and sell it on the open market transferring millions of barrels from tanker to tanker zanjani was arrested in 2013 and charged with embezzlement for withholding 1 9 billion in oil revenues and is now facing the death penalty neighbors and black knights iran relied heavily on neighboring afghanistan and iraq to circumvent prior sanctions afghan banks in particular were used to pay for iranian imports in 2012 the president of the money exchange union in afghanistan said that the rial comes across in trucks where it is then converted into us dollars afghan middlemen were making anywhere from five to seven percent commission in september 2018 a money exchanger in kabul told bloomberg that he takes a taxi with suitcases full of cash to iran via a remote border crossing he reportedly transfers about 220 000 in two to three trips since the traders have contacts and multiple entry visas they are not questioned or stopped by afghan border police according to khan jan alokozay the deputy chairman of the afghanistan chamber of commerce and industries traders sell dollars on the black markets for rials in iran and they smuggle the rials back to afghanistan to sell them at its official rates in provinces since the rial is an accepted currency as a result of this money exchange afghanistan is struggling with problems of its own the us dollars smuggled into iran are now causing a dollar shortage in afghanistan traders in afghan border provinces traditionally known for their commerce with iran are also transferring dollars which in turn has caused the value of the afghani to depreciate reuters reports that as much as 2 to 3 million cross every day this is just an example of the many loopholes iran uses to import gold and hard currency iranians also purchase dollars in iraq about 2 6 million iranians traveled to iraq in 2017 as religious pilgrims visiting sites sacred to shia muslims in karbala and najaf the iraqi government is trying to make it more difficult for iranians to buy dollars through iraqi exchange houses at the same time iraq has sought waivers to allow it to continue to purchase iranian oil that fuels power plants responsible for generating 40 percent of iraq s electricity most goods that were smuggled to iran during the last round of sanctions went through the uae and oman but when the treasury department cracked down tehran turned to iraq incompetence and corruption on the part of the iraqi government allow iran to bypass many rules and regulations beyond supplying oil for electricity iran also has leverage because of its links to iraqi shia parties and militias one often overlooked tactic is the role of couriers or porters iraqi kurds for example bring money and food to relatives in the kurdish region of iran this can turn into a profitable business porters or kolbar have been around for generations and have smuggled everything from cigarettes and electronics to alcoholic beverages according to iranian government data some 68 000 kolbar special licenses were issued by the interior ministry for iranian kurds so they can avoid being stopped by border police since june 2018 they are now being allowed to enter customs at semi official borders with iraq iran has heavily relied on front companies to do business in countries including china iraq liechtenstein and the uae eastern european countries that don t share strong trade ties with iran have also been conduits for sanctioned trade in the past countries such as belarus hungary and romania looked at sanctions as a lucrative opportunity during the previous round of penalties and earned the nickname black knights it is unclear what role they might play during this sanctions period front companies and rationing iran has heavily relied on front companies to do business in countries including china iraq liechtenstein and the uae according to reporter and atlantic council non resident senior fellow borzou daragahi this entailed hiring outsiders as silent partners or registering under obscure names that didn t immediately raise flags iran has also used private companies in the uae and iraq owned by arab citizens from iraq lebanon and syria these individuals purchase goods and legally ship them from the uae and iraq and finally smuggle them through land or water routes to iran according to the deputy chairman of iran s chamber of commerce industries mines and agriculture pedram soltani iranian businessmen have been opening new companies under chinese partners names and trusting their assets to them in order to circumvent sanctions in 2013 it was reported by the wall street journal that the irgc had opened 150 front companies in georgia under georgian partners names one method to safeguard vital imports such as medicine has been used by iran s foreign investments company fic which recently spent 3 million to purchase a bankrupt pharmaceutical factory in france the fic has dozens of cash accounts and investments amounting to 5 billion in twenty two countries it is prioritizing assets to insure access to key goods services and technology fic specifically bought the french factory to make sure that tehran can obtain medicine for infectious diseases such imports were problematic in the past despite an exemption for humanitarian needs fic has investments in an afghan trading house a brazilian auto parts plant a german pipeline company and even an omani lease finance firm which is shared with saudi arabia fic also invested in a uae company to buy power generation equipment to mitigate the impact of sanctions on ordinary iranians the iranian parliament is considering legislation to increase imports of essential goods and sell them at subsidized prices meat rice sugar and bread could be distributed via rationing coupons popularized during the iran iraq war these measures would help the most vulnerable iranians the rural poor in july iran s planning and budget organization discussed an executive package that would help mitigate the impact of sanctions as western companies exit iran china is likely to be the biggest beneficiary when france s total quit the south pars gas project in august china s national petroleum corporation was considered as a replacement even though its stake would increase to 80 percent similarly now that india is considering pulling out of the chabahar port project in which it had pledged a 500 million investment to build two berths china could step in meanwhile fisherman in the persian gulf are complaining about the presence of chinese boats at their fishing grounds most iranians regard chinese products as substandard compared to western goods but remember how quickly they took over the market a decade ago when chinese and indian pharmaceuticals and drug ingredients flooded iran during the last round of sanctions many iranians complained that the drugs either didn t work or caused serious side effects conclusion through its four decades of existence the islamic republic of iran has shown its ability to survive economic strangulation it is dusting off its old sanctions circumvention playbook but its people are bound to experience considerable pain that will only compound grievances about a host of social political and economic ills because of the trump administration s continuous threats to leave the jcpoa and re implement sanctions iran has had at least a year to plan its response although iran s detection systems and knowledge are leaps and bounds ahead of where they were according to farhad alavi a sanctions compliance attorney in washington it doesn t mean that the government has come up with significant or better alternatives since the 2012 round once again the iranian government will blame the united states for the sanctions an argument that takes on new strength because it was the united states not iran that first violated the nuclear deal but the iranian people were already disappointed before trump took office that they saw so little benefit from the jcpoa in part because of endemic domestic corruption and mismanagement a key question now is whether the vaunted patience of the iranian people will fade before the sanctions do

the country s external debt overhang is looming frighteningly over gota s administration by w a wijewardena the sick economy president gotabaya rajapaksa now fondly called gota by everyone inherited an underperforming economy it was just like the economy which the previous administration had inherited from his brother some five years ago as i had presented in this column repeatedly the economy was turning from bad to worse since around 2013 and it was the job of the previous administration to put it on the right growth path they were successful somewhat in constitutional reforms but regarding the economy their performance record had been far from the desired hence the economy today is characterised by sad stories all around gota s immediate challenge has been to convert them into pleasant and promising stories what are those sad stories that confront him falling growth rate three weeks ago the department of census and statistics sri lanka s official statistical bureau responsible for assessing the size of the economy and its growth rate came up with the first piece of sad news the growth rate in the third quarter of 2019 has been 2 7 a little up above the previous quarter s rate of 1 6 but pretty much less than the growth of 3 5 recorded in the corresponding quarter of the previous year thus in the first three quarters of 2019 the real economic growth has been at a dismal 2 7 accordingly the year is likely to end up in a rate of less than 3 as has been predicted by international agencies what is important for gota is the predicted economic growth rate for the next three years which if no action is taken would settle between 3 and 3 5 if he is to meet the targets set in his manifesto the growth rate should practically double to 6 5 this is indeed a herculean task for any economic planner the fragile external sector the supporting drivers of economic growth have also been very weak exports in the first 10 months of 2019 have been virtually stagnant recording a growth of only 0 8 in the services sector the main driver of growth tourism has not recovered from the depth to which it had fallen after the easter bombings in fact its earnings have fallen by 21 in the first 10 months remittances which had been the single most important relief for the country s fragile external sector in the past have declined by 6 during the same period both agriculture and services have been at a very low level of performance the industrial performance has been a little better but it cannot single handedly rescue the economy hence gota must adopt a multi pronged approach to expand agriculture services tourism exports and remittances simultaneously if the economy is to remain on course with the planned targets the external debt overhang the country s external debt overhang is looming frighteningly over gota s administration that has been the cumulative effect of the original sin committed by sri lanka ever since it had gained independence from the british that sin was to borrow abroad to finance local investments in the absence of adequate local savings and invest in sectors that have contributed poorly to the country s foreign exchange earnings as revealed by the central bank statistics in the next 12 month period the total foreign debt servicing commitments comprising both the repayment of the principal and the payment of interest will amount to 6 billion this is made up of the government s commitments amounting to 4 8 billion and those of the private sector by about 1 2 billion the country s liquid foreign exchange balances after taking out the illiquid gold reserves at end november 2019 had been some 6 5 billion and if it is used for debt payments its foreign exchange reserves would fall to a critically low level thus gota s problem is slightly different from those of the private sector borrowers the latter may be having rupee funds to meet its commitments and its problem is lack dollars in the country gota s problem is that he has neither rupees nor dollars to do so hence he has no alternative but to borrow abroad to fill his coffers and use those proceeds to repay his loan commitments this strategy known as loan recycling and used by all the previous successive governments would provide only a temporary solution to the country it adds to gota s woes and if continued unabated those of any future administration to come to power as well the need for using scarce money prudently but just like the previous administration had been preoccupied by constitutional reforms and a hurry to bring the alleged corrupt deals of their predecessors to justice gota is also preoccupied by considerations other than the economy he has to seek parliamentary majority in a general election in a few months time hence all governmental resources are now being diverted to attaining that goal at the expense of sound economic policies accordingly at a time when the treasury was limping with a huge cash shortage he has offered a costly tax cut to citizens and jobs for 100 000 samurdhi kids the first would drain the treasury of a promised revenue flow of about rs 600 billion and the latter would impose an unexpected cost of rs 42 billion on his already fragile budget numbers that latter amount is a lot of money equal to the annual administration budgets of some 14 state universities this is a serious choice to be made by a government which is planning to increase the university admissions by about a quarter by establishing 300 odd university colleges the government does not have money for this and hence the available moneys will have to be spent prudently a write off four months ahead as far as economic rebuilding is concerned the next four months will be a write off for gota since his government has to fight a parliamentary election to secure majority if the voting pattern at the recently concluded presidential election is repeated his government has a good chance of securing a simple majority in parliament but what is being fought for now is not just the simple majority but a two third majority the latter is needed by him to amend the constitution and revert to the governance structure that prevailed prior to 2015 to attain that goal his government has to postpone all the unpopular economic reforms that are necessary to come out of the present economic malaise hence the economic war has to be temporarily kept aside until the conclusion of the scheduled parliamentary elections since sri lanka has no time to waste that temporary recess will surely be fatal to the country s economic rebuilding exercise inadequate capacity for developing technology sri lanka has a limited scope for creating economic prosperity for its people through historically prominent growth drivers like subsistence agriculture three tree crops comprising tea rubber and coconut apparels and telecommunication services all these sectors have now reached their saturation point with the available technology hence any further development leading to increased additional wealth creation known as value addition in these sectors requires the adoption of advanced technologies given sri lanka s inadequate capacity for developing such advanced technologies in house the attainment of this goal is necessarily a medium to long term objective hence in the initial stage of economic development sri lanka needs to use technologies developed elsewhere this was the strategy adopted by the four asian tigers namely singapore taiwan south korea and hong kong that was done by attracting foreign direct investments or fdis with high technologies on one side and forcing local universities to get affiliated to world s reputed universities to develop its own technology on the other a good example in the present era is sri lanka s competitor in most respects vietnam that country which was nowhere in the global trade map some 30 years ago is the home for large technology based manufacturers like nike samsung ibm intel fujitsu and hp today according to the world bank data vietnam s high tech exports in 2017 had been 41 of its manufactured exports the comparable figure for sri lanka had been just 1 implying that it has a long way to go to attract high technology in the initial period of economic expansion the strategy adopted by both south korea and singapore could serve as guidance to sri lanka south korea s technology policy south korea s strongman president park chung hee who held the post from 1963 till 1979 had a separate technology policy side by side with his industrial policy to acquire or develop new technologies and make them available to all sectors concerned to improve productivity and go for new areas of production in this respect technology had been recognised as a public good to be necessarily produced by the state it consisted of two aspects one was to develop new technology through research and development and improve the technologies adapted from other countries the other was to facilitate the use of technology for going for new products and improving the existing production practices to develop technology in house new research institutes were setup while encouraging the existing universities to undertake new research and development programs one of the institutes so setup was the korea institute of science and technology popularly known as kist with the joint participation of both the korean and us governments this institute was later amalgamated with the korea institute of science and is presently known as korea advanced institute of science and technology or kaist its success is gauged by the number of global patents it has got and its ranking within the top 50 universities in the world and at the 6th place among asian universities south korea is a technology driven economy and its high tech exports in 2018 had amounted to 36 of manufactured exports according to the world bank data singapore s going for a western oasis in singapore prime minister lee kuan yew forced all singaporean universities to get affiliated with universities of repute in usa and improve curricula and research capability based on such collaboration as a result the national university of singapore which was relatively unknown in early 1960s got itself elevated to the 22nd position in global ranking by 2018 in addition to developing in house capacity for technological advancement lee adopted a policy of attracting fdis with high technology to the country to enable the expatriates from the western world to come and work in singapore a conscious policy to convert the country to a western oasis was adopted in this policy singapore improved its environment healthcare facilities education and transport to be on par with any developed country so that the expatriates felt as if they were working in their own countries this was a miraculous development and today singapore s high tech exports amount to about 52 of the manufactured exports according to the world bank data industry 4 0 both south korea and singapore are presently going through the fourth industrial revolution also known as industry 4 0 or 4ir this is a term coined by the founder and chairman of the davos based world economic forum klaus schwab to distinguish the modern wave of high technology based global production model from the existing model of production using electronics and computers gota s problem is that sri lanka is still in the second industrial revolution or industry 2 0 or 2ir in which production processes are only partly mechanised he has to make a leapfrogging from industry 2 0 to industry 4 0 bypassing industry 3 0 or 3ir this is challenging but not impossible provided he adopts an appropriate policy package to wean the local businesses to the use of emerging technologies vietnam has begun this process by introducing a road map covering 2020 through 2030 in which all sectors in the economy including education and healthcare would go for new technologies wake up and fight the war i have discussed how sri lanka should go for industry 4 0 in a previous article in this series under the title presidential aspirants and voters read ips s soe 2019 before you make your next move the following para from the article aptly describes the challenge before gota in this context state of the economy 2019 by the institute of policy studies makes the following remark it can be argued that sri lanka is yet to even come to terms with technologies of the third industrial revolution electronics and information technology leave alone those of 4ir the reality though is the pace of change or the quantum leap of technology from one revolution to another is so swift that countries can no longer be complacent what this means is that the world is waking up every morning with news of next big thing hitting the market a sleeper will find himself being overtaken by all others who are continuously awake and vigilant on the developments in new technologies so gota should wake up and fight his economic war to a conclusion as he did in the case of his other wars the writer a former

frustration with inequality sparked protests across latin america last year but will they maintain momentum in 2020 one morning in december belen larrondo set out as she had dozens of times over the past two months to meet fellow students and activists outside a metro station in santiago chile she went with peaceful pleas for political transformation to redress staggering income inequality in her country but she also went prepared for confrontation armed with goggles to shield her eyes from projectiles and baking soda in case she got hit with tear gas an architecture student and the president of the catholic university of chile s student federation larrondo knew full well the potential for state security agents to respond violently to her and other protesters as they had before when trying to tamp down the social unrest that has swept the country since october if something happens to me my family will die larrondo told al jazeera during a telephone interview from her home in santiago but unfortunately it s something that we have to do and fear is not going to stop me because i think there are things you have to fight for that sentiment rippled across parts of latin america in 2019 as movements of varying scale and mechanism captured and channeled deep seated discontent rooted in questions about inequality democracy and what it means to lead a dignified life the outrage and frustration that has spilled onto the streets sprouted from seeds planted long ago in some cases the signs were ignored in others they were overshadowed by other debates and while there is not wholesale cohesion experts point to the repudiation of austerity and neoliberal free market policies as one common thread that could continue to stoke discontent as a new decade dawns contagion effect chile a country that had previously cultivated an image of stability and economic prosperity in south america has seen visceral protest movements high school students who jumped subway turnstiles to demonstrate against a transit fare hike struck a deep chord with the nation on october 18 inspiring thousands of chileans to take to the streets almost every day since at least 27 people have died thousands have been arrested or injured and property damage is widespread but the protests carry on a leaderless movement fuelled by a wellspring of discontent with an economic system that has birthed inequality in chile as in other parts of latin america frustration with economic policies that promise to pile more financial pain on low and middle income segments of society has boiled over into demonstrations calling to upend the status quo in ecuador indigenous led protests brought the country to a standstill over fuel subsidy cuts and other austerity measures in argentina people who had been marching in the streets over growing levels of poverty took their anger out at the ballot box removing the market friendly president mauricio macri and installing a centre left peronist alberto fernandez in his place during his inauguration speech in december president fernandez blamed his country s fragile economic and social fabric on the the adventure of his predecessor a reference to the growing rejection around the region against the neoliberal economic model there is definitely a contagion effect i do see it very clearly said silvia otero bahamon an assistant professor of political science at universidad del rosario in bogota colombia colombia saw its own wave of unprecedented anti government protests at the end of november motivated by a range of issues that included discontent over free market policies hundreds of thousands of colombians took to the streets only to be met with force by the conservative government in power especially with ordinary citizens they see what is happening in chile they say f it let s go to the streets said bahomon it s working for them there what if it works for us too a dignified life leaders in chile expressed surprise at the intensity of protests that broke out in october but chilean economist marco kremerman told al jazeera that the statistics have long indicated that an explosion of discontent was just waiting to happen in a country he says has two faces in terms of macroeconomics the growth of the economy the generation of wealth a controlled level of inflation low levels of public debt the numbers are good said kremerman who works with the think tank fundacion sol in santiago it s as if you had a house and from the outside it looks very well painted it has a very nice exterior but the problem is inside the house inside the house there are many fractures the statistics on salaries pensions and indebtedness are very serious the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd ranks chile as one of the most unequal countries in its membership with an income gap that is 65 percent wider than the organisation s average more than half of chileans earn the equivalent of less than 500 a month said kremerman noting that about half of the pensioners in the country s privatised system collect pensions of around 230 a month chile s highly privatised economy which includes education and healthcare is rooted in free market policies implemented during the 17 year dictatorship of general augusto pinochet who was in power from 1973 to 1990 kremerman says inequality was papered over in chile thanks to growing levels of household debt as people borrowed to pay for housing and other necessities such as food and clothing the relentless economic pressure on the country s low and middle income classes helps explain why the student subway fare protest moved a much wider segment of chilean society to demand reforms aimed at securing a dignified life as larrondo and kremerman put it the mostly peaceful demonstrations have included bouts of looting and destruction by a small subsection of vigilante protesters who have torched buildings and damaged the santiago metro they have also been met with forceful repression by state police who are accused by various organisations including the united nations of violating human rights jennifer pribble an associate professor of political science and global studies at the university of richmond in the united states sees the crisis in chile not simply as a backlash against neoliberalism but as a reaction to the failure of the centre right and the centre left to respond to demands for reform stretching back to 2006 and 2011 when students took to the streets to demand more spending on public education prior to those movements mobilisations had been largely muted in chile following a dictatorship that had killed tortured disappeared and disarticulated members of civil society it is still fundamentally seen as a system that was built by a dictator to maintain a conservative democracy and to limit the ability of democracy to respond to citizen demands and to promote citizen engagement and participation said pribble in addition to calling for the reform of education pensions and the healthcare system citizens have demanded an overhaul of the constitution a plan is in place proposed by a coalition of political parties that will see chileans vote in an april plebiscite on whether they want to rewrite the constitution and how to go about it some protest demands are getting a response from government on sunday the centre right chilean president sebastian pinera announced a proposal to reduce healthcare wait times and lower the cost of medicine a pretty flag to burn argentina by contrast is known for greater levels of public spending in the region but has been living through a painful recession for which former president macri has been blamed poverty sharply went up during his tenure it is now more than 40 percent according to the catholic university of argentina with six out of every 10 children and youth in the country living below the poverty line the latest count from the national institute of statistics and census in argentina pegged the poverty figure in the first quarter of 2019 at 35 percent the country s debt has soared and average argentines have watched their purchasing power evaporate due to rampant inflation president fernandez says macri left argentina in virtual default due in part to a whopping 57bn bailout deal with the international monetary fund conversations to renegotiate terms with the imf have started fernandez said the country wants to settle its debts but it needs to grow the economy to be able to do that in comments last week he argued that a social pact struck with trade unions and businesses gives him more leverage in the imf talks the creditors took on a risk by investing in a model that has failed all over the world time and again he said during his inauguration speech to reorganise the economy we need to leave the logic of more cuts more recession and more debt that the last four years have brought us in this reorganisation we re going to protect the most vulnerable sectors days after argentina s new government assumed office it started to make good on that promise to protect the vulnerable economy minister martin guzman a young academic who has worked alongside nobel laureate economist joseph stiglitz announced a series of measures including bonuses for pensioners higher taxes on the wealthiest freezing of utility prices and currency controls in the short term there has to be a concrete response to the situation of hunger that is back in argentina of families who can t complete the four daily meals and all of that is a challenge said silvia saravia national coordinator for the group barrios de pie one of the organisations that staged massive protests against the macri government they have to be urgent responses but argentine economist eduardo levy yeyati sees the discontent that swept macri from office not as a rejection of the neoliberal model but of the government of the day that bore responsibility for the crisis adding that the country has long suffered from problems with deficits and external debt chile and colombia by contrast suffer from problems rooted in people legitimately demanding access to services like education healthcare or housing yeyati argues i think neoliberalism is a pretty flag to burn during these demonstrations said yeyati the dean of the school of government at universidad torcuato di tella and director of the center for evidenced based policy but i believe the frustration in countries that grew in these last few years has much more to do with second generation demands in a manner of speaking demands around access to goods and services demands of the middle class and i think the solution to these conflicts will depend a lot on the capacity of the governments of different political stripes to satisfy them without sacrificing the future economic growth and investment in colombia the anger expressed on the street had another unique feature according to otero bahamon who says this has to do with the 2016 peace agreement that was struck with the marxist group the revolutionary armed forces of colombia farc although the peace deal s implementation is precarious otero bahamon says it means that issues around conflict no longer have a stranglehold over colombia freeing up space for other public debates including those around economic issues such as pension and healthcare reforms the peace deal also neuters the government s ability to dismiss all forms of protest as being aligned with the farc which it had done in the past in november colombia saw its first cacerolazo a form of protest in latin america and popularised by argentina that features ordinary citizens marching through the streets banging pots and pans it felt very magical said otero bahamon to hear your neighbours that you never speak to to see them through the kitchen window and to see that they are enraged they are tired of it all people are connecting in a political way larrondo agrees in the long run i think this is going to help us improve our quality of life in latin america but in the short term i am less optimistic she said questioning the political will for fundamental change in chile at least kremerman insists that the dispute is not driven by middle class desires but by concerns over the precarity of life and so far all of the measures proposed by the chilean government have been to tinker with the existing model not change it i m worried about the levels of repression and the political vacuum he said but a lot of hope because the protagonists are back on the streets and we re talking amongst ourselves again

multinationals are scrambling to avoid losses in a volatile foreign exchange environment with the trump administration talking down the dollar their job is getting more complicated a strong dollar brexit and trade battles with china combined in 2019 to inflict considerable pain from foreign exchange losses on multinationals around the world and with us president donald trump threatening to turn his trade war into a currency war 2020 looks like it might be even more costly on the currency front us multinationals lost 21 billion in revenue due to foreign exchange swings in the second quarter according to kyriba a treasury management software company that tracks earnings calls it was the third straight quarter with losses over 20 billion kyriba said even the most sophisticated and well heeled companies are vulnerable to currency swings third quarter earnings at apple took a 1 1 billion hit to revenues owing to adverse currency moves for example foreign exchange is clearly a headwind for us right now cfo luca maestri told analysts on apple s october earnings call other major companies suffered too largely because they operate in dollars and sell to emerging markets whose currencies have weakened dramatically against the greenback abbott laboratories reported a 4 decline in sales revenue due to currency swings in key emerging markets including brazil russia and china the parade of losses only underscores the fact that managing a safe path through the global foreign exchange market which the bank for international settlements estimates at 6 6 trillion a day remains more of an art than a science every corporation is a little bit different says marc chandler chief market strategist at bannockburn global forex a boutique foreign exchange advisory you can find two companies in the same space that have two different currency impacts because of their hedging policy they might hedge 70 of their exposure for instance why don t they decide to hedge 80 or 90 of it it all depends on how aggressive they are and what instruments they use looking forward non us companies too are doing what they can to defend themselves against a treacherous currency market sometimes successfully a bannockburn client piano software a business platform development company based in slovakia faced a major currency challenge this summer when it offered to acquire cxense a listed norwegian data management firm that uses a software as a service model the purchase price was 351 million norwegian kroner about us 39 million at the time of offer and piano raised that amount through debt financing from a us bank to close the deal but then cfo alex franta now interim ceo was reluctant to convert the 39 million into kroner if the deal fell through before completion piano might be stuck with the norwegian currency at a time when it was fluctuating sharply in one month the krone had already gained 2 5 which could have cost piano an additional 1 million piano s bank offered to sell it a three month dollar krone forward contract but since the contract required a trade at the end of that period it raised the same concerns franta says instead piano took bannockburn s recommendation to buy an option on a dollar krone forward giving it the choice of exercising the trade but not the obligation to do so as it turned out the deal took longer to complete than expected and the option expired without being exercised the krone by then had depreciated 10 against the dollar saving piano nearly 4 million in exchange costs despite having to pay for the option we re very glad we went with the option franta says despite the expense it saved me a huge amount of worry about what the ultimate cost of the deal was going to be another company facing foreign exchange headwinds is onduline a paris based manufacturer of roofing materials with turnover of 300 million 334 million onduline has 85 of its sales in currencies other than the euro including in north america and asia says maxime firth the company s controlling group director onduline had tried to reduce its foreign exchange exposure by opening factories in turkey and russia but extreme volatility in the turkish lira and russian ruble hurt the bottom line many of our expenses in turkey are linked to the us dollar so when the lira falls against the dollar the price of bitumen the main ingredient we use rises automatically firth says the lira lost as much as 5 of its value in a single day in march onduline has tried to compensate by raising prices in europe where it keeps its books priced in euros firth says to avoid currency shocks while covering dividend payments to its russian subsidiary its biggest wholly owned business onduline purchases euro ruble forwards the company has also began using a cloud based planning platform called anaplan to make sure the home office has the latest data from its manufacturing plants and can budget for any currency swings we can simulate various currency scenarios to make budgeting easier and more accurate firth says the trump effect businesses on the other side of the atlantic face a different kind of uncertainty for the moment us based companies have an advantage in hedging due to the strong dollar the cost of a forward contract is based on the spot exchange rate multiplied by the difference in the interest rates between the two currencies with the dollar deposits offering higher interest than most of the rest of the world s major currencies the euro interest rate is actually negative us companies in effect get paid to hedge but that may change if trump is successful in his efforts to talk the dollar down so that countries no longer take advantage of our strong dollar by further devaluing their currencies he proclaimed on twitter on december 2 trump called on the federal reserve to lower interest rates to reduce demand for the currency and lower its value in foreign exchange transactions should the fed decline to act this makes it very hard for our manufacturers and farmers to fairly export their goods the us president tweeted trump who has used tariffs as a weapon in trade talks with china the eu and canada appears to have decided to turn trade conflicts into currency conflicts and this could have far reaching implications for multinationals brazil and argentina have been presiding over a massive devaluation of their currencies which is not good for our farmers trump tweeted therefore effective immediately i will restore the tariffs on all steel aluminum that is shipped into the u s from those countries commerce secretary wilbur ross followed up on trump s comments by hinting to fox business that other countries could also be punished for alleged currency manipulation brazil and argentina are not the only where there are currency issues he said

2019 was a whipsaw year first the terrifying 17 percent drop in the stock market during the fourth quarter of 2018 set the stage then economic data points weakened during the first half of 2019 to make things worse the political atmosphere was terrible with brexit fbi investigation impeachment korea and a very real trade war a recession looked inevitable at that point an inverted yield curve during the summer seemed to confirm this fortunately that was wrong starting from a very low point the stock market showed 28 percent improvement to all time record highs even gold was up 18 percent the best performance in 10 years the political obstacles were pushed away brexit may still be a problem but for now wall street appreciates the long delay as england has had three years to prepare its contingency plans the mueller report was anticlimactic but the first ever removal of a sitting u s president would be a very unwelcome surprise to the market the long running drama with korea has become white noise although phase one of the china trade deal was hollow it was still enthusiastically received by an overly eager market lastly with the fed dropping interest rates three times the lower end of the yield curve dropped ending the inversion between short and long term rates that spread is now about 30 basis points which is much better the most frightening event of 2019 was the near freeze of the repo market repurchase agreement form of short term borrowing in september it was attributed to a timing need to cover tax payments which is difficult to believe injection of liquidity in response the fed flooded the repo market with liquidity about 240 billion worth which can cure most any problem at least temporarily it also ended quantitative tightening which was draining liquidity the fed s balance sheet is growing again which increases liquidity the u s economic data is looking healthy enough to sustain a bull market unemployment is at a 50 year low inflation is still tame not surprisingly personal income and consumer confidence are both rising worker income is finally rising faster than prices holiday retail sales were strong small business confidence is up the durable goods orders suggest the weakening manufacturing sector seems to have finally stabilized this volatility index vix has improved from 25 a year ago to 13 now however this strong economy has been fueled by a weak fed and massive fiscal stimulus from deficit budgets as well as corporate earnings growth famed market bull ed yardeni expects earnings to increase only 5 percent in 2020 in 2019 the combined global stock markets rose about 24 percent a whopping 17 trillion to almost 90 trillion with russia as the best performing stock market up 45 percent and chile as the worst down 11 percent stock market disconnect an increasing global concern is the disconnect between economic growth and investment performance how can stocks go up 20 percent when the economy is growing at only 2 percent with support from deficit spending and central banks worldwide as well as some earnings growth that s how today s greatest economic unknown is the global impact of negative interest rates used primarily in europe and already totaling a huge 17 trillion many european asset managers have wisely abandoned asset allocation using bonds the fed has assured congress it has no plans to follow the european lead good also worrisome is the debt levels of u s and chinese government and business debt which are all at record levels credit rating agency moody s just put out a major warning on junk bonds another debt crisis anyone fortunately mortgage debt and other consumer debt are at relatively healthy levels of course there is always negative economic data such as the index of leading economic indicators which has fallen for three straight months for the first time since 2009 the ism nonmanufacturing index is signaling slower growth the falling monthly trade deficit looks like good news but it is due to rapidly falling imports reflecting the trade war which is a long way from being over the usmca or united states mexico canada agreement is still not finalized phase two of a china deal has not even started and now we are threatening 100 percent tariffs on some european products stable for now nonetheless the economy appears stable for now in comparison the stock market looks overheated the relative strength index says it is 15 percent over bought investment giant vanguard predicts a 50 percent probability of a 10 percent drop in 2020 election years tend to be bumpy for the stock market during the first half as uncertainty rises before it rises in the second half as uncertainty falls 2016 was an obvious exception to that wall street currently anticipates president trump will be re elected for the last decade the technology sector has performed the best and that is expected to continue except those privacy shredding companies which have been targeted by congress after a lost decade for energy stocks in general it is time to reconsider noncarbon energy stocks after a strong 2019 for larger banks there is still room to run for the regional banks recovering from years of under performance the emerging markets will benefit from the weakening dollar which was inflating their dollar denominated debt the last decade was one long bull market with no recessions and only a few scares remember march of 2009 many investors do not and that worries me my biggest concern for the next decade is the continuing trillion dollar annual budget deficits and our continuing inability to address it without the usual political talking points jim flinchum is an investment strategist with bay capital advisors a

first a review of last week s events eur usd holidays are for people to get distracted for a while from daily problems plunging into the magic atmosphere of miracle expectation and miracles happen and financial markets are no exception as we have already warned our readers in normal times investors look either towards the riskier stock market or seek to hide their capital in safe havens preferring government bonds gold and safe haven currencies but christmas and new year are unusual times and the market is so thin these days that it can be managed even on small volumes as a result in the last decade of december both the s p500 stock index continues to update historical highs and gold along with the yen and the franc show an impressive growth and treasury debt obligations are not going to retreat from the won positions new year s miracles that is but as you know there are much less holidays in the year than working days and the market returns to its normal state this week as for eur usd starting from november 29 the pair is slowly moving along the ascending channel on december 31 it reached its upper limit at 1 1240 and then changed direction opening the year 2020 with a gap down the pair almost got to the bottom of the channel on friday afternoon january 03 and then the pair returned to the central zone of the channel on a fairly dismal statistics on business activity in the usa index ism in manufacturing sector was below expectations and failed to rise above 50 and ended the week in the area of strong support resistance 1 1160 gbp usd the week s result of the british pound was close to zero starting at 1 3085 it ended the five day period at 1 3075 losing just 10 points however due to its relatively high volatility it did not deprive traders of the opportunity to profit its range of fluctuations over these days amounted to more than 230 points usd jpy in contrast to the pound which ended the five day period with almost zero results safe haven currencies are growing rapidly against the dollar thus the yen gained almost 135 points against the american starting from the horizon of 109 45 it finished at 108 10 cryptocurrencies the digital asset market as well as the forex market continues to sum up the results of the past year for example the online portal forklog has compiled a list of the most prominent and influential crypto persons in 2019 the top 10 is headed by the head of the bitcoin exchange binance changpeng zhao in the middle of the list is the head of facebook mark zuckerberg and the telegram creator pavel durov and the top ten is completed by chinese president xí jìnpíng and ethereum developer vitalik buterin bitcoin despite all the rate hikes rose by 110 in 12 months the s p500 index rose by 22 8 and gold added 19 over the same period the result for the reference cryptocurrency in general is quite good but only for those investors who invested in the coin at the beginning of the year and not in the mid summer for the latter a completely different sad melody sounds now let s move on to the results of the last week and here there is nothing to talk about the same side trend the pair btc usd grows to 7 550 on dec 29 then drops to 6 900 by 03 january and then returns to where it started the week in the area of 7 300 in general it is a complete disappointment for investors but as for active traders who trade on short timeframes with a leverage of 1 50 like with the broker nordfx the jumps of 650 is a good opportunity to make a profit as for the top altcoins things are also flat here there is a movement in very narrow side channels with gradual consolidation for a third week running ripple xrp usd is around 0 19 ethereum eth usd 130 and litecoin ltc usd 42 per coin the total capitalization of the crypto market has fallen to 190 billion and bitcoin crypto fear greed index is gradually approaching its neutral position now it is at 38 which in fact also indicates a stagnation in the market as for the forecast for the coming week summarizing the opinions of a number of experts as well as forecasts made on the basis of a variety of methods of technical and graphical analysis we can say the following eur usd last week we summarized the forecasts given for 2020 by analysts at jpmorgan chase goldman sachs bank of america merrill lynch deutsche bank and a number of other global banks recall that in general they reached a consensus predicting the fall of the dollar against the euro and the growth of the pair to levels from 1 1400 to 1 2000 the main reason was a slowdown in global economic growth which should increase demand for riskier assets especially so since the us federal reserve on the eve of the presidential election under pressure from donald trump is likely to continue to reduce interest rates or at least keep them at the existing level however there is also an opposite opinion which is again tied to the us presidential election it is noted that it is during the election years that the us currency shows particularly good results in such periods over the past 40 years the usd index declined only twice but the euro fell in 9 cases out of 11 so if you focus on these statistics the dollar should be bought not sold moreover for central banks it is still the main reserve currency far ahead of any other assets as for the near future 55 of experts supported by 85 of indicators on d1 expect the pair to grow to the upper limit of the ascending channel at the level of 1 1240 the next target is 1 1330 the strengthening of the euro over the dollar can be also facilitated by the macroeconomic data which we will learn next week so on tuesday january 07 the december value of the ism business activity index in the service sector will be known and on friday data on the labor market in the united states will be released and if the number of new jobs outside the agricultural sector nfp decreases according to the forecast by 40 from 266k to 160k this will have a negative impact on the dollar however often the market reacts in advance to such predictions so that immediately at the time of the release of statistics there may not be strong jerks in addition to these 55 of bull supporters there are also 45 of experts who support bearish sentiment 85 of the indicators on h4 and graphical analysis on the same timeframe side with them support levels are 1 1100 1 1065 and 1 1000 gbp usd the situation with the pound is again confused and depends on how and what happens to the process of leaving the eu the head of the european commission ursula von der leyen expressed concern that there is little time left for negotiations on the uk s relations with the european union after brexit in her view the 11 month transition period for negotiations is extremely short and may have to be extended and her deputy frans timmermans called on the british to immediately return to the bosom of the european family after the divorce in the meantime 60 of experts expect the pair to grow to the upper limit of the channel 1 3050 1 3215 the goals in case of a breakout are 1 3285 1 3425 and the december 13 high of 1 3515 graphical analysis 15 of trend indicators on d1 and the same number of oscillators that give signals about the pair being oversold agree with this development the remaining 40 of analysts and the vast majority of indicators vote for the fall of the pair the nearest strong support is at 1 2975 the goal is to reach the 1 2825 1 2900 zone usd jpy supported by graphical analysis on d1 70 of analysts believe that the fall of the pair will stop at the level of 107 80 having fought off from which the pair will first go to the resistance of 109 25 and then to the maximum values of last december in the area of 109 70 30 expect that the strengthening of the yen will continue so the pair will be able to fall to the support of 107 50 and then another 100 points lower as for the indicators 100 of them are colored red on h4 and 85 on d1 signals of the pair being oversold are given by 15 of oscillators on d1 which is often confirmed by the rapid change of trend cryptocurrencies forecasts for the near future are as gray and boring as the charts of crypto pairs however the closer to the may halving of bitcoin the more green color and optimism of experts appear 70 of them expect that the quotes will go up sharply the picture is similar among investors according to tradeblock only 30 of btc coins were in motion in 2019 the remaining 70 are in wallets in a frozen state in the hope of a future growth of course there are pessimists among analysts according to their forecasts the pair btc usd will soon have another fall the new generation of mining equipment asic s17 and t17 makes this process cost effective even if bitcoin falls to the 3500 4400 zone and this is where they believe the really strong support is located but if the pair breaks through it then we can talk about the end of the 10 year history of the world s first digital currency
the extempore speech has been transcripted and marginally edited it is a privilege to be here this morning at the very prestigious india economic conclave organised by the times network i assumed charge of the reserve bank last year on december 12 and this event was held around that time having witnessed many of the proceedings of the event last year on television i looked forward to participating in this year s conclave i must also compliment shri anand of times network and shri vaidyanathan of idfc first bank for introducing the subject and the theme of the event succinctly 2 today as we sit down and talk here or elsewhere almost every discussion converges on the state of the indian economy multiple views are expressed multiple analyses are done and multiple suggestions are made the whole country s interest in the economy is a very good sign there is indeed a need for very informed and objective conversation on the state of the indian economy and more importantly about our future course of action 3 in this context i propose to talk about the important role of the reserve bank of india in creating a financial system for the 21st century with a focus on the growth aspect financial stability which is essential for growth and economic development will also be touched upon by me role of the reserve bank of india 4 as a national institution the reserve bank predates the independence of india the preamble of the rbi act 1934 states the rbi s role as to regulate the issue of banknotes and the keeping of reserves with a view to securing monetary stability in india and generally to operate the currency and credit system of the country to its advantage 5 this mandate has been interpreted over time as to maintain price stability financial stability and economic growth with the relative emphasis between these objectives governed by the prevailing macroeconomic conditions in may 2016 the rbi act was amended and the role of the reserve bank in the area of monetary policy has been restated as follows the primary objective of monetary policy is to maintain price stability while keeping in mind the objective of growth 6 empowered by this mandate the rbi adopted a flexible inflation targeting fit framework under which primacy is accorded to the objective of price stability defined numerically by a target of 4 per cent for consumer price headline inflation with a tolerance band of 2 per cent around it while simultaneously focusing on growth when inflation is under control the relative emphasis on inflation and growth depends on the macroeconomic scenario inflation and growth outlook and signals emerging from incoming data 7 post global financial crisis gfc financial stability has emerged as a key priority for central banks around the world though the jury is still out as to whether it should be added as an explicit objective of monetary policy the fact remains that it has always been an underlying theme within this mandate in fact drawing upon this mandate the reserve bank of india has taken several policy actions in recent months encompassing monetary and liquidity measures as well as macro prudential measures to reinvigorate domestic demand and accelerate the pace of economic growth simultaneously we have been taking steps to strengthen the banking and the non banking financial companies nbfc sector the reserve bank of india will continue to do whatever is necessary to deal with the multiple challenges of growth slowdown spikes of inflationary pressures and health of the domestic banking sector and nbfcs 8 having briefly touched upon the role of the reserve bank let me now turn to growth and then to financial stability global growth 9 in the recent couple of years we have seen that global growth has slowed down because of trade tensions protectionist tendencies lingering uncertainty over brexit among others what is critical is that the outlook on all these is ever changing 10 talking about the ongoing trade tensions one often hears of statements about trade wars between the two leading nations coming to an end one day followed by contrary news the next day this fluctuation has been happening over a period especially in the last few months yesterday s announcement of the united states of america usa and china coming to some understanding hopefully will be sustainable and will not get reversed in the coming weeks or months media reports of china increasing its agricultural imports from the usa and the usa going slow on its proposal to levy new tariffs on chinese imports i hope will bring in a lot of certainty in the global trade and growth spheres 11 similarly in the case of brexit there has been a positive development in the sense that there is a stable government which is committed to brexit earlier the debate in the public space in the united kingdom uk was oscillating between brexit and no brexit fortunately as it would appear there is some element of certainty coming in there 12 to highlight the kind of uncertain times that we are living in i would like to mention one more development when the saudi oil drone strikes happened about a few months ago the oil markets went into great suspense immediately in an interview within two three days of the drone strikes i was asked a question by your channel et now and i had said that i will wait for at least two weeks to see saudi arabia s revival plan but fortunately within no time the saudi authorities were able to put together a revival plan and the shock was rendered temporary while the times are uncertain it is good that efforts are being put in to reduce the element of uncertainty 13 against this backdrop i had observed in my intervention at the introductory session of the imf s international monetary and financial committee imfc meeting in october 2019 that we all member countries need to act now and together to prevent the slowdown from becoming entrenched 14 global growth is widely talked about in india because it influences domestic growth as well i do not intend to imply that the slowdown that we are experiencing in the country is entirely due to global factors but they do have an impact for emerging market economies such as india quick revival of growth is very important considering their contribution to global growth and there is therefore a need for coordinated and timely action by all countries this is a point which needs to be driven home very strongly 15 in 2008 when the global financial crisis gfc happened multilateralism was at the forefront of global discourse ten years later today when there is a global slowdown it is no more the dominant theme bilateralism has overtaken the multilateral sentiment all the g 20 countries led by the usa had come together post gfc and worked out a global plan of action to revive growth we do not see that kind of global action in the current scenario i only hope that global growth does not suffer from hysteresis that is delayed action by countries should not overtake or should not stifle the recovery process for example even though quarterly growth annualised in the euro area ea has been stable in the last two quarters it was 0 8 per cent in q2 and q3 of this year it is not what the ea would like to have we find that there is space for fiscal policy action in many of the larger european economies but we are yet to see any traction on that front these countries may have their own reasons for holding back fiscal action but as an outsider and after my interaction with central bank governors of other major economies it is felt that fiscal action in europe is somewhat delayed and we are yet to see the kind of fiscal action that we saw in 2008 in fact it is noteworthy that the new chief of european central bank ms christine lagarde has stressed the need for some amount of fiscal expansion by countries in the ea which can afford to do so 16 talking about the world growth scenario we find that there are some marginal signs of pickup in the us economy with growth in q3 being 2 1 per cent in comparison to 2 0 per cent in q2 of 2019 the uk which recorded a surprising growth of 0 8 per cent in q2 has reported a 1 2 per cent annualised growth in q3 growth in china has decelerated south africa has witnessed a decline in growth from 3 2 per cent in q2 to 0 6 per cent in q3 brazil has shown some marginal improvement the overall picture however remains unclear 17 fortunately for india both government and the reserve bank have acted in time with regard to the rbi i can say that the markets were somewhat surprised by rbi s action a little ahead of time in terms of reduction in policy rate as early as in february 2019 when we anticipated that a momentum for a slowdown is building up the government on its part has also announced several policy measures in the last five to six months 18 i would like to conclude this part of my intervention by saying that a synchronised slowdown across countries necessitates coordinated policy action by major economies domestic economic growth 19 coming to domestic economy it is imperative that we recognise and highlight the growth drivers of the past and the present what led the indian growth story in the last two to three decades which sectors could play that role today growth drivers of the past 20 in the late 1990s and the first decade of the 21st century it was essentially the information technology it sector which led the growth india was able to capitalise on the it boom in fact india s software exports went up by 13 times from about us 6 3 billion in 2000 2001 to us 83 5 billion in 2018 19 the telecom revolution also happened during the same period and created a lot of new jobs and also added to the gross domestic product gdp the infrastructure sector especially the construction of highways also expanded with the golden quadrilateral and the other initiatives that followed riding on the global growth manufacturing activity was mainly driven by new automobile companies which made entry into india such as ford hyundai toyota renault and nissan among others maruti and ashok leyland went for expansion and new manufacturing facilities came up simultaneously big global electronic hardware and manufacturing companies started setting up their base in india furthermore the incredible india campaign was initiated and large number of foreign tourists started taking interest in india in fact receipts from the tourism sector grew by almost eight times from us 3 5 billion in 2000 01 to us 28 4 billion in 2018 19 growth in the late 1990s and in the early years of this century was thus primarily driven by it telecom manufacturing especially in automobiles electronics and tourism related segments within the service sector also experienced concomitant expansion what can be the growth drivers of today 21 going forward india should strive and become a part of the global manufacturing value chain we have been fairly insulated from the global value chain therefore when major manufacturing economies experienced slowdown in the past india was not significantly impacted it cannot be a justification for remaining permanently away from it for far too long for a major economy such as ours which is increasingly making its global presence felt it is necessary to play a significant part of the global value chain i am sure that the policy makers in the government will give due attention to this aspect there are of course a number of steps which have been taken in this direction in the recent months and years however more steps are necessary 22 food processing could be another area we also need to regain our pre eminence in textiles opportunities in the manufacturing and tourism sectors need to be explored further spending on infrastructure by the central and state governments is another important area capital expenditure of states has remained stagnant around 2 6 2 7 per cent of their gross domestic product gdp over the last few years this needs to be stepped up e commerce and start ups offer new opportunities and several steps have been taken to create an enabling ecosystem in these areas 23 the rbi s role in the context of revival of growth has been multi pronged as i mentioned earlier we have pre emptively reduced the policy rate by 135 basis points between february 2019 and now to reinvigorate demand in keeping with the accommodative stance the reserve bank has injected a sizable amount of liquidity into the system which was in deficit for a very long time currently the system is in daily surplus by about 2 5 3 0 lakh crore that is the quantum of money we are absorbing through reverse repo operations every day 24 to ensure better and higher credit flow we have taken several measures to touch upon a few we have increased the single exposure limit for banks to nbfcs allowed commercial bank lending to nbfcs for on lending to certain sectors of the priority sector and reduced the risk weights for banks in certain category of loans to individuals without compromising on any of the macro prudential principles which is prescribed under the basel norms role of rbi in maintaining financial stability 25 this brings me to the role that rbi plays in maintaining financial stability in this regard i would like to share certain interesting facts i touched upon it briefly in the press conference post monetary policy but i would like to highlight a few points again we did a survey of 1539 listed manufacturing companies and an analysis was done based on their h1 2019 20 unaudited half yearly statements which indicate the following these manufacturing companies have increased their investment in fixed assets including capital work in progress during the first half of 2019 20 45 6 per cent of the funds available with these companies were deployed in fixed assets as compared to 18 9 per cent in the first six months of last year which means that there was a certain quantum of funds available with the manufacturing companies which was put into fixed assets this probably means that some signs of revival are beginning to show in the investment cycle i must qualify by saying that it is too early to rush into any conclusion nonetheless this is an interesting fact which deserves attention our analysis also showed that there is evidence of some amount of deleveraging i e reduction in borrowing during the first half of this financial year the proportion of available funds that was used to reduce the long term and short term borrowing during the first half of 2019 20 was 11 per cent and 4 2 per cent respectively many companies are not availing their working capital limits to the full which may not be a very good sign it points to some slowdown in the economic activity on the other hand it could also imply that they have adequate surplus with them which is being used to meet their working capital requirements as time progresses one would expect them to utilise more of these funds in investments in other words there is a certain amount of capital available in the system which needs to feed into the investment cycle 26 what explains this phenomenon my sense is that there is a process of cleaning up of balance sheets going on in the corporates so as far as these corporates are concerned new investments are being carefully thought through they have certain amount of funds available certain amount of investable resources at their disposal but they are in the process of deleveraging and cleaning up of their own balance sheets before they can restart their investment plans 27 banks and nbfcs are cleaning up their balance sheets as well these are positive signs which are creating a base for future growth in the case of scheduled commercial banks scbs we find that the system wide capital to risk weighted assets ratio crar is about 14 3 per cent at the end of march 2019 comparable numbers for other countries like china and the us are 14 1 per cent and 14 9 per cent respectively one of course must mention that in the advanced european countries like france and germany it is a little higher at about 18 19 per cent but our 14 3 per cent is well above the regulatory requirement 28 the problem of stressed assets is also being addressed and the resolution of non performing assets npas has gathered momentum the supreme court s judgment in the case of essar steel has really unclogged a major resolution issue which had been pending for quite some time there has been improvement in the gross npa figures after a long time scheduled commercial banks especially the public sector banks have had perceptible improvement in profitability 29 in this context the role of the reserve bank has been to focus on strengthening regulation and supervision to create or to facilitate a robust framework of financial stability where the banks and the nbfcs will be able to fulfil the expectations of the society we have carried out a review of regulations of banks and nbfcs in the recent months and have brought about several improvements regarding their supervision we have created separate departments of supervision and regulation there is a college of supervisors which is being set up to improve the supervisory skills of our personnel and an internal research and analysis wing is being set up within the regulation and supervision departments to support them with analytical and research inputs because of the interconnectedness of our financial system this research and analysis wing will be able to see things together correlate them and look at issues holistically and identify the possible vulnerable areas and the possible weak or fragile spots if any that are showing signs of coming up 30 we also need to focus on 21st century banking in which a lot of activity is currently taking place in digital banking we have put in place a regulatory sandbox for fintech in the digital payments space the reserve bank has played an important role in creating a kind of a model unified payments interface upi that is being watched internationally the bank of international settlements bis in a very recently published paper has said that the upi framework of india can become an international model to facilitate quick and seamless payments not only within countries but across countries the national payments corporation of india npci has decided to set up a subsidiary to focus on taking the upi model to other countries as a business proposition role of communication 31 while doing all these an important area which is not often discussed about but which i would like to specifically mention is communication while there have been divergent opinions about central bank communication there is no denying the fact that it plays a very important role in the functioning of a central bank some central bankers in the past have believed that central bank communication should be delightfully vague that is at the end of a governor s talk when one tries to understand what he said one realises that he has said nothing or nothing new the counter view is that central bank communication should give clarity should bring about transparency in its policymaking and should also give some forward guidance 32 it is for you to assess how we have fared in this aspect but we have tried to strengthen our communication in the recent months i would not say that it is for the first time as it has happened earlier too but that by and large the focus of rbi s communication has been to give greater clarity to what goes behind decisions and be as transparent as possible in fact i can share that in the last few months whenever we have taken any major policy decision we have had detailed and long meetings with analysts researchers and media personnel we have also had discussions with academic bodies and research institutions and these are held closed door so that a free and frank discussion can flow and we can try to explain what has gone into the decision making process for the first time we have also started giving forward guidance about our major policy decisions especially with regard to monetary policy let me give some examples about six months ago in one of the monetary policy committee mpc resolutions we had said that growth is a matter of highest priority as long as inflation is under control we gave a very clear message that so far as the reserve bank is concerned so far as the monetary policy is concerned and so far as the mpc is concerned growth is a matter of highest priority to give some amount of forward guidance to the market and the analysts after we had changed our stance to accommodative a few months ago we had said in the mpc resolution that the reserve bank will continue the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive growth while keeping in mind the inflation target when we took a pause in the last mpc meeting i do not know why the markets said that they were surprised i was told that the market was surprised by our policy decision in february but subsequently i am happy and want to thank all of you for accepting that it was the right call to take this time around too with the pause that we have taken i do hope that the events will unfold in a manner which will prove that the mpc s decision was right but that is not the point i am trying to make and only time will tell how the situation evolves when we took the pause the mpc very clearly recognised that monetary space is available and it will use this space as per requirement keeping in mind the incoming data regarding inflation and growth this can be construed as an example of forward guidance wherein the reasons for the pause have been very elaborately explained in the mpc resolution and in the statement which i made during the press conference it is available on the rbi website in our decision to take a pause while we have said that there is space for further monetary policy action we have very carefully and very definitively also said that the timing will have to be decided in a manner that its impact is optimum and maximised 33 we have in fact in other policy measures also tried to bring about a lot of transparency showing our focus on communication to explain the power of communication let me mention the 2008 global financial crisis and the expansionary policy that the us fed adopted at that time the communication at that time was very powerful therefore it was accepted by the international markets and the analysts everybody understood exactly what the fed was going to do in 2013 during the so called taper tantrum the us fed s communication was not as powerful a mere mention that they are perhaps going to roll back or unwind the expansionary policy created a huge havoc and volatility in the international financial markets communication therefore is a powerful tool any decision that is taken by the central bank has to be backed by communication of course communication should be backed by action and it should never be empty words conclusion 34 let me conclude by saying that in a complex and interconnected economy such as india challenges emanate from the spheres of monetary policy regulation and supervision of financial markets as well as detection of frauds risk management functions and internal control systems of banks and non banks amongst others 35 consequently there is never a dull moment in the central bank it is always full of challenges what is important is that we should respond to these in time recently an old timer in mumbai told me that you have winds blowing from two different directions in the top floors of the reserve bank i thought he was talking about the role of the reserve bank and how complex it is until i realised that he meant that the wind actually blows in from two different directions my reply to him was well that would demonstrate how complex and challenging is the role of reserve bank in a complex economy like india thank you
for decades nigeria s economic outcome in each year has never failed projections and expectations that were based on the activities of the preceding year unfortunately it has all been mostly for unpalatable events one of the worrisome antecedents is the nation s debt sojourn it has assumed a geometric rise year after year while the revenue predictably has taken the opposite direction nigeria is in for it in 2020 the director general of the lagos chamber of commerce and industry lcci muda yusuf told the guardian that there are expectations that the country s debt profile will trend upwards by 2020 especially on approval of 3 billion credit facility from world bank for power sector reforms he said it is also expected to rise with a possible ratification of 29 96 billion loan request for infrastructure development currently pending at the national assembly but mostly the widening fiscal deficit as passed in 2020 budget at n2 7 trillion against n 2 1 trillion in 2019 is a sure bet for borrowing coupled with increased appetite for government securities by institutional investors following their exclusion from open market operations the rising indebtedness of the economy calls for concern as increased debt stock failed to stimulate neither growth nor infrastructure development given nigeria s revenue challenges the country will continue to spend a large chunk of its earnings to service debt the opportunity cost of high debt service commitment for the economy and citizens is very high there is also the exchange rate risk inherent in the exposure to mounting foreign debt which we need to worry about as the currency depreciates the burden of servicing foreign debt would intensify this is a major problem with increasing the stock of foreign debt he said indeed nigeria would be facing another round of fiscal headwinds in 2020 with the mix of 83 billion debt rising recurrent expenditure increased cost of debt servicing sustained fall in revenue and about 22 billion debt plan waiting for legislative approval it may be worse if the anticipated shocks from the global economy like the brexit the united states china trade war and interest rate policy of the federal reserve bank go awry the nation s debt stock currently at 83billion comes with huge debt service provision in excess of n2 1 trillion in 2019 but set to rise in 2020 with approved provision of about n2 7 trillion but the challenge is stemming from the country s revenue crisis which has remained unabating in the last five years while the borrowings have persisted an indication that the economy has been primed for recurring tough outcomes the newly appointed chairman of the federal inland revenue service muhammad nami has reportedly lamented the revenue shortfall particularly from the revenue agency after several initiatives were put up to ramp up inflows despite the rise in the service s workforce the engagement of consultants the rise in inflation and the exchange rates the tax revenue collection continues to dwindle he said during the 2019 fiscal year despite claims of improvements in revenue flows federal government has recorded hundreds of billions in budgetary shortfalls in all the quarters with november alone recording n218 05 billion the nation s quarterly economic report published by the central bank of nigeria cbn showed that the revenue crisis is not getting any better as the federal government recorded serial deficits in excess of n1trillion in the first 11 months of 2019 specifically a retrospective analysis of the federal government s 2018 budget performance showed that the government spent a sum of n7 51 trillion based on a total revenue of n3 86 trillion creating a deficit of n3 64 trillion an indication that all is yet to be well the civic tech organisation budgit noted that while government planned to earn n7 16 trillion in 2018 it was only able to reach n3 85 trillion which represents 54 per cent revenue performance according to budgit s findings the government has always spent more on debt servicing at the same time that its debt profile is growing astronomically although the government recorded revenue of n3 86 trillion it also spent n5 86 trillion on recurrent expenditure meaning that n2 trillion was borrowed to fund recurrent expenses in 2018 it spent n2 09 trillion on servicing public debts a figure that grew from n1 63 trillion in 2017 as it is fg is spending so much on servicing debts while it plans to even borrow more the government borrowed a total of n1 74 trillion in 2018 yet the sources for additional deficit borrowing of n1 9 trillion was not stated in its report the principal lead at budgit gabriel okeowo said according to him there is need for details of government s expenditures for proper verification and public accountability while we wonder why other financing sources are not explained by the government it is clear that nigeria has a huge revenue problem and the current pace of recurrent expenditure growth mainly salaries and debt servicing is not sustainable he said an economist ucha wagbo said the principal officers of this administration are wishing away the evil reality by just following the stereotypes which the minister of finance zainab ahmed and former minister of budget udo udoma scripted the rhetoric that our total borrowing rate is just under 50 per cent of our gross domestic product gdp and that the multilateral institutions projected a country like ours to borrow from 50 to 55 per cent of the gdp are lame excuses are the multilateral institutions not the ones telling us now to mind how we borrow will the 50 per cent borrowing pay our debts if the proceeds are wasted on frivolities what does he understand as debt crisis is it when the country cannot pay at all if you service your debt with a quarter of your total budget or use more than 60 of your income to service debt are you better off the truth is that nigeria has debt problem and 2020 will be challenging he said similarly government s recurrent expenditure which has been on the rise in the last four years will distort government s economic projections further in 2020 as the new minimum wage adds to huge costs associated with governance while the recurrent expenditure shot up to n5 39 trillion in 2018 representing n800 billion growth in one year without new minimum wage implementation just in november 2019 the federal government spent 95 9 per cent of its resources on statutory transfers 7 2 per cent and recurrent expenditure 88 7 per cent leaving only 4 1 per cent for capital projects federal government s personnel costs rose from n1 8 trillion in 2017 to n2 1 trillion in 2018 without the full implementation of the new minimum wage plan a fiscal governance campaigner eze onyekpere said this administration has unresolved contradictions between between its mantra of cutting down waste improving efficiencies and removing ghost workers from the payroll and the rising recurrent non debt expenditure actual recurrent non debt expenditure was n2 51 trillion in 2016 n2 76 trillion in 2017 and n3 103 trillion in 2018 for the half year in 2019 it has reached n2 05 trillion which is 21 per cent more than the pro rated value of recurrent non debt expenditure in the 2019 budget this increment to n4 88 trillion in 2020 cannot be the sign of a system that is taking steps to remove waste and inefficiencies even though a new minimum wage is kicking in efforts should be made to reduce the cost of governance through the implementation of fit and good practices he said raising concerns on the country s debt sojourn he said the rising debt service is crowding out expenditure in critical infrastructure and human development if there is a shortfall in revenue salaries and overheads will be drawn down debts will be serviced but capital projects will suffer how will nigeria be better like this what is the basis for hope in 2020 he queried inflation brouhaha inflation started trending downwards in the first quarter q1 and q2 of 2019 but assumed a reversal mode in q3 as cbn s restriction on food related imports started putting pressure on local food prices and other manufacturing inputs worse still the closure of land borders as a foil to smuggling and heightened insecurity in the country stoked panic buying as well as supply shortage according proshare analysis inflation which started 2019 at 11 37 per cent in january fell to 11 22 per cent at the end of q2 2019 and by july the aggregate price level growth had slowed to 11 02 per cent raised optimism that cbn would by q2 of 2020 be within its target band of between six per cent and nine per cent unfortunately the cbn s move to tighten the noose on importers of food and related products by denying them access to the official foreign exchange market added to the rise in the price of food food inflation grew faster than the general headline inflation rate throughout 2019 food inflation rose from 13 51 per cent in january 2019 to 13 56 per cent at the end of q2 2019 and fell slightly by 0 05 per cent to 13 51 per cent at the end of q3 2019 at the end of 2019 food inflation worsened and rose to 14 48 per cent in november payment system landscape perhaps one of the brightest points in 2020 will be the evolving payment system landscape which just took off with price slashes in the cost of banking and financial services but initial skepticism is still high over the strict compliance by banks and payment system service providers since january 1 2020 a graduated fee scale for electronic transfers to replace the current flat fee of n50 began as transfers below n10 000 now attract a maximum charge of n10 transfer from n5001 n50 000 n25 and transfers above n50 000 n50 card maintenance fee on the current account has been removed as the accounts already attract maintenance fees savings accounts now attract a card maintenance fee of n50 per quarter three months from n50 per month yearly card maintenance fee on foreign currency denominated cards is reduced to 10 from 20 remote on us that is automated teller machine atm charges after third withdrawal from other banks machines within a month are reduced to n35 from n65 the charge for hardware token will be on a cost recovery basis subject to a maximum of n2 500 from previous maximum charge of n3 500 while the fee for sms mandatory alert will be on cost recovery from previous maximum charge of n4 bill payment via e channels will attract a maximum charge of n500 from 0 75 per cent of the transaction value subject to a maximum of n1 200 meanwhile some banks are already sending messages to their customers as readiness for the commencement of the new charges which cut nearly all applicable fees by the lenders significantly the apex bank said the revision of the guide to charges and strengthening of the consumer protection regulation was necessitated by continued evolution in the financial industry over the past few years which has spurred innovation and the introduction of new products channels and or participants
spread the love fiscal discipline is important if zimbabwe is going to achieve monetary stability in 2020 economists have said by panashe chikonyora zimbabwe has been undergoing a currency change from the use of multiple currencies to the re introduction of local currency zimdollar in the latest development in this respect the reserve bank of zimbabwe said it will release higher denomination notes to improve cash availability in the market economists who spoke to herald finance business have expressed mixed views on the higher denomination 10 and 20 bond notes pan african chamber of commerce board member langton mabhanga said the introduction of higher denomination notes without integrity and ethical behaviour by the monetary and financial system is insufficient in taming inflation there is a full record of new notes unleashed straight into the black market domain we need tight regulations that monitor and control deployment of the high volumes of rtgs balances that are resident in the banks profit wallets these balances can be the hot money being deployed to mop up us dollars on the black market hence pushing prices of commodities up and consequently pushing inflation up he said the way the rbz is dispensing money into the banks is depreciating the value of our local currency because more money in the banks means more cash will circulate in the black market and the foreign currency market will continue to expand as dealers will continue to change money at higher rates higher rates will lead to price increases and further surge inflation the minister of finance and rbz governor must put the banks on the latch and stop them from unleashing bulk notes into the black market we rather have two ethical banks than the current too many that are fleecing the transacting public and fuelling inflation added mr mabhanga inflation is the rate at which prices of goods and services in an economy increase over a measured period mostly a month or a year normally it is caused by various factors key among them being an increase in the money supply that out paces economic growth which usually leads to higher borrowing costs for businesses and people needing loans and mortgages however a decline in inflation does not imply a decrease in prices but signifies slower pace of average price increases as the pricing regime in zimbabwe is largely linked to the money supply determined exchange rates last year zimbabwe s inflation rate for october reached 39 9 percent the highest rate but later retreated to 17 5 percent month on month towards year end in november the lowest rate in the last five months confederation of zimbabwe industries czi president henry ruzvidzo concurred with mr mabhanga saying that the move can be positive if fiscal and monetary authorities remained disciplined to maintain relative stability the arbitrage space that has been in existence with bond notes is unhealthy if sufficient currency is introduced some stability can be achieved as the velocity of electronic money is much more than for cash he said meanwhile economist eddie cross lauded the move saying that it is positive the impact on inflation will be negated by the mpc insisting that the new notes are only introduced to the market via the commercial banks but it will help with liquidity and enable people to use the local currency in the market said mr cross at its last meeting on november 29 2019 the monetary policy committee of which mr cross is a member noted that the country s expansionary fiscal policy was expected to pile inflationary pressure on the economy the committee noted that the country s 2020 national budget had potential expansionary impact on money supply which limits the scope for tightening of monetary policy as required under the bank s disinflation programme the central bank last year said it was targeting monthly inflation of 10 percent said confederation of zimbabwe retailers president denford matashu without being pessimistic the currency challenges in our economy will not go away anytime soon as long as the level of informalisation in our economy is averaging 70 percent money just like blood has to circulate there is no point in blaming rbz governor of the current hyperinflation as the key drivers remain shambolic like production informal sector burgeoning and low levels of exports bigger notes even if you repaint them will not do much in a country full of speculators dealers and non productive citizenry we have also become lazy and mourn with no production even at household level the mentality to wait for government to do things for us should go away i think it depends on how these higher denomination notes are being introduced if they are being introduced as additional money they will increase inflation rate but if they are introduced as something that already existed when the new bond notes were introduced or as a replacement then they won t surge inflation i think government has played its part and we as citizens are to blame for example the mono currency system government introduced which people are fighting we are playing with money especially if you look at the informal sectors commuter omnibus operators are getting a lot of money which they are not returning to the banks this simply means that people are milking money from the banks hence money is not circulating share this share twitter facebook email linkedin reddit pinterest whatsapp like this like loading
file photo the bank of ghana bog on november 29th 2019 released a document justifying the need for the introduction of higher value denomination currency hvd notes the question of whether hvd notes are warranted at any point in time is not a merely conceptual one it is in fact a highly empirical enquiry to be approached from a careful analysis of considerable amounts of data about the proportional use of different notes and the differential costs of security and distribution one cannot have random opinions about such a subject and expect to be taken seriously i don t have any data on the contemporary usage patterns of the different ghana cedi ghs notes in circulation or about the costs of printing different notes like most ghanaians therefore i did not have too much difficulty delegating all thinking about the issue to the fine technocrats at the central bank until now a bunch of controversies arising from the refusal of major supermarkets and even banks to accept the new notes because they lack the means to validate their authenticity compelled me to finally take a look at the bog s explanatory documents today after all item authentication has been a decade and half interest of mine having now read the bog document and subsequent bog press releases on the subject i am suddenly completely unsure of my earlier faith in the central bank to do all our thinking for us in this matter i will simply lay out the worrying things i found and let readers of this blog judge for themselves the most problematic element of the bog s analysis is the central reason it offers for introducing the hvd notes in the very first paragraph of the original q a formatted release it states as follows high levels of inflation and currency depreciation in the past have eroded some of the gains from redenomination the deadweight burden reflected in high transaction cost has re emerged in this one statement is contained all the alarm bells about the depth of technical preparation that should have gone into this exercise except in cases of hyperinflation and hyper depreciation requiring a new currency series high value denomination notes are almost never justified by the need to counter or offset routine inflationary pressures over time for example when the 100 was first introduced in the us in 1869 and reintroduced as a federal reserve note in 1914 it was for a time the highest in circulation in due course larger denominations surfaced mostly as a result of wartime and other contingent exigencies by 1946 a firm decision to stop the issuing of hvd notes had been taken and by 1969 all currencies higher than 100 were being removed from active circulation to reduce the costs of fighting counterfeiting and money laundering today the 100 bill is worth only 4 if measured against its original value as a result of cumulative inflation it remains the highest denomination in circulation purely in keeping with contemporary policy an alternative policy of trying to preserve the face value of the 100 note at the time of the 1969 currency reforms would have required an introduction of 1000 and 2000 bills in the united states something that cannot be countenanced in today s anti terror and anti narcotics climate it is easier to understand the argument when one recalls that in a floating exchange regime currencies can rise and fall over time is the logic here then that should the ghana cedi strengthen against the usd consistently over time that would dictate the retirement of the largest of the hvd notes things are even starker in a managed exchange rate regime consider this fact by the time of the 1984 budget the official cedi usd exchange rate was 35 cedis to the dollar governor j s addo lowered the value to 38 5 cedis to 1 dollar in a conclusive reversal of the last peg from 1978 of 2 75 cedis to the dollar then in effect yet ahead of the latest round of managed devaluations in 1982 the highest note the 50 cedi note had been removed from circulation or demonetised ostensibly as an anti corruption measure echoing an earlier currency confiscation in 1979 when in 1984 the hvd notes of 50 100 and 200 cedis were introduced or in the case of 50 cedi note reintroduced with no serious explanation as to why fears of corruption were no longer an issue the effective worth of the highest value note was officially 5 by the time of the 1985 budget it was 3 7 more interestingly the parallel unofficial in actual fact market rate was about 156 cedi usd suggesting hence that the 50 cedi note that just 10 years earlier had been nominally worth 50 was now worth just 32 us cents 0 32 whilst the highest circulating note was worth just 1 28 in short the history of face value preservation tactics and politics in ghana betrays a ridiculous mixture of arbitrariness and confusion trying to bulwark the face value of ghana s benighted national currency notes against depreciation and inflation trends is clearly to court absurdity and also distrust in view of this messy track record at any rate the historical record clearly shows that ghana s highest value notes have for the most part generally exchanged for low dollar amounts in the 1985 to 1990 period the 500 cedi note moved from 5 5 to 1 5 peak to trough in the 1990 to 2000 period the 10000 and 20000 notes emerged as the highest value notes yet at their strongest they were about 1 4 and 2 7 respectively the dramatic change of affairs represented by the introduction of the 50 ghana cedi note in july 2007 with its debut value of 54 marking the high point of ghanaian currency face value politics in 30 years was a break with the past precisely because it also marked the start of a new series effectively a new currency such an exceptional development cannot set a precedent for the routine preservation of the currency s purchasing strength at some arbitrary usd rate by printing larger and larger notes to approximate the continuous appreciation of the highest notes nominal value s by the time of the introduction of the 100 and 200 ghana cedi notes in late 2019 the value of the 50 ghana cedi note in usd terms was about 9 in comparison with other hvd notes in ghana s history adjusting for both us and local inflation this amount as has already been shown above was big enough the largest nigerian naira note is exchanged today for 2 75 the largest kenyan shilling note is exchanged for 9 91 the largest south african rand note is exchanged for 13 8 by the time the government of india removed hvd notes out of circulation due to purported fears about money laundering and crime the highest rupee note was exchanging for 14 simply put economies comparable to ghana s in various characteristics have hvd notes well within the value range of ghana s last version the ghs50 note 2 the bog makes plausibly persuasive points about an expansion of incomes leading to an increase in preference for the then highest value notes the ghs20 and the ghs50 in the european common market for instance it is the 50 euro note not the higher value 100 and 200 euro notes or the 500 euro notes that are being demonetised over the usual concerns that are in widest circulation in the us the highest circulation bill is the 20 whilst the highest value 100 bill is mostly preferred outside the us thus the preference for higher value notes in ghana is a significant point however the point in the way it was put in the bog release that ghc50 and ghc20 account for about 70 of the total demand is completely vague is this demand being expressed in monetary value or quantity terms if in value terms then it is completely unremarkable since the face value being several multiples of the face value of the lower denomination notes their quantity could well be tiny and still constitute 70 of usage in such a scenario the need to print larger quantities would be far from clear and user preference may well tilt to a medium portion of the value spectrum as is the case in many other countries 3 it is important in connection with the above point to note that convenience is affected by both the concern about carrying large sums of low value notes and the almost converse concern about finding change when counterparties pay for goods and services with large notes thus preference is an entirely empirical matter and rather technically complex to compute if the bog wished to educate the public in this matter by releasing that statement it ought to have been clearer 4 most strangely the bog chose to provide none of the critical information that would have best assisted curious persons in evaluating the propriety of its decision to introduce high value denominations against the global trend of demonetizing high value notes at the heart of any sound analysis would be a trade off between printing less money and the concomitant result of users carrying less money and creating highly tempting targets for crime the cost of printing higher quantities of money in the face of a rising average size of transactions in the economy reduces the seigniorage revenue of the central bank thus if the average size of transactions moves upward it makes sense to introduce more hvd notes at the same time such notes are more expensive than lower value notes because they require more security features to prevent counterfeiting and more policing to suppress money laundering for example in the us the most expensive notes such as the 50 bill can be as much as four times 4x costlier to print than the cheapest ones such as the 1 bill the right balance between transactional convenience and policing cost is as always entirely empirical by refusing to provide a breakdown of the costs of printing the different bills and the quantities in circulation as well as the average velocity per class and other critical monetary parameters the bog shows a complete disinterest in helping analysts come to any sensible conclusions about the need for these new hvd notes 5 the weirdest of all the claims in the bog document is the assertion that somehow printing high value notes will reduce the deadweight burden associated with current transaction costs this claim is manifestly erroneous there is no welfare loss context here to even warrant use of the deadweight burden term 6 lastly we live in a time of great cynicism about the procurement practices of governments the introduction of a new class of currency notes represents a potentially major procurement opportunity for agents and representatives of the mints and printing presses in europe and america with whom the republic of ghana deals on these matters where the new bills are significantly more expensive than older bills commissions may be in order opening the door to unpleasant allegations about the real motives impelling the procurement action it would have been reassuring had the bog provided information about the procurement terms of this new production whether by de la rue the loss making financially struggling security printing firm or crane currency the controversy plagued contractor now embroiled in corruption allegations in liberia the decision to shroud all these important matters in silence including even the name of the printer mint is doing very little to dispel lingering doubts and confusion about this whole hvd notes printing business
but gdp growth fell consecutively in the first three quarters of 2019 causing concern for beijing in november the government announced 2 trillion rmb in tax and fee cuts and 2 15 trillion rmb in local government special bond issuance to stimulate the economy according to the national bureau of statistics the economy showed some positive signs of recovery in december a stage one agreement to put a hold on the trade war with the united states boosted market sentiment gdp growth is expected to improve in the last quarter helping the annual gdp growth reach the official target range of 6 6 5 per cent reaching an agreement with the united states was one of the most important developments of 2019 the first phase of the deal entails china buying more high quality us agricultural products and allows us financial services to enter the chinese market the united states will halve the 15 per cent tariff and postpone further tariffs financial markets were somewhat relieved to see the trade deal but the trade war has taken a toll on the us china relationship on global supply chains and overall business confidence it has become clear that the conflict between the united states and china is an inevitable product of the hegemonic struggle between a dominant existing economic power and an emerging one there was also some progress in financial sector reform in 2019 in august the people s bank of china introduced a market based mechanism for the loan prime rate a benchmark interest rate that commercial banks charge their best clients and which reflects market demand for credit in september the quota on qualified foreign financial institutional investors and renminbi qualified foreign financial institutional investors was removed in theory this allows licensed international investors to invest unlimited amounts in stocks and bonds the actual number of foreign investors is still far from the quota the development of the yangtze river delta is also expected to accelerate the opening of china s financial sector greater foreign access to the banking industry and stock and bond markets is expected to be granted through this region first 2020 is significant for china because it is the final year of the 13th five year plan it is also the year the government is expected to deliver on its longstanding promise of doubling 2010 gdp and household income amid an economic slow down reaching the gdp growth target is important not only for maintaining confidence in the chinese economy but also to preserve the credibility of the communist party while uncertainties around the global economy persist china is likely able to navigate these external uncertainties and lead the economy to meet its growth targets the crucial question is what policy option will be used to achieve this goal it would be unfortunate if economic development was again pursued by massive monetary and fiscal stimulus something that has been used repeatedly in the past and with diminished effectiveness and increased costs each time the only policy response to end pessimistic expectations for the chinese output train and steer the chinese economy onto a track of sustainable long term growth is reform pushing forward financial sector and soe reform and introducing functioning market mechanisms soe reform should be a policy making priority but the current soe reform agenda is worrisome in 2015 a major soe reform agenda was released but the guidelines excluded a decisive role for markets in resource allocation instead the government s agenda combines corporate governance with the institutionalisation of party leadership within soes with further reforms to make soes stronger better and bigger this is an unfortunate step backwards it is impossible to ensure a level playing field for all forms of ownership under the current reform agenda for example soes are still preferred over private firms when loan applications are considered in commercial banks due largely to the implicit government guarantees without a level playing field and meaningful competition it is hard to address overcapacity problems and eliminate zombie firms another key challenge for the chinese economy is the ever rising debt of local governments many local governments face increasing fiscal strain as their revenues do not cover expenditure needs much of which is in infrastructure investment that growth relies on the introduction of local government special bonds has not yet eased the difficulty in raising capital for infrastructure projects the trade war with the united states is another major challenge that china will continue to face china has become the world s second largest economy and its rise is naturally causing disruptions to the existing global economy amid a rise in anti globalisation and nationalism in the international environment the chinese leadership must develop long term strategies to manage relations in a multipolar world and to ensure china s rise is as smooth and beneficial as possible to the world in 2012 the chinese government reiterated two centennial goals the first goal of doubling 2010 gdp and per capita income will likely be reached when the communist party celebrates its centenary in 2021 but the second goal of transforming china into a developed country by 2049 is still far from reach reform is the key jiao wang is research fellow at

let s face it 2019 is going to be a hard year to beat stocks and 401 k plans up more than 25 on average wage gains of 3 to 5 7 million surplus jobs and the lowest unemployment and inflation rates in nearly 50 years that s a lot to celebrate booms like this don t happen by accident the imperative is for republicans to connect the dots between this banner year for the middle class and the tax cuts deregulation policies and pro america energy production initiatives so will 2020 continue the winning streak the only thing that we know for sure is that economists don t know for sure i ll include myself in that category the best i can do is provide reasons for optimism and reasons for pessimism the case for optimism 1 america has scored two big wins on the trade front the biggest risk since trump entered office was a freeze up of the global trading system because of his tariffs now with the concluding of the trade deal with canada and mexico and a very positive outlook for a trade win in the tariff wars against china investors are bullish the china deal takes an escalation of tariffs off the table for 2020 2 the federal reserve is finally getting it right a year ago the fed torpedoed the economy and the stock market fell by 2 500 points while gdp growth and investment stalled out now rates are lower there is more dollar liquidity and we have price stability with very little risk of inflation 3 trump s tax cuts are working the tax cuts have been a spectacular success in terms of generating jobs wage hikes profits and gdp growth the chances of those tax cuts going away in 2020 are close to zero if anything we might see another small tax cut in sum the policy goals are turned toward growth 4 washington will be paralyzed with partisan gridlock in 2020 good when things are going well less is more so what could go wrong here are four things to worry about 1 china trade deal blows up beijing could back out they ve done it before or they could start cheating if either happens trump hammers them with more tariffs and we are back in a trade war 2 elizabeth warren bernie sanders joe biden oh my if markets start anticipating that any of these anti growth candidates will win stocks will tumble if trump loses then we are talking green new deal medicare for all capital gains taxes wealth taxes and the end of the trump tax cuts to say this would be harmful to growth and stocks is a vast understatement and if trump loses to one of these candidates the market could collapse 3 the global economy stays flat it s been stalled out for the last year or two and if it doesn t get a boost in europe and elsewhere it s going to affect u s growth negatively we can t keep carrying the world economy on our shoulders 4 housing bubble bursts again don t look now but fannie mae and freddie mac are up to their old tricks providing near 100 loan guarantees on 2 3 down payment loans if housing values fall defaults will soar as they did in 2008 and 2009 amazingly the government has learned none of the lessons from the last housing meltdown on balance i m with the bulls for 2020 just don t expect 25 gains again this year
a financial crisis has already begunâ we just donâ t know it yet let s address an elephant in the room the rapidly expanding federal debt each annual deficit raises the total debt and forces the treasury to issue more debt in hopes someone will buy it the us government ran a 343 billion deficit in the first two months of fiscal 2020 october and november and the 12 month budget deficit again surpassed 1 trillion federal spending rose 7 from a year earlier while tax receipts grew only 3 no problem some say we owe it to ourselves and anyway people will always buy uncle sam s debt that is unfortunately not true foreign treasury buyers are turning away the foreign buyers on whom we have long depended are turning away as peter boockvar noted foreign selling of us notes and bonds continued in october by a net 16 7b this brings the year to date selling to 99b with much driven by liquidations from the chinese and japanese it was back in 2011 and 2012 when in each year foreigners bought over 400b worth thus it is domestically where we are now financing our ever increasing budget deficits the fed now has also become a big part of the monetization process via its purchases of t bills which also drives banks into buying notes the fed s balance sheet is now 335b higher than it was in september at 4 095 trillion again however the fed wants to define what it s doing market participants view this as qe4 with all the asset price inflation that comes along with qe programs it will be real interesting to see what happens in 2020 to the repo market when the fed tries to end its injections and how markets respond when its balance sheet stops increasing in size it s so easy to get involved and so difficult to leave declining foreign purchases are in part a consequence of the trade war the dollars china and japan use to buy our t bills are the same dollars we pay them for our imported goods but interest and exchange rates also matter with rates negative or lower than ours in most of the developed world the us had been the best parking place but in the last year other central banks started looking for a nirp exit higher rate expectations elsewhere combined with stable or falling us rates give foreign buyers who must also pay for currency hedges less incentive to buy us debt if you live in a foreign country and have a particular need for its local currency an extra 1 in yield isn t worth the risk of losing even more in the exchange rate i know some think china or other countries are opting out of the us treasury market for political reasons but it s simply business the math just doesn t work especially when president trump is explicitly saying he wants the dollar to weaken and interest rates go even lower if you are in country x why would you do that trade you might if you re in a country like argentina or venezuela where the currency is toast anyway but europe japan china the rest of the developed world it s a coin toss the fed began cutting rates in july funding pressures emerged weeks later coincidence i suspect not the fed started monetizing debt it sure looks like through qe4 and other activities the fed is taking the first steps toward monetizing our debt if so many more steps are ahead because the debt is only going to get worse as you can see from the chart below the fed is well on its way to reversing that 2018 quantitative tightening luke gromen of forest for the trees is one of my favorite macro thinkers he thinks the monetization plan will get more obvious in early 2020 those that believe that the fed will begin undoing what it has done since september after the year end turn are either going to be proven right or they are going to be proven wrong in q1 2020 we strongly believe they will be proven wrong if when they are the fftt view that the fed is committed to financing us deficits with its balance sheet may go from a fringe view to the mainstream both parties in congress are committed to more spending no matter who is in the white house they will encourage the federal reserve to engage in more quantitative easing so the deficit spending can continue and even grow the next recession whenever it happens will bring a 2 trillion deficit meaning a 40 trillion dollar national debt by the end of the decade at least 20 trillion of which will be on the fed s balance sheet my side bet is that in 2030 we will look back and see that i was an optimist sometime in the middle to late 2020s we will see a great reset that profoundly changes everything you know about money and investing crisis isn t simply coming we are already in the early stages of it i think we will look back at late 2019 as the beginning this period will be rough but survivable if we prepare now in fact it will

opportunity overview egypt s macroeconomic state is favorable compared to that of other msci frontier and emerging markets as the economy has witnessed notable improvements since 2016 egypt s inflation has declined from the double digit peaks during 2016 to the single digit levels as of june 2019 which has supported local consumers and allowed the central bank to cut interest rates egypt s tourism industry has also recovered considerably as around 9 million tourists visited egypt last year notably egypt has successfully completed a three year imf program during which the economy improved in many aspects the economy has seen notable improvements including an improvement in the ca deficit reduction in inflation increase in foreign exchange reserves and the increased stability of the country s currency following its flotation in 2016 economic growth is beginning to approach the 7 levels previously seen in 2006 2007 which was driven by the reforms implemented before the gfc the strong performance of banking stocks in egypt will serve as a catalyst for the favorable performance of egypt s stock market which trades at 9 7x pe at the moment egypt s current interest rate environment coupled with the improved macroeconomic prospects bodes well for banks in the region which have superior long term growth prospects this is not to mention that egypt has a large unbanked population and that incomes are poised to rise in the coming decades as egypt eventually advances to become a top 10 20 economy in the coming decades pwc even projected it would be the 7th largest economy by 2030 while commercial international bank egypt otcqx cibey is a suitable option for investors to gain direct exposure to banks in egypt the global x msci egypt etf egpt also provides investors with exposure to banks in egypt the etf s price is currently approaching a fresh three year low despite the plethora of macroeconomic improvements that have occurred in egypt since 2016 banking stocks will be one of several areas that will drive the performance of this etf interest rates have declined the benchmark interest rate in egypt is notably higher than that of many other frontier and emerging markets i e sri lanka and vietnam which allows banks in egypt to enjoy favorable nims the current interest rate environment in egypt is still very attractive even following the numerous rate cuts that occurred during the months when inflation reached the single digit levels the reduction in the cost of capital will support businesses in egypt which is especially supportive of commercial international bank egypt as it mainly provides loans to institutional clients growth opportunity one key factor to note is that the market capitalization of some of the largest banks in egypt is smaller compared to that of other more emerging market banks for example the market capitalization of commercial international bank egypt is only 7 4 billion while other leading banks in emerging markets such as thailand and malaysia have a much larger market capitalization moreover egypt s economic growth has also outpaced all of the countries below in recent years and it has a much

services as their incomes rise and to also begin to use increasingly complex banking products as well according to the world bank only around 32 8 of people in egypt have a bank account which is on par with the mena average but well below the averages seen in other regions such as latin america europe and central asia egypt s banking sector has witnessed robust growth during the past two years which has been driven by the market reforms and the turnaround in tourism growth loans grew by 14 2 and 13 6 during fy17 18 and fy18 19 respectively deposits grew by 17 3 and 12 3 during fy17 18 and

areas such as tourism and telecommunications grew by 17 20 this year which presents an opportunity for banks that loan to these corporations banks are well positioned to benefit from the broad based economic turnaround in the country with the tourism and telecommunications industries spearheading this growth banks can also expect to enjoy lower npl ratios in subsequent years as egypt s macroeconomic state improves egypt s npl ratio reached 4 2 as of june 2019 which is much lower than the double digit levels seen between 2009 and 2011 commercial international bank egypt overview

direct coverage ratio the bank only witnessed a 20 basis point decline in its nim despite interest rates in the country dropping substantially during 2019 one interesting factor to note is that cibey s stock price fared well during egypt s previous economic downturn banking and healthcare have been two of the most defensive areas for investment in egypt given that 1 egyptian consumers have been increasingly spending money on private healthcare as incomes rise and 2 banks have been able to benefit from the higher interest rate environment banks are currently in a sweet spot at the moment given that the stronger economy has supported the reduction in npls and also because interest rates are still high based on regional standards despite the recent rate cuts experienced during 2019

the assessment will take into account the adverse impact of the baht appreciating to between bt29 bt31 to the dollar the private sector is concerned about the baht appreciatimg to bt29 in the beginning of this year he said we previously expected that the baht would not appreciate further because it could erode our competitiveness and cause us to loose export markets to our competitors he said the baht has been the strongest currency in asia and it ranks fourth among the strongest global currencies he said over the past two years of the strengthening baht thai exporters have lost about 17 per cent of total export value he said some businesses have suffered losses from the unfavourable exchange rate and many struggle to make profits he said adding that manufacturers could not increase production because of drop in orders according to visit the government recently set up a committee to look into the issue of the baht s appreciation however they could not implement any effective measures as power was in the hands of the central bank he complained the bank of thailand bot however said earlier that the baht had moved beyond the bt30 level during the new year holidays because of the thin market and it retreated when the market returned to normal on january 2 exporters will meet with central bank governor veerathai santipraphob on friday january 10 to discus about the issue of the baht s appreciation he said the private sector would like the baht to stay around bt31 to the dollar or stay close to the value of competitors currencies he said we re concerned very much that the baht may appreciate further and surpass the bt29 level that would severely hurt thai exports and the country s competitiveness meanwhile siam commercial bank s economic intelligence centre eic forecast that the baht would appreciate to 29 5 30 5 by the end of this year the eic believed that there were many factors behind the baht s appreciation this year however the pace of strengthening may not be as fast as last year s said the eic the baht averaged 31 05 per dollar last year or up 4 1 per cent from 2018 the baht s nominal effective exchange rate was 123 2 last year or up 6 6 per cent from 2018 the research centre expected thailand to continue to have a high current account surplus this year about 6 per cent of gdp compared with 6 3 per cent of gdp last year factors driving the current account surplus include flat exports and imports expansion of tourism and weak investment combined with high international reserves the baht has been a regional safe haven currency and demand is high among investors the impact of the us china trade deal would lead to funds inflows into emerging markets including thailand the dollar is expected to weaken during the global recovery then it would indirectly boost the baht value relatively however the weakness of the dollar is not much as the us federal reserve would keep its policy rate unchanged this year while the european central bank and the bank of japan are expected to further ease their monetary policies leading to a relatively weaker euro and yen the bot has limited tools to deal with the baht appreciation because it cannot cut the policy rate any further as it is already at a historic low at 1 25 per cent moreover the bot could not intervene much in the exchange rate market because it fears that the united states may accuse thailand of being a currency manipulator the chinese yuan is on a rising trend after the us and china reached an agreement on the first trade deal this will pull the thai baht up too said the eic however there are factors that could limit the pace of the baht s strengthening thai corporates are likely to invest more abroad due to slower economic growth in the country thai investors are also encouraged to invest more in foreign financial assets as risk of the global economy reduces it may cause gold prices to reduce or not increase much this year which will lessen pressure on the baht compared with last year when gold price rose high thai investors sold gold for profit and exchanged for the baht the eic said the conclusion is that the baht is strengthening and would continue the trend this year but the pace of the appreciation may be smaller than last year s the eic added

gdp fall smooth as waterfall why is the govt of a once fairly well run state going the way of reckless latin america the people have handed the present government the power to rule them unless they change their minds it is difficult to see a change in governance expect a crisis and economic decline every few years shutterstock ashok v desai the graph is smooth like a waterfall in the quarters beginning with april 2018 the year on year growth in gross domestic product at constant prices has been 8 1 8 0 7 0 6 6 5 8 5 0 and 4 5 per cent the central statistics office has not released details of gdp composition but in the april september half year gdp growth fell from 7 3 per cent in 2018 to 4 6 per cent in 2019 manufacturing which in the previous half year had grown by 9 4 per cent shrank this year by 0 2 per cent growth of construction fell from 9 1 to 4 6 per cent agricultural growth declined from 5 to 2 1 per cent the only sector that boomed was no prize for guessing government whose growth rose from 8 1 to 10 1 per cent the government dismissed the governor of the reserve bank of india and sent its obedient servant from delhi to mumbai to take his place the new governor transferred a good deal of rbi s capital funds carefully accumulated over decades to finance the central government this is old news but the figures underlying it are shocking in the budget it presented in february the government had planned to borrow rs 4 48 trillion during the year ending next march by september it had borrowed rs 4 78 trillion rs 300 billion more than it had planned to borrow in the year it sold rs 612 billion of its loans to the national small savings fund and as if that was not enough it raided small savings and took away another half a trillion that was what it did till september we can only wait and see what further havoc it would wreak in the current half year advertisement why is the government so desperate why has it destroyed the independence of the central bank why is the government of a once fairly well run state following in the footsteps of reckless latin american governments argentina is the country of gold in name living with a few hundred per cent a year of inflation and without any gold or foreign exchange reserves is normal for argentina and other latin american states india is one of the world s largest hoarder and importer of gold does india want to move from drinking chai to dancing cha cha cha why should it not it has only to look at its own history to see why from 1947 till 1991 it had at least one balance of payments crisis every decade everyone clapped if the government brought down inflation below 8 per cent finance ministers believed that profligacy was patriotic and spent without caring a hoot about the economy finally the humiliation of running abroad repeatedly with a begging bowl made p v narasimha rao change the government s ways but that is all history today with foreign exchange reserves touching 450 billion who cares the finance minister is playing her maiden innings does she understand the importance of macroeconomic policy let us dance duffmuttu and let the treasury take care of itself though taking care of the economy is not its priority a man peeps through the gates of a closed shalimar paints factory in howrah telegraph file picture but some economists just cannot help worrying about the economy arvind subramanian and josh felman have collected reams of statistics and investigated what led to india s great slowdown as they show industrial growth in india has been modest for years but in the last year output index of consumer goods industries hardly grew whilst investment index fell direct tax collections show no growth this financial year non oil exports are stagnant whilst imports have fallen growth of power generation is close to zero the lowest in three decades the world s fastest growing economy has suddenly given up on growth the government has drastically reduced corporate tax and the rbi has cut its interest rate but the economy has refused to perk up subralman trace back its travails to the global financial crisis of 2008 to save the indian economy from the global slowdown the government spent madly on infrastructure mainly power projects state governments buy votes with electric power they give it to their voters free or below cost so the private companies that were foolish enough to invest went bankrupt that led to the twin balance sheet problem the insolvency of companies that had borrowed to invest in infrastructure loaded up banks balance sheets with bad debts which we prefer to call non productive assets export growth too sputtered the government ran deficits many new lenders came up and their loans started a home building boom by 2017 the housing boom too sputtered there were no buyers for flats builders went bankrupt and so did the lenders whom we prefer to call non bank finance companies the balance sheets of builders and their lenders got loaded with bad debts the twin balance sheet problem turned into a quadruple balance sheet problem how to sort out this mess subralman opt for five rs first recognition raghuram rajan had organized an asset quality review to establish the real quality of bank loans which were good bad and doubtful and what could be recovered from no good loans there should be another aqr covering banks as well as nbfcs second resolution urjit patel and viral acharya had spelt out the resolution procedure in february 2018 detail was added to it in june 2019 subralman essentially argue for a law that would strengthen creditors hands and limit the courts and tribunals power to hold up and delay resolution they also propose two specialized resolution drivers bad banks which would take over banks bad loans to power and real estate sectors respectively and accelerate resolution next regulation subralman want greater powers for the rbi it should strengthen its prompt corrective action framework and extend its supervision to nbfcs fourth the government must give its banks more capital on the condition that they recognize npas correctly and clean up their balance sheets fifth reform the government should sell stakes in its banks to the private sector and let it run them if it cannot it should at least transfer its investments in banks to a holding corporation with an independent management there is also a comprehensive programme to improve figures a fiscal commission to look at the budget an aqr to be done by raghuram rajan and a statistical commission to be chaired by abhijit banerjee then there is agriculture replace fertilizer and power subsidies with direct transfers create a single market for agricultural products have a stable policy on agricultural exports and imports as well as on livestock incentivize water conservation and give permission to genetically modified crops subralman are so concerned about economic policy even though they get nothing material out of india no power no function no profit because there is so much to be done and the case for doing it is so strong but it is difficult to see a government that abolished the planning commission and dismissed first class economists understanding the need for good policy the people have handed the present government the power to rule them unless they change their minds it is difficult to see a change in governance expect a crisis and economic decline every few years but whatever his idea of governance the prime minister certainly makes a spectacular show of it read also economy here comes the storm
the energy sector posted a gain during the final quarter of 2019 in q4 energy commodities rebounded by 3 38 in 2019 the sector was 15 11 higher than at the end of 2018 wti and brent crude oil posted significant gains on the year but the prices had declined to low levels at the end of 2018 oil product prices followed with gasoline and heating oil moving higher during q4 and for the year in the natural gas market the memories of the move to the highest price since 2014 in mid november when nearby futures rose to 4 929 per mmbtu have faded into the marketâ s rear view mirror in early august natural gas fell to a low at 2 029 per mmbtu which turned out to be a bottom for the energy commodity the price of nearby natural gas futures rallied and moved over the technical resistance level at 2 53 per mmbtu in september before failing at over the 2 70 level the pre winter rally was brief with the nearby futures contract rising to a high at 2 905 but selling took the price below the 2 20 level in december the energy sector of the commodities market will reflect the economic and geopolitical landscapes as we move into 2020 the middle east which is home to more than half the worldâ s oil reserves remains the most turbulent region on earth at the same time venezuela is a political and economic mess which means the nation with the leading petroleum reserves in the world is not likely to see oil output increase any time soon when it comes to china the â phase oneâ trade deal with the us in december could add to demand in 2020 opec cut production at its december meeting which helped stabilized the price of crude oil the us is the worldâ s leading producer of crude oil with a daily output climbing to a new record at 12 9 million barrels according to the energy information administration during q4 energy commodities power the world bullish and bearish factors on the economic and political landscapes were pulling the price of petroleum in opposite directions throughout most of 2019 nearby nymex crude oil futures experienced a spike to the upside in q3 after an attack on saudi production on september 14 however the price came back down by the end of the year as saudi output returned to normal levels two weeks after the attack the price remained below the high that followed the attack for the rest of 2019 natural gas was weak as the price action moving into the winter months reflected a much higher level than last year during the final quarter meanwhile the price of ethanol posted a significant loss in q4 but was still higher in 2019 compared to the end of the previous year on the second day of 2020 us airstrikes killed the highest profile iranian military commander the leader of the iranian revolutionary guard general soleimani appears to be responsible for the siege on the us embassy in baghdad in late december the quick response raised the political temperature in the region to a boiling point crude oil rallied to new highs on tuesday evening in the us in the aftermath of the death of the iranian general it followed through on the upside on friday january 3 crude oil review crude oil traded within the 2019 range in q4 as the price traded from a low at 50 99 to a high at 62 34 on the nearby nymex futures contract in q4 the nearby futures rose by 12 93 in 2019 the price of wti crude oil was 34 46 higher than at the end of 2018 the nearby futures contract settled at 61 06 per barrel on december 31 nymex wti crude traded in a range from 45 52 to 66 60 in 2019 we have seen lots of price action in the crude oil market since october 2018 source cqg the weekly chart illustrates the fall in q4 2018 and price recovery in q1 and q2 2019 but the price ran out of upside steam in late april and declined the september 14 attack that knocked out 50 of saudi petroleum production which amounts to 6 of world supplies sent the price to the high of the quarter at 63 38 on september 16 however no retaliation or further event caused the price of oil to move back to just under 51 during the first week of october the price of oil rallied steadily throughout the final quarter of 2019 the us is the leading producer of crude oil in the world as output reached a record high at 12 9 million barrels per day during q4 at the december opec meeting the cartel increased its production cut from 1 2 to 1 7 million barrels per day for the first half of 2020 the saudis added another 400 000 barrels per day for good measure bringing the effective reduction to 2 1 million barrels per day the move by opec stabilized the oil market the production cut together with a â phase oneâ deal on trade between the us and china lifted the nearby nymex futures contract to the 60 per barrel level in december in a sign that us production has become more efficient the rig count according to baker hughes fell over the past three months and stood at 670 as of january 3 2020 43 lower than at the end of q3 meanwhile even though the rig count fell production continued to rise to a new record high in the us fewer regulations under the trump administration and a more favorable corporate tax policy improved the economics for u s producers and the american oil industry has become a significant exporter of crude oil in the future the u s is now the worldâ s swing producer of the energy commodity when the price declines shale output will decline and the u s can import cheaper oil from abroad however when the price rises american shale production will flow and the u s will compete with other world producers to supply the energy commodity around the globe and even to the chinese now that there has been progress and a de escalation of the trade war the issues facing the middle east remained a substantial concern in q4 and reached a new peak in early 2020 which could impact global supplies of the energy commodity this year however the us achieved its goal of energy independence because of technology and a friendlier regulatory environment with the 2020 election on the horizon climate change is likely to be a significant topic of discussion in q4 many of the candidates from the other side of the political aisle have rolled out platforms for the environment at the end of q3 in september one of the leading candidates elizabeth warren said she would ban fracking on day one of her administration the election will likely serve as an energy referendum for the us as the democrats are likely to adopt parts of the progressive agenda including the â green new deal â trade issues between the u s and china de escalated at the end of q4 at the start of august the us slapped new tariffs on china and the chinese retaliated the fears of a worldwide recession as a result of economic weakness in china and contagion around the world sent the price of oil to the lows of the quarter at 50 52 per barrel during the week of august 5 however some optimism returned to the market in september and the attack was another example of the political risk in the worldâ s most turbulent region in december the â phase oneâ trade deal that followed the opec production cuts lifted the price of nymex crude oil over the 60 per barrel level iran continues to be a clear and present danger in the middle east the strait of hormuz is likely to remain a hub of international concern over the coming weeks and months any increase in hostile actions in the middle east that impact production refining or logistical routes like the strait of hormuz could cause availability problems around the world as the strait is now a focal point we have witnessed a military buildup in the area which raises the political temperature in the region saudi arabia depends on the us for military support in the region given its ongoing battles with iran however they have also been maintaining close ties with russian president putin the position of saudi arabia and their relationships with the us russia and their neighbors in the middle east creates a complex puzzle that could impact the price of oil in the months ahead the three dominant oil producers in the world are the saudis russians and the united states it is in the best interest of all three nations for the oil price to remain at a level that is high enough to allow oil and profits but low enough to keep inflationary pressures in check the past year and three months were a highly volatile period in the crude oil market the energy commodity took the elevator to the downside in q4 and the stairs higher in q1 in q2 it rallied until late april when selling once again hit the market in q3 the price spike on september 16 gave way to selling that took the price back below 51 per barrel in q4 oil rebounded on the back of a deeper opec production cut and a de escalation in the trade war trade and iran have been the most significant factors for the oil market over the past three months in 2020 the future of us energy policy could take the center of the stage and cause price variance in the energy commodity in q4 brent futures lagged wti as it posted an 11 38 gain in 2019 the price of brent crude oil was 22 66 higher than at the end of 2018 nearby brent futures closed on december 31 at 65 99 per barrel as the february contract rolled to march on the final day of the year brent traded in a range from 53 47 to 75 59 in 2019 after the september 14 attack the price of nearby brent futures moved to a high at 71 per barrel but did not return to the level in q4 brent s premium to wti decreased to 5 26 per barrel basis the nearby march contracts down 0 11 per barrel in q4 the brent premium traded to the highest level since march 2015 at 11 59 per barrel in may in q4 the range in the spread was from 4 65 to 7 15 per barrel and it closed the quarter closer to the low the expansion of the us pipeline system has weighed on the spread and the calm in the middle east over the past three months also contributed to the decline in brentâ s premium over wti crude oil nymex crude oil moved 12 93 higher over the past three months and the xle only posted a marginal gain in the final quarter the etf closed at 59 20 on the final day of trading in q3 was at the 60 04 level on december 31 an increase of 0 84 or 1 42 over the period the xle lagged the price action in both the crude oil and stock markets in q4 the potential for a shift in us energy policy starting in 2021 could be weighing on the prices of oil related shares bullish and bearish factors will continue to pull the price of crude oil in opposite directions in 2020 as the situation between iran the saudis and the us is not going away any time soon the middle east and even venezuela are extreme hotspots in the world and trade between the progress on trade between the us and china will determine the health of the global economy the â phase oneâ deal at the end of q4 was a positive sign for the crude oil market i believe that any price spikes in 2020 are likely to come on the upside because of the tension around the strait of hormuz and increased military presence in the region iran remains a clear and present danger in the part of the world that is home to over half the worldâ s oil reserves as we were reminded on january 2 oil products review oil products often reflect periods of seasonal demand but they also are a piece of a complex puzzle when it comes to the price direction of crude oil which is the critical input when it comes to the refining process rbob gasoline tends to rally in the spring and summer and heating oil or distillates tend to do best during late fall and winter although they exhibit less seasonality than the gasoline futures market both gasoline and heating oil futures rose in q4 meanwhile the products diverged slightly from their seasonal patterns as gasoline rose more on a percentage basis than heating oil futures refining margins on both moved lower as the products underperformed the price action in the crude oil futures market in q4 gasoline moved 7 92 higher and was 29 83 higher in 2019 compared to the closing price at the end of 2018 source cqg as the weekly chart highlights gasoline traded in a range of 1 3230 per gallon to 2 1559 on the active month contract on the nymex in 2019 the price pattern on the weekly chart since early 2016 had been positive as gasoline has made higher lows and higher highs however seven consecutive weeks of losses ended that bullish price trend in q4 2018 in q1 eight straight weeks of gains sent the price back to the highest level since last october the price of gasoline futures moved steadily lower with crude oil after hitting a high during the week of april 22 the fuel traded in a range since late september nearby futures closed on december 31 at 1 69050 per gallon wholesale gasoline spiked higher with crude oil on september 16 to 1 7785 but the price settled into a trading range over the rest of the year in q4 the heating oil futures rose by 6 62 and were 20 45 higher in 2019 heating oil futures are a proxy for diesel and jet fuel as the oil products are all distillates and have similar characteristics heating oil futures have some seasonal features but less than gasoline as jet diesel and other distillates are year round fuels source cqg the weekly heating oil chart shows a constructive and bullish trend since early 2016 the price carnage in the crude oil market took the price to a low at 1 6424 per gallon in late december 2018 on the continuous contract before recovering with the price of oil nearby heating oil futures closed on the final trading day of q4 at 2 02280 per gallon wholesale heating oil traded in a range from 1 6215 to 2 1377 per gallon in 2019 oil products rose with the price of oil in q4 and both moved higher in 2019 gasoline outperformed heating oil in the year that ended on december 31 crack spreads review the price action in crack or refining spreads shows that gasoline and distillate fuel processing margins moved lower during the final quarter of 2019 in q4 the offseason for gasoline demand the gasoline crack fell by 14 30 but was still 7 63 higher compared to the price at the end of 2018 source cqg as the weekly chart shows the nearby nymex gasoline processing spread exploded higher in q1 as the market looked forward to the season of peak demand in q2 the gasoline crack spread retained most of its gains but the seasonal pull caused the spread to move into winter mode as the end of summer approached the nearby gasoline crack spread closed q4 at 10 01 per barrel on december 31 the gasoline crack spread was higher at the end of q4 in 2019 compared to q4 2018 when it closed at 9 30 per barrel in q4 the heating oil crack fell 6 60 source cqg the weekly pictorial of the heating oil refining spread illustrates that it closed q4 at 23 90 per barrel the heating oil crack spread had been under pressure since 2013 but the price action in 2016 and 2017 broke the pattern of lower highs the processing spread between crude oil and distillates made a higher high in mid november 2018 at 32 53 per barrel before turning lower at 23 90 at the end of 2019 the refining spread was lower than it was last year at the time as it closed q4 2018 at 25 09 per barrel natural gas review in q4 despite the start of the winter season natural gas futures posted a loss of 6 05 and was 25 54 lower in 2019 natural gas was a wild ride in q4 2018 as the price traded to a high at 4 929 per mmbtu in mid november and then fell like a stone reaching a low at 2 543 per mmbtu in mid february 2019 natural gas rallied at the beginning of the peak season of demand late last year on the lowest level of inventories in years but the price came back down to earth in december and during the first three months of 2019 during the third quarter the selling continued taking the price to a low at 2 029 per mmbtu in august in q4 high levels of inventories stifled any chance of a peak demand season rally source cqg as the weekly chart shows the highs in natural gas came in mid november when a combination of short covering and cold weather took the price to a lower high at 4 929 per mmbtu record production caused some market participants to short the commodity but low stocks and an increase in demand for power generation and growing shipments of lng supported the demand side of the fundamental equation for the natural gas market additionally a pairs trade of long crude oil and short natural gas at the beginning of october as sanctions on iran and record output of natural gas caused some traders and hedge funds to buy oil and sell gas on spread the trade wound up being one of the most painful spreads of 2018 as longs scrambled to sell oil and shorts chased natural gas higher in q4 resulting in significant losses on both sides of the pairs trade however warmer forecasts brought the price back below the 3 level by the end of 2018 the selling continued throughout 2019 natural gas picked up a head of steam on the downside as the price fell below technical resistance levels at just above the 2 50 per mmbtu level the price found a bottom at 2 029 per mmbtu during the week of august 5 in q4 higher inventories than in 2018 weighed on the price of the energy commodity pushing it to a low at 2 138 per mmbtu after the start of the 2019 2020 withdrawal season in 2019 nearby natural gas futures closed q4 at 2 1890 per mmbtu technical support is at the recent low at 2 029 level resistance is at the 2 905 and 3 level as we head into 2020 a bearish island gap formation from early november from 2 738 to 2 753 stands as the first target on the upside in the natural gas futures market the price range in natural gas has been from lows of 1 02 to highs of 15 65 per mmbtu since 1990 a twelve year price at below 4 00 became a bargain for a time in late 2018 natural gas will move into the first quarter of the new decade with a threat to challenge the march 2016 low at 1 611 per mmbtu the price action at the start of the peak winter season for demand was decidedly bearish politics rather than inventories and the weather could be the most significant factor when it comes to the path of least resistance for the price of natural gas in 2020 ethanol in q4 ethanol corrected as the price fell by 12 53 ethanol futures moved 8 78 higher in 2019 a significant issue to keep in mind when it comes to ethanol is the political push for a â green new dealâ by democrats in congress and the candidates for president rising support from a move away from fossil fuels and hydrocarbons could boost the demand and price of ethanol and other alternative energy products as we witnessed in the second quarter of 2019 the 2020 election could inject lots of volatility into the ethanol market as well as all in energy commodities the bottom line on energy after falling from the high in mid september to a low at 50 99 in early october the price of crude oil made higher lows and higher highs the opec production cut and â phase oneâ trade deal pushed the price back above the 60 per barrel on nearby nymex futures in december brent marginally underperformed wti as the pipeline system in the us expanded and allowed for increased exports as we head into 2020 iran and trade will continue to provide direction for the crude oil market a weaker us dollar and lower us interest rates are not bearish for the price of crude oil increased tension after the us airstrike on january 2 has the potential to cause a significant move in the crude oil market in q1 when it comes to natural gas the price goes into 2020 after a significant disappointment at the start of the 2019 2020 withdrawal season it looks like natural gas could head for prices below the 2 level over the coming months the price of coal tends to be a seasonal commodity that follows the price of other energy products source barchart as the chart of the price of january coal futures for delivery in rotterdam the netherlands shows closed q3 at 63 45 per ton and moved lower to 53 00 at the end of q4 a decline of 16 5 in q4 on the january contract the price of rotterdam coal futures underperformed both crude oil and natural gas in q4 as coal has become a four letter word for environmentalists in the energy sector the vanguard energy index fund etf shares nysearca vde correlates with the price of crude oil but it has lagged the energy commodity source barchart during q4 it underperformed the energy commodity as it appreciated by 4 45 compared to a rise in the price of nymex crude oil futures of 12 93 vde holds shares in many of the leading energy commodities in the world including source yahoo finance the vde moved from 78 02 at the end of q3 to 81 49 at the end of q4 keep those

opinions of monday 6 january 2020 columnist bright simons the bank of ghana bog on november 29th 2019 released a document justifying the need for the introduction of higher value denomination currency hvd notes the question of whether hvd notes are warranted at any point in time is not a merely conceptual one it is in fact a highly empirical enquiry to be approached from a careful analysis of considerable amounts of data about the proportional use of different notes and the differential costs of security and distribution one cannot have random opinions about such a subject and expect to be taken seriously i don t have any data on the contemporary usage patterns of the different ghana cedi ghs notes in circulation or about the costs of printing different notes like most ghanaians therefore i did not have too much difficulty delegating all thinking about the issue to the fine technocrats at the central bank until now a bunch of controversies arising from the refusal of major supermarkets and even banks to accept the new notes because they lack the means to validate their authenticity compelled me to finally take a look at the bog s explanatory documents today after all item authentication has been a decade and half interest of mine having now read the bog document and subsequent bog press releases on the subject i am suddenly completely unsure of my earlier faith in the central bank to do all our thinking for us in this matter i will simply lay out the worrying things i found and let readers of this blog judge for themselves the most problematic element of the bog s analysis is the central reason it offers for introducing the hvd notes in the very first paragraph of the original q a formatted release it states as follows high levels of inflation and currency depreciation in the past have eroded some of the gains from redenomination the deadweight burden reflected in high transaction cost has re emerged in this one statement is contained all the alarm bells about the depth of technical preparation that should have gone into this exercise except in cases of hyperinflation and hyper depreciation requiring a new currency series high value denomination notes are almost never justified by the need to counter or offset routine inflationary pressures over time for example when the 100 was first introduced in the us in 1869 and reintroduced as a federal reserve note in 1914 it was for a time the highest in circulation in due course larger denominations surfaced mostly as a result of wartime and other contingent exigencies by 1946 a firm decision to stop the issuing of hvd notes had been taken and by 1969 all currencies higher than 100 were being removed from active circulation to reduce the costs of fighting counterfeiting and money laundering today the 100 bill is worth only 4 if measured against its original value as a result of cumulative inflation it remains the highest denomination in circulation purely in keeping with contemporary policy an alternative policy of trying to preserve the face value of the 100 note at the time of the 1969 currency reforms would have required an introduction of 1000 and 2000 bills in the united states something that cannot be countenanced in today s anti terror and anti narcotics climate it is easier to understand the argument when one recalls that in a floating exchange regime currencies can rise and fall over time is the logic here then that should the ghana cedi strengthen against the usd consistently over time that would dictate the retirement of the largest of the hvd notes things are even starker in a managed exchange rate regime consider this fact by the time of the 1984 budget the official cedi usd exchange rate was 35 cedis to the dollar governor j s addo lowered the value to 38 5 cedis to 1 dollar in a conclusive reversal of the last peg from 1978 of 2 75 cedis to the dollar then in effect yet ahead of the latest round of managed devaluations in 1982 the highest note the 50 cedi note had been removed from circulation or demonetised ostensibly as an anti corruption measure echoing an earlier currency confiscation in 1979 when in 1984 the hvd notes of 50 100 and 200 cedis were introduced or in the case of 50 cedi note reintroduced with no serious explanation as to why fears of corruption were no longer an issue the effective worth of the highest value note was officially 5 by the time of the 1985 budget it was 3 7 more interestingly the parallel unofficial in actual fact market rate was about 156 cedi usd suggesting hence that the 50 cedi note that just 10 years earlier had been nominally worth 50 was now worth just 32 us cents 0 32 whilst the highest circulating note was worth just 1 28 in short the history of face value preservation tactics and politics in ghana betrays a ridiculous mixture of arbitrariness and confusion trying to bulwark the face value of ghana s benighted national currency notes against depreciation and inflation trends is clearly to court absurdity and also distrust in view of this messy track record at any rate the historical record clearly shows that ghana s highest value notes have for the most part generally exchanged for low dollar amounts in the 1985 to 1990 period the 500 cedi note moved from 5 5 to 1 5 peak to trough in the 1990 to 2000 period the 10000 and 20000 notes emerged as the highest value notes yet at their strongest they were about 1 4 and 2 7 respectively the dramatic change of affairs represented by the introduction of the 50 ghana cedi note in july 2007 with its debut value of 54 marking the high point of ghanaian currency face value politics in 30 years was a break with the past precisely because it also marked the start of a new series effectively a new currency such an exceptional development cannot set a precedent for the routine preservation of the currency s purchasing strength at some arbitrary usd rate by printing larger and larger notes to approximate the continuous appreciation of the highest notes nominal value s by the time of the introduction of the 100 and 200 ghana cedi notes in late 2019 the value of the 50 ghana cedi note in usd terms was about 9 in comparison with other hvd notes in ghana s history adjusting for both us and local inflation this amount as has already been shown above was big enough the largest nigerian naira note is exchanged today for 2 75 the largest kenyan shilling note is exchanged for 9 91 the largest south african rand note is exchanged for 13 8 by the time the government of india removed hvd notes out of circulation due to purported fears about money laundering and crime the highest rupee note was exchanging for 14 simply put economies comparable to ghana s in various characteristics have hvd notes well within the value range of ghana s last version the ghs50 note 2 the bog makes plausibly persuasive points about an expansion of incomes leading to an increase in preference for the then highest value notes the ghs20 and the ghs50 in the european common market for instance it is the 50 euro note not the higher value 100 and 200 euro notes or the 500 euro notes that are being demonetised over the usual concerns that are in widest circulation in the us the highest circulation bill is the 20 whilst the highest value 100 bill is mostly preferred outside the us thus the preference for higher value notes in ghana is a significant point however the point in the way it was put in the bog release that ghc50 and ghc20 account for about 70 of the total demand is completely vague is this demand being expressed in monetary value or quantity terms if in value terms then it is completely unremarkable since the face value being several multiples of the face value of the lower denomination notes their quantity could well be tiny and still constitute 70 of usage in such a scenario the need to print larger quantities would be far from clear and user preference may well tilt to a medium portion of the value spectrum as is the case in many other countries 3 it is important in connection with the above point to note that convenience is affected by both the concern about carrying large sums of low value notes and the almost converse concern about finding change when counterparties pay for goods and services with large notes thus preference is an entirely empirical matter and rather technically complex to compute if the bog wished to educate the public in this matter by releasing that statement it ought to have been clearer 4 most strangely the bog chose to provide none of the critical information that would have best assisted curious persons in evaluating the propriety of its decision to introduce high value denominations against the global trend of demonetizing high value notes at the heart of any sound analysis would be a trade off between printing less money and the concomitant result of users carrying less money and creating highly tempting targets for crime the cost of printing higher quantities of money in the face of a rising average size of transactions in the economy reduces the seigniorage revenue of the central bank thus if the average size of transactions moves upward it makes sense to introduce more hvd notes at the same time such notes are more expensive than lower value notes because they require more security features to prevent counterfeiting and more policing to suppress money laundering for example in the us the most expensive notes such as the 50 bill can be as much as four times 4x costlier to print than the cheapest ones such as the 1 bill the right balance between transactional convenience and policing cost is as always entirely empirical by refusing to provide a breakdown of the costs of printing the different bills and the quantities in circulation as well as the average velocity per class and other critical monetary parameters the bog shows a complete disinterest in helping analysts come to any sensible conclusions about the need for these new hvd notes 5 the weirdest of all the claims in the bog document is the assertion that somehow printing high value notes will reduce the deadweight burden associated with current transaction costs this claim is manifestly erroneous there is no welfare loss context here to even warrant use of the deadweight burden term 6 lastly we live in a time of great cynicism about the procurement practices of governments the introduction of a new class of currency notes represents a potentially major procurement opportunity for agents and representatives of the mints and printing presses in europe and america with whom the republic of ghana deals on these matters where the new bills are significantly more expensive than older bills commissions may be in order opening the door to unpleasant allegations about the real motives impelling the procurement action it would have been reassuring had the bog provided information about the procurement terms of this new production whether by de la rue the loss making financially struggling security printing firm or crane currency the controversy plagued contractor now embroiled in corruption allegations in liberia the decision to shroud all these important matters in silence including even the name of the printer mint is doing very little to dispel lingering doubts and confusion about this whole hvd

this article is part of a joint investigative project by eye on ohio and the energy news network read the previous installment how affiliate arrangements subsidies and riders led to higher electric bills in ohio even as power prices declined with different utilities serving specific parts of the state ohioans electric bills and the tariffs that govern them vary but they all have one thing in common they re hard for many people to understand and the bills don t clearly detail all charges to consumers here s a guide to what all the small print says and what it doesn t say on a sample bill for a residential customer of firstenergy s illuminating company bills from other utilities will vary however many of the concepts will be similar bills will also jump by a few dollars each month after utilities implement a new law house bill 6 meant to bail out two of firstenergy s nuclear plants and two 1950s era coal plants it will also scale back the state s energy efficiency and renewable energy standards deciphering an electric bill rider alphabet soup based on a sample 2019 bill from firstenergy s illuminating company code rider name what it s for ami advanced metering infrastructure for smart grid metering effective july 1 2019 dcr delivery capital recovery rider recovers costs for investments in the distribution system dmr distribution modernization rider the ohio supreme court held this rider was unlawful in june 2019 so an august 2019 order required firstenergy utilities to refund the unlawful no strings attached credit support rider for the month of july however earlier charges for the rider aren t refundable dse demand side management and energy efficiency rider utility costs for energy efficiency and peak demand reduction programs the charge does not reflect savings from those programs the average has been about 5 61 per month including about 2 monthly savings even if customers don t take part in those programs going forward hb 6 will cut these charges but guts the energy efficiency and renewable energy standards dun distribution uncollectible rider shifts costs for uncollectible charges so paying customers are effectively paying for others who don t pay their bills pur pipp uncollectible rider shifts costs of low income customers who can only afford to pay a set percentage of their income skt state kwh tax rider customers using 2 000 kwh or less per month pay about half a cent per kwh rates fall for entities using more electricity usf universal service fund rider administrative costs for low income programs and consumer education programs edr economic development rider economic incentives from the utility shift costs to other customers including various industrial and commercial users nmb non market based services rider generally covers costs from grid operator pjm for using the bulk transmission system and related services pir phase in recovery rider debt service for refinancing costs for fuel and purchased power much of which was initially bought at least a decade ago rer residential electric heating recovery rider shifts costs for firstenergy discounts to certain customers who have all electric heating in their homes stay tuned house bill 6 riders still to come are charges to cover subsidies for two firstenergy nuclear plants and for coal plants and to reflect hb 6 s changes to the energy efficiency and clean energy standards sources puco and firstenergy this guide to deciphering bill rider charges would apply to a sample 2019 residential bill for firstenergy s illuminating company the first eight items are included in the bill s distribution related component according to firstenergy spokesperson christopher eck the next four items fall within the cost recovery charges eck said other utilities electric bills may have the same or different riders and may group them under different parts of the bill even where charges have the same names amounts may vary for the sample used for the illuminating company the customer charge was 4 00 but aep ohio customers paid 8 40 some current costs also reach back to earlier generation activities for example firstenergy s rider pir pays debt service on fuel and purchased power that apparently were first acquired more than a decade ago aep ohio s customers also pay a phase in recovery rider for fuel that was consumed but not billed to customers from 2009 to 2011 how cross subsidies affect customer bills ohio s law to deregulate sales of electricity generation passed in 1999 but it took roughly a decade before utilities actually spun off their power plants duke energy sold almost all of its generation assets early on aep firstenergy and dayton power light transferred their utilities former power plants to affiliates by the time that finally happened lawmakers passed senate bill 221 among other things that 2008 law allowed electric security plans with various bill riders that increased opportunities for cross subsidies said energy analyst noah dormady at ohio state university he and his colleagues reported on their analysis of puco price data in the energy journal last year the point for policymakers isn t to jump back to regulating retail electricity dormady and his colleagues wrote rather they suggest the study shows the impact of political and regulatory processes on what ohioans pay for electricity a some cross subsidies shifted industrial costs at the expense of consumers or commercial customers others let utilities eventually funnel funds from regulated utilities to unregulated affiliates b cross subsidies on ohio residential customers bills rose by more than 500 since sb 221 dormady and colleagues found to about 1 88 cents kwh versus 0 31 cents kwh before the law s effective date c some territories were harder hit than others dormady noted for example cross subsidies in aep ohio s territory jumped from 0 15 cents kwh before deregulation to as high as 4 4 cents kwh after for a household using 1 000 kwh per month that would be nearly 45 per month in cross subsidy charges for supposedly arms length generation affiliates dormady said d because duke functionally divested by selling almost all its generation for the cincinnati metro area it didn t have the same need to seek cost recovery to cross subsidize the losses of a legacy coal fleet in an era of low gas price dormady said customers saved money read more calculate your utility bill how deregulation affects ohio electricity charges keeping score as of june 2019 consumers had paid more than 15 billion in utility subsidies since deregulation began according to the office of the ohio consumers counsel early payments reimbursed utility companies for the costs of separating generation from distribution utilities also got payments for stranded assets they might otherwise have had trouble selling duke managed to sell most of its ohio generating plants by 2009 but other utilities or their affiliates continued to own all or part of various power plants later payments were justified as ways to keep prices steady so consumers wouldn t see swings from the market utilities have continued to make those arguments as they sought yet more subsidies for noncompetitive coal and nuclear power plants source office of the ohio consumers counsel 2019 click to enlarge
washington the federal reserve s policy making committee saw much less risk of recession at its meeting last month when it kept interest rates steady after three straight cuts and signaled that it expected to keep low rates unchanged through this year minutes of the december meeting released friday showed that fed officials favored keeping rates in a low range of 1 5 to 1 75 to cushion the u s economy from slow global growth and the trump administration s trade conflicts officials were also concerned that inflation still hadn t reached the fed s target level of 2 still many fed policymakers at the dec 10 11 meeting expressed the view that the risks of a u s china trade war had diminished along with the probability of a disruptive brexit the meeting occurred two days before the trump administration and beijing reached a preliminary trade deal though press reports had already suggested that an initial agreement was near at their meeting last month fed officials noted that the u s economy was showing resilience despite the trade fights and a weak global economy the minutes said a rise in long term rates also suggested that the likelihood of a recession occurring over the medium term had fallen noticeably in recent months since last month s meeting though tensions have escalated in the middle east as the trump administration has confronted iranian backed forces in iraq on friday stocks sank on wall street and oil prices jumped after u s forces in iraq killed a top iranian general yet many analysts say higher oil prices could potentially benefit the u s economy because of the sharp increase in the past decade in u s oil production higher oil prices encourage energy companies to invest in drilling wells which boosts demand for steel pipe and other equipment from u s factories and creates jobs those trends increasingly offset the drag on consumer spending exerted by higher gas prices joe brusuelas chief economist at the tax advisory firm rsm suggested that the risks to the u s economy are for now contained as a result we do not expect any action by the federal reserve brusuelas said there would need to be a much greater disruption to oil supply from the persian gulf to warrant a rate cut by the fed in the near term but should iran respond to the attack and military action escalates the danger to the u s economy could increase economists said the wild card is whether turmoil in the middle east triggers a sustained sell off in equities depressing business and consumer confidence to the point where labor market and inflation concerns become secondary said ian shepherdson chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics though the fed s policymaking committee voted unanimously last month in favor of keeping rates unchanged several members voiced concerns about the long term consequences of very low rates keeping rates ultra low could fuel excessive risk taking on wall street a few participants warned which could lead to dangerous asset bubbles if those bubbles were to burst it could make the next recession more severe than otherwise but a greater number of fed officials felt that the job market could still strengthen and draw more people off the sidelines into jobs without sending inflation up too much that sentiment would favor keeping rates low to further reduce unemployment and stimulate economic growth chairman jerome powell echoed that view in the post meeting news conference signaling that the fed was comfortable with keeping rates low for the foreseeable future we have learned that unemployment can remain at quite low levels for an extended period of time without unwanted upward pressure on inflation powell said at the news conference fed officials also expressed concern that americans expectation for future inflation was too low inflation expectations some argue can become self fulfilling if workers expect low inflation they re less likely to demand higher pay which in turn allows companies to keep a lid on prices low inflation expectations are another reason for the fed to keep rates down in hopes that they will eventually boost inflation in comments since the december meeting fed officials have remained upbeat about the economy s prospects in remarks titled is a recession around the corner thomas barkin president of the federal reserve bank of richmond said he was concerned about the weakness in business investment which he attributed to uncertainty caused by factors ranging from rising middle east tensions to the outcome of trade talks with china but he said there were reasons to be optimistic including the benefits of the fed s three rate cuts last year while there is always the risk of a shock the fed has done a lot to support the economy s continued expansion and to provide buffers against the downside barkin said in comments to a bankers association meeting in baltimore

global employment is nearing a peak and downfall cannot be ruled out a rise in unemployment may not necessarily have an adverse impact on the local currency we examine five countries and their impact on currencies local or foreign wages have become all the rage for central banks and that is a sign that employment has ceased to be a source of concern policymakers are puzzled by the lack of substantial salary growth as job markets are bustling complaints about the quality of jobs such as those in the gig economy have replaced pictures of people queueing up for unemployment benefits as employment is at high levels it is easier to fall than rising from this point a slowdown in global growth in 2019 has not triggered a substantial rise in the number of the jobless but 2020 may see a change how can it affect currencies we start from the straightforward cases and move to the more complicated ones 1 uk pound negative unemployment rate 3 8 as of october 2019 the lowest since the 1970s uncertainty about brexit has already weighed on the british economy growth has significantly slowed down and while investors are encouraged by the conservatives clear victory that provides a clear path to leaving the eu the future relationship with the old continent remains up in the air protracted negotiations after the official exit date on january 31 may cause a downturn that may eventually impact employment worsening economic conditions may bring andrew bailey the new governor of the bank of england to cut interest rates the boe hinted that it is ready to cut interest rates and two members voted for a cut in the past couple of meetings the government is unlikely to step in and help prime minister boris johnson is focused on brexit moreover his government may wish to spend political capital on reforms and boost the economy closer to the elections due only in late 2024 the proximity to the previous vote means that fighting unemployment is unlikely to be a priority all this leads to the straightforward conclusion that a rise in uk unemployment will likely push the pound lower 2 japan yen negative unemployment rate 2 2 as of november 2019 the lowest since the mid 1990s the world s third largest economy may have had a hard time battling low inflation but nobody complains about its rock bottom jobless rate the job to applications ratio stands at 1 57 a healthy rate as well japan is affected by the trade wars either directly from us tariffs or indirectly as collateral damage from the sino american spat if the economic situation deteriorates and unemployment rises the government is likely to step in and help however prime minister shinzo abe already announced a fiscal stimulus plan and the bank of japan is reluctant to cut the interest rates the negative 0 10 rate is hurting bank profits overall rising unemployment in japan may result in a weaker yen and little room for policymakers to turn the ship around easily in this scenario the yen s path is likely to be down 3 germany may eventually turn positive for the euro unemployment rate 3 1 seasonally adjusted as of october 2019 the lowest since the early 1980s the euro zone s largest economy enjoyed several years of falling unemployment as exports to china and more recently upbeat consumption have pushed the economy forward however the locomotive of the euro zone has been suffering a manufacturing slump in 2019 and the country barely escaped a recession the labor market has also shown worrying signs with occasional monthly increases in the number of the unemployed albeit within an upbeat trend if the industrial downturn continues or worsens the jobless rate may lift off from the historic lows while the initial reaction would be a lower euro in expectation for further monetary stimulus the common currency could later rebound how rising unemployment could sharpen the minds of politicians such as chancellor angela merkel s cdu and also her junior coalition partner spd to introduce fiscal stimulus the rising popularity of the green party may trigger investment in environmental technologies germany has been leading the old continent s austerity policy and has been clinging onto its schwarze null minimal fiscal surplus policy if berlin abandons its constitutional debt brake and sets an example for a change at the european level the common currency could rise it would relieve the european central bank from pushing the economy forward on its own overall a rise in german unemployment will likely send the euro lower only to rise later on 4 china fears of a global slowdown may boost safe havens unemployment rate 3 61 as of july 2019 the lowest since at least 2002 the ongoing trade spat between the world s largest economies has hurt china more than the us growth has slowed down to the lowest levels since the early 1990s but the jobless rate remains low the one state party carefully manages its economy and would intervene to mitigate any potential increase in people seeking jobs the regime is afraid of discontent and would also like to continue growing in global influence nevertheless any bounce in unemployment would be an ominous sign for the entire world it would show that the global economy is slowing down and send stocks down the safe haven us dollar and japanese yen would benefit in this case and so would gold 5 us dollar reaction depends on the democratic candidate unemployment rate 3 5 as of november 2019 the lowest since 1969 concerns about the labor market came and went during 2019 but central bankers see the us at full employment after over ten years of growth a slowdown in the economy cannot be ruled out and neither can a recession an increase in unemployment would likely push the federal reserve off the fence and trigger fresh rate cuts while that would weigh on the greenback it may also have the counter effect when the us sneezes the world catches a cold goes the adage investors fearing a global downturn may make their way to the safe haven us dollar and the japanese yen moreover a potential increase in us joblessness in 2020 may also risk president donald trump s reelection chances in that case the reaction of the greenback heavily depends on his democratic rival if a moderate such as joe biden michael bloomberg or pete buttigieg is the nominee markets would likely prefer a change in the white house to ease trade tensions and refrain from significant welfare spending in that scenario the dollar may fall amid a diminishing demand for safe haven assets on the other hand if left leaning elisabeth warren or bernie sanders makes it through markets would prefer trump the fear of a business unfriendly president may trigger flows to the safe haven dollar overall a modest rise in the unemployment rate would be us dollar negative while a substantial increase would put the focus on the democratic candidate whose chances would rise conclusion from rock bottom levels there is a good chance that unemployment will begin rising in 2020 increases in unemployment in the uk and japan will likely be detrimental to their currencies however it could turn into a positive story for germany a rise in chinese joblessness would likely trigger safe haven flows while labor issues in the us are difficult to trade given the presidential elections this article belongs to the 20 trading ideas

by howard schneider and ann saphir san diego reuters an unprecedented combination of low u s unemployment weak inflation and low interest rates has the u s federal reserve grappling with how to fight the next recession as experts debate new approaches to financial regulation as well as a fuller overhaul of fed strategy related stories at a three day conference in san diego on an array of economic topics one stood out the textbook view of central banking where low unemployment produces unwanted inflation that monetary policymakers can counter with interest rate hikes is at least badly hobbled if not fully broken not only are low unemployment and weak inflation co existing but global interest rates are stuck at such low levels and are considered so unlikely to rise that the fed and other central banks may enter the next recession with little room to cut rates before hitting zero and having to decide on other strategies these factors are basically the hand that we are dealt new york fed president john williams said expressing a resignation shared by other central bankers and academic researchers gathered for the american economic association annual conference the fed is in the middle of a broad review of its approach to monetary policy that is due to conclude later this year the economy is currently felt to be functioning well with a recession unlikely in the near term an apt time officials feel to make any changes the conference produced a flourish of ideas including a call from former fed chair ben bernanke to make once unconventional monetary policy tools like bond buying a permanent part of the central bank s arsenal in effect making the tactics he used to counter the 2007 09 financial crisis a staple part of fed recession fighting with a federal funds target rate unlikely to rise much beyond 2 to 3 percent and currently set lower than that the fed would not have enough firepower otherwise to battle the next downturn he said on sunday former fed chair janet yellen called for better tools for financial regulation arguing the fed could safely leave interest rates at low levels boosting job and wage growth if it was confident other methods could be used to ensure that an ongoing era of easy money did not lead to a credit crash and ultimately to worse outcomes overall although it would be politically touchy in the united states other countries have put stricter limits on mortgage credit for example to prevent low interest rates from encouraging risky borrowing such tools are needed here to free monetary policy to focus on the fed s core objectives of maximum employment and stable prices yellen said cleveland fed president loretta mester told reuters on the sidelines of the meeting that if fed policymakers are trying to resolve one question in their minds right now it is how much financial risk they are willing to push into the future in return for the benefits workers are seeing today some people say i am willing to take the risk of a very low interest rate now and others say the problem with that is if you do end up with a financial stability problem the very people you are trying to help are going to be the ones that are hurt worse that is kind of the issue it may be about a time frame question concern that low borrowing costs could fuel such financial excesses were among arguments that some fed policymakers made last year against the central bank s three interest rate cuts in the end fed chair jerome powell and most of his colleagues judged that financial markets were flashing few warning signs of rising instability and thought rate cuts could cushion the u s economy from the effects of slowing global growth and rising trade tariffs need another tool in research presented at the conference a group of researchers said as yellen suggested that the fed may not need to compromise on its macroeconomic goals if there are better rules for regulating banks household credit and otherwise ensuring against financial crisis can monetary policy address output and stable prices and something called financial conditions you need another tool said nellie liang a senior fellow at the brookings institution and former head of the fed s financial stability division liang co authored a paper with researchers at the international monetary fund and the federal reserve bank of new york concluding that without separate tools to keep financial conditions stable central bank policy sets the stage for lower long term growth because of the occasional credit busts we have low inflation we ve got lots of employment if we keep rates low because inflation is not high what kind of financial vulnerabilities might you build and how much does that increase the downside tail risk four quarters out eight quarters out liang said these vulnerabilities build over time you get better stuff now at the cost of worse later it is not clear how much traction those ideas may get in the near future regulators have moved to lighten some rules on the banks and one of the ideas liang s group considered a countercyclical bank capital requirement that could be raised when times are good and loosened to encourage lending in bad times is in place but never used other researchers delved into the need for better fiscal policies so the fed will not fight the next crisis alone even concluding that something like defense spending could be used to buffer a recession one paper concluded for example that a surge in government contract spending lowers local interest rates for things like used car purchases and home mortgages providing an unexpected economic boost beyond the direct contract dollars spent reporting by ann saphir and howard schneider editing by peter cooney

compared with 3 per cent growth in world gdp and 4 3 per cent growth for the region in 2018 figures for 2019 are only expected to reach 2 6 per cent and 4 per cent respectively but the vietnamese economy has continued on track for an expected growth rate of 6 8 per cent slightly slower than 2018 but on par with 2017 driven mainly by domestic consumption and export oriented manufacturing headline inflation year on year was about 2 2 per cent in october 2019 despite increases in the administrative prices of healthcare and education the outbreak of african swine fever did not seem to affect food prices and lower fuel prices also helped to contain inflationary pressure with relatively low inflation and robust growth in nominal wages 13 1 per cent as the workforce moves away from agriculture towards more productive manufacturing and services jobs poverty rates have fallen further those in extreme poverty living on less than us 1 90 per day are now estimated by the world bank to be less than 2 per cent of the population monetary policy has been prudent with credit growth at 12 5 per cent within the central bank s target of 14 per cent for 2019 overall banking stability has also improved with a more active resolution of non performing loans through the seizure and sale of collaterals and debt restructuring on the fiscal side consolidation is being achieved through a combination of cutbacks in government capital spending and asset sales capital expenditure fell by 5 6 per cent between 2018 and 2019 largely because of slow disbursement rates in some ministries and provinces on the revenue side assets such as land use rights and state owned houses have been sold and divestment from state owned enterprises has occurred but these are one off events and increased effort needs to be put to the improved collection of tax revenue still the current consolidation has enabled public debt to fall to 56 per cent of gdp well below the 65 per cent limit set by the national assembly but this limit is still above the 55 per cent gdp ceiling recommended by the imf for prudent management of long term debt on the external front exports continued to grow by 8 4 per cent in the first nine months of 2019 compared with 15 8 per cent in the same period in 2018 this is a creditable performance in the face of much headwind and uncertainty in the global economy exports to the united states rose by almost 28 per cent in the first nine months of 2019 compared with about 18 per cent in 2018 this shows that in the short term vietnam has from one narrow view been a beneficiary of the trade diversion effect of the us china trade war foreign direct investment inflows have also continued at the high levels reported in 2017 and 2018 again further evidence of the resilience of the vietnamese economy as a result international reserves have risen by an estimated equivalent of 0 4 per cent of imports from late 2018 to late 2019 according to a recent report by the world economic forum vietnam has also moved up 10 places in the global competitiveness index in the medium term the outlook according to the world bank is a comparatively healthy growth rate converging around 6 5 per cent in the next two to three years but the weak linkage between export oriented foreign firms and the domestic sector is a continuing concern the lack of long term finance and the scarcity of skilled labour are the two issues continually voiced by the domestic private sector at the same time the slowing down of state owned enterprise reform and divestment a process that begun in earnest in 2016 is regrettable no doubt the movement away from the public debt ceiling of 65 per cent of gdp would have eased the political pressure on state asset divestment but this structural reform must continue if the domestic private sector is not to be crowded out in the years to come associated with state owned enterprise reform is the state business relationship the 13 conglomerates known as the state economic groups segs were formed in 2007 upon vietnam s entry into the wto on the rationale that vietnam needed large companies in order to compete in the world economy because these conglomerates are largely controlled by the central government they are at times directed to place investment projects in provinces in return for political support a number of these segs have gone bankrupt and the anti corruption campaign has resulted in the demise of several high ranking officials systemic cronyism needs to be tackled if vietnam is to move beyond a middle income country in the long term the vietnam economy has shown great resilience against global headwinds and uncertainties it is hoped that the authorities will take advantage of this resilience and continue with structural reforms to cement vietnam s future suiwah leung is honorary associate professor of economics at the crawford school of public policy the australian national university this

letters staff writer savannah morning news reflecting on rep carter s reflections congressman buddy carter opened his op ed column published dec 30 citing his reflections on 2019 by lambasting house democrats for ramming shameful baseless articles of impeachment through the peoples house however as we all know from the evidence that had been presented and recently re enforced by the finding that only 91 minutes after president donald trump s talk with the ukraine president a halt delay in supplying the ukraine with house approved aid was issued to insure granting of his illegal self serving quid pro as to the second count of the impeachment there can be no question in anyone s mind that trump ordered members of the executive branch not to cooperate with the house investigation thereby obstructing congress investigation carter was one of the many republicans who on the false pretense of not being represented at the initial closed house impeachment hearings raided and disrupted those hearings knowing that the republicans had equal representation in those hearings carter states that the impeachment was passed by the most partisan impeachment vote in history true but the simple reason is that all of the republican s voted on the party line and not on the facts before them the house actions are similar to those of a grand jury whereby it is their duty based upon the evidence presented by a prosecutor to find if there is a reasonable likelihood a crime has been committed it is the senates duty to actually try the case and determine guilt or innocence based upon a fair and complete trial based upon mitch mcconnell s statements there will not be a fair trial since he and others have made up their minds before hearing or even allowing all of the testimony and evidence and further are admittedly colluding with the defendant who they have the duty to try joel spivak savannah use local contractors for home repairs i bought my house in november 2019 one month earlier hurricane michael had tossed a tree on the roof and it was replaced by an out of town roofer with locations in jonesboro and riverdale last month after some heavy rain i noticed a small leak above the bathroom window i found out the name of the roofer and called to explain the situation the first thing they asked me was if i was the purchaser of the original roof i said no the original purchaser was likely the insurance company of the former owner then they told me that they were four hours away and would get back to me about this i never heard from them again i called a local roofer who bid almost 1 000 for four hours work to replace the gaskets around the roof vents which should have been replaced by the original roofer during the job at much lower cost i thanked them for the bid and went to home depot to get a bucket of henry s roof sealant 20 problem solved as we are sure to get more storms i suggest homeowners keep damage repair work local even if it means a long waiting time get emergency repairs done and wait jon a hartz sr savannah look big picture on america s economy recently published op ed columns by two of our elected officials rep buddy carter and sen kelly loeffler suggest that the nation is doing great for business as if we are only a consumer nation true the unemployment rate is at a record low and the stock market is booming yet many americans continue to struggle to meet their basic needs the people who have benefited most from the trump tax cuts are the super rich for 379 of the fortune 500 companies their average income tax rate was 11 3 of their income ninety one companies paid nothing including amazon chevron ibm and halliburton average americans on the whole are paying more that 11 of their income in taxes though they may have gained a small increase in income the republican cult oops party revel in the numbers quoted by sen loeffler and rep carter the numbers less often looked at include the fact that the latest mar a lago trip for the president to his own resort have cost the american tax payers 118 million at the same time president donald trump proposes cutting food stamps for 3 7 million americans studies have shown that food stamp dollars return 1 18 to 1 20 to the community the people most likely to be hurt by the work requirement are the rural poor jobs are hard to come by in poor rural counties where many work hard to survive the system is often an under the table economy which would not meet the requirements for the food stamp bureaucracy when thinking about the nation s economy please consider the

state department of family and children services took custody of 13 800 children with the vast majority of those coming from homes where neglect or substance abuse was an issue if we are to prevent the cycle of foster care from repeating we have to address the problem of what to do with foster kids once they age out of care since most have moved from one foster placement to another they have no close relationship with an adult who can encourage them nor do they have the financial means to complete their education they aren t sure how to look for a job where to find a place to live or how to navigate the challenges of everyday life about 700 foster kids age out and leave state custody each year in georgia and most follow in their parents footsteps in a very short period of time for example across the country about 50 of foster children who age out will become homeless within the first four years of being on their own an estimated 71 of girls are pregnant in their first year out of foster care estimates are that within four years of leaving foster care 50 will be unemployed and 70 will rely on welfare programs the u s department of health and human resources estimates that foster kids who age out cost taxpayers 350 million a year in lost productivity incarceration and welfare and other government assistance programs gov brian kemp and the georgia legislature are expected to look at georgia s foster care crisis this winter i believe it is important they engage local communities to mentor these young adults and find ways to bridge them financially so they can

question in their minds right now it is how much financial risk they are willing to push into the future in return for the benefits workers are seeing today some people say i am willing to take the risk of a very low interest rate now and others say the problem with that is if you do end up with a financial stability problem the very people you are trying to help are going to be the ones that

provocative and turkish troops will enter libya clearly as u s president trump said complicating the situation the markets frequently over react to geopolitical developments but it appears to have begun a new technical phase in the capital markets corrective pressures appear to be building this would seem to favor the though a poor at the end of next week could cut it short and seem stretched

geopolitical tensions spurred a rebound but it ran out of steam near the week s high of 97 10 just above the 50 retracement of the decline since the december 23 high 97 80 the next retracement objective and the 20 day moving average are found in the 98 20 98 25 area as we anticipated last week the 50 day moving average has moved below the 200 day moving average known as the deadman s cross or the golden cross the macd is trying to turn higher but the slow stochastic appears a bit further from turning euro the peaked on new year s eve a hundredth of a penny shy of 1 1240 and proceeded to sell off to 1 1125 ahead of the weekend that the euro was sold on the geopolitical developments may not be surprising but what stands out is the not the sell off but the recovery to session highs of 1 1180 into the end of the european session it finished the week near 1 1160 perhaps the contrast between the firm inflation readings from and and the disappointing u s headline and fell to the lowest level in a decade and hit a three year low the euro held a trendline drawn off the end of november and late december lows it begins the new week near 1 1120 and rises to about 1 1140 at the end of the week neither the macd nor the slow stochastic have turned lower but they appear poised to do so in the coming days this would seem to suggest short term participants should sell into strength though

only around a third of this was recorded at the end of the week in response to the geopolitical developments the absence of the domestic market may have exacerbated the move who can forget last year s

vain it fell to about jpy107 85 on the geopolitics and subsequent decline in equities and interest rates the macd and slow stochastic are pointing lower but a note of caution in injected by the lower bollinger band 108 20 which was violated on a closing basis a convincing break of jpy107 70 the 38 2 retracement of the gains in the august 26th low jpy104 45 could signal another leg down into the

selling off to mxn18 80 be the end of december we had thought the market looked vulnerable to a short squeeze but it was not until the geopolitical developments at the end of last week for the dollar to rise from its base the dollar spiked to almost mxn19 0275 before north american markets even opened and closed just below mxn18 91 while the slow stochastic has turned higher the macd has yet to do

what happens when one group doesn t want to give up their power photo file with capital gains tax quashed property investors are returning to the market at near record rates but if mum and dad buy all the houses what s left for the kids kirsty johnston reports it crept up on me being a landlord in 2017 i d moved to dunedin with my boyfriend and bought a four bedroom cottage by the sea my dream when we broke up a year later i thought we d sell and i d take my money back to auckland and invest in a centre city apartment instead don t do that my mortgage broker said buy him out and then get the apartment as well at first i thought she was kidding there was no way any lender would give me a second mortgage on a single income particularly not in auckland i said but then i talked to a financial adviser and the bank within three months with a bit of money shuffling and a bit of help from dad i had two homes and a tenant and a terrifying level of debt a year later i think about the impacts of this decision almost all the time i desperately do not want to own a rental property both because it s stressful and because ideologically it leaves me queasy but each time i think of selling someone says are you crazy then i do the numbers and i see they re right there is no better way to invest my money herein lies the problem at the root of both new zealand s sluggish economy and a deepening generational inequality we have made it too easy to have our wealth tied to property data revealed by the herald today shows that up to a third of property in new zealand is owned by mum and dad investors like me who buy and hold a small to medium number of houses mostly as a form of retirement savings for a bit this group looked to be waning their lobby groups the property associations had threatened that with cooling prices and possible tax changes investors would be getting out but in the past few months as the spectre of capital gains tax faded into history mum and dad are buying again in fact corelogic data shows that mortgaged multiple property owners ie investors accounted for 26 per cent of property purchases by august levels not seen since the investor zenith just before the reserve bank changed the rules about deposits in 2016 read more 7 tips to get started in property investment should you be allowed to buy an investment property with kiwisaver shares vs property what s the better investment mary holm shares v houses the winner is clear the greatest increase was those with only one other property new investors the data said the second biggest group was those with three or four houses looking to expand their portfolio any investors that are getting out have just been replaced by more investors says nick goodall from corelogic there s still easy credit and low interest rates and once capital gains tax was ruled out the confidence came back investors are saying we can continue to buy in this market goodall says that growing investor group even those that own between 10 20 properties aren t professionals they re going to have a job they re part time investors they ll say what else do i do for my retirement they want a passive income and they know it s successful so they continue to accumulate to get a portfolio mum and dad investors are moving back into the market photo file housing now makes up more than half of new zealand s total investment assets or 55 per cent just over 40 per cent of that is owner occupied homes and 13 per cent is investor housing according to 2018 s tax working group report it is our biggest investment class by far comparatively for example we have 8 per cent in investor shares and 4 per cent in investor funds we invest more in housing than any other developed country according to an article by journalist bernard hickey last year our housing market was worth 1 13 trillion in 2019 up by more than 1 trillion from 123 billion in 1990 by that measure housing is worth 3 9 times our gdp hickey says and more than 7 2 times the value of our stock market in contrast america s housing market is worth us 33 3 trillion or 1 6 times its gdp and 1 5 times the value of its stock market in other words housing is new zealand s default investment choice it has always been a driving force in our economy a national preoccupation a right but in the face of a supply crisis coupled with crippling housing unaffordability it s becoming harder and harder to write off our obsession as benign a nation divided by housing the arguments against over investing in housing and correlating high house prices created by such persistent demand are both social and economic economy wise experts say that if so much wealth wasn t tied to property it could be going into business and creating jobs which would be more valuable anecdotally many small business owners faced with expansion or buying properties will do the latter equally anz economists in a 2018 property focus report said high house prices were limiting new zealand s economic expansion and productivity new zealand routinely underperforms on productivity by oecd standards they said high house prices both make it more difficult for younger households to invest in businesses limiting the entrepreneurial endeavours of younger people and create barriers to labour mobility and social mobility and to the degree that high house prices are a symptom of excess domestic demand pressure they will be associated with upward pressure on the real exchange rate stifling exporting and import competing activity they said there are also economic risks associated with having extremely high levels of private debt jenny mcarthur a new zealander who lectures in urban infrastructure and policy at ucl in london says when house prices are so high the huge amounts of workers incomes siphoned off to pay mortgages is taken out of the economy which can trigger a recession mcarthur also argues that high house prices are creating untold intergenerational inequality with prices in auckland now up to ten times income owning property is currently an unachievable dream for many on the numbers everyone born after 1995 those turning 25 this year and beginning their working careers was just born too late for housing to be affordable either you can t afford it at all or you inherit and we shouldn t want that mcarthur said in a housing stocktake commissioned by the minister of housing and urban development last year the authors wrote new zealand was quickly becoming a society divided by the ownership of housing and its related wealth ownership rates had peaked in 1991 it said a year which was historically significant as the year of ruth richardson s mother of all budgets which ended the state s home ownership support programmes and commenced the sell off of the state s mortgage portfolio this inequality of ownership is exacerbated by rising rents now at an average 500 a week eating into the wages of already struggling tenants according to former salvation army housing expert alan johnson in his report beyond renting renters have poorer quality housing they pay more of their income in housing costs and have much less wealth than those who own property on the other hand not only have landlords more wealth but they have managed to accumulate more as house prices and rents have continued to rise faster than wages salaries pensions and benefits he says a self re inforcing trend using property as a path to wealth is deeply embedded in the new zealand psyche doing up housing and flicking it for a profit fits squarely with kiwis egalitarian beliefs that anyone can succeed if they try hard enough and the country s strong diy culture new zealand herald business editor at large liam dann says even in the face of evidence that early egalitarianism has given way to class culture that emotional attachment is one of the reasons we find it so hard to let go of using property as a commodity until recently flipping was celebrated he says when things were more equal it wasn t such a negative thing new zealand herald business editor liam dann says property investment is deeply embedded in the new zealand psyche photo file it s also what makes it politically difficult to do anything about regulating property investment not only is it those who already own property who want to keep the system the same but those who aspire to improve their financial position too so when the coalition government looked at introducing capital gains tax for example it wasn t only property owners that felt like something was being taken away and resisted change dann says the other factor driving our strong cultural preference for housing particularly for the baby boom generation is a fear of the stock market even when the sharemarket outperforms housing baby boomers are still wary of it because of the crashes in 1987 and 2008 he says they don t trust it whereas housing is something tangible that they understand that they can see they trust it because it s worked for them they ve had double digit increases on their properties it makes them feel wealthy the problem with that attachment says economist and politician geoff simmons the leader of the opportunities party top is that it doesn t work for everyone and it s only become such a strong belief because those who currently hold the balance of power have rigged the system for themselves it s self reinforcing that s why it s in their psyche because it works for them in the set up we have the reason it works and the main reason those like simmons say new zealand is so wedded to housing is because its incentivised by tax unlike in most similar countries we don t have a capital gains tax there s also no tax on housing as an asset unlike the money in managed funds or bank deposits even retirement savings are taxed at a higher rate than housing meaning as an investment it s the most attractive asset class there is the system rewards property investment and it rewards landbankers simmons says they know it s the best place to put your money and unlike investing in the stock market finance for housing is easy credit is available interest rates are low if you already have a property using the equity to buy another one is actively encouraged by the financial sector equally regulation is light there s no licence required to be a landlord there are some laws as of last year higher insulation standards were mandated alongside other initiatives to make rentals healthier rental property losses are now ring fenced and the coalition government have also proposed to strengthen tenants rights to make it harder to get rid of tenants without good reason andrew king the outgoing head of the new zealand property investors federation says in his opinion people are being disincentivised from becoming landlords with such changes his group argue that mum and dad landlords are essential to society as they provide shelter for people he also says that amid a housing crisis having investors own homes is actually beneficial as the number of people that live in each owner occupied home say if purchased by a first home buyer is lower andrew king of the new zealand property investors federation photo jason oxenham and that s despite rental properties being smaller he says so when you sell to a first home buyer that could lead to someone without a home he also argues that it s cheaper for mum and dad landlords to provide accommodation than the state comparing the cost of a private house to a public one and the subsidies that go with those however most property analysts don t think any of the regulatory changes have made a tangible difference to the investment space it s not too hard to find reasons for why smaller investors appetite for residential property has lifted again wrote corelogic s kelvin davidson in august after all although the costs of being a landlord have increased the flipside is that rents are also rising in her paper on the new zealand rental sector massey university academic karen witten noted this almost cognitive dissonance by investors as a trend she wrote how landlords decried high house prices but failed to link their behaviour taking advantage of tax breaks cheap finance and increasing equity in their existing property to those prices and the subsequent difficulties faced by first home buyers it will destabilise the country justine sachs is 25 years old and she s mad the union organiser from auckland came to new zealand from south african when she was 11 despite promises of a better life her family were unable to afford their own home sachs now fears she will always be the same the lack of freedom and insecurity is just unfair she says i feel locked out of this market i m not even focused on myself i just want my mum to have security sachs watched the debate over capital gains tax last year and felt like no one had her interests at heart those people saying i don t want to go prices to go down because it s not in my interest that politicised me i thought it was selfish unlike elsewhere new zealand is yet to see instability from huge levels of inequality and anger from the youth towards the establishment but sachs believes if there isn t regulation better tax or at the very least better rental laws it could lead to political unrest i think it s coming there is rumblings she says i think if this government or the next one doesn t do anything it will happen but that s terrifying it will destabilise the country justine sachs 25 fears she may never be able to afford a home photo supplied sachs isn t alone in this feeling in fact several academics interviewed for this story said they couldn t understand why the youth weren t marching in the streets otago university tax expert andrew coleman speaking from his current teaching post in morocco was one of those he described the situation as appalling the fact baby boomers and even the generation younger than them don t seem to care about this at all is an indictment on them it s a real intergenerational scandal he said i find it surprising that young people haven t said hey these systems are biased against us i don t know why there isn t a revolt coleman believes tax is at the heart of the inequality he has studied the rapid escalation in house prices since 1989 when changes were made to the way property was taxed in comparison to retirement savings and says he thinks people responded to those changes by investing in housing if you tax land at lower rates than other assets then you drive up the price of land he says i don t want to say that it s only tax but tax is one of the issues in the market which may be under appreciated coleman wants the tax on retirement savings lifted so it can compound faster making it more equitable to property investment he says it can still be taxed when it s withdrawn the same as most countries overseas his idea is one of many that experts say could happen to dampen the market simmons from top says his party would go further taxing all assets at the same rate as a bank account neither of those ideas have proved particularly popular among voters or investors so far witten in her paper argued that one way to help was to make renting a viable alternative with stronger tenant rights requires a perceptual shift to viewing a dwelling as primarily a home rather than predominantly an asset and for this to be reflected in legislation which affords tenants secure occupancy she said it is unlikely that the rental laws introduced this year will redress that balance mcarthur raised the idea of a debt to income limit where borrowers would be allowed to borrow up to five times their income in mortgage debt that has so far not found a footing everyone is instead talking about supply but there are bigger things at play if we don t address the supply of debt then we are still going to have this problem mcarthur says like dann and coleman and simmons and sachs mcarthur says the main roadblock to solutions is attitude when she returned to new zealand recently she felt frustrated that the problem was getting worse not better and no one seemed to care there s this idea that this is just how it is now it s normalised which is just so shocking she says why is no one on the streets about this people are like oh i just have a giant mortgage but that is wrong and the government are responsible for not letting this happen but they have they just let this happen completely in plain sight she believes the cultural narrative about homeownership is one sided and we need to acknowledge that we ve gone from having a model that helped everyone build wealth to that model being a problem we need to say there s two sides to the story on one side you have people protecting values and protecting their assets and capital gains she says and then you have those who don t have housing and they re directly connected nothing comes for free it s coming at the expense of someone else after speaking to mcarthur i went and looked again at selling my rental home the numbers again did not stack up term deposits are down to 3 per cent interest dunedin property prices increased 14 per cent last year i consoled myself by thinking well at least my tenant has somewhere to live if anyone asks i ll say she would have been unable to afford to buy anyway i m doing her a favour
wednesday the state of maine took america one giant step closer to ending the antidemocratic grip the gop s had on our presidential elections even though george w bush lost the 2000 election by a half million votes nationally and donald trump lost in 2016 by 3 million votes both ended up in the white house because of the electoral college the problem with getting rid of the electoral college is that it s written into the constitution amending that document takes two thirds of the house and senate and three quarters of the states and that isn t happening any day soon read a criminologist explains why keeping trump from the white house is all that matters but because the constitution also says that individual states can determine on their own how to assign their electoral votes there s a way to get around the electoral college altogether right now all but two states give 100 of their electoral votes to the presidential candidate who won the most votes in the state maine and nebraska split their states in two but assign all electoral votes to whoever won the most popular votes in each region but they don t have to a state under the constitution can assign their electoral votes to any candidate they want when it looked like al gore was going to win florida in 2000 for example the speaker of the florida house prepared legislation authorizing the governor jeb bush to give the state s electoral votes and thus the presidency to his brother george w bush regardless of who the recount determined won the popular vote in that state so some smart political and constitutional minds got together and came up with a system whereby states representing 270 electoral votes the amount to become president pledge to commit all of their electoral votes regardless of who won in their individual state to whichever candidate won the national popular vote to accomplish this they organized what they call the national popular vote interstate compact npvic and states have been signing up for several decades with maine they re at 209 electoral college votes and michigan with 16 electoral college votes will be the next state to join as the national popular vote legislation is working its way through their legislature now by about two to one 65 of americans favor this change so the person who wins the country also wins the white house as you can imagine republicans hate the idea and are threatening litigation under an ancient and anachronistic law if it passes by this system we would have had president al gore and president hillary clinton the supreme court would today have a pronounced progressive tilt a half million americans would not have died of covid and the country wouldn t have lost two decades in the fight against global warming all because that s what the majority of americans actually voted for democracy after all yesterday maine s legislature passed with votes of both democrats and republicans a bill joining the compact bringing the total number of electoral votes now held by compact states to 209 with michigan we ll be at 225 most americans are rightly confused by the entire process and only a small percentage could even accurately describe what the electoral college is or why it s in the constitution the history is fascinating america s founders and framers thought they could use the electoral college to prevent somebody like donald trump from ever becoming president seriously unfortunately they were wrong and now we re paying the price it s often said that the electoral college was brought into being to perpetuate or protect the institution of slavery and indeed during the first half century of america it gave the slave states several presidents who wouldn t have been otherwise elected this is because there s one elector in the college for every member of the house and senate and three for the district of columbia when the three fifths compromise was in effect until just after the civil war slave states had more members in the house of representatives than the size of their voting public deserved it s now true of red states and the senate where republicans represent only 145 million americans and democrats represent 186 million americans but republicans hold fully 50 of the vote this explains in part why when madison proposed the electoral college the framers seized on it as a compromise solution after weeks of drawn out and often angry debate on how to select a president most amazing according to the framers of the constitution themselves the real reason for the electoral college was to prevent a foreign power like russia from placing their stooge in the white house today we re horrified by the idea that donald trump may actually be putting first the interests of russia and china and that money and other efforts from multiple foreign entities may have helped him get elected it s shocking something we never even really took seriously when for example the movie manchurian candidate came out back in the day what a cute idea for a movie we thought that could never happen here but this was actually a big deal for the founding generation one of the first questions about any candidate for president during that era was is he beholden in any way to any other government at the time of the declaration of independence it s estimated that nearly two thirds of all citizens of the american colonies favored remaining a british colony jimmy carter s novel the hornet s nest is a great resource there were spies and british loyalists everywhere and spain had staked out their claim to the region around florida while the french were colonizing what is now canada and louisiana foreign powers had us boxed in in 1775 the year the revolutionary war unofficially started virtually all of the colonists had familial friendship or business acquaintances with people whose loyalty was suspect or who were openly opposed to american independence it was even rumored that ben franklin was working as a spy for british intelligence and it turns out evidence shows he was only against france when he lived in paris conservative federalists in particular were wary of franklin s internationalist sentiments jefferson was living in france when the constitution was being written and his political enemies were even then it got much louder around the election of 1800 whispering that he had at best mixed loyalties in response he felt the need to protest to elbridge gerry that the first object of my heart is my own country in that is embarked my family my fortune and my own existence when john adams famously defended british soldiers who during an anti british riot on march 5 1770 shot and killed crispus attucks and four others he was widely condemned for being too pro british an issue that recurred in 1798 when as president adams pushed the alien and sedition laws through congress over vice president thomas jefferson s loud objections british spy gilbert barkley wrote to his spymasters in london that quakers and many other americans considered adams an enemy to his country and after the revolutionary war the nation was abuzz about one of that war s most decorated soldiers benedict arnold once considered a shoo in for high elected office selling out to the british in exchange for money and a title so it fell to a fatherless man born in nevins to explain to americans that the main purpose of the electoral college was to make sure that no agent of a foreign government would ever become president back then america was so spread out it would be difficult for most citizen voters to get to know a presidential candidate well enough to spot a spy or traitor alexander hamilton explained in federalist 68 therefore the electors having no other governmental duty obligation or responsibility would be sure to catch one if it was tried the most deadly adversaries of america hamilton wrote would probably make their approaches from more than one quarter chiefly from the desire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils influencing public opinion or owning a senator was nothing compared to having their man in the white house as hamilton wrote how could they better gratify this than by raising a creature of their own to the chief magistracy of the union but hamilton wrote the framers of the constitution have guarded against all danger of this sort with the most provident and judicious attention the system they set up to protect the white house from being occupied by an agent of a foreign government was straightforward hamilton bragged the choice of president would not depend on any preexisting bodies of men who might be tampered with beforehand to prostitute their votes instead the electoral college would be made up of persons for the temporary and sole purpose of making the appointment the electors would be apolitical because it would be illegal for a senator or house member to become one hamilton wrote and they have excluded from eligibility to this trust all those who from situation might be suspected of too great devotion to the president in office no senator representative or other person holding a place of trust or profit under the united states can be of the numbers of the electors this hamilton was certain would eliminate any sinister bias excluding members of congress who may be subject to bribery or foreign influences the electors would select a man for president who was brave of heart and pure of soul the process of election affords a moral certainty hamilton wrote that the office of president will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications indeed while a knave or rogue or traitor may fool enough people to even ascend to the office of mayor of a major city or governor of a state hamilton believed the electoral college would ferret out such a traitor he wrote talents for low intrigue and the little arts of popularity may alone suffice to elevate a man to the first honors in a single state but it will require other talents and a different kind of merit to establish him in the esteem and confidence of the men in the electoral college who would select him as president of the whole union hamilton s pride in the system that he himself had helped build was hard for him to suppress he added in federalist 68 it will not be too strong to say that there will be a constant probability of seeing the station filled by characters preeminent for ability and virtue unfortunately as donald trump proves things haven t worked out that way because the three fifths compromise gave more electors to the slave states than their voting population would indicate the electoral college handed the white house to four virginia slaveholders among our first five presidents since that compromise has been eliminated the electoral college continues to wreak mischief in putting george w bush and donald trump into office hamilton never envisioned a day when a man so entangled in financial affairs with foreign governments as is donald trump could even be seriously considered because in his mind the electors would carefully investigate the candidate that hasn t happened in over a century so by his standards the electors totally failed in their job in the 2000 and 2016 elections the electoral college was a compromise designed to keep the president above political considerations it was sold to the public as a way to prevent an agent witting or unwitting of a foreign power from becoming president it has failed on both counts through the arc of time since her founding america has constantly albeit in fits and starts expanded democracy from expanding the vote to include racial minorities and women to amending the constitution to allow for citizens to vote for u s senators rather than having them appointed by often corrupted state legislatures average citizens of all races and genders have been brought into the decisions around who will lead us but in the past two decades the electoral college has brought us two presidents who were rejected by a majority of americans this is fundamentally undemocratic the national popular vote interstate compact can fix this if the supreme court doesn t intervene in response to a gop lawsuit check out your state on their website if democrats can flip a few more red states blue this november and with abortion on the ballot that s a real possibility we might be able to get this done in time for the 2028 election now read how donald trump is spreading a dangerous

following an unprecedented spike in cases of the mosquito borne disease in recent months chief medical officer cmo dr rhonda sealy thomas said she would consider the situation an epidemic she said because it is an unexpected increase in the number of cases she would say there is an outbreak of the disease dr sealy thomas said towards the end of last year december 2018 we started seeing an increase in what you call undifferentiated fever persons coming down with high fever and some of the symptoms and did see an increase in the number of cases of dengue she told an observer radio program she said that the situation continued up until early 2019 when there was actually a decrease in the number of cases the cmo said that the cases increased from two to three a week and then in august we started noticing an increase going up to 20 30 and 40 and peaked at about 87 she said as a result the authorities have revived the dengue task force an ad hoc committee to combat the situation dr sealy thomas said the purpose of the task force is to monitor the situation and take control measures to reduce mobility that is with the illness and complications of dengue bahamas the central bank of bahamas cbb has recently introduced a digital version of the bahamian dollar starting with a pilot phase in exuma and extending to the first half of 2020 to abaco the bank said that this initiative has acquired the name project sand dollar with the sand dollar also being the names assigned to the proposed central bank digital currency the cbb said in a statement this s a continuation of the bahamian payment system modernization initiative psmi which began in the early 2000s the bahamian psmi targets improved outcome for financial inclusion and access making the domestic payments system more efficient and non discriminatory in access to financial services it said although average measures of financial development and access in country are high by international standards pockets of the population are excluded because of the remoteness of some communities outside of the cost effective reach of physical banking services the bank said the public though will need more assurances around the safety of conducting online transactions the digital currency design and public education will tackle these issues caribbean the united states agency for

to earn increased revenues from overflight services as a result of the recent us 17 million upgrade to the kingston air traffic control center katcc speaking at the opening of the center holness explained that aviation contributes billions of dollars to the jamaican economy both directly and indirectly director general of the jamaica civil aviation authority jcaa nari williams sing said the additional revenue would come from accommodating more aircraft in the jamaican airspace as a result of more efficient movement of aircraft through the country s flight information region fir which is many times the size of jamaica he pointed out that the upgrade at the katcc was part of a larger air navigation services modernization program which includes two new air traffic control towers at the norman manley international airport and sangster international airports william singh said this will redound to a benefit for the country as more aircraft in the airspace means more revenue earned

climate alarmist banks go carbon colonialist paul driessen and david wojick africa has the world s lowest electrification rate its power consumption per capita is just 613 kilowatt hours per year compared to 6 500 kwh in europe and 13 000 in the united states african development bank afdb president akinwumi adesina observed in july 2017 that s 9 4 of eu and 4 7 of us electricity consumption it s equivalent to americans having electricity only 1 hour a day 8 hours a week 411 hours per year â at totally unpredictable times for a few minutes hours or days at a stretch it s actually even worse than that excluding significantly electrified south africa sub sahara africans consume an almost irrelevant 181 kwh of electricity per capita â 1 4 of the average american s in sub saharan afria over 600 million people have no electricity and over 700 million rely on wood grass and dung for cooking and heating the region is home to 16 of the world s population and 53 of those without electricity by 2050 its urban populations could increase by 600 million determined to transform the dark continent the afdb launched a 12 billion new deal on energy in 2017 and a light up and power africa initiative in july 2018 it frequently emphasized that access to sufficient supplies of reliable affordable modern energy â including fossil fuels â is critical for the continent s social and economic development without energy it is impossible to create jobs increase productivity reduce inequality improve people s health and wellbeing or end poverty the bank s lofty goal for its energy new deal is 100 access to electricity in urban areas and 95 in rural areas by 2025 in july 2017 mr adesina told the african union summit he was excited that japan has answered our call to adopt a balanced energy mix that includes its ultra super critical clean coal technologies that remove sulfur nitrogen oxides and particulates while greatly reducing co2 emissions in 2018 the bank approved seed money for a nigerian coal project and geared up to finance a 350mw coal plant in senegal it also initiated plans for a 2 billion coal fired power station in the kenya s port city of lamu after the imf world bank and other western lenders rebuffed kenya but then mr adesina and the afdb caved in to carbon colonialist pressure the bank now says almost nothing about coal or even natural gas its new themes include responding to global concerns about climate change gradually adopting a low carbon and sustainable growth path significantly reducing reliance on fossil fuels and transitioning to green growth and clean renewable energy in september 2019 the bank announced that it planned to begin scrapping coal fired power plants all across africa build the largest solar zone in the world and pull funding for the lamu power plant we re getting out of coal mr adesina said coal is the past and renewable energy is the future so the afdb has joined the world bank goldman sachs and other multilateral anti development banks in caring more about climate alarmism and avoiding criticism from the likes of greta the perpetually aggrieved and angry teen â than they do about safeguarding the lives livelihoods health and living standards of hundreds of millions of electricity deprived africans this 180 degree flip flop is delusional dysfunctional and disingenuous for many it will be lethal first there is nothing green clean or renewable about wind and solar energy the vast amounts of land and raw materials mines and factories required to build wind turbines solar panels batteries and transmission lines â to harness widely dispersed insufficient intermittent weather dependent wind and solar energy to benefit sub saharan africans â are anything but clean green renewable or sustainable in fact trying to meet those needs would require millions of turbines and billions of solar panels second the afdb cannot possibly achieve its energy new deal or light up and power africa goals with wind and solar it will never reach 100 or even 25 access to meaningful electricity that way no country has ever built or sustained a modern economy this way â and countries that have tried to by mandating wind solar and fossil fuel free economies are paying a terrible price headlines tell the story germany s green suicide industrial job losses top 80 000 german wind industry faces extinction 340 000 german families have pricey electricity cut off british steel faces insolvency british families are already deeply in debt to their energy suppliers before winter even sets in meanwhile the fossil and nuclear based us economy added another 266 000 jobs in november and wages also grew third there is no evidence to support claims that temperatures droughts and weather anywhere in africa are unprecedented or due to carbon dioxide from fossil fuels â or from wood grass and dung fires they and other climate changes have been common throughout history and an energy rich prosperous africa will be far better able to deal with future changes than a poor energy deprived continent could fourth china india indonesia and other countries are not going stop building coal and gas fired power plants â and emitting enormously more co2 why should africa and the afdb go down a different path finally banishing fossil fuels and nuclear and focusing on pseudo renewable energy will mean millions of children and parents will continue to suffer and die needlessly every year from diseases of poverty and energy deprivation this eco manslaughter at the hands of climate activists and banks must not continue africans have a fundamental human right to more than the few light bulbs cell phone charging stations and one cubic foot refrigerators that can be supported by a wind turbine and solar panel economy thankfully botswana tanzania and other countries recognize that their continent is rich in coal oil natural gas hydro and uranium they intend to utilize those resources take charge of their destinies develop their economies and improve their people s lives â by building coal and gas fired power plants hydroelectric facilities and pebble bed modular or other nuclear power plants they will also install wind turbines and solar panels in distant villages until electrical grids bring 24 7 365 power to the villages no single solution will work everywhere but under no circumstances are we going to apologize for developing africa s oil gas and coal fields equatorial guinea energy minister gabriel obiang lima has said adding it is criminal for any non african to suggest that africa should ignore any resources it has energy is the catalyst for growth says gwede mantashe south africa s new mineral resources and energy minister and national chair of its african national congress africa has long exported its oil and gas to the rest of the world while remaining energy deficient itself he noted during a recent africa oil week conference in cape town that is no longer tenable his new integrated resources plan includes coal and nuclear and all forms of energy as appropriate to a given time and situation south africa s trade unions now see that solar and wind will not create jobs or prosperity they promote coal power for inland areas where coal is plentiful and nuclear for coastal regions where water can cool reactors zambia kenya nigeria ghana and rwanda all appear prepared to join sa in going nuclear â and zambia has a new zambian atomic energy agency zamatom headed by dr roland msiska it has begun building a nuclear center and preparing for a new generation of small modular nuclear reactors i am tired of being lectured by people in rich countries who have never lived a day without electricity says nigerian sam bada maybe they should just go home and turn off their fridge hot water laptops and lights then live like that for a month and tell us who have suffered for years not to burn coal energy deprivation perpetuates economic deprivation â and creates breeding grounds for terrorist groups in weakened african nations recent islamic state attacks underscore this growing danger meanwhile too many banks lack the moral decency to stand up for fossil fuels or nuclear or question climate alarm doctrine if they continue to balk china could well step in â and gain greater influence and expanded control of africa s raw materials in the process it would be much better if africa stood up for itself every new power plant generates electricity jobs better living standards and more tax revenues to build more power plants transmission lines and prosperity every country can do this just as china india and other nations have already there d be no better holiday gift than to banish greta the grinch from africa paul driessen is senior policy analyst for the committee for a constructive tomorrow and author of books and articles on energy climate change and economic development david wojick is an independent analyst specializing in science and logic in public policy home
the agreement comes at a critical moment for africa for centuries europe the us and more recently china have stripped the continent of its raw materials today the majority of africa s external exports are extractives namely oil and minerals increasingly african nations hoping to secure sustainable economic growth are shifting away from the volatility associated with extractive exports towards industrialised goods while overall intra african trade is miniscule 42 per cent of it consists of industrial goods and this number is expected to grow under afcfta a focus on industrial goods promotes african industrialisation and the advancement of its manufacturing sector providing more employment opportunities for the continent s booming youth population despite growing trade tensions globally africa has never been better positioned as a prime successor to become the manufacturing hub of the developing world today only 15 per cent of african exports go to other african countries compared with intra trade levels of 61 per cent in asia and 67 per cent in europe high tariffs and colonial era infrastructure make it easier for african countries to export to europe asia or the us than to each other at the same time overlapping membership in africa s regional economic communities hinders trade standardisation and enforcement the share in total trade in africa shows deepening levels of integration in southern african development community 84 9 per cent comesa 59 5 per cent the community of sahel saharan states 58 4 per cent and economic community of west african states 56 7 per cent afcfta by contrast establishes a single continental market for goods and services seeking to increase intra african trade by cutting tariffs by 90 per cent and harmonising trading rules at a regional and continental level if fully implemented afcfta could unlock significant growth opportunities particularly for countries that are better placed to reap the rewards of intra regional trade in turn if these gains can be shared more broadly continent wide the tangible benefits of afcfta will be manifest to all africans countries with good trade integration and open economies are most likely to benefit economically from lower trade tariffs however there are still critical obstacles before the agreement can be fully implemented and have tangible benefits for all concerned parties why rules of origin matter first afcfta needs to get rules of origin right essentially rules of origin the set of technical requirements that define goods eligibility for zero tariff on imports in a free trade area are a passport for goods they are at the cornerstone of what it means for goods to be labelled made in africa unctad s 2019 economic development in africa report titled made in africa rules of origin for enhanced intra african trade demonstrates that the rules of origin are the critical policy tool needed to make any free trade area operational in order to boost trade in a more inclusive manner the rules of origin define the conditions that firms must comply with in order to authenticate that their goods originate from the free trade area and are thus eligible for preferential treatment within the area afcfta must provide real trade preferences to its members that can be used by african firms through supportive rules of origin that are well designed transparent and easy to implement this will help build viable african value chains in industries like tea cocoa chocolate cotton apparel beverage cement and automotive getting african firms to trade more with each other while also gaining more from trading with the rest of the world infrastructure and connectivity while increasing intra africa regional value chains is necessary african countries also need to increase their current marginal share in global exports increasing african exports will contribute to economies of scale create decent jobs and serve as a source of international learning to improve productivity however this will require significant investment in productive capacity and has significant political implications afcfta must not be constrained by infrastructure deficits and the fragmentation of supply chains the vast infrastructure gap in africa including transport and utilities infrastructure must be urgently addressed so as not to restrict increased trade integration currently african countries are not sufficiently investing in connectivity and infrastructure which significantly hampers regional trade to reverse this pattern a massive and strategic investment in connectivity and infrastructure is essential the harmonisation of regulations related to different sectors is needed to foster trade and a conducive business climate one reason for the lack of adequate investment in infrastructure and connectivity is that africa s development banks remain undercapitalised and trade finance for african smes is limited for example east african development bank only has assets of 390 million the development bank of southern africa is the largest with 5 3 billion dollars and even the regional afdb is small compared with other regions loaning 20 3 billion compared with 95 billion for asian development bank or 82 billion for inter american development bank if african governments are serious about financing the regional infrastructure and sme investment needed to make afcfta a game changer they need to mobilise the continent s financial resources without increasing the risk of debt distress there is no universal recipe for industrialisation african countries need to design their own economic development strategy and industrial policy that fits their unique circumstances however african countries may be able to benefit by focusing on learning from other successful regional economic systems and benefiting from the latecomer advantage a pragmatic approach to evidence based policy making will create better outcomes learning from the experiences of other regions and policy dialogue among african countries is especially important the afcfta will give african countries preferential access to the most economically dynamic region it is important to be realistic about time frames however we must ensure that the right systems and partnerships are put in place to reap the benefits of the afcfta one of the world s most exciting new

as president trump seeks re election he would ignore indications of trouble in the global economy at his own peril in much the same way as the 2008 lehman bankruptcy put paid to john mccain s 2008

10 predictions for global forest industries in 2020 jan 6 2020 forest2market market watch blog author pete stewart 1 global pulp market will soften hopes of a us china trade deal might breathe new life into pulp prices or they might fall flat as continued uncertainty takes a toll global gdp growth in 2020 is expected to be in the 2 range so short of some unexpected good news supply will still outpace demand expect pulp market weakness in 2020 without some big policy development or global economic shift on the horizon 2 us south sawtimber markets will flatten while production capacity has increased in the south over the last year it hasn t been enough to move sawtimber stumpage prices higher in fact prices have come down significantly after the weather induced spike that occurred in 1q2019 we look for prices to flatten along with housing starts in 2020 3 us hardwood industry will continue to face challenges but decreases will moderate in november we published a comprehensive analysis of hardwood log and lumber exports to china and other destinations while china s significant influence on the hardwood export market has been progressive over the last decade the ongoing trade dispute and tariffs have played a large part in the steep drop off we have seen in 2019 if a long term trade deal with china is reached in the coming months we expect to see a considerable rebound in american hardwood exports while it will take time to see a trend reversal play out in both the supply chain and the export data the us hardwood industry is positioned to react quickly to market signals china s economy is slowing however which could impact american hardwood demand in the near term 4 us housing starts will taper a recent reuters poll found most analysts expect housing to improve during 2020 the consensus opinion called for prices to end 2019 with a 3 rise the lowest in seven years and then slow to 2 9 and 2 8 over the next two years existing home sales are forecast to average roughly 5 million units over the coming year demand for housing is going to be strong but it s still going to be a supply issue it s going to be quite a while before that really rectifies probably two or three years said raymond james scott brown we think total starts will fluctuate between saars of 1 103 and 1 351 million units with 2020 s average being 1 264 million units 0 6 relative to 2019 5 the us dollar usd will maintain its strength with so much uncertainty surrounding the brexit and chinese trade situations at this point a year long forecast for the usd is a tall order however we believe that the usd will largely hold steady against both the cad and eur in 2020 despite improving investor risk appetite we see only modest downside for the u s dollar in 2020 because the american economy still looks much sturdier than china or europe however fx markets should be anything but dull with plenty of opportunity to collect carry and to position for macroeconomic divergence and major political events says zach pandl a currency strategist with goldman sachs in 2020 the cad will range between c 1 285 and c 1 376 and the eur will range between eur 0 890 and eur 0 946 6 the brazilian forest sector will stagnate when jair bolsonaro took the helm of the new government in january 2019 brazil s business class was hoping to finally move beyond the political and economic crises of the last decade however these hopes have largely not played out brazil is still challenged with anemic growth a weak currency and trade tariffs on forest products recent court challenges will keep brazilian plywood producers from fully exporting production and generally weak global gdp will be a drag on brazilian pulp manufacturers financials on a positive note inflation has stabilized and brazil is positioned especially with its low manufacturing cost to be the site of the next new greenfield pulp mill 7 british columbia bc will curtail more lumber production tariffs on lumber exports to the us will stay in place through 2020 combined with a restricted log supply this dynamic has created a challenging environment for bc lumber manufacturers bc will reduce capacity by approximately 500 750 mmbf of lumber this production will be offset by increased capacity in the us south that will marginally affect supply in the us construction market to add insult to injury a devastating beetle infestation in central europe is killing a significant portion of the spruce inventory the lumber produced from salvage spruce is making its way to china and india further edging out imports from bc 8 clt and engineered wood products will continue to grow rapidly with passage of the farm bill and the timber innovation act in 2018 investment and commercial interest in cross laminated timber clt and other engineered wood products has surged over the last year fourteen mass timber code change proposals have also been approved clearing the way for their inclusion in the 2021 international building code ibc the largest mass timber building in america was recently unveiled at the university of arkansas and per the american wood council over 44 tall wood buildings are either underway or have been completed over the last six years canada based structurlam mass timber also recently announced that it will begin construction on its first us based production facility in conway ar which is projected to open in 2021 the plant s first customer will be walmart which will use 1 1 million cubic feet of clt derived from timber grown in arkansas forests and produced at the arkansas facility to build its new headquarters in bentonville these innovative wood based construction technologies are here to stay 9 rate of global economic growth will slow gdp will follow global gdp has decelerated from its 2018 peak of 3 5 and the us economy real gdp grew at roughly 2 in 2019 citing key inhibitors including trade tensions weak business investment and political uncertainties the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd slashed its global growth forecast for 2019 to a decade low 2 9 down from may s estimate of 3 2 and forecasted a subdued range of 2 9 to 3 through 2021 passage of the us mexico canada trade agreement which now appears more likely and a possible trade deal with china present upside risk to the projections for now though we see us growth decelerating next year gdp growth will average 0 9 in 2020 10 forest industry in the pacific northwest will plug along to the chagrin of landowners saw log prices continued to decline during most of 2019 giving sawmills some much needed room to increase profits with recovering yet still weak lumber demand increases we don t see that cost relief itself will bring new investment to the pnw sawmill set however a few new engineered wood plants have been announced which we expect will stimulate demand beyond 2020 the limiting factor in the pnw is log supply at a competitive price and it will continue to be a challenge for years to come or at least until if there is a drastic change in federal forest harvest policy about forest2market inc forest2market provides pricing data supply chain

gulf economies already strained by years of low oil prices face a double edged sword with the prospect of conflict with iran increasing oil prices while also threatening exports if the us killing of iranian general qasem suleimani on friday leads to conflict between washington and tehran oil facilities could be targeted in gulf states which also host us military bases including the headquarters of the us fifth fleet in bahrain observers say such a conflict might send oil prices above 100 a barrel but could also lead to a massive disruption of exports if iran closes the strait of hormuz a strategic waterway which serves as the main artery for middle east oil with iran vowing to retaliate there is an increased risk of attacks on oil facilities and other targets in the gulf states said m r raghu head of research at kuwait financial centre however high oil prices may not translate into higher revenues as over 20 percent of global oil supply is transported through the strait of hormuz which iran threatened to block in september drone and missile attacks on saudi aramco oil facilities in september blamed on iran slashed crude production from the world s top oil exporter by almost half and a string of attacks on vessels in the troubled waters of the gulf last year which washington and its allies blamed on iran also stoked fears for the security of global supply a major new disruption that led to lower production and exports and consequently lower revenues could cripple oil dependent regional economies gloomy outlook the oil price crash of mid 2014 cost gulf economies hundreds of billions of dollars with saudi suffering the most since then they have increased borrowing amid persistent budget deficits weak economic growth and lower foreign investment inflows in october the international monetary fund cut its forecasts for gulf economic growth in 2019 to just 0 7 percent down from 2 0 percent the previous year saudi arabia was pared to a meagre 0 2 percent over low oil prices production cuts and geopolitical tensions oil and gas income make up at least 70 percent of public revenues for the gulf cooperation council gcc states of bahrain kuwait oman qatar saudi arabia and the united arab emirates london based capital economics predicted that if iran succeeded in closing the strait of hormuz brent crude would jump to 150 a barrel it said however that the impact on other countries in the middle east and north africa would ultimately depend on whether they get directly caught up in the conflict many gulf countries emerged relatively unscathed and recorded rapid growth during and after the first gulf war in 1990 91 when oil exports were not disrupted given the variables the outlook for oil is difficult to pinpoint edward bell director of commodities research at emirates nbd uae s second largest bank believes oil prices over 100 a barrel are unlikely moving from a sort of 60 70 range to 70 80 a barrel range will be much more likely bell told afp even if the strait of hormuz was closed some gulf countries mainly saudi arabia and uae have alternative export routes on the red sea and the arabian sea oman lies outside hormuz but the saudi east west pipeline with a capacity to transport five million barrels a day to the red sea was hit by drones flown by yemen s iran backed huthis in the summer causing disruption for several days saudi economist fadhl al bouenain said a us iran war would further dampen economic growth in gcc states just as many of them are attempting to diversify towards a post oil future any restrictions to gulf countries ability to export oil would lead to a drop in their economic growth this will not be offset by higher oil prices bouenain told afp a conflict would increase risk premiums hit foreign direct investment flow into the region and make raising debt from overseas more expensive said raghu from kuwait financial centre if the strait of hormuz was blocked even for a few days it could decrease the ratings of gcc banks and sovereigns and dampen investor confidence s p ratings said in july 2020 afp
korean government extended 2 5 million for the enhancement of ocean university of sri lanka in 2017 file photo by dr ivan amarasinghe bsc hons phd mibiol cbiol introduction post independent sri lanka inherited an archaic system of limited vision and productivity within the fisheries and national aquatic resources exploitation policies of sri lanka while there were support agencies such as the fisheries department the national aquaculture resources r d agency nara and a few colleges of fisheries around the island teaching basic applied technology for fishermen and fishing boat navigation opportunities for ocean resources identification planning and exploitation were limited a new vision was born in october 2000 when new fisheries and aquatic resources development minister mahinda rajapaksa introduced the concept of a sagara vishwa vidyalaya an ocean university the dependence of our country on expensive international consultants and experts for national fisheries and aquatic resources development needed reappraisal our country had also spent vast sums of foreign exchange secured as international aid loans on unproductive and sometimes faulty and inappropriate development projects recommended by these foreign experts the unique way to alleviate such problems was to develop the national knowledgebase of the aquatic and ocean resources on a more holistic basis aimed at broader expertise on all ocean resources so that national capacity be optimised to international competence in addition to the ongoing dependence on foreign advisors for local development engagement in fisheries was constrained within the caste system whether it be the karaiar in the north or the karawes of the rest of the insular coastal belt there was a stark adherence to a caste based rigidly discriminatory coastal professional structure as an egalitarian national leader rajapaksa identified that a seat of learning of the highest calibre a university was a much needed first step not only to alleviate the above development problems but also create a more inclusive society sharing the ocean resources as a common heritage of the people than fisheries being the exclusive nametag of an underprivileged group within it the united nations convention on the law of the sea unclos and its relevance to sri lankan development through an ocean university unclos is an international treaty adopted and signed in 1982 at the end of almost 10 years of negotiations 1973 1982 it replaced the four geneva conventions which concerned the territorial sea and the contiguous zone the continental shelf the high seas fishing and conservation of living resources on the high seas unclos is the legal framework for global marine and maritime activities it defines the national boundaries of the ocean adjacent to a country these confines are not only lateral from the maritime coast to the deep seas but also vertically down to the seabed it allocates exclusive economic zones eezs for each country the convention came into effect in november 1994 currently 162 parties including the eu share its jurisdictions unclos itself was formulated through a un conference on the law of the sea in 1980 under the chairmanship of retired sri lankan civil servant hamilton shirley amerasinghe he was also chairman of the ad hoc committee on the indian ocean he proposed that the indian ocean be declared a zone of peace unclos and the efforts of amerasinghe at the conference rewarded the island of sri lanka with legal rights to an oceanic expanse that was 10 times larger than its land area it was granted an exclusive economic zone of 200 miles from the shores with a de facto responsibility of being the centre of the indian ocean as a zone of peace all these new developments through unclos affecting sri lanka and the indian ocean make the mahinda rajapaksa concept of an ocean university of sri lanka not only a relevant proposal but also a necessity knowing that 3 4th of the planet earth is covered by the oceans and that the unclos legally defines the extent of guardianship to allied oceanic states a centre of higher learning encompassing all affairs of the ocean is a necessary development the potential academic and consultative contributions for the betterment of states their maritime diplomatic relations conflict resolutions resources identification and sustainable exploitation would be immense unrealised opportunities and the need for reappraisal of development potentials former prime minister ranil wickremesinghe indirectly accepted the failure of his government on oceanic affairs at the second indian ocean conference in september 2017 colombo in his address he stated just a few hundred metres from temple trees is an ocean that is destined to define the future of the world sri lanka located enviably in the centre of the indian ocean is well poised to play a significant role in determining this future our shores are washed by the waters of this great ocean it has shaped us as a distinct people our future development is intrinsically linked to it and we share responsibility in keeping its waters safe we believe as people of the indian ocean peace progress and prosperity are goals that need to be pursued together despite these promising predictions intra trade in the indian ocean region including the bay of bengal remains low for example south asia remains the least economically integrated region in the world unlike the european and pacific nations there is an absence of political will to promote indian ocean economic cooperation more specifically trade liberalisation and connectivity trade and connectivity are central to achieving and maintaining a high regional growth rate there is no doubt that wickremesinghe would have declared that sri lanka is proud of the contribution that the ocean university is contributing towards his dream of the indian ocean towards peace progress and prosperity as goals pursued together if only mahinda rajapaksa s initiatives of sagara wishwa vidyalaya as an international holistic centre for studies research and dialogue been developed further under a ranil wickremesinghe government instead of being ignored wickremesinghe s own words are an indictment on the performance of his own government the mahinda rajapaksa concept of a sagara wishwa vidyalaya was a landmark in the history of global higher education two years following the rajapaksa concept of an ocean university for the people china instituted the first ocean university in 2002 by 2019 the ocean university of china became a front runner in the world while the ocean university of sri lanka sunk to abysmal levels of being 23 849th in international rankings this was far below even some of the private teaching institutes and colleges in sri lanka itself it is time to question as to why this globally exemplary higher education concept of mahinda rajapaksa failed miserably in his own country historical relationship between man and the ocean historically the oceans of the earth facilitated sailing to unknown lands for nations which sought friendly trade or subjugation and plunder of distant lands their resources and the people ancient chinese chronicles up to the seventh century denote regular visits by sri lankan known then as heladiva ships as trade vessels sri lankan chronicles mention heladiva as a seafaring nation much of it being along the silk route through the s e asian seas the europeans used the oceans for all the benefits that other seafaring nations sought while they are more noted for establishing their own empires around the globe through cunning adventure and subjugation of distant peoples the british empire was based on the spiritual presumption that at heaven s command britain arose from out the azure main this was the charter of the land and guardian angels sang this strain rule britannia rule the waves britons never will be slaves the message was very clear those who ventured out to the oceans would prosper the end of the empire gave birth to the commonwealth which continues the appraisal of natural resources of its members in patronage as commonwealth countries are endowed with immense and precious natural resources these include millions of square kilometres of ocean space significant renewable wind solar and non renewable resources oil gas minerals when managed equitably and sustainably the exploitation of natural resources bolsters national resilience to economic and social crises improving prosperity for all citizens thecommonwealth org oceans and natural resources it promises to provide technical assistance and support member countries in the development of policies laws design of fiscal regimes and strengthening national institutions as they seek to implement the sustainable development goals while such altruism is commended some member states are keen to be independent rather than be dependent on technical assistance and national policy formulations of external benefactors the first step to achieve success in such futuristic ventures is to establish a knowledgebase with relevant competence in scientific technology and capacity building to formulate robust national policy to derive the benefits of sustainable exploitation and management of the national resources as an island within the indian ocean sri lanka has to develop bilateral multilateral and global relations which should ensure diplomatic friendship for those who seek right of passage within its oceanic space post colonial sri lanka must develop a seat of learning which would be a fountain of multidisciplinary competence to achieve national prosperity and global appreciation in the above goals the creation of the sagara vishwa vidyalaya ocean university of sri lanka by mahinda rajapaksa was based on those principles evolution of universities from ivory tower philosophy to grass roots applicability universities were historically treated as ivory towers of philosophical thinking nalanda st andrews oxford and cambridge were meant for erudite philosophical spiritual advocacy with concurrent governance advice to the national leaders with gradual acceptance of the need for scientific learning and applicable technology for welfare and development of society universities moved forward from ivory tower exclusiveness to an egalitarian wide purpose national and global stakeholder three paradigm shifts from the traditional model of a university initiated by visionary political leaders 1 open university harold wilson concept of a university in the air the most radical change in university education came in 1969 under the concept of a university in the air named the open university by the then british prime minister rt harold wilson this model did not advocate a single campus based lecture room where a lecturer or professor was the sole teacher of a disciplinary subject or unit instead it used a headquarters where teams of excellently qualified and experienced professionals defined the course to be taught and the contents of each subject the main teaching relied on new technology through media the radio television and computers course units were produced through panels of academics who formed the course developers and managers with appropriate inputs from specialists across britain the units were distributed to the vast student population within britain and in far flung corners of the earth and the oceans where british citizens were employed as defence personnel or other civilian and trade missions regular radio and tv broadcasts formed a supplementary role the print course material received by students as a labour prime minister wilson expected to promote greater equality of opportunity for all and social mobility for those wishing to educate themselves at any stage of their lives to achieve success in life today the open university is the biggest university in britain with a student population of over 147 000 the ou won the categories of teaching excellence and digital innovation in 2018 many countries across the world including sri lanka have their own version of open universities now 2 colleges of technology to universities margaret thatcher concept of unification of the binary higher education model in 1992 british prime minister rt margaret thatcher revolutionised tertiary education in britain through her option of classification of reputed colleges of technology and polytechnics as universities vocational disciplines and applied research became the hallmarks of fame and fortune for these universities the newly empowered universities indeed surpassed the expectations of their early critics today some of these new universities are in the highest echelons of international academic ratings in addition they have offered vast opportunities to many thousands of british students who would otherwise have not had the opportunity of such entry to acclaimed universities the new universities excel in research and consultancy capacities the thatcher initiative has ensured vast foreign exchange earnings for britain through recruitment of foreign students to these hundreds of universities 3 colleges of fisheries and nautical engineering to an ocean university mahinda rajapaksa concept of a university for integrated management of the ocean resources the third visionary model of a university is built on the traditional foundation of university learning and certification of attainment with a mission to assess understand and benefit from a vast array of natural resources within a water body the ocean surrounding the island of sri lanka in the introduction above the rationale of mahinda rajapaksa to develop this new concept of a university within a defined global space with clear holistic objectives concerning the oceans and to identify opportunities for a deprived class of people were mentioned his vision was that of a statesman as well as that of a minister in search of optimal ministerial policies for the development of his country the vision of the ocean university as freedom independence and sovereignty are the fundamental underpinnings of post colonial developmental resurgence in an island surrounded by a vast ocean then freedom of thought through education independence in policy formulation and hallmarks of sovereignty should spring from a fountain of knowledge such as an ocean university that was the vision of fisheries and aquatic resources development former minister mahinda rajapaksa the mission of the ocean university the mission to achieve the envisioned goals of the proposed ocean university necessitated the short the medium and the long term plans of action as the goals were diverse and comprehensive phase 1 nifne as a precursor to the ocean university before an ocean university could be established with all essential infrastructure teaching and research facilities cabinet approval and financial aspects the minister established a national institute of fisheries and nautical engineering nifne in 1999 as a testing precursor to a future sagara vishwa vidyalaya the nifne recruited outside the national university entrance selection criteria and lowered the entrance requirements to encourage the youth and professionals of the fisheries community to academia initially less than were selected for the undergraduate degrees of b sc in fisheries sciences and nautical engineering teaching was from the nara campus on rented office and lecture rooms the presence of the reputed nara staff within reach encouraged the teaching of undergraduates lectures and practical exercises were conducted by the best professors and senior academics of various sri lankan universities invited on lucrative rates of payments regional colleges mentioned above conducted certificate and diploma courses in a range of fisheries and fishing vessel knowledge experienced vice chancellors of peradeniya and ruhuna universities with erudite professors and senior professionals representing the various allied government ministries departments and agencies comprised the governing council of the nifne challenging circumstances due to pressures from various unions as commonly seen in sri lanka delayed the progress the convocation for the first batch of graduates of the nifne was held in 2007 with mahinda rajapaksa now being the prime minister of sri lanka with felix perera as minister of fisheries and aquatic resources development very much similar to the upgrading of technological colleges to university status under the thatcher vision the rajapaksa concept incorporated the existing fisheries colleges to the ocean university the presence of the regional colleges of fisheries in jaffna trincomalee batticaloa tangalle galle mattakkuliya and negombo allowed a future usage of these as regional teaching bases on the distance education model of the open university of the uk phase 2 the establishment of the ocean university as a ugc approved ministry of higher education partnered national entity in 2014 the ocean university of sri lanka was formally established under the act no 31 the university grants commission ugc of sri lanka approved degree awarding status as university four undergraduate degree programs in the fields of marine science and nautical engineering were approved the ocean university also continued the previous activities of the nifne to offer diplomas and certificate level courses and mobile programs these were essentially treated as national technical vocational certificates to enhance the fisheries and coastal sector performance degree courses b sc in fisheries and marine science b sc in marine engineering b sc in transportation management and logistics b sc in coastal and marine resources management approved by the university grants commission diploma courses underwater cutting and welding aquaculture and management course certificate courses 1 diving welding and floating vessels mechanic cdc certification is approved the change of government of sri lanka following the election of the present president and the cabinet dominated by the unf in 2015 led to a virtual standstill of the progress of the newly established university the vision of an ocean university with multidisciplinary teaching research and training which served all stakeholders of the ocean resources appears to have evaporated the university has been assigned as a minor appendage assigned to vocational training and skills development within a multiagency ministry of industry and commerce resettlement of protracted displaced persons co operative development vocational training and skills development china the winner and sri lanka the loser when the rajapaksa seminal proposal of 1998 for a holistic academic and technological delivery befitting an ocean university was made there were no other such ocean universities around the world many countries such as norway japan and china had colleges of fisheries education some countries including sri lanka had departments of fisheries education oceanography maritime science etc within different faculties of universities apart from the rajapaksa vision of the 1990s to establish an ocean university china is the only country with a vision to follow suit china upgraded its shandong college of oceanology to ocean university of quingdao chairman deng xiaoping wrote the name of the university 青岛海洋大学 in his own calligraphic style to mark the occasion and in october 2002 it was officially established as the ocean university of china under the direct administration of the state ministry of education moe ocean university of china ouc is now a national key comprehensive university with particular strengths in oceanography and fisheries science ouc offers courses in science engineering agronomy fisheries pharmaceutics economics management liberal arts law education history and art there are 17 colleges and one teaching centre for fundamental courses and one department of social sciences ouc boasts 12 post doctoral research programs 81 academic disciplines majors authorised to offer doctorate degrees 193 disciplines majors for masters degrees and 69 undergraduate programs ouc is the cradle of china s marine professionals and it has graduated a large number of competent specialists in marine science for china 70 of ph d holders in oceanography and fisheries in china graduated from ouc the first scientist to reach the south pole the first chinese scientist to investigate the south pole were from the ouc while the ocean university of china ouc went from strength to strength and diversified the courses and degrees while making landmarks in global oceanic research the ocean university of sri lanka ocusl has virtually reverted to its nifne status this is reflected in the international university ranking too the five top 10 universities in sri lanka are peradeniya 1 981 colombo 2 023 moratuwa 2 495 ruhuna 2 853 sri jayawardenapura 2 960 jaffna 4 296 rajarata 4 383 open 4 629 and sabaragamuwa 4 894 in international rankings ocean university of china ranks at 697 while the ocean university of sri lanka ranks at 23 849 this indicates an abject failure or wilful destruction of the eminent mahinda rajapaksa chinthanaya the losses due to such failure are to sri lanka and its people case studies worthy of appraisal at an ocean university for sri lanka singapore is often cited as an example of how a small peninsular state can reach the highest levels of national development and per capita income with a thriving ocean based international hub of trade it will be useful for countries such as sri lanka to study the oceanic contributions to such developments and advice the government on an appropriate pathway to emulate viet nam offers an example of a recently independent and fast developing country which needs application of unclos to assert its independence on the national territorial waters viet nam also has to engage in diplomatic dialogue with global superpowers such as china and the usa who seek to use vietnamese south china sea as an area of chinese as well as us american regions of global interests recently china renewed interests in the ancient silk route renamed as the belt and road initiative bri bri is essential for the global development strategy adopted by china to facilitate infrastructure development and investments in 152 countries and international organisations in asia europe africa the middle east and the americas the us treats the same route as essential for their asia pacific and asia atlantic interests the problems that viet nam faces in recent times in exercise of its legal rights within its territorial waters due to these complex demands can be detrimental to its international trading peace and welfare similarly recent increase of chinese and us interests declared in sri lanka and within the unclos designated territorial waters of sri lanka need cautious handling through erudite appraisal the ocean university of sri lanka should offer an international centre for diplomatic and erudite contributions through a centre for international maritime trade and peace dialogue recommendations for a future government a new team of competent academics entrepreneurs administrators will be appointed to restore the ideals set out in the mahinda rajapaksa concept of an ocean university of sri lanka new university courses aimed at occupational and entrepreneurial aspects with delivery in new occupational and business opportunities shall be prioritised expatriate academics professionals and entrepreneurs and international diplomats must be invited to contribute with relevant new ideas teaching and other relevant assistance wider educational attainments research opportunities leading to international advisory consultancy opportunities shall be created opportunities for global bilateral and multilateral dialogue partners as erudite and competent specialists in the following subjects shall be introduced to produce professionals urgently needed for ocean based activities such as laws of the sea coastal and deep sea defence and security shipping transport logistics ports and oceanic supplies to ships on the silk route fisheries exploitation in co operation with neighbouring states oceanography coastal and sea bed mineral resources shipbuilding ports and harbours construction regional and international trading coastal tourism climate change and its effects on coastal communities and coastal businesses coast conservation safety on the coast and the ocean ocean generic natural disasters and mitigation oceanic wave energy conversion to electrical energy n b the above and a myriad other ocean and coastal nationally lucrative developments that have not been realised so far in sri lankan universities must be introduced the elimination of the globally archaic binary system of education replete with the thatcherite objectives of university delivery leading to direct tangible benefits to the people and the country shall be advocated the wilson concept of distance education in its open university model shall be introduced so that all people of the country will feel inclusive within the society in opportunities to better themselves through the ocean university this will be a blessing to the poor regional stakeholders as local centres will assist them those who a missed a higher education b wish to be at the cutting edge of academia and technology while in employment or c are socially handicapped should be encouraged to derive maximum benefit through regional based colleges radio and tv broadcasts teaching with one to one teaching assistance and care for handicapped students around the country will be commenced those qualifying from the ocean university shall be guided to postgraduate opportunities those needing special assistance in learning will be guided for success by specialist advisory teams a team of competent academics professionals of all ocean based interests and activities including entrepreneurs on oceanic resources exploitation and relevant government departments will assess all present university activities and summarise which types of new courses degrees and research must be prioritised for the next stage in the progress of the ocean university in its long term mission attainments for this an understanding of the successful courses at the ouc may recommended the existing academic board and the governing council should be consulted individually so as to collate their ideas for future progress new courses as recommended in 1 above must be launched through utilisation of national and international teachers partnerships with foreign national universities with specialist competence to develop new courses and research programmes must be sought a five year plan of resurrection to the rajapaksa vision of a sagara wishwa vidyalaya will be developed the sooner a future government restores the esteemed and valuable potentials expected of a multidisciplinary ocean university the better it shall be for a return to the development of sri lanka expected delivery of benefits to the people and the state vast numbers of new employment opportunities for all sri lankans in a vast array of above activities such as coastal and deep sea resources exploitation offering of international services such as marine defence services to international clients will be consolidated through studies and education at a ocusl coastal and oceanic tourism exploration and production of ocean resources within sri lankan extended economic zone eez are other projected advantages the national problem of electricity generation can be solved through the use of oceanic wave energy wave energy is clean energy recommended by the global scientific community and climate change experts our continued use of fossil fuel to produce electrical energy is environmentally destructive enhances climate change problems and drains the national foreign exchange reserves the eight colleges positioned on the coastal belt of the island could be used as training and graduation centres for certificate courses at university level for example each college can commence courses of three to six month duration suitable for service in the tourism industry these may be developed in conjunction with the ministry of tourism and the private hotels sector within three to five years this will not only produce excellent service personnel for the sri lankan tourist industry but also for service in other countries that will boost the economy in billions of dollars international accreditation of such personnel will enhance the reputation of sri lanka as well as attract foreign students for such courses there are a vast number of such courses in many disciplines which once initiated will attract much needed foreign exchange earnings to sri lanka coastal storage facilities such as those of the oil tanks complex in trincomalee can be used not only to store future petroleum reserves for the country but also as a facility for international distribution and allied logistics the economic enrichment to the country through such a facility will exceed those of singapore prospecting natural mineral deposits such as ilmenite and deep sea petroleum exploration and their sustainable exploitation will be taught with cutting edge research and technology at the ocean university there are signs of vast deposits of yet unexplored or exploited cobalt within the sri lankan territorial waters instead of selling our national oceanic resources at extremely cheap prices e g ilmenite over the last five decades sri lanka can develop its own technologists through the ocean university thereby being capable of deriving the best capacity and economic benefits for sri lanka attraction of foreign direct investments from potential partners for such technological entrepreneurship in sri lanka will benefit local capacity excellence as well as national economic development the training of coastal tourist specialists as well as in hotel service staff will benefit the country and be a source of internationally recognised school of tourism studies and training accredited at reputed university diploma and certificate levels if a multinational and multilingual facility can be developed the ocean university of sri lanka may attract global trainees wishing to qualify in various aspects of coastal and oceanic tourism billions of dollars and other foreign exchange earnings to sri lanka through foreign student and scholar recruitment foreign ocean based job opportunities conferences and enhanced tourism will be tangible benefits of such activities through the ocusl enhancing the maritime defence services this will generate a vast income if sri lanka can continue to supply global maritime defence personnel and security services as done in the pre 2015 years earnings through port supplies and services may well exceed those enjoyed by such countries as singapore the new hambantota port as well as the ancient traditional port of galle renowned over thousands of years with oceanic silk route vessels should aim at such services through accredited professionals of the ocusl enhanced international reputation for sri lanka and sri lankans with the ocean university as a global hub on ocean affairs there are some eminent sri lankan professionals on ocean affairs presently employed as expatriates in various countries inviting them to serve the motherland would give vast strength to develop the ocean university to international reputation public private entrepreneurships encouraged through an ocean university will benefit sri lanka in a multitude of ocean associated enterprises final conclusion based on the above discourse and collection of factual data a team may be able to forecast the economic trade and employment enhancement contribution over the next five year period by a properly instituted ocean university based on the conceptual model of the vision of mahinda rajapaksa the calculated forecast figures should be broadcast to the public as soon as possible so that the public realises the value of returning sri lanka to prosperity the
