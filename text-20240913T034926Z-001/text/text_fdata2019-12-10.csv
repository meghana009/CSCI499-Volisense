saxo bank a leading facilitator of capital markets products has released its 10 outrageous predictions for 2020 which focus on a series of unlikely events which if they were to occur could send shockwaves across financial markets while these predictions do not constitute saxo s official market forecasts for 2020 they represent a warning of a potential misallocation of risk among investors who typically see just a one percent likelihood to these events materialising it s an exercise in considering the full extent of what is possible even if not necessarily probable inevitably the outcomes that prove the most disruptive and therefore outrageous are those that are a surprise to consensus steen jakobsen chief economist at saxo bank said this year s outrageous predictions all play to the theme of disruption because our current paradigm is simply at the end of the road not because we want it to end but simply because extending the last decade s trend into the future would mean a society at war with itself markets replaced by governments monopolies as the only business model and an utterly partisan and a highly fragmented and polarised public debate it s an environment where negative yields are now used to discriminate against access to mortgages for low income households the elderly and students as regulatory capital requirement demands make credit hurdles too high for that group to get credit instead they rent at twice the price of owning a tax on the poor if ever there was one and a driver of inequality this in turn risks leaving an entire generation without the savings needed to own their own house typically the only major asset that many medium and lower income households will ever obtain thus we are denying the very economic mechanism that made the older generations wealthy and risk driving a permanent generational wealth gap he added we see 2020 as a year where at nearly every turn disruption of the status quo is an overriding theme the year could represent one big pendulum swing to opposites in politics monetary and fiscal policy and not least the environment in politics this would mean the sudden failure of populism replaced by commitments to heal instead of to divide in policymaking it could mean that central banks step aside and maybe even slightly normalise rates while governments step into the breach with infrastructure and climate policy linked spending he explained headline summaries of the outrageous predictions 2020 1 reversal of fortune cuts gold to oil price ratio in half gold begins 2020 hoping that a historic new move higher was set in motion in 2019 as global central banks mobilised maximum policy support for their weakening economies and drove real yields lower and even nominal yields into negative territory for entire yield curves in the most extreme cases precious metals rushed higher on the reduction of the cost of carry technicians also celebrated the four year range bound limbo ending with a bang in the crude oil market meanwhile the concerns driving gold higher drove oil lower this was mostly down to signs of weakening demand growth from slower gdp growth rates as well as fears that longer term demand may dry up on trade wars and the electrification of cars added pressure on prices came from the supply side amid surging us production and concerns that opec and russia may struggle to sustain production cuts speculators continued to build short positions into late 2019 in the belief that the direction of least resistance lay to the downside in 2020 the tables are turned on both markets the gold market rally fizzles out as global central banks ease off the gas on further policy in a grand admission of the policy error of negative rates as bond investors smell a general policy shift towards mmt inspired fiscal stimulus long bond yields rise steeply the shift reduces interest in holding non yielding assets like gold as investors scramble to invest in companies with pricing power and any asset set to absorb fiscal outlays overextended gold longs are ill prepared for the narrative shift and gold prices are crushed back into the price limbo below 1300 opec and russia sensing a slowdown in u s shale oil production seize the opportunity and announce a major additional cut to their oil production the timing also coincides with the next round of aramco s ipo which helps to ensure the desired valuation from investors outside the kingdom the market is caught off guard and the scramble to cover shorts while adding fresh longs eventually sees wti crude oil return to 85 b the gold ratio is halved from its 2019 high of 30 down to 15 2 the sudden arrival of stagflation rewards value over growth the ishares mscci world value factor etf leaves the fangs in the dust outperforming them by 25 per cent the world has now come full circle from the end of the bretton woods system when it effectively shifted from a gold based usd to a pure fiat usd system with trillions of dollars borrowed into existence not only in the us but all over the world each credit cycle has required ever lower rates and greater doses of stimulus to prevent a total seizure in the us and global financial system with rates at their effective lower bound and the us running enormous and growing deficits the incoming us recession will require the fed to super size its balance sheet beyond imagination to finance massive new trump fiscal outlays to bolster infrastructure in hopes of salvaging his election chances but a strange thing happens wages and prices rise sharply as the stimulus works its way through the economy ironically due to the under capacity in resources and skilled labour from prior lack of investment rising inflation and yields in turn spike the cost of capital putting zombie companies out of business as weaker debtors scramble for funding globally the usd suffers an intense devaluation as the market recognises that the fed will only accelerate its balance sheet expansion while keeping its policy rate punitively low 3 ecb folds and hikes rates european banks on the comeback trail as the eurostoxx bank index rises 30 per cent in 2020 despite the recent introduction of the tiering system which has helped to mitigate the negative consequences of negative rates banks are still facing a major crisis they are confronted with a challenging economic and financial environment marked by structurally ultra low rates an increase in regulation with basel iv which will further reduce the banks roe and competition from fintech companies in niche markets in an unprecedented turn of events in early january 2020 the new president of the ecb christine lagarde who has previously endorsed negative rates executes a volte face and declares that monetary policy has overreached its limits she points out that maintaining negative deposit interest rates for a longer period could seriously harm the soundness of the european banking sector in order to force euro area governments and notably germany to step in and to use fiscal policy to stimulate the economy the ecb reverses its monetary policy and hikes rates on january 23 2020 this first hike is followed by another a short time later that quickly takes the policy rate back to zero and even slightly positive before year end 4 in energy green is not the new black the ratio of the vde fossil fuel energy etf to icln a renewable energy etf jumps from 7 to 12 the oil and gas industry came roaring out of the financial crisis after 2009 returning some 131 per cent from 2008 until the peak in june 2014 as china pulled the world economy out of its historic credit led recession since then the industry has been hurt by two powerful forces the first was the advent of us shale gas and rapid strides in globalising natural gas supply chains via lng then came the us shale oil revolution which saw the us become the world s largest oil and petroleum liquids producer the second force has been the increasing political and popular capital behind fighting climate change causing a massive surge in demand for renewable energy the combined forces of lower prices and investors avoiding the black energy sector have pushed the equity valuation on traditional energy companies to a 23 per cent discount to clean energy companies in 2020 we see the tables turning for the investment outlook as opec extends production cuts unprofitable us shale outfits slow output growth and demand rises from asia once again and not only will the oil and gas industry be a surprising winner in 2020 the clean energy industry will simultaneously suffer a wake up call 5 south africa electrocuted by eskom debt usdzar rises from 15 to 20 as the world cuts credit lines to south africa the very bad news is the south african government announcement late this year that in order to continue to bail out troubled utility eskom and keep the nation s lights on the budget next year is projected to balloon to its worst in over a decade at 6 5 per cent of gdp a sharp deterioration after the government managed to stabilise finances at a near constant 4 per cent of gdp for the last few years worse still the world bank estimates that its external debt has more than doubled over that period to over 50 per cent of gdp the eskom fiasco may be the straw that will break the back of creditors willingness to continue funding a country that hasn t had its financial or governance house in order for decades other uncreditworthy ems will be drawn into the abyss as well in 2020 with the most differentiated performance across em economies in years the country teeters toward default 6 us president trump announces america first tax to reduce trade deficit a tax on all foreign derived revenue scrambles supply lines and spikes inflation us 10 year inflation protected treasuries yield 6 per cent in 2020 thanks to a rush of investor interest as the cpi rises the year 2020 starts with reasonable stability on the trade policy front after the trump administration and china manage at least a temporary détente on tariffs currency policy and purchases of agricultural goods but early in 2020 the us economy struggles for air and us trade deficits with china fail to materially improve while chinese purchases of agricultural products can t realistically increase further eyeing polls showing a resounding defeat in the 2020 us presidential election trump quickly grows restive and his administration drums up a new approach in a last ditch effort to steal back the protectionist narrative the america first tax under the terms of this tax the us corporate tax schedule is completely reconstructed to favour us based production under the claimed principles of fair and free trade the plan cancels all existing tariffs and instead slaps a flat value added tax of 25 per cent on all gross revenues in the us market that are sourced from foreign production this brings stinging protests from trading partners for what are really just old tariffs in new clothes but the administration counters that foreign companies are welcome to shift their production to the us to avoid the tax 7 sweden breaks bad a massive and pragmatic attitude shift washes over sweden as it gets to work to better integrate its immigrants and overstretched social services driving a huge fiscal stimulus and steep rally in sek as often seems the case in swedish policymaking just as they took progressive taxation too far and collapsed the economy in the early 90 s they have now taken political correctness on immigration so far that they have become politically incorrect they are ignoring the large and growing contingent of swedes who are questioning that policy shutting them out of the debate a parliamentary democracy should allow all groups of reasonable size a voice in the debate but the traditional main parties of sweden have taken the unusual collective decision to ignore the anti immigration voice which has grown to represent more than 25 per cent of the swedish voters the justification and intentions were good openness and equality for all and safeguarding the swedish open economic model but anything taken too far can overwhelm and to survive all models need to be able to change when facts change the other nordic countries now talk of sweden conditions as a threat not as a model of best practice sweden is now in recession and with its small open economy status is extremely sensitive to the global slowdown this sense of crisis social and economic will create a mandate for change 8 democrats win a clean sweep in the us 2020 election driven by women and millennials the 2020 us election puts the democrats in control of the presidency and both houses of congress big healthcare and pharma stocks collapse 50 per cent the polls going into 2020 don t look promising for trump and neither does the electorate the marginal trump voter in 2016 and in 2020 is old and white a demographic that is fading in relative terms as the largest generation in the us now is the maturing millennial generation of 20 40 year olds a far more liberal demographic millennials and even the oldest of generation z in the us have become intensely motivated by the injustices and inequality driven by central bank asset market pumping and fears of climate change where president trump is the ultimate lightning rod for rebellion as a climate change denier the vote on the left is thoroughly rocked by dislike of trump with suburban women and millennials showing up to express their revulsion for trump the democrats win the popular vote by over 20 million grow their control of the house and even narrowly take the senate medicare for all and negotiations for drug pricing bring a massive haircut to the industry s profitability 9 hungary leaves the eu hungary has been an impressive economic success since it joined the eu in 2004 but the 15 year marriage now seems in trouble after the eu initiated an article 7 procedure against the country citing hungary s or really pm orbán s ever tighter restrictions on free media judges academics minorities and rights groups the push back from hungary s leadership is that the country is only protecting itself mainly protecting its culture from mass immigration it s an unsustainable status quo and the two sides will find it tough to reconcile in 2020 as the article 7 procedure moves slowly through the eu system pm orbán is even openly talking about how hungary is a blood brother with the renegade turkey as opposed to a part of the rest of europe a big shift in rhetoric a change of tone which coincides with eu transfers all but disappearing over the next two years hungary s currency the forint huf is on the back foot and reaches a much weaker level of 375 in eurhuf terms as the markets fear the disengagement or reversal of capital flows as eu companies reconsidered their investment in hungary 10 asia launches new reserve currency in move away from us dollar dependence an asian aiib backed digital reserve currency takes the us dollar index down by 20 per cent and tanks the us dollar 30 per cent versus gold to confront a deepening trade rivalry and vulnerabilities from rising us threats to weaponise the us dollar and its control of global finances the asian infrastructure investment bank creates a new reserve asset called the asian drawing right or adr with 1 adr equivalent to 2 us dollars making the adr the world s largest currency unit the move is clearly aimed at de dollarising regional trade local economies multilaterally agree to begin conducting all trade in the region in adrs only with major oil exporters russia and the opec nations happy to sign up due to their growing reliance on the asian market the redenomination of a sizable chunk of global trade away from the us dollar leaves the us ever shorter of the inflows needed to fund its twin deficits the usd weakens 20 per cent versus the adr within months and 30 per cent

paul volcker the former federal reserve chairman often called tall paul for his 6 7 stature is dead at 92 volcker played an outsized role in shifting the prevailing economic model from one dominated by labor to one dominated by capital as mark blyth put it in a recent talk the late 1970s and early 1980s the rise of the independent central banker which volcker exemplified was a core element in the economic regime change after the moneyed classes saw workers as being too empowered and revolted his fixation with reducing inflation favored investors over workers and lowered labor s wage share of gdp as as we ll see volcker sought to achieve that end it took me quite some time to get a better perspective on volcker i was imprinted by the wall street of 1981 when volcker was in the midst of implementing what he d billed as a money supply experiment in order to wring inflation out of the system the fed money supply figures were announced every thursday at 4 00 pm after the market had closed then at 3 00 pm even on the investment banking floors someone would inevitably hover around the quotron machine and would broadcast the latest money supply increases and whatever the hot takes there were on what it meant at the peak of his money supply experiment banks were hemorrhaging losses on their credit card portfolios which yielded only 19 when it cost 22 to fund them the economy went into a steep slide the worst since the great depression securities firms like goldman were also suffering the institutional sales force both equities and fixed income was crying for lucrative new issues but few companies who didn t have to wanted to sell shares in the death of equities era nor did they want to issue bonds at prevailing rates of 13 to 15 structures with tax advantages like zero coupon bonds and debt for equity swaps became popular volcker relented in august 1982 i recall the word going through the firm like lightening that the fed was going to ease up there was no news announcement primary deals apparently got the signal from the new york fed s trading desk later write ups of this era suggested that volcker wanted to persist even longer but that the latin american sovereign debt crisis and the very real risk of us bank failures recall that that serial near bankrupt citibank was looking wobbly stayed his hand that august was the beginning of long disinflationary period that ended in may 2007 it gave a huge tailwind to financial asset prices and helped make the new neoliberal model of denying workers real income gains but letting them binge on debt as a way to increase their standard of living palatable it was also a major driving force for financialization which is increasingly decried by economists as a negative for growth no wonder bankers revere volcker ironically economists have deemed the volcker and parallel thatcher money supply experiments to be failures contrary to the persistent myth making of milton friedman money supply changes and lagged ones correlated with no macroeconomic variable so it may not come as a surprise that william grieder found in his classic the secrets of the temple that volcker may have suspected as much greider provided evidence that volcker was using money supply targets as an a cover to let interest rates rise vastly higher than would have been deemed sane he had stuck with the traditional central bank approach of targeting interest rates another telling greider tidbit was that during the time when volcker was driving interest rates to the moon volcker would keep a notecard in a jacket pocket that tracked weekly construction wages volcker saw getting them to decline as a key metric that his policies were succeeding he intoned i want unions to get the message some experts such as warren mosler point out that the underlying inflationary trends were dissipating even before volcker launched his money jihad as shown by oil prices peaking in 1979 recall that volcker became fed chairman in 1979 and started implementing the volcker shock of constraining money supply in march 1980 thus there is a case to be made that inflation would have abated particularly since the key practice that had helped reinforce it widespread formal and informal cost of living adjustments had been abandoned or weakened the suddenness of volcker turning off his kill the economy to save it initiative wound up seriously damaging us manufacturers mind you they had been feeling considerable heat from germany and japan in the 1970s i recall a sense of despair and even desperation in the business press and among my business school colleagues i went to hbs from 1979 to 1981 about the decline of us competitiveness some of it was that many us manufacturers particularly automakers were saddled with old plant that was less efficient than that of the foreign upstarts germany and japan also had better infrastructure thanks to post world war ii reconstruction that isn t to say that far too many us companies were also afflicted with sclerotic management there are famous stories from that era of gm execs having no idea how bad the company s cars were because they d be babied every day by mechanics while they were at the office big us manufacturers also often saw themselves as victims of unions who protected slough off workers that picture was challenges when toyota in a famed joint venture with general motors called nummi took over the operation of gm s worst factory which it had shuttered in 1982 its workers had regularly called in sick or showed up drunk toyota re hired the 85 of the former employees and let the union play a role in choosing managers toyota got the factory s output to the average quality level of then widely recognized as way better toyota plants but the aftershocks of the volcker experiment put floundering us manufacturers on a faster decline from which most never recovered the dollar strengthened considerably and rapidly which gave foreign manufactures a price advantage in the 30 months of the super strong dollar us automakers lost market share sharply and they never got it back the impact was so strong that even the supposed free marketer reagan administration was able to secure the plaza accord of 1985 a coordinated g 5 effort to push the dollar down and in particular the yen up volcker remained an uber inflation hawk arguing for decades after his leadership of the fed for zero inflation an idea that would have most orthodox economists eyes rolling even though economists dislike inflation they loathe deflation if you accept the premise that the central bank is using interest rates to manipulate growth zero gives you nowhere to go if you think you need to drop rates in a crisis the us unlike europe remains allergic to the idea of negative interest rates and we ve explained elsewhere why this is a sound view mind you mmt advocates also favor zero interest rates but their approach is radically different they don t want money to play a role in managing the economy they want to use a job guarantee to provide a floor for labor prices and help assure sound development and use fiscal spending to further regulate activity by contrast volcker was also adamantly opposed to deficit spending volcker also stood for skepticism of bankers and his belief in the need for strong regulation particularly of consumer products he was vehemently opposed to money market funds recognizing as the crisis demonstrated to be correct that consumers would incorrectly treat them as equivalent to government guaranteed deposits he also didn t like that money market funds made it harder for the fed to control credit money market funds are big holders of commercial paper which provide short term funding for corporations and later off balance sheet vehicles he also pooh poohed financial services claims of adding special value saying that the last innovation he d seen in banking was the atm volcker s brand image as a strict regulator led obama to include him in campaign events in his 2008 run leading many to assume that obama would make volcker his treasury secretary one scenario was that volcker would serve only for a year until the financial system was stabilized and then hand off the job obama s bait and switch with geithner showed where the incoming president stood on bank and if you had any doubts obama added insult to injury by relegating volcker to heading a do nearly nothing committee but the idea that volcker was actually tough on banks is considerably exaggerated consider for instance our write up of a 2010 volcker speech widely depicted as blistering unfortunately the reactions to volcker s speech say far more about politics and pr in the us than they do about what he actually said volcker s comments were delivered in a moderate occasionally perplexed tone he was often candid and descriptive far from blistering and despite the wall street journal headline volcker spares no one in broad critique in fact he left many targets untouched bank pay accounting chicanery free market ideology cognitive capture of regulators and the revolving door between regulatory positions and lucrative private sector roles predatory behavior by financial firms in fact volcker was a defender of traditional commercial banks noting that they have special role via acting as depositaries and payment services and complaining of how money market funds were encroaching on their turf and providing similar functions without having the same degree of oversight and capital requirements he also spent a fair bit of his talk extolling the fed as the logical party to serve as the lead financial regulator while somehow missing that the central bank did a horrific job in the runup to the crisis and is chock full of monetary economists who have no interest in financial firms inner workings indeed volcker actually said and i am not making this up that the mess in the economy was not the result of the financial crisis his formulation is rather astonishing he depicts the financial crisis as the result of real economy imbalances as opposed to the build up of speculative excesses in a grossly undercaptialized tightly coupled financial system starts at 9 30 but in saying that i don t mean to blame the crisis on the regulators or even on the market i mean this crisis got so serious it s so difficult to get out of this recession because of disequilibrium in the real economy you know the story when the bubble in housing burst then the financial system came under great pressure you don t blame it for originating the crisis in fact under pressure it broke huh the idea that the real economy distortions produced the crisis as opposed to deregulation led to excessive leverage in financial firms and were the primary cause of distortions in the real economy is barmy contrast volcker s take with that of meryvn king governor of the bank of england in a 2009 speech two years ago scotland was home to two of the largest and most respected international banks both are now largely state owned sir walter scott would have been mortified by these events writing in 1826 under the pseudonym of malachi malagrowther he observed that not only did the banks dispersed throughout scotland afford the means of bringing the country to an unexpected and almost marvellous degree of prosperity but in no considerable instance save one have their own over speculating undertakings been the means of interrupting that prosperity banking has not been good for the wealth of the scottish and it should be said almost any other nation recently over the past year almost six million jobs have been lost in the united states over 2 ½ million in the euro area and over half a million in the united kingdom our national debt is rising rapidly not least as the consequence of support to the banking system we shall all be paying for the impact of this crisis on the public finances for a generation to put none too fine a point on it king is the top central banker an a country where financial services constitutes a bigger proportion of gdp than the us yet he does not hesitate to place blame for the crisis where it belongs on the banks and he is willing to eat crow for regulatory lapses volcker by contrast offers a critique which is hardly controversial yet gives the industry a pass similarly volcker was hauled out of mothballs to press for what is now called the volcker rule only after the administration was on the back foot as a result of losing the old ted kennedy seat in massachusetts to scott brown ending the democrats filibuster proof majority the administration wasn t keen to have him give even comparatively mild criticism of financiers while it was laboring mightily to bail them out while not reforming them and the geithner treasury was not all that happy with the narrow restriction of the volcker rule volcker s idea of limiting bank proprietary trading was sound but as we discussed at length at the time trying to separate customer trading from other trades was a flawed way to go about it a financial firm will often take on a large position from a customer because it can do so at a good price if it flattens its position relatively quickly which is what the volcker rule would want it to do it s perverse to look favorably to selling to customers as opposed to other professional traders we argued based on input from former in house risk managers that this was one place where the notorious value at risk model would give regulators a good handle on whether a financial firm was holding unduly large as in presumed speculative positions part of volcker s stature was due to his famously modest one might even say cheap habits and his personal integrity he stayed at the fed even though he was nursing a wife dying of cancer people on wall street at the time thought he might quit because the chairman s salary wouldn t buy much in the way of nursing care volcker was also slow to cash out and even when he did he became the chairman of the boutique investment bank wolfensohn co headed by former salomon brothers partner later world bank head james wolfensohn i have no doubt he could have landed a much more lucrative post had he wanted to i met volcker first on an over 90 degree day when i was in a t shirt and jeans in a vegetable market around the corner from my apartment he was wearing a suit and tie and carrying a very worn denim bag i approached him and told him i remembered from my days at goldman how everyone had hung on the money supply announcement he seemed pleased to have been recognized and politely said i was too young for that i didn t keep him much longer i next saw him at one of amar bhide s book parties a very small gathering volcker was expected to make only a brief appearance but stayed for about half an hour oddly he wound up seated alone for a stretch with no one talking to him i went over a chatted him up feeling it was wrong for him to be neglected like that we discussed some recent news although for the life of me i can t recall what precisely i ran into him again at some inet conferences and engaged him briefly at each and also saw him speak an the atlantic economy summit this when one of the budget debates was a hot topic and volcker moralized about the horrors of debt spending i had gotten sufficiently better versed in macroeconomics to be disappointed volcker s starchy manner lack of pretentiousness and skepticism of bank claims of virtue made him old school but he played a central role in ushering a brave new world that was nevertheless better for financiers and rentiers than everyone else

at the end of last year it stood at 45 3 the expectations component was even stronger jumping to 10 7 from 2 1 it is the second gain in a row and the third in the past four months it is the highest since february 2018 often it seems the performance of the dax is helps investor sentiment in germany and we note that it has strung together a three month 10 advance in the last three months france

efforts to reform government pensions italy disappointed industrial output contracted by 0 3 and the 2 4 decline on a work day adjusted year over year basis is the most of the year the poorer economic performance aggravates the tensions within the governing coalition the uk published several economic reports today but are being overshadowed by thursday s election first october s gdp was flat which was a bit disappointing after the 0 1 contraction in september services were up more than expected 0 2 vs flat in september but this was blunted by weaker than expected industrial output 0 1 after 0 3

the largest decline since january 2018 economists had been looking for around a 0 2 decline the takeaway is that the uk economy remains soft and the pressure on the bank of england to ease policy will likely increase next year recall carney is to step down by the end of january and that means among the first things his successor may have to do is deliver a cut the euro has edged slightly higher and

3130 america important pieces fell into place yesterday that make passage of the usmca a strong likelihood trade representative lighthizer presented the compromise that he struck with pelosi to his mexican counterpart seade and apparently after some haggling a deal was reached the head of the largest union federation in the us the afl cio gave his endorsement the next lighthizer and kushner will return to mexico to sign off on the agreement and canada s deputy prime minister freeland who as foreign minister helped negotiate the deal will also join them we share two observations first updating nafta was needed and could have been accomplished if the us would have remained in the tpp trans pacific partnership second the impact on the us economy is minimal and mostly from the lifting of the uncertainty the us non partisan internationa trade commission forecast the agreement would boost the us economy by about 0 35 and add about 176k jobs over six years it is a win win for the president and the democrats the usmca was a priority of the administration and this is a moderate measure when the left wing of the party is wrestling for control it is not certain that the bureaucratic elements of the implementing legislation will be approved by the end of the year but it could and if not now then early next year separately today marks the end of the terms of two of the remaining three appellate judges at the wto three are needed for a ruling this jeopardizes the conflict resolution process the wto has two broad lines of business the first is promoting global trade agreements but this has been bogged down the second was the adjudication of disputes which was an improvement over its predecessor gatt general agreement on tariffs and trade one source of strains the wto arguably comes from trying to incorporate china which joined 18 years ago tomorrow although some argue that the wto is not equipped to cope with china in december 2001 when many observers feared the end of globalization after 9 11 china joining the wto was heralded as a success separately the us has been critical of what it regards as judicial over reach by the wto and this goes back to at least the obama administration at the same time it is noteworthy that the us wins the vast majority of cases it brings to the wto the economic calendar is light today the only reports to note are the us productivity and unit labor cost measures which are derived from the gdp data and typically do not move the market the federal reserve meets tomorrow no one expects a change in policy and the updated economic forecast will likely dominate the investors interests brazil s central bank also meets tomorrow and is widely expected to deliver another 50 bp cut in the selic rate to 4 5 it would be the fourth cut in h2 this year the us dollar is consolidating in the upper end of the range set at the end of last week against the canadian dollar on the back of the conflicting employment reports support near cad1 3230 has frayed a bit but it has not been convincingly violated a break of cad1 3220 would likely signal a near term high is in place and could spur a move toward cad1 3180 the prospects for the usmca is not doing the canadian dollar much good but it is being cited as a factor behind the mexican peso s continued gains it is rising for the sixth consecutive session today and is approaching our support target in the mxn19 17 mxn19 18 area the high yields can still attract funds to mexico over the holiday period this could see additional strength of the peso
alberto fernandéz began his term as argentina s president on december 10th in unorthodox fashion he drove himself and his girlfriend fabiola yáñez to congress for the inauguration in their second hand toyota but citizens had conventional causes for trepidation as well as something to celebrate mauricio macri the outgoing president was the first non peronist since 1983 to end his term in office without tumult on the streets but as he handed the presidential seal and baton to mr fernandéz there was nervousness about what the return of the peronists will mean for a country in an economic crisis mr macri leaves with argentina in a deep recession two fifths of its citizens are poor meaning they cannot afford a basket of staple goods and the share is rising the annualised inflation rate exceeds 50 argentina s 57bn loan from the imf is the largest bail out in the fund s history mr fernández has promised to put the economy back on its feet but an adviser to the new president admits there are no easy answers on the economy and no good options mr fernández s central problem is that argentina lacks the money to deliver the relief he has promised the country s net foreign exchange reserves are just 12bn about three months worth of imports the budget deficit is expected to exceed 4 of gdp this year the government s overall debt stands at 93 of gdp capital flight triggered by worries about argentina s ability to pay its debt has weakened the peso the main reason inflation is so high mr macri had hoped that the imf s money plus an ambitious programme of budgetary austerity would restore the markets confidence instead austerity further weakened the economy driving voters to mr fernández that spooked the financial markets which feared that he would bring back the economic populism of cristina fernández de kirchner no relation who preceded mr macri as president and will now become argentina s vice president the peso tumbled more pushing inflation still higher mr fernández wants to reverse the sequence that mr macri had in mind he is betting that growth will lead to a revival of confidence rather than the other way around to bring that about he has assembled a team of economists with heterodox ideas some of them veterans of ms fernandez s disastrous presidency but he has been vague about his plans and that has added to the markets unease the centrepiece of the economic programme is likely to be a restructuring of argentina s 123bn debt to domestic and foreign private creditors excluding the imf to be carried out by the new economy minister martín guzmán an academic with little political experience who specialises in debt negotiation he has spent the past decade in the united states and is close to joseph stiglitz a nobel prizewinning economist who often denounces global capital markets and the imf mr guzmán has told his new cabinet colleagues that argentina faces social disaster if it pays the enormous sum over 50bn of debt due in 2020 he has proposed that argentina defer payment of both interest and principal for the next two years to give the government the means to kickstart the economy analysts assume he will end up demanding bigger concessions than that the president elect himself has warned that the risk of default is high bond prices suggest the markets are expecting a haircut a discount on the securities face value of nearly 50 mr fernández would buttress a debt restructuring with other growth boosting measures he wants to raise public and private sector wages and pensions and plans to keep a cap on utility prices that was due to expire at the end of 2019 matías kulfas a central bank official during ms fernández s presidency has been put in charge of a ministry of productive development which will be responsible for production trade energy and mining he has a target of doubling exports during the four year life of the government the new government is expected to keep capital controls introduced by mr macri as an emergency measure to curb the depreciation of the peso and curb inflation and to reach a pact with employers and trade unions to hold down prices and wages that may mean that salaries will rise by less than mr fernández has implied the biggest question is how quickly the new team plans to cut inflation and generate the primary fiscal surplus ie before debt service payments needed to repay what remains of argentina s debts including to the imf although mr fernández has downplayed the need for a primary surplus the new economy minister has suggested that argentina should aim to achieve one gradually there is worried speculation that the central bank will pay for expensive promises such as boosting pensions by printing money even though its new president miguen pesce is thought to be a safe choice that would push inflation still higher mr fernández has tried to dispel the impression that his team will repeat the mistakes made by ms fernández who fought with foreign creditors presided over an excessive expansion of the public sector payroll raised trade barriers and levied punishing taxes on exporters this is alberto s economic team and he will be in charge on this front says an adviser to the new president yet mr fernández has not laid to rest fears that ms fernández will have undue influence over his government mr guzmán got the economy ministry only after she had vetoed two other candidates says the adviser outside the economic sphere ms fernández has acquired unprecedented clout for a vice president her influence suggests that reforming the state and combating corruption will not be priorities for the new administration ms fernández had a hand in the choice of the ministers of interior defence and security her supporters will be in charge of the agencies that handle taxation pensions and care of old people all of which have big budgets and jobs to offer political allies as vice president ms fernández is the senate s leader and commands the peronist bloc in the chamber where it has a majority her son máximo leads the peronists in the lower house of congress ms fernández also helped arrange the appointment of carlos zannini one of her closest associates to be attorney general mr zannini was held in preventive detention for his alleged role in covering up a deal that ms fernández had made with iran to absolve it of blame for the bombing of a jewish centre in buenos aires in 1994 in which 86 people including the bomber died his trial has been delayed indefinitely alberto nisman a prosecutor who was murdered in 2015 had indicted mr zannini a judge added a further charge of treason as attorney general mr zannini who was released from jail in 2018 and denies all charges will lead the government s anti corruption unit as well as its team of lawyers mr fernández has already signalled that he is not concerned about the alleged misdeeds of his senior officials he contends that ms fernández and jailed members of her government are victims of political persecution he has pronounced mr zannini innocent we vindicate you he told the new attorney general mr fernández will also revive aspects of his peronist predecessor s foreign policy the incoming foreign minister felipe solá has signalled re engagement with nicolás maduro venezuela s leftist dictator who will now be less of a regional pariah argentina s new government will not accept in its current form a trade deal negotiated by mercosur a four country trade bloc with the european union this will dampen argentina s growth prospects in the long run and increase tension with brazil the bloc s biggest member mr fernández and jair bolsonaro brazil s far right president speak of having pragmatic relations but there is no hiding the frostiness mr bolsonaro did not attend mr fernández s inauguration sending his vice president instead the macri government is proud of having ended the economic isolation that ms fernández imposed on argentina we ve spent four years taking argentina out of the deep freeze says jorge faurie the outgoing foreign minister the fear is we re going back optimists think that the leftward shift in diplomacy will make it easier for mr fernández to adopt a moderate economic policy argentines must hope he is right
haiti on the brink assessing u s policy toward a country in crisis testimony before the house foreign affairs committee antonio garrastazu regional director latin america and the caribbean international republican institute mr chairman ranking member rooney distinguished members of this subcommittee thank you for the opportunity to testify today thank you also for organizing a hearing on this topic critical to u s interests and the future of democratic governance in haiti the republic of haiti with its stark authoritarian past has had a fragile transition to democracy since the end of the duvalier dictatorship in 1986 with its political instability institutional weakness and rampant corruption haiti ranks 161 out of 180 on transparency international s corruption perceptions index rising insecurity and challenges from numerous natural disasters have hampered economic development stirred citizen unrest and limited the government s ability to adequately address the democratic deficits impacting the nation located 838 miles south of florida haiti is the poorest country in the western hemisphere six million or 60 percent of haitians live below the poverty line and almost a quarter in extreme poverty since the inauguration of president jovenel moïse in february 2017 widespread protests have become commonplace the administration s policies increase of government revenue through tax hikes and elimination of fuel subsidies as well as citizen outrage at corruption and a remobilization of the army have exacerbated political gridlock increased migration economic uncertainty and severely impacted haiti s governability president moïse has nominated three prime ministers in his almost three years in office the government remains without an approved budget and elections for the entire chamber of deputies local offices and two thirds of the senate remain in limbo an unstable haiti poses a risk to u s national security haiti is a large recipient of u s aid in the region second only to colombia while u s haiti policy is designed to foster institutions and infrastructure necessary to achieve strong democratic foundations and meaningful poverty reduction through sustainable development aid has declined in the past decade from a high of 380 3 million in fiscal year fy 2011 to a requested 145 5 million in fy 2020 a 15 percent reduction from fy2019 concentration of development assistance at the national level however has shown few results as evidenced by the current political and economic conditions across the island efforts at bolstering the capacity of local officials and civil society organizations cso youth private sector engagement and using the talents and resources of the diaspora community will provide a sustainable path toward haiti s journey to self reliance jsr targeted foreign assistance on democracy human rights and governance should be a priority to help haiti from the brink and get the nation on the right track this will be more effective at ensuring good governance accountability transparency and economic development to combat endless cycles of corruption strengthen institutions rule and law and citizen support for democracy political context haiti has been shaken by a series of protests over the past several years this is mostly due to government disfunction and poor governance a lack of economic opportunities continuous political gridlock and inadequate government responses and attention to citizen demands have exacerbated the current political crisis engulfing the nation protests which began shortly after president moïse took office escalated in july 2018 when then prime minister jack guy lafontant announced the end of fuel subsidies and tax increases to promote a policy agenda and secure a loan from the international monetary fund aimed at strengthening haiti s economy these included agricultural health care energy and infrastructure reforms outrage at this announcement without citizen input and widespread government corruption claims led to the decree being rescinded there have been two prime ministers since lafontant left office the current nominee fritz william michel has not been ratified by parliament essentially leaving the country without a functioning government mass protests swelled in september 2019 with no end in sight haitians are demanding president moïse step down given the rise in food and gas prices including corruption allegations stemming from the defunct petrocaribe fund an oil alliance between caribbean nations and venezuela for preferential oil prices and payment deferrals up to 25 years the situation has been worsened by a crisis in public services gas and electricity shortages across the country have severely hindered public transportation most schools remain closed and hospitals are running low on supplies the haitian national police hnp have gone on strike demanding better wages and working conditions increasing public safety concerns amnesty international reported there have been at least 35 people killed since the protests began in the midst of growing instability the u s has sent the naval ship comfort to assist with humanitarian supplies treating more than 3 500 citizens the u s has also released a statement expressing support for democratically elected president moïse and called for a national dialogue to end the tensions throughout the country high level u s government officials u s ambassador to the united nations kelly craft and under secretary of state for political affairs david hale visited haiti on november 20 and december 5 respectively to press for an inclusive national dialogue and need to overcome the challenges to restore a functioning government although protests are waning and streets are quieter across haiti demonstrations will likely continue given the opposition s uncompromising demand that president moïse step down furthermore the fact that elections for the entire chamber of deputies two thirds of the senate and all local officials should have been held on october 27 2019 continues to exacerbate the ongoing political impasse and an increasingly fragile environment as a result there are several potential scenarios that could unfold over the next year first on january 13 2020 there will be an absence of a functioning parliament and the executive will most likely begin to rule by decree this would likely further galvanize the opposition and exacerbate protests second the current parliamentary terms of office could be extended preserving the untenable status quo a third option would require a constitutional assembly to draft a new constitution or amend the current one fourth the opposition may agree to a national dialogue with the president and a compromise is reached this is unlikely given the opposition s current stance on having moïse resign which he has vowed not to do lastly some experts have suggested the need for a neutral respected mediator to bring the two parties to the negotiation table u s assistance to haiti ever since establishing democratic relations with the country in 1862 the u s has played a key role in haiti s development and advancement toward democracy from reinstating the first democratically elected president jean bertrand aristide after a 1991 coup to support resulting from a devastating earthquake and hurricane in 2010 and 2016 respectively the u s has been actively engaged in assisting in haiti s development foreign assistance to haiti has consistently declined during the last decade from a high of 380 3 million in fy 2011 in fy 2020 the trump administration requested 145 5 million in aid to haiti a 15 percent reduction from fy 2019 most of the u s assistance to haiti has traditionally been focused on health in fy 2020 for example only 4 percent of the requested funding was allocated for democracy human rights and governance 6 0 million while 80 percent was for health projects 115 7 million focus on democracy and governance and local government institutions can help haiti on its journey to self reliance jsr according to the united states agency for international development s usaid jsr s fy 2020 country roadmap haiti has a 0 09 score on a 0 1 scale for government effectiveness this indicator measures the quality of public services civil service and its independence from political pressure policy formulation and implementation and the credibility of the government s commitment to its stated policies this indicator demonstrates that strengthening institutions democracy human rights and governance should be a major focal point of u s assistance in need of more funding this in turn will help provide a path toward sustainability and local ownership to haiti s ongoing governability crisis haiti a strategic u s ally haiti is the poorest country in the western hemisphere with over 6 million or 60 percent of the population living below the poverty line the country s proximity to the united states its regional geo political significance unstable political climate and increased insecurity leading to an influx of roughly 676 000 migrants to the u s out of an 11 million population has vast national security implications geopolitically haiti serves as an important u s ally in the region first haiti can be considered a partner in countering malign chinese interference by maintaining its strong relationship with taiwan haiti helps prevent china from concluding through its belt and road initiative bri more opaque and economically questionable infrastructure projects that bring unstainable debt burdens in this region and increased dependence on china this is significant given that many countries across latin america and the caribbean including its neighbor on the island of hispaniola the dominican republic have close ties to china by maintaining a good relationship with haiti the u s will help ensure china does not gain yet another foothold in latin america and the caribbean using corruption to secure preferential terms for chinese state owned companies and manipulating the information environment to ensure a china friendly narrative and advance chinese communist party interests second from 2018 to 2019 there has been a shift in haiti s approach to voting in the organization of american states oas siding more recently with the u s this is a further testament of haitian support for democracy and u s policy across the region for example haiti voted in defiance of the caribbean community caricom bloc at the oas not to recognize the legitimacy of nicolas maduro as president of venezuela this was not a popular decision among haitians and demonstrated a fundamental shift in regional politics this was the first time haiti voted against the authoritarian venezuela regime and represented a critical moment of solidarity for maintaining momentum to help end the current impasse in venezuela haiti has taken a similar stance on the increasingly authoritarian government in nicaragua haiti abstained from voting in the oas in condemning violence in nicaragua called for the government to agree on an electoral calendar voted for a resolution on the situation in the country and in favor of appointing a commission to carry out diplomatic efforts in the country local governance and the way forward for haiti the governance challenges facing haiti require a robust response from the democracy assistance community building the capacity of local governments and providing support outside of the capital port au prince enhancing accountability and state presence and bringing institutions closer to citizens while ensuring they have an active role in enhancing their communities is critical to advancing democratic principles the u s government has made positive investments in local governance projects such as the international republican institute s iri national endowment for democracy funded initiatives tetratech s usaid funded lokal and rti international s usaid funded project supporting the efficient management of state resources geré while these investments are significant local officials remain in need of support municipalities often do not receive their national budget allocations and therefore have very limited resources to pay their own salaries let alone develop their communities especially in rural areas these deficiencies are compounded by the circumstantial i e poverty high unemployment and cultural reality i e lack of trust that tax collection is extremely difficult in haiti beyond these financial limitations iri has also found that there is a need to invest in the skills of local officials municipal representatives often do not fully understand their roles and responsibilities and could benefit from increased support in leadership resource management fundraising techniques negotiating skills to interact with national officials and citizen engagement among others since 2016 iri for example has worked with municipal officials and civil society organizations in haiti s greater north area to strengthen their institutional capacity promote citizen engagement and encourage marginalized groups including youth and women to have a voice and participate in political processes the institute is helping build basic governing skills introduce municipal governance best practices supported by civil society among elected and municipal officials based on community needs developing political and administrative skills at the local level is much more effective than the current top down approach adopted by many foreign assistance donors given that local officials are on the front lines and have more direct interaction with citizens on a regular basis iri s governance work in haiti focuses on tailored technical assistance and the creation of action plans that promote citizen engagement and enhance governing skills and democratic best practices with select local officials including principal mayors deputy principal mayors and director generals several examples can help put issues of good governance into perspective first as part of iri s good governance approach officials from the municipality of caracol developed a tax collection campaign to connect with citizens and inform them on how the municipality will use taxes to better their community while unemployment and a lack of trust toward officials hindered tax collection the director general reported the five day awareness campaign distributed a total of 1 477 tax collection forms building trust between local officials and their constituents investing in local governance initiatives such as these need to be part of a long term strategy with an emphasis on citizen engagement and viable state presence across the country second in pignon mayor nicolas victorin is challenging the status quo and his experience depicts how youth can serve as agents of change in their communities in march 2018 mayor victorin attended iri s generation democracy gendem leadership academy in panama city panama where youth leaders shared experiences best practices and lessons learned during the event mayor victorin sought regional partnerships including with then panama city mayor jose blandon mayor blandon invited him to return to panama to share his story and experience during a series of events commemorating black ethnicity month an annual celebration in panama in may 2018 mayor victorin returned to panama and participated in a fundraiser concert for pignon organized by the host municipality the 3 200 raised helped support a six month micro loan program for 10 women and a cassava root business in a rural commune near pignon that is still running strong by leveraging its generation democracy network in haiti iri is providing young leaders with a platform to discuss opportunities share lessons learned experiences and strategies for mobilizing peers fabrice dugas president of groupe echo haiti which promotes youth innovation and participation in national development efforts has also participated in generation democracy iri s flagship global youth initiative sharing their experiences with young leaders from the region and around the world as dugas noted i gained the energy i needed to do more to inspire others to empower others to fight for the haitian youth because if all of these young leaders can do it so can i iri has also been working with local civil society organizations csos across the grand north region to improve advocacy and oversight of local governments the institute has supported the creation of a grassroots departmental network gdn with support from usaid composed of 15 local csos from across the region the creation of the gdn is significant because of the centralized nature of decision making in haiti and the need to provide a voice to leaders outside the capital and at the local level in partnership with the university of haiti campus henri christophe de limonade ueh chcl iri is conducting a seven month long certified course teaching 28 members of the gdn how to be agents of change in haitian civil society the course provides an opportunity for participants from a diversity of backgrounds to learn about the functions of government how to hold their governments accountable advocate for their rights as well as identify priorities in their communities participants are currently drafting policy recommendations on issues of interest to shape the narrative across the country iri is also working with ueh chcl to develop a policy hub within the campus to serve as a repository of knowledge for local actors across the grand north area grassroots movements have emerged across the region including in haiti with the petro challengers who are mostly young middle class citizens frustrated with the status quo and corruption which in turn led to the mass protests that have paralyzed the country for more than two months both national and local officials seem to be afraid of engaging with their constituents the lack of engagement with citizens is compounded by poor public relations and communications skills both internally and externally indeed president moïse s speeches during the current crisis the first one was a prerecorded message that was disseminated at 3 00 am with very little substance show an insensitivity toward citizens and have aggravated the current political situation recommendations for u s foreign assistance in haiti there are many political economic and security challenges in haiti s democratic governance landscape that should be addressed through u s foreign assistance a cornerstone of this strategy is strengthening local haitian institutions though providing humanitarian and health assistance is important and critical it will not have the intended impact without strong democratic institutions to ensure these investments are being efficiently and effectively distributed sustained engagement by the u s is crucial to ensuring haiti moves toward a more stable future where crises can be averted and u s interests protected the following recommendations are a step in the right direction first a sustained focus on local level governments and bolstering the capacity of civil society organizations is necessary there is often an overemphasis to concentrate development assistance at the national level yet local leaders are on the front lines interacting and addressing citizens concerns if local level governments and civil society organizations csos work together there is an opportunity a space to improve accountability and transparency critical for advancing democracy building the capacity of civil society organizations are a means for citizens to organize and hold their leaders accountable iri has had positive results at the local level where politicians and civic leaders are willing to learn essential leadership and accountability skills generally csos in haiti are extremely politicized and tend to be used as a steppingstone into political parties or government positions this is problematic because cso leaders are often focused on short term interests and therefore cannot truly hold government officials accountable csos seem to be concentrated at the national level and there s a dearth of effective organizations at the local level most of the csos that iri works with are grassroots organizations with very broad mandates and objectives there is a need to strengthen local grassroots organizations with specific skill sets as well as to help them specialize in strategic areas of interest such as democracy and governance second a focus on youth a third of haiti s population 20 to serve as agents of positive change in their communities is critical youth involvement in civic engagement and outreach will empower them as leaders and help them become more interested and involved in the political process third there is a need for more public opinion research to better understand the challenges haitians face to inform national and international policymakers and effectively design and implement u s foreign assistance programs research and qualitative and quantitative public opinion data are a cornerstone of iri s approach to programming iri implemented a political economy analysis pea in haiti to help understand the problems and opportunities impacting the decision making and sectoral influence of political electoral and civic actors both at the national and local levels the pea served as a tool for iri s governance approach in country more mixed method surveys are greatly needed to inform and adapt future u s foreign policy and assistance in haiti fourth as described in usaid s journey to self reliance private sector engagement has an important role to play to ensure the sustainability of foreign investments the support of entrepreneurial spaces incubators and accelerators such as banj are an example of the positive impact the private sector can have in equipping young haitians with marketable skills and providing spaces to co create and innovate fifth the u s should continue to work with haiti s diaspora community as a critical element in the foreign assistance process the diaspora community represents 11 percent of haiti s population 21 in 2018 remittances represented 31 percent of haiti s gross domestic product 22 this community which maintains close ties to the island can serve as champions to address gaps and challenges facing the nation through financing of projects providing human capital expertise and technical know how to help shape and inform haiti s future conclusion haiti is at a critical juncture rampant corruption diminished rule of law weak institutions and a lack of adequate responses from governments including citizen outreach are fueling popular discontent and are responsible for the country s continued dysfunction in order to set the country on a path to stability and democratic reform citizens must be included in decision making in areas that impact their lives their families their communities ensuring transparency accountability and enhanced participation and stakeholder support at the local level is key to ensure this cycle of discontent becomes an opportunity for citizens to feel democratic governance is the best way forward assessing u s policy toward haiti a country in perpetual crisis is never easy and can be frustrating yet the u s commitment to haiti needs to remain strong haiti s proximity to the u s its regional geo political implications and relevance to our national security has never been more important supporting a strong committed and empowered local governance in haiti is but one economically sensible tool at the disposal of the u s foreign policy apparatus

the canadian dollar s outperformance this year stunned many but strategists are not expecting a repeat in 2020 casting doubt on its run as one of the best major currencies just last week the nation s central bank cited a tightening labor market as a main reason why it can buck the global easing trend and keep its policy rate at the highest levels among advanced economies that upbeat tone didn t last long when november labor force survey showed a surprise job loss weakening the loonie by its biggest decline since october now clouds are gathering on the prospects for the canadian currency which is in a neck and neck race with the british pound for the no 1 spot among all its major peers this year traders see about a 60 per cent chance of a rate cut in the next 12 months double what was expected before the jobs data according to swaps trading an index from citigroup inc which falls when data prove worse than forecast is at the lowest since september 2018 indicating that canada s growth might be slowing down at a faster pace than analysts expect canada will be more vulnerable to a local growth slowdown in 2020 to the detriment of the canadian dollar strategists patrick locke and daniel hui at jpmorgan chase co said in a recent report the team expects the currency to weaken and the central bank to cut interest rates in january currency traders will be eyeing the next batch of economic data and bank of canada s policy decision in late january as economic growth turns sluggish the central bank may not sound as confident at its next meetings in january and march likely preparing for a cut in april said brian rose senior economist at ubs global wealth management which has us 2 5 trillion in invested assets global growth is set to remain weak into the new year and canadian growth is on a downward path he said in an email last week there are more risks to the canadian dollar s strength investors are still cautious as washington and beijing continue to work toward a phase one trade agreement that has yet to be signed u s president donald trump hasn t ruled out hiking the tariffs set to take effect on chinese goods on dec 15 with additional levies likely to reduce the appetite for riskier assets including commodity linked currencies and the outlook for oil prices is still murky the loonie has benefited from canada s oil exports yet demand growth is

northeast texas economic development district revolving loan fund plan may 2018 revised 7 2 2019 drafted to include ctedd rlf portfolio transfer on 11 18 2019 introduction under title ix of the public works and economic development act of 1967 as amended the economic development administration hereinafter called eda may assist distressed areas experiencing long term economic deterioration or areas threatened or impacted by severe economic dislocation the revolving loan fund plan was developed in accordance with eda directive no 17 07 dated 7 10 89 and the updated eda guidelines dated march 14 2018 as adopted the rlf plan has become the standard operating procedure for north east texas economic development district inc hereinafter called netedd in administering a revolving loan fund program in areas experiencing long term economic deterioration and or severe economic dislocation both exemplified in part by high or excessive unemployment rates relative to surrounding areas and the state the revolving loan plan is divided into two parts the first covers the strategy of the rlf plan and the second covers the operational procedures part i the revolving loan fund strategy i comprehensive economic development strategy overview the north east texas economic development district netedd consists of eleven counties in the right corner of texas or the far northeastern part of the state this eleven county region including bowie cass camp delta franklin hopkins lamar marion morris red river and titus counties cover a geographical area of almost 6 547 square miles and is home to approximately 304 748 people note both camp and marion counties are currently undergoing eda approval for realignment from netedd to east texas economic development district etedd this action is being pursued because both of these counties are geographically contiguous to the etedd and currently operate under the east texas council of governments etcog and have requested the aforementioned realignment consequently the netedd region will be reduced to nine counties upon approval by the eda in addition to the original counties of netedd pending approval from eda for a transfer of rlf funds from ctedd an additional 14 counties will be added to our service area for rlf funding these 14 counties include bell bosque coryell ellis falls freestone hamilton hill johnson limestone mclennan navarro milam and somervell the aforementioned counties are served page 1 of 178 by three different ceds in an effort to maintain the purpose of the funding netedd staff will review the ceds and annual updates for each of the areas covered in consideration of the size of the district the board and staff relied on a variety of resources and partners to obtain input into the 2018 comprehensive economic development strategy ceds report meetings with partners were used as a springboard to evoke discussion of economic development issues affecting the region these partners provide the information that is an an integral part of this report and include community and private sector participation members of the north east texas economic developers roundtable netedr were vital to the initial planning process a roundtable is a group of professionals interested in economic development in north east texas the professionals come from city county and state governments private developers and consultants utilities non profits and quasi governmental units such as councils of governments and river authorities the regular open meetings are held in different communities in the district and serve as a forum for the exchange of ideas and information related to economic development in north east texas the roundtable s website contains information about available sites for development and community profiles for the region elected officials from counties and cities in netedd region were involved in the process city managers economic development administrators chambers of commerce staff and board members were involved northeast texas workforce commission staff and board members were primary contributors the ark tex council of governments staff and board members were an essential source of information local community leaders from educational and religious organizations provided information concerning their communities major business owners from various areas within the region gave input and information strengths the strengths that were reported for the netedd region in the 2013 ceds report continue in 2018 as strong attributes for the region affordable housing

resources a location along transportation corridors crossroads for major highways adequate hospitals and other medical facilities fairly good industrial diversity growth potential in agribusiness logistics and ecotourism weaknesses many of the weaknesses that were reported in 2013 continue to plague the netedd region as well in 2018 relatively low wage levels higher than state average

than state and nation the average value of owned homes is low educational attainment rates are low shortage of highly skilled labor job growth is slow new business growth is low infrastructure is aging and inadequate public transportation and air transportation are inadequate there are environmental concerns in some areas growth sectors the logical growth sectors for the netedd economy include healthcare forest products and added value agriculture and distribution centers because of geographic location and transportation opportunities some of the industry clusters that exist or could exist in the region include forest products added value forest products manufacturing petroleum poultry medical districts manufacturer trucking facilities and distribution centers prison facilities netedd regional background economics page 3 of 178 the overall economy in the netedd region continues to grow slowly but naturally at a higher momentum in the more populated communities with interstate highway or corridor highway access communities with attributes such as texarkana bowie county paris lamar county sulphur springs hopkins county and mt pleasant titus county have all seen the benefits of multiple industrial and retail expansions and relocations over the past five years unfortunately many of the rural communities and rural portions of the netedd counties which continue to be dependent upon agriculture and commuting to employment are still plagued with high unemployment and stagnant population growth or population decline the vision for north east texas has changed little from the days of representative wright patman he was credited with saying that he wanted to see residents in his part of texas earn at the national average be educated at the national average and have fewer than the national average living below the poverty level north east texas has made changes and improvements but our vision remains to have a workforce that is competitive nationally earn wages at the national average and relieve the burden of poverty from as many residents as possible goals measurable outcomes objective increased involvement with local governments and businesses to promote the economic development of the region number of jobs created in measurable period and or number of projects resulting in job retention the number of technical assistance visits made on job creation

programs for small businesses and local economic development corporations ii the business development strategy the business development strategy is already well documented in the netedd ceds report and the ark tex regional development company atrdc annual report sba certified development company the netedd staff has a close working relationship with the business the sector in designing and implementing the business development strategy that initially enabled netedd to determine the need for an rlf and define the types of rlf investments that would be most effective in complementing other types of business assistance in supporting the objectives of the ceds program a priority objective is to provide technical assistance and financing to help small medium sized manufacturing plants start up expand or increase productivity increased use of technology and the expansion of markets through exporting are strategic objectives to help keep local firms competitive types of assistance identified and targeted in northeast texas include 1 management business assistance from small business development centers including atrdc netedd 2 production and engineering assistance from the texas manufacturing assistance center network stationed in longview 3 seminars in international trade co sponsored by netedd and the northeast texas economic developers roundtable and 4 financial assistance provided by netedd atrdc the following are among those activities for which a loan may be made from the rlf the establishment or expansion of businesses engaged in commercial industrial or agricultural activities such as farming manufacturing construction sales service the establishment or expansion of cooperatives engaged in the production and marketing of farm products equipment or supplies the manufacture and sale of industrial commercial or consumer products or the provision of various commercial services business or job retention small business development page 5

of rlf capital are listed below see 13 cfr 307 17 b acquire an equity position in private business subsidization of interest payments on an existing rlf loan provide for borrowers required equity contributions under other federal agencies loan programs enable borrowers to acquire an interest in a business either through the purchase of stock or through the acquisition of assets unless sufficient justification is provided in the loan documentation sufficient justification may include acquiring a business to save it from imminent closure or to acquire a business to facilitate a significant expansion or increase in investment with a significant increase in jobs the potential economic benefits must be clearly consistent with the strategic objectives of the rlf provide rlf loans to a borrower for the purpose of investing in interest bearing accounts certificates of deposit or any investment unrelated to the rlf or refinance existing debt unless the rlf recipient sufficiently demonstrates in the loan documentation a sound economic justification for the refinancing e g the refinancing will support additional capital investment intended to increase business activities for this purpose reducing the risk of loss to an existing lender s or lowering the cost of financing to a borrower shall not without other indicia constitute a sound economic justification or rlf capital will finance the purchase of the rights of a prior lien holder during a foreclosure action which is necessary to preclude a significant loss on an rlf loan rlf capital may be used for this purpose only if there is a high probability of receiving compensation from the sale of assets sufficient to cover an rlf s costs plus a reasonable a portion of the outstanding rlf loan within a reasonable period of time as determined by eda following the date of refinancing iii the financing strategy banking institutions throughout the netedd generally have conservative lending policies financial institutions almost uniformly showed gains in deposits and these statistics contrasted to other area economic indicators viz excessive unemployment rates and losses in personal income and loan to deposit ratios generally in the fifty percent 50 range indicate conservative lending policies in general area lenders are reluctant to participate in high risk ventures or provide needed long term financing normally local lending institutions require a 20 percent to 30 percent equity investment for applicants in a relatively strong financial position and with sufficient managerial experience in the industry or business for new ventures and closely held companies the equity requirement may be as much as 50 percent if the loan is considered at all specialized equipment and technology based loans for manufacturers needing to upgrade to remain globally competitive page 6 of 178 are hard to finance conventionally the netedd rlf in conjunction with the area banks has been successful in filling this need most of the area lending institutions are innovative and utilize applicable loan supplement programs as needed sba 7 a sba 504 and loan guarantee programs from the sba and the usda the netedd rlf has proven to be another valuable financial tool that helps marginal projects become more attractive to private lenders by reducing the amount of exposure the utilization of the netedd rlf has strengthened the economic base of the areas within the district which suffer from severe economic distress the netedd rlf plan has worked with local economic development organizations with an emphasis on bowie county to help diversify away from defense facilities and recover from associated job losses some areas have more on going economic development activities than others but the problems causing economic distress are present in all areas this economic distress is reflected by out migration unemployment and underemployment loss of personal income lack of industrial diversification and lack of facilities and capital to stimulate and sustain economic development it must be noted that the levels of distress are chronic and fluctuate directly with the rise and fall of economic activity within netedd s major industries hospitality defense and related industries the following financial policies are presented to serve a standard by which individual loans are tested and evaluated in order to achieve the goals and objectives of this plan 1 working capital loans will not exceed 50 of the total amount of loans in the rlf portfolio 2 loan size minimum 10 000 up to a maximum of 300 000 3 in general principal and interest will be amortized over the life of the loan however in order to encourage participation in a direct fixed asset loan by other lenders and investors the rlf loan principal may be payable after other loans made in connection with the project have been repaid in full it must be noted that each loan will be negotiated on an individual basis in order to generate maximum impact 4 the interest rate on rlf loans will follow the rates allowed by the rlf grant the minimum interest rate will be limited to four 4 percentage points below the current money center prime rate quoted in the wall street journal or the maximum interest rate allowed under state law whichever is lower but will not be less than four 4 percent however should the prime interest rate exceed fourteen 14 percent the minimum rlf interest rate may be limited to ten 10 percent if this would compromise the ability of the rlf to implement the overall financing strategy the target rate will be the amount current money center prime rate fixed over the life of the loan 5 moratoriums on rlf principal may be established for the short run as needed in order to meet the credit needs of the borrower and further the goals and objectives of the rlf program 6 wherever possible the netedd will always strive to take a superior lien position however the board may take a lien position for the rlf which may be subordinate and make inferior to lien or lien securing other loans made in connection with the project on page 7 of 178 order to achieve the rlf goals in determining the collateral requirements netedd in conjunction with participating lending institutions will consider the merits and potential economic benefits of each individual loan request rlf loans will be secured by liens and or assignments of rights and benefits of the mortgagor in projects involving fixed asset loans the rlf will normally require collateral such as liens on the fixed assets evidenced by loan documents to include but not be limited to notes mortgages and deeds of trust and security in interest 7 a loan origination fee of 1 5 targeted for each loan the following items are needed for standard loan application and processing financial information and credit report authorization and release form caivrs disclosure form sams clearance personal history form personal financial statement form standard loan application business financials and or projections as needed civil rights requirements the netedd rlf will comply with all department of commerce and economic development administration regulations under title vi of the c r act of 1964 section 112 of public law 92 65 section 504 of the rehabilitation act of 1973 and the age discrimination act of 1975 all as amended any other applicable non discrimination law s netedd rlf will require the same assurances of compliance from all loan recipients all applicants will be required to submit a policy statement that such applicant shall not discriminate against employees or applicants for employment on the basis of race creed religion national origin sex handicap or political belief or affiliation applicants will be required to post a non discrimination notice in areas where such notice will be seen by employees and applicants such notice will provide information for persons to report such discrimination who feel they have been discriminated against by the applicant loan recipient compliance will be monitored semi annually and will require corrective action as necessary corrective action may require applicants to submit a workforce analysis showing hiring patterns of affected groups and projected employment figures aimed at remedying underutilized minorities the netedd rlf shall not discriminate against loan applicants on the basis of race color national origin religion or sex all applicable statutes executive orders requirements and regulations pertaining to non discrimination will be adhered to by netedd rlf the netedd rlf will require assurance in writing from loan recipients that affirmative action in the area of contracting will be taken to involve minority and or female owned businesses the netedd rlf will work to further the cause of minority business development by encouraging applicants for funding by netedd rlf the netedd rlf will work with page 8 of 178 minority business organizations such as the texarkana black chamber of commerce the local service corps of retired executives score and the local small business development center and other organizations working for minority business development and encourage their referrals of potential loan applicants the monitoring of loan recipients on a regular basis will be used to ensure compliance if patterns of discrimination are found with a loan recipient and efforts to force corrective action are unsuccessful the loan will be classified as a problem loan and if corrective action is not taken the loan may be declared in default of loan covenants the standards outlined below reflect the expected achievement of the rlf portfolio individual loans will generally conform to these standards but may vary depending on the economic benefits both direct and indirect to be achieved by each loan as long as cumulative results of the portfolio generally meet specified standards the overall cost per job is targeted at the sba rate of one job created for every 65 000 loaned though in some instances cost per job will be less than the indicated amount this amount will be adjusted periodically to coincide with the sba job creation requirement the cost per job requirements tended to focus on the number of jobs rather than the quality of jobs increased costs of upgrading plant and equipment to keep pace with advances in technology to remain competitive make the job retention a worthy public policy objective the maximum loan to any single borrower is set at 300 000 with eda approval page 9 of 178 due to the high level of long term unemployed and underemployed workers in the netedd area 50 of the new jobs created will be targeted at the long term unemployed and or underemployed workers the rlf will continue to focus on economic base jobs or basic value added jobs these types of jobs tend to have a more positive impact on the area than do service jobs a manufacturing job usually generates additional cash flow which creates market demand and generates additional supplier and service jobs most of the dislocated workers in netedd filled basic job slots and were classified as semi skilled and skilled industrial workers rlf loan activity will be targeted but not limited to replenishing these types of jobs which will have the most economic impact on the area the target ratios for semi skilled and skilled workers are industrial 60 commercial 40 entry level 25 semiskilled 25 skilled 50 there is a gap in the lending practices of the local lending institutions for commercial loans less than 25 000 the local lending environment generally views the smaller loans as unprofitable ventures due to the cost of servicing the loans the revolving loan fund will be used to address this weakness in the local lending environment while keeping the same priorities as larger loans however since the local lending institutions have an aversion to making the smaller loans there will probably not be any private leveraging of the rlf funds this will probably result in the rlf financing 100 of the project this leveraging shortfall will be made up by leveraging the larger loans in an amount that should make the overall portfolio average in the 3 5 1 range the rates of private sector dollars to be leveraged by the rlf portfolio will be set at an overall average of two to one 2 1 it is expected a majority of the loans will leverage private sector funds in the 3 5 1 range all loan applications will be analyzed with a maximum positive impact on the economy considered the primary factor as such the ratio of public private borrowers and locally owned or outside concerns are irrelevant rlf loans must be used for purposes which result in private sector job creation or retention and contribute to the economic development of the area loans will normally finance industrial or commercial activities including light manufacturing and service industries where opportunities for private sector jobs are the greatest and will emphasize direct job creation or retention location or expansion of established business new start up or the retention of business in some instances indirect job creation may be considered on a low priority basis but only with a significant impact on the economy proclamation of the rlf will ensure that the program is known to all potential loan applicants including minorities and women through the judicious use of the rlf financing can be provided to those businesses and industries that indeed offer the most long term gains for the area the netedd can ensure maximum gains for various areas by tailoring to meet the different needs of each locale in small rural areas revolving loan financing would most likely be to labor intensive page 10 of 178 industries offering the quickest relief to severe unemployment problems in the larger more urbanized areas financing would be targeted at developments that would leverage major business expansions and start ups providing a continuing source of new jobs every effort will be made to ensure that the loan portfolio will increase the tax revenues in all eligible areas involved with the rlf program the netedd loan committee and the loan candidate will be appraised of the state and federal statutes concerning civil rights and environmental regulations loan reviews and applications will require statutory compliance as a part of the terms and conditions of the loan the required selection criteria that financing is not otherwise available will be applied to all loans the economic impact criteria are that the business be classified as a basic industry or other value added business or support to a value added business the staff will make an annual report to the netedd rlf committee to assess the performance of the rlf in accomplishing its stated economic adjustment objectives and to modify the rlf plan as needed and recertify the plan part ii operational procedures i administrative procedures the staff of netedd including contract labor will be responsible for the identification and development of appropriate financing opportunities providing business and financial counseling performing environmental review compliance and loan management netedd staff will also render loan servicing functions which will include but not be limited to performing credit analysis loan write ups and recommendations to the committee loan processing collections and servicing handling defaulted loans and foreclosures and compliance with grant requirements loan closings and foreclosures will be handled by outside legal counsel loan procedures and documents are in compliance with the rlf administrative manual the netedd rlf loan committee is composed of the netedd president and some of the atrdc executive board which also reviews sba 504 program loans this structure allows for administrative efficiency and competency in loan reviews this loan committee is composed of five members who are representative of the public and private sector as well as minority representation members with business experience that might have a conflict of interest on a particular project must abstain from voting on that project the board has members with bank lending experience and at least one of those members must be present for

impacts would those threats and hazards have on our community based on those impacts what capabilities should our community have the thira helps communities understand their risks and determine the level of capability they need in order to address those risks the outputs from this process lay the foundation for determining a community s capability gaps during the spr process the thira follows a three step process as described in the comprehensive preparedness guide 201 third edition 1 identify threats and hazards based on a combination of experience forecasting subject matter expertise and other available resources develop a list of threats and hazards that could affect the community when deciding what threats or hazards to include in the thira communities consider only those that challenge the community s ability to deliver at least one core capability more than any other incident the thira is not intended to include less challenging threats and hazards 2 give threats and hazards context describe the threats and hazards identified in step 1 showing how they may affect the community and create challenges in performing the core capabilities identify the impacts a threat or hazard may have on a community 3 establish capability targets using the impacts described in step 2 determine the level of capability that the community plans to achieve over time in order to manage the threats and hazards it faces using standardized language create capability targets for each of the core capabilities based on this desired level of capability by identifying impacts

thursday s federal reserve monetary policy announcement is one of the most important events of the week but we don t expect fireworks this is the last fomc meeting of the year and there s zero chance of a change in policy however a press conference follows every central bank meeting and there s always the possibility of market moving comments from fed chairman jerome powell at their last policy meeting in october the fed cut interest rates for the third time in a row and instead of emphasizing the need for such aggressive measures powell described the reduction as a move to insure against softening global growth and uncertain trade developments while these 2 problems persist the economy has taken a turn for the better since october see table below consumer spending improved more jobs were created inflation ticked higher there s more housing market activity with the manufacturing and service sector isms increased therefore jerome powell has very little reason to focus on the risks and vulnerabilities of the us economy instead he ll most likely reiterate that policy is in a good place because of the strong labor market and consumption this means that the us dollar should hold onto its gains against the japanese yen on the hopes that the president trump will deliver the gift of a christmas rally by delaying the december 15th tariffs powell s speech will be far more interesting than the fomc statement and if his outlook is as rosy as we expect usd jpy could extend its gains to 109 however if he emphasizes uncertainties and suggests that there may be a need for additional stimulus it would be an unexpected shock that could send the dollar sharply lower we re nearing the end of the year which is why investors look react kindly to surprises the most important of which will be president trump s announcement on chinese tariffs so far a decision has not been made but according to the wall street journal and bloomberg news washington may delay the new tariffs and possibly even reduce existing ones with only a few days left before the deadline this will go down to the wire and trump could even wait until the market closes on friday or over the weekend to make the announcement if that s the case the impact of fomc and ecb will be limited however if president trump makes a decision before the end of the week the only thing that will matter to fx traders is whether tariffs are on or off the best performing currencies today were sterling and the swiss franc the uk s general election is on thursday and all signs point to an easy victory for boris johnson euro also extended its gains towards 1 11 on the back of stronger investor confidence the german zew survey beat expectations with the expectations component rising to 10 7 against a forecast of 0 3 the eurozone zew survey also turned positive in december better than expected data from germany helped euro rally ahead of ecb but we expect central bank president lagarde to emphasize continuity by focusing on the need for ongoing accommodation the australian and canadian dollars also traded lower while the new zealand dollar held onto its gains all 3 currencies are consolidating as they wait for president trump s big decision

microsoft amazon ceo and founder jeff bezos has had issues with president trump largely stemming from trump s accusations that bezos company is underpaying taxes the question is whether the president of the united states should be allowed to use the budget of dod to pursue his own personal and political ends the formal complaint said economist and former chairman of the federal reserve paul volcker passed away over the weekend at the age of 92 volcker understood the importance of cycles in relation to the economy published in 1978 the rediscovery of the business cycle reintroduced the concept of cycles and their effect on the economy to the western world the rediscovery of the business cycle is a sign of the times not much more than a decade ago in what now seems a more innocent age the new economics had become orthodoxy its basic tenet repeated in similar words in speech after speech in article after article was described by one of its leaders as the conviction that business cycles were not inevitable that government policy could and should keep the economy close to a path of steady real growth at a constant target rate of unemployment of course some minor fluctuations in economic activity were not ruled out but the impression was conveyed that they were more the consequence of misguided political judgments of practical men beguiled by the mythology of the old orthodoxy of balanced budgets and of occasional errors in forecasting than of deficiency in our basic knowledge of how the economy worked or in the adequacy of the tools of policy the avant garde of the profession began to look elsewhere to problems of welfare economics and income distribution for new challenges of course the handling of the economic consequences of the vietnam war was an obvious blot on the record but that after all reflected more political than economic judgments by the early 1970s the persistence of inflationary pressures even in the face of mild recession began to flash some danger signals the responses of the economy to the twisting of the dials of monetary and fiscal policy no longer seemed quite so predictable but it was not until the events of 1974 and 1975 when

of the year gdp was flat in the three months to october and the latest surveys point to further stagnation in november and december the economy is being held back by weak productivity growth and low

index rose 4 9 pts 14 7 zew president achim wambach at first glance the renewed substantial increase of the zew indicator of economic sentiment may seem surprising it rests on the hope that german exports and private consumption will develop better than previously thought this hope results from a higher than expected german foreign trade surplus in october alongside relatively robust economic growth in the eu in the third quarter and a stable german labour market the rather unfavourable figures for industrial production and incoming orders for october however show that the economy is still

addressing the all liberians diaspora conference saturday mr mueller said liberia a country heavily depending on foreign direct investment remains a fragile post conflict country with weak capacity and limited physical and human capital accumulation washington mr michael mueller vice chairman of the board of the european federation of liberian associations and co chairman of the all liberian conference for dual citizenship says any country with a strong dependency on foreign direct investment and war criminal steering political affairs in an unstable governmental environment will fall short of attracting international investors addressing the all liberians diaspora conference saturday mr mueller said liberia a country heavily depending on foreign direct investment remains a fragile post conflict country with weak capacity and limited physical and human capital accumulation the conference brought together dozens of diaspora international organizations local and state officials recognized liberian experts and notable friends of liberia joined by representatives of u s government and international agencies in a bid to unite the liberian diaspora on major issues affecting liberia the two day affair was sponsored by the leading umbrella liberian diaspora organizations representing the various regions of the world including the union of liberian associations in the americas ulaa the european federation of liberian associations efla the federation of liberian communities in australia folica conference of liberian organizations in the south western united states colosus the united liberian association ghana ulag and the coalition of concerned liberians ccl the major liberian diaspora organizations are united under the aegis of the all liberian conference on dual citizenship alcod representing over 500 000 liberians in the diaspora citing political instability and sanctions as key detriments to liberia s survival mr mueller said liberia is currently on the sanctions list of the office of foreign asset control of the treasury department of the united states of america political stability in connection with foreign direct investment plays a major part of the risk for any investor countries with an uncertain political situation will be a significant disincentive economic crisis combined with economic sanctions will be a major factor in discouraging foreign investment he averred level of corruption a deterrent the efla leader declared that the key component of political instability is the level of corruption and trust in institutions especially the judiciary and the extent of law and order liberia he added has always tended to give long term concession right to multi national corporations in extracting natural resources without visible benefit to the overall economic growth respectively without creating a human capital brain gain the opposite happened and the reality is taking place into today s economic environment we created an economic environment with cheap labor and with the sole benefit of the authority and the multi national corporations in contrast mueller said offshore companies were established without knowledge to the public to backchannel additional cash for the ruling elites despite liberia s vast national resources which include iron ore rubber mining industries and precious wood the economy built on bankable asset respectively finished products remains indispensable to growing our marketplace as well as our labor skills mueller explained that the reign of former president ellen johnson sirleaf was blessed to be elected after a devastating civil war and the peace agreement signed by the international stakeholders offered an opportunity for liberia to receive the highest ever number of un peacekeepers deployed worldwide with the peacekeepers on the ground he said a lot of other international organizations followed creating job opportunities for liberians this situation stood steady throughout her reign of sirleaf with various economic studies placing unmil s total local expenditure at over usd550 million with a cumulative local impact exceeding usd850 million mueller said the contributions of diaspora liberians can never be underestimated one should also not underestimate the remittances from us the liberians in the diaspora which still is constant factor in supporting liberia s gdp growth with the given political stable environment and international support the sirleaf government was able to attract billions of foreign direct investments but also under her leadership what happened in our past economic history continued with the inflow of money mueller said the sirleaf government gave long term concession rights to multi national corporations however he adds greed abuse of resources and the lack of transparency and accountability were on the daily agenda although sirleaf and her team managed more or less very well keeping it all under the carpet professionally mr mueller explained that the sirleaf administration having easy money to its disposal paid deaf ears to transforming the country s economy to a robust economy driving by bankable assets and finished products when it became time for turning over to the weah led government last january he said the un estimated that more than 90 percent of the gdp lost during liberia s 14 years of conflict was regained however as the last troops were leaving in june 2018 the annual economic growth forecast was slashed from 4 7 percent to 0 4 percent by the time the un mission left he said the speculative economy dissolved and revealed huge structural issues in liberia s actual economy such problems which include inadequate access to credit a lack of infrastructure to support sector growth and the dominance of a concession model where the government allocates large swathes of land to foreign companies for resource extraction especially rubber palm oil and iron ore such actions leave no potential for local value addition to the detriment of the local workforce weah s govt coming up short to date the current government has not given a full account of these monies which accumulated to the reasons for the lack of confidence in the government by the international community meanwhile weah has reportedly constructed or reconstructed over 49 personal buildings for himself mr michael mueller vice chairman of the board of the european federation of liberian associations mueller said the weah government has so far been unable to do well when it comes to economic planning whatever assumption the weah government made before taking over is best known to them the facts are that before taking over from the sirleaf government the prices on the international markets for liberia s export commodities were already in the downturn he cited the missing usd 100 million and another usd25 million from the central bank of liberia shortly after president weah took office as key impediment to the administration s progress to date the current government has not given a full account of these monies which accumulated to the reasons for the lack of confidence in the government by the international community meanwhile weah has reportedly constructed or reconstructed over 49 personal buildings for himself mueller said while the government has launched its pro poor agenda for prosperity and development focusing on physical and human capital accumulation policy uncertainty and slippages have imposed a significant toll on the economy over the past two years notably higher fiscal deficits and accommodative monetary policy have led to the rapid depreciation of the liberian dollar and increased inflation eroding the purchasing power of the already poor mueller said as a result the near and medium term outlook under the baseline scenario is very very challenging the imf is now emphasizing on significant fiscal adjustment they underscored that efforts should focus on mobilizing domestic revenue and rationalizing spending especially the wage bill while securing needed space for social and capital expenditure a fix idea formulate realistic budget to fix the problem he said the weah administration must formulate realistic budgets and to implement a sound borrowing plan that ensures debt sustainability while advocating caution in engaging in non concessional borrowing they are called for further progress in public financial management reforms to improve the quality of spending in the resource constrained environment mr mueller also stressed the importance the contributions of diaspora liberians are making to keep the local economy afloat additionally and notwithstanding the economic engagement with the liberian diaspora is essential underlining the diaspora s first call to be addressed in the form of dual citizenship right now as we speak it is still the liberian diaspora assistance that offers one of the only chances of survival usd 433 million representing 31 percent was contributed to liberia s gross domestic product according to the world bank information for 2018 alone with the current situation on the ground and the unemployment staggering at a rate of over 80 percent mueller said liberians are still returning from abroad with access to foreign capital which he expects will increase the strength of liberian competition in the business arena dual citizens he said would also help to create various forms of capital and infrastructural development including land improvement and development within the private sector liberians in the diaspora s role in the economy could provide thousands of jobs for the unemployed liberians some studies have shown the african diaspora send more money to their respective countries than all the foreign aid combined in all of these i have yet to hear any concrete argument suggesting how the proposition of a real dual citizenship could hurt the liberian economy mueller averred

i think that both sides are going to find a way to delay the imposition of new tariffs on december 15 said art hogan chief market strategist at national securities in new york we just don t know if

raise gdp by 0 35 after six years oxford economics said in a note however at a time when slower global growth rising protectionism lingering policy uncertainty and a strong dollar are constraining

addressing the all liberians diaspora conference saturday mr mueller said liberia a country heavily depending on foreign direct investment remains a fragile post conflict country with weak capacity and limited physical and human capital accumulation washington mr michael mueller vice chairman of the board of the european federation of liberian associations and co chairman of the all liberian conference for dual citizenship says any country with a strong dependency on foreign direct investment and war criminal steering political affairs in an unstable governmental environment will fall short of attracting international investors addressing the all liberians diaspora conference saturday mr mueller said liberia a country heavily depending on foreign direct investment remains a fragile post conflict country with weak capacity and limited physical and human capital accumulation the conference brought together dozens of diaspora international organizations local and state officials recognized liberian experts and notable friends of liberia joined by representatives of u s government and international agencies in a bid to unite the liberian diaspora on major issues affecting liberia the two day affair was sponsored by the leading umbrella liberian diaspora organizations representing the various regions of the world including the union of liberian associations in the americas ulaa the european federation of liberian associations efla the federation of liberian communities in australia folica conference of liberian organizations in the south western united states colosus the united liberian association ghana ulag and the coalition of concerned liberians ccl the major liberian diaspora organizations are united under the aegis of the all liberian conference on dual citizenship alcod representing over 500 000 liberians in the diaspora citing political instability and sanctions as key detriments to liberia s survival mr mueller said liberia is currently on the sanctions list of the office of foreign asset control of the treasury department of the united states of america political stability in connection with foreign direct investment plays a major part of the risk for any investor countries with an uncertain political situation will be a significant disincentive economic crisis combined with economic sanctions will be a major factor in discouraging foreign investment he averred level of corruption a deterrent the efla leader declared that the key component of political instability is the level of corruption and trust in institutions especially the judiciary and the extent of law and order liberia he added has always tended to give long term concession right to multi national corporations in extracting natural resources without visible benefit to the overall economic growth respectively without creating a human capital brain gain the opposite happened and the reality is taking place into today s economic environment we created an economic environment with cheap labor and with the sole benefit of the authority and the multi national corporations in contrast mueller said offshore companies were established without knowledge to the public to backchannel additional cash for the ruling elites despite liberia s vast national resources which include iron ore rubber mining industries and precious wood the economy built on bankable asset respectively finished products remains indispensable to growing our marketplace as well as our labor skills mueller explained that the reign of former president ellen johnson sirleaf was blessed to be elected after a devastating civil war and the peace agreement signed by the international stakeholders offered an opportunity for liberia to receive the highest ever number of un peacekeepers deployed worldwide with the peacekeepers on the ground he said a lot of other international organizations followed creating job opportunities for liberians this situation stood steady throughout her reign of sirleaf with various economic studies placing unmil s total local expenditure at over usd550 million with a cumulative local impact exceeding usd850 million mueller said the contributions of diaspora liberians can never be underestimated one should also not underestimate the remittances from us the liberians in the diaspora which still is constant factor in supporting liberia s gdp growth with the given political stable environment and international support the sirleaf government was able to attract billions of foreign direct investments but also under her leadership what happened in our past economic history continued with the inflow of money mueller said the sirleaf government gave long term concession rights to multi national corporations however he adds greed abuse of resources and the lack of transparency and accountability were on the daily agenda although sirleaf and her team managed more or less very well keeping it all under the carpet professionally mr mueller explained that the sirleaf administration having easy money to its disposal paid deaf ears to transforming the country s economy to a robust economy driving by bankable assets and finished products when it became time for turning over to the weah led government last january he said the un estimated that more than 90 percent of the gdp lost during liberia s 14 years of conflict was regained however as the last troops were leaving in june 2018 the annual economic growth forecast was slashed from 4 7 percent to 0 4 percent by the time the un mission left he said the speculative economy dissolved and revealed huge structural issues in liberia s actual economy such problems which include inadequate access to credit a lack of infrastructure to support sector growth and the dominance of a concession model where the government allocates large swathes of land to foreign companies for resource extraction especially rubber palm oil and iron ore such actions leave no potential for local value addition to the detriment of the local workforce weah s govt coming up short to date the current government has not given a full account of these monies which accumulated to the reasons for the lack of confidence in the government by the international community meanwhile weah has reportedly constructed or reconstructed over 49 personal buildings for himself mr michael mueller vice chairman of the board of the european federation of liberian associations mueller said the weah government has so far been unable to do well when it comes to economic planning whatever assumption the weah government made before taking over is best known to them the facts are that before taking over from the sirleaf government the prices on the international markets for liberia s export commodities were already in the downturn he cited the missing usd 100 million and another usd25 million from the central bank of liberia shortly after president weah took office as key impediment to the administration s progress to date the current government has not given a full account of these monies which accumulated to the reasons for the lack of confidence in the government by the international community meanwhile weah has reportedly constructed or reconstructed over 49 personal buildings for himself mueller said while the government has launched its pro poor agenda for prosperity and development focusing on physical and human capital accumulation policy uncertainty and slippages have imposed a significant toll on the economy over the past two years notably higher fiscal deficits and accommodative monetary policy have led to the rapid depreciation of the liberian dollar and increased inflation eroding the purchasing power of the already poor mueller said as a result the near and medium term outlook under the baseline scenario is very very challenging the imf is now emphasizing on significant fiscal adjustment they underscored that efforts should focus on mobilizing domestic revenue and rationalizing spending especially the wage bill while securing needed space for social and capital expenditure a fix idea formulate realistic budget to fix the problem he said the weah administration must formulate realistic budgets and to implement a sound borrowing plan that ensures debt sustainability while advocating caution in engaging in non concessional borrowing they are called for further progress in public financial management reforms to improve the quality of spending in the resource constrained environment mr mueller also stressed the importance the contributions of diaspora liberians are making to keep the local economy afloat additionally and notwithstanding the economic engagement with the liberian diaspora is essential underlining the diaspora s first call to be addressed in the form of dual citizenship right now as we speak it is still the liberian diaspora assistance that offers one of the only chances of survival usd 433 million representing 31 percent was contributed to liberia s gross domestic product according to the world bank information for 2018 alone with the current situation on the ground and the unemployment staggering at a rate of over 80 percent mueller said liberians are still returning from abroad with access to foreign capital which he expects will increase the strength of liberian competition in the business arena dual citizens he said would also help to create various forms of capital and infrastructural development including land improvement and development within the private sector liberians in the diaspora s role in the economy could provide thousands of jobs for the unemployed liberians some studies have shown the african diaspora send more money to their respective countries than all the foreign aid combined in all of these i have yet to hear any concrete argument suggesting how the proposition of a real dual citizenship could hurt the liberian economy mueller averred

fighting for their freedom this experience of communal character is developing in a third of the syrian territory including arab and armenian population among other nationalities and also people of

women and those groups that have always been the focus of the domination of the capitalist system in all of its scope kurdish militias defeated the islamic state with a balance of 11 thousand dead

over popular sectors have grown alarmingly we can mention unemployment of 13 million and underemployment of more than 27 million workers to point out some social drama data millions of people with informal and precarious work are screwed by the scam of miserable days and going hungry this along with the 20 increase in the lethal action of the police against blacks and the population of the peripheries of the oppressed classes the sinister aggravation of the prison system and the rationalization of selective death and counterinsurgency technology stuck in marginalized bodies and territories the reciprocal support the complicity of the double adjustment repression as a reason for a neoliberal security state where finance and its knife dominate is in relief militia government stage to manage the misery in the face of the scandal of a class of super rich and great fortunes which takes for itself more than half of all the wealth and common goods of the country that is to say doctors trained at the chicago school take place in a special political configuration with the crime bureau of the militia police officers and every movement of activism and judicial trap that has been set in motion by operation lava jato bolsonaro has been implicated in the lines of investigation that lead the assassins of companion marielle franco the matter which is far from being resolved returns to the public scene and generates some level of protest in the streets for justice and truth to meet those responsible in the marielle case there is also some level of differences and disputes towards the internal of the ruling classes even among the mainstream media where the red globe now wants to show itself as democratic when in fact it led bolsonaro to the government this moment of tension in the above and bearing in mind some discontent and rebellion from those below is appropriate to move the field of the oppressed and generate situations of greater popular mobilization and organization with lula out of prison due to the decision of the supreme court on the trial rights with presumption of innocence the sectors of the electoralist left play again for the restoration of a class agreement that does not conform to the mode of shock government of this situation we commemorate with our people every little victory against injustice every point of resistance that is practiced to confront the lawfare of the judicial system but with all our political independence and with much respect for the popular affection of an important part of the country that is heading to lula at this time we will not forget the infamous and horrific punishment of brazilian prisons which is the racist and anti poor punitive machine of the bourgeois justice entrusting the political exit of the brazilian people to the freedom of lula so that he will be elected president again is at least suicidal because he does not place the demands of the brazilian people on the street and because ultimately the situation in that country will be solved from above only the people can sweep this authoritarian and neoliberal government and the social and political forces that sustain it in colombia the esmad police squad of shock and repression has taken to the streets with great harshness to repress student demonstrations with several wounded and detained this is part of the militarized state policy of the governments of the colombian right where it has been evidenced that there is no room for any peace process a large number of popular militants have been killed several of them ex guerrillas the return to armed action by a sector of the farc is proof of this electoral processes and the coup in bolivia three electoral processes with different implications in the future of the region have been developed at the end of october bolivia argentina and uruguay three electoral processes with different implications in the future of the region have been developed at the end of october bolivia argentina and uruguay on november 11 the former coca cola trade union leader evo morales and the mas ipsp in bolivia experienced a coup d etat and was forced to resign from the presidency under the direct pressure of the armed forces and the police reinforced under his government and under the pressure of large popular protests led by the right morales had breached the anti reelectionist mandate of the 2009 constitution one of his main political achievements as well as the result of the 2016 presidential re election that clearly defeated him and more importantly the indigenous and union mandate for the collective leadership he presented himself for the fourth time to the presidential elections with a diminished political capacity but maintaining important bases of popular support and the letter of good economic performance of the andean amazonian capitalism model the most radical expression of the progressive cycle in the region the development of the political model of the mas for almost 14 years centered on the caudillismo around the figure of evo morales under the myth of the indigenous worker representation whose decisions are taken in the party domes using the base organizations as a van tail forged a vertical movement that proposes solutions from above in the institutions of the bourgeoisie the weakening of the figure of evo morales leaves a reference gap that opens the way for the interference of us imperialism together with the most reactionary misogynist racist and neo liberal business sectors his main rivals in the general elections of october 2019 were former president carlos mesa of the citizen community party forced to resign in 2005 for the general strike for the nationalization of resources and now questioned about his relations with odebrecht and the evangelical pastor chi hyung chung of the christian democratic party considered the local bolsonaro and accused morales of turning bolivia into sodom and gomorrah the main opponents who had co governed territorially with morales in the last period of time developed an anti communist campaign based on fear of a second venezuela but also appealed to the legitimate discontent of the population with corruption or low wages once the voting was carried out in which the right parties expected to have a second round and probably win the election in the counting of the votes on the night of october 20 various irregularities were presented and denounced given these irregularities in the counting and the government and opposition arrogance of declaring victory in such a closed scenario a wave of protests led by morales s adversaries that began as vigils before the polling stations and then became massive mobilizations and an indefinite civic strike since october 23 for 17 days it blocked the most populous and conservative region of santa cruz but also the progressive centers of el alto and la paz important mobilizations and road blockades were developed with the participation of unemployed transport businessmen since november 6 university students residents of popular neighborhoods and mining worker sectors for its part the government mobilized important trade union indigenous and peasant forces in its support denying any possibility of political dialogue and denouncing a civic coup in the meantime there were strong street clashes between supporters and opponents of the government which added to the police repression left the sad balance of 24 dead today these actions denoted a clear coup plan backed by the american government and the cia in the previous days there was already information about the preparations for this action however the bolivian right managed to capture and capitalize on some popular discontent at least at that time the dissatisfaction with evo and his government comes from different social sectors regional union with the cob in the lead coca growers students professionals today appears mixed in this electoral framework and the right reactionary and racist tries to capitalize all it can the rioting of repressive forces throughout the country demonstrates that the inheritance of banzer s coup thinking remains intact in the upper layers of the bolivian army and the police the opposition organized around the civic committee with a focus on santa cruz radicalized its position and mesa went from accepting the oas audit to reject it and proclaim or the jail or the presidency he began a wave of violent protests that included barricades on multiple roads carried out with private vehicles of the protesters the burning of government buildings and violence against state officials and their families a movement that spliced with police riots with some labor demands and political purposes they developed from november 8 in sucre cochabamba and santa cruz and from there to the rest of the country at the time supporters of the mas developed actions to unblock barricades and concentrations supported by sectors of the security forces in which violent clashes with the opponents occurred morales accepted the oas review of the voting by accepting a second round of elections while calling for a dialogue with the opposition on november 9 after the unfavorable results of this institution led by the united states and its political partners the masist government agrees to repeat the presidential elections on november 10 in the middle of the development of a great march towards la paz organized by the right wing opposition that sought to reinstate god in the presidential palace and called an intervention of the army the dome of the armed forces suggests in open political intervention the resignation of the government which finally became effective with the resignation of morales and garcía linera amid complaints of coup d etat and his departure to mexico the cataract of morales errors and his government is striking more than mistakes we must recognize they are part of a conception that claims changes can be made through bourgeois institutions he did not firmly face the coup once it was launched he summoned to negotiate the most fascist sectors directly nazi that were promoting the same he submitted himself to the opinions of the oas north american foreign policy organism and the interference of said organism in venezuela and the double standards applied according to each country that same oas that supports the genocidal government of colombia among other facts and he exiles himself just like that with that conception there are no substantive changes and it is not possible to face any advance of the right or coup d etat however this new coup attempt is part of us policy for the area if they cannot control a country directly if it shows some degree of independence in foreign policy they destabilize it until overthrowing the government that they see as an obstacle proof of this is the daily attempts of the empire in venezuela the empire cares nothing about venezuela s political regime its corruption its ineptitude its bureaucracy and bolirricos it matters only to geopolitical effects and mainly because of its wealth oil recall that in 2008 bolivia expelled the dea from the country us anti drug agency for its destabilizing work and constant support for the opposition even organizing armed groups that has been the work of this organization and the cia financed organized trained the extreme right groups to give coups and to return to the effective control of governments to these sectors and to the most recalcitrant most neo liberal bourgeoisie the old politics of the empire stronger than ever evo morales response despite the coup d etat has been to resign as president and institutionally channel the discontent calling for elections again despite calls to mobilize against the coup in different locations in bolivia as in solidarity in the rest of the continent the bolivian people that people who have an immense experience of struggle who starred in the 1952 revolution and the gas and water war in more recent dates which has a very rich millenary organizational tradition has shown incredible dignity and firmness it has gone out to face the coup d etat and developed relevant clashes with dead and wounded it is a people that does not let itself run over and goes out with determination to face the reaction that popular mobilization opens a path not everything is said and the coup has not consolidated some speak of civil war the truth is that the levels of struggle are growing in the altiplano the coup d etat represents not only the project of plundering natural resources under the interests of imperialism but also exalts the most disastrous racist and colonial component of the more than 500 years of submission to indigenous peoples it is a christian racist crusade against the andean amazonian peoples who organized from below and with the whipala as a standard face repression of the army and ultra reactionary attacks with high levels of radicalism the struggle that indigenous peoples are carrying out in defense of the conquests of the people and their dignity suggests that the articulating axis of resistance to the coup in bolivia is the organized people fighting in the streets argentina peronism returns in argentina the triumph of peronism was more adjusted than thought the ultra neoliberal macri recovered 10 points of votes reaching a total of 40 peronism could not exceed 50 the social scenario in which this transfer of government occurs is undoubtedly marked by the enormous social and economic damage caused by the adjustment and hunger policies of the macri government as if that were not enough alberto fernández and the kirchner made repeated calls not to occupy the streets not to mobilize to hold on until december not to destabilize to not generate a new 2001 what was in the debate in these months were two clear strategies in the field of the argentine left to hold on the governance of macri and vacating the streets as the kirchner and related sectors argued by omission and electoral commitment were in this same logic the fit and the pcr and on the other hand a set of social and trade union organizations that promoted the fight in the streets without waiting for the polls betting on a popular solution in argentina the triumph of peronism was more adjusted than thought the ultra neoliberal macri recovered 10 points of votes reaching a total of 40 peronism could not exceed 50 the social scenario in which this transfer of government occurs is

and the pcr and on the other hand a set of social and trade union organizations that promoted the fight in the streets without waiting for the polls betting on a popular solution but that quietism not only allowed macri to regain ground but also prevented an solution to the crisis from below in argentina an attempt was made to place the popular movement after the fernández fernández formula but they could not there were people on the streets and concrete conquests few perhaps but conquests that allow popular organizations to be toned we know that the crude neoliberal advance which hit hard those below during the last years cannot wait for the times of politicking we are aware that the transition of government is marked by repeated attempts by employers to impose a labor reform at all costs and in any way trying to roll back working conditions to the nineteenth century in short this change of government far from being a brake on labor reform can be presented as an opportunity for the dominant sectors to make up these changes under another type of modality clearly more attenuated than what would have happened with a second macri mandate sense will continue to overflow and transcend the proposed solution from above regaining confidence in the very strength of popular organizations uruguay also turns right uruguay on the other hand presented as an oasis of peace and stability by the fa government an image that has expanded throughout the region which is continuity of that switzerland of america also seems to turn right in the october elections the big winner has been the national party they have joined the historic colorado party and the novel cabildo abierto open council a party of military origin made up of former soldiers and others in activity and has grouped almost all fascist groups and personalities that were scattered in different sectors its candidate and main figure is guido manini ríos former commander in chief of the army until a few months ago manini ríos comes from a traditional family of uruguayan politician located in the spectrum of the extreme right his grandfather was the founder of the most conservative sector of the colorado party in 1913 and his uncle was a member of the jup juventud uruguaya de pie fascist clash group in the years before the dictatorship family of landowners politicians and military all from the extreme right guido manini ríos is a friend of former general villas boas of brazil and vice president mourao uruguay on the other hand presented as an oasis of peace and stability by the fa government an image that has expanded throughout the region which is continuity of that switzerland of america also seems to turn right in the october elections the big winner has been the national party they have joined the historic colorado party and the novel cabildo abierto open council a party of military origin made up of former soldiers and others in activity and has grouped almost all fascist groups and

friend of former general villas boas of brazil and vice president mourao this sector cabildo open obtained about 11 of the votes a high vote for a new party linked to the military it is an extremely conservative party and that is clear to the whole of uruguayan society it is a direct ideological option that their voters make in addition in the previous months there were several complaints about neo nazi groups that were joining the open council and whose members were photographed with their leader in addition guido manini ríos has opened a subpoena for having hidden information arising from statements by josé nino gavazzo repressor and torturer under the condor plan directly involved in the disappearance and murder of fellow faus in a court of honor about their participation in murders of militants during the dictatorship this party will have a parliamentary representation of 3 senators and 11 deputies we can say that in uruguay fascism now has its own party all right wing parties support lacalle pou in the second round at the end of november if the national party candidate wins belongs to the herrerismo historically conservative sector he will implement a law of urgent consideration as he has already announced in which among other measures he will promote the dismantling of fuels regressive changes in education and labor relations among other measures for its part the colorado party promotes the chilean model that is pure and hard neoliberalism but to the uruguayan from that combination of factors will emerge the multicolored government program as lacalle pou has called it the broad front also proposes adjustment perhaps more gradual without touching the social areas as they declare but the fiscal deficit is close to 5 and public accounts seem to be complicated by mid 2020 just when a new budget has to be approved debt interest payments due on those dates are an important bottleneck in uruguay two country models are not disputed in these elections the model is only one and the right turn with adjustment and repression too what is defined is the dose the degree of the turn whether it will be more abrupt or not therefore next year is expected adjustment and stick from above but on the other hand from below resistance a wave of rebellion in central america and the caribbean there were great days of protest in puerto rico initiated since july 13 with a march of hal a million people on days 17 and 22 and general strikes they made the governor ricardo roselló and the new progressive party resign due to corruption scandals with humanitarian aid and comments of contempt and discrimination against the population of on the 24th of that same month amid the deep economic crisis experienced on the island there were great days of protest in puerto rico initiated since july 13 with a march of hal a million people on days 17 and 22 and general strikes they made the governor ricardo roselló and the new progressive party resign due to corruption scandals with humanitarian aid and comments of contempt and discrimination against the population of on the 24th of that same month amid the deep economic crisis experienced on the island on the other hand there were various waves of protest in haiti against the government of businessman jovenel moise and the haitian tetkale party which occurred in february june and september in the midst of the deep economic crisis corruption scandals and an agreement of the government with the international monetary fund imf to deepen neoliberal reforms the mobilizations resume the protests against the electoral fraud of 2016 have included violence against the rich neighborhoods of the city of port au prince and various general strikes with the tragic balance of 77 dead likewise the wave of struggles in honduras since october 10 and widespread since day 18 against the government of juan orlando hernández and the national party dotted with corruption and drug trafficking scandals by chapo guzmán himself are still open they followed the fights against electoral fraud in 2017 starring university students and popular sectors the massive popular mobilization in response to the economic crisis active unemployment in the chain of production distribution and services social unrest with unpopular governments permeated by public and private corruption and the contempt of the parliamentary bourgeoisie towards living conditions of the people explain this revitalizing wave of central american and caribbean rebellion that we must support and from which we need to learn the stage that opens from the rebellions in ecuador and chile october brought changes and brought struggle of the peoples it began with the uprising of the ecuadorian people since october 2 there was an extensive popular mobilization in ecuador that achieved an important victory against the neoliberal package promoted by the government of businessman lenin moreno of alianza país resuming the struggles of medical students hunger strikes of teachers and retired electrical workers and civic unemployment in the charqui region october brought changes and brought struggle of the peoples it began with the uprising of the ecuadorian people since october 2 there was an extensive popular mobilization in ecuador that achieved an important victory against the neoliberal package promoted by the government of businessman lenin moreno of alianza país resuming the struggles of medical students hunger strikes of teachers and retired electrical workers and civic unemployment in the charqui region the moreno government deepening the pro market policies developed by rafael correa himself decided to implement in the economic crisis a structural reform agreed with the international monetary fund imf to obtain a loan for 4 200 million dollars that included decree 883 that imposed a drastic increase in the price of gasoline of up to 120 which in turn implied chains from all other economic sectors and a labor reform that imposed a reduction of wages for the majority of temporary employees of the public sector in 20 more than 20 thousand dismissals of state workers 50 reduction of the holiday period as well as mandatory salary confiscations and the advance of a precarious labor reform before the gasoline rise decree the people went out to the street lenin moreno s government reacted by decreeing the state of siege the degree of popular mobilization increased with the strong presence of conaie marching on quito the government went away from the capital and it remained under popular control for several days but let s analyze it in more detail the pack hit workers and the peoples of the country and aroused resistance in the first place it began a short stop of transport businessmen who blocked roads border bridges and urban roads organized in the federation of passenger public transport cooperatives fenacotip that lasted for 48 hours after that it was the important indigenous resistance of communities from mainly the andean zone and to a lesser extent the amazon organized by the confederation of indigenous nationalities of ecuador conaie previously hit by the correista repression which became the effective direction of the movement conaie organized the great march of tens of thousands of people with hundreds of trucks overflowing with participants over the city of quito which managed to fleetingly occupy the national assembly on october 8 and occupy multiple public buildings throughout the country the situation forced the government to move to guayaquil and decree the state of exception curfew in the capital press censorship and militarization of the country thirdly an important labor protest was organized around the unitary workers front fut and important student and popular sectors which developed partial strikes in oil refineries and an important general strike on october 9 the movement had a new peak in the mobilization for the day of the indigenous resistance on october 12 as well as multiple protests in the large cities of the interior with axis in the center of quito where indigenous peasants workers and students occupied the city center and lived in camps organized in parks and private universities there were 11 days of mass protest cacerolazos roadblocks and roads in the middle of the country and hundreds of thousands of people mobilized in the streets with a tragic balance of 11 dead 1300 wounded and 1100 detainees who remembered the heroics rebellions of 1995 and 1997 against neoliberal policies the natives decreed the state of exception in their territory and retained military and police deployed in repressive activities to be tried by their justice institutions at the same time there were burns and looting in some commercial areas amid the government rhetoric of not going backwards with the reforms and propaganda accusations against correa and maduro of a misty destabilization plan finally the very weakened moreno government sat down to negotiate on october 13 with the management of some of the organizations suspending the decree that eliminated fuel subsidies although the other aspects of the package still remain in force although the demand for moreno s resignation did not deepen the government sought to exclude urban unions and organizations from negotiations and the elements of popular self organization did not spread throughout the country the massive protest was important since it meant a re articulation of the popular movement weakened and fragmented by correismo in the midst of increasing its political autonomy and intersectoral unity in this context of rising struggles and seeking popular alternatives to the crisis and neoliberal adjustment a re articulation of some expression of organized anarchism in the country is desirable in short indigenous organizations peasants labor unions students youth are the participants and animators of this popular revolt that put the police and the army in check mobilizations with high levels of confrontation with the repressive forces and with total class independence since the politicians linked to former president correa who were present at the mobilizations were run the people are not willing to be instrumentalized and used by the caste of politicians a popular knowledge of profound implications for the realization of popular power the government had to repeal the decree and reverse its measures a popular victory of a people that has brought down several governments in chile a protest by secondary students with massive underground lanes against the rise in the price of santiago s energy and public transport fares implemented on october 6 was strongly repressed resulting in a day of national rebellion still open especially since the national protests on the 18th of the same month the second government of sebastián piñera and the chile vamos coalition attacked the fairness of the youth protest and prepared for the application of the state security law showing great disregard for the living conditions of the working class and the popular sectors and a closed defense of its neo liberal economic policy heiress of the military civic dictatorship of pinochet and three decades of governments of the consensus and the right the student protest continued and was generalized by the capital increasing the effects on the metro system and sometimes the workers and users of the system the early mobilization of education and health workers was added and later organizations such as the unitary central of workers cut and the confederation of students of chile confech adhered to the mobilization organizing large general strikes such as those of the 4 of november this is how the cacerolazos and mass concentrations were generalized throughout the country such as those experienced since october 20 with expressions such as the march of the 25th of the same month the largest in the country s recent history which gathered about 1 200 000 people in santiago with axis in plaza italia the mobilization of hundreds of thousands of people from viña del mar to the headquarters of the congress in valparaíso on the 27th or the march of the limache settlers who traveled 100 kilometers to santiago the activity of the secondary students massively organized in the coordinating assembly of secondary students aces and national coordinator of secondary students cones was key but movements with a long history of combating the cracked chilean bipartisan regime joined the mapuche people joined conducting concentrations in the araucanía destroying colonial symbols and the movement of women for example in the midst of a popular mobilization similar to the great days of national protest against the dictatorship of 1983 and 1986 and an increase in popular violence with barricades looting and fires on various buildings the piñera government talked about the country being at war and the first lady spoke of an alien invasion the state of exception and curfew was decreed in most cities of the country and a violent repression developed a generalized ill treatment and torture harassment and sexual abuse and repression by police and military forces at the time piñera was forced to repeal the rise in the subway ticket enact minimum social reforms in terms of pension minimum wage and freezing of rates make a cosmetic change of cabinet and engage in political dialogue to achieve a possible constitutional reform although seemingly worn out the day of popular protest in chile is still open and territorial assemblies in public squares schools universities neighborhoods and unions remain under the slogan chile woke up and a growing demand to piñera so far there is an unfortunate balance of 30 dead and 2 000 injured and 5 000 arrested it is noteworthy that the activity of organized anarchists although minority has been important and in the midst of the struggle forms of popular self organization flourished the current movement can achieve important economic and salary conquests press for legislative reforms in transport education pensions or health and lead to a clear increase in the levels of organization mobilization and popular self management the chilean people have cracked 30 years of neoliberalism and the entire post dictatorship heritage the repression was hard but carabineros was overwhelmed by people in the streets that s why piñera decreed the state of exception and the curfew removing the army from the barracks the people challenged both impositions and continued on the street mass mobilizations in urban centers others in neighborhoods barricades demonstrations of anger and rejection of model symbols the people has broken normality in chile with and without a general strike the mobilizations continue in a process of organization and resistance a wide and rich experience accumulates and a new stage opens uncertain but a stage of street people defying power however the leftist parties for the most part are promoting the convening of a constituent assembly that provides chile with a new constitution knocking down the inheritance of the pinochet dictatorship it is a meaningful claim since part of the inheritance of pinochetism is the constitution and the legal order that guarantees and that no government dared to touch including those of the concertación but it enables a solution from above to the crisis opened by popular mobilization it enables the parties of the system to find a solution to the problems of the chileans guaranteeing the same rights to the possessing and dominant classes in the country and to that odious guarantor institution of the bourgeois order that is the army no constitution under capitalism will touch private property in all its terms or guarantee the dismantling of the armed forces nor will it socialize the profits and property of copper the experience of allende and popular unity speaks clearly of its own of the limits that tolerates the bourgeoisie and the empire but the most complex of the constituent is that it places the solution to the hands of the oppressors and those willing to succeed them in their role popular needs and their inevitable deception because there are a thousand ways to circumvent consecrated legal texts in this way the people are placed again as a tail van of the parties of the system of their discussions obliges them to take sides for one of them and set aside the organization and the popular cause it is a corral of branches instead the alternative is in that same down which has shaken and cracked the model a process of unification of popular struggles in search of a crisis solution plan built by popular organizations an articulation of the oppressed from the bottom up building popular power with self management and direct democracy strengthening popular organizations and a process of convergence must be the objectives of the militancy of revolutionary intention we want to be clear when we say popular power we say capacity for action and decision of the people of their grassroots organizations articulated in a federalist way from bottom to top it is a purely popular process outside the state and against it we can mention as historical examples the collectivizations in full spanish revolution the machnovitchina in ukraine during the russian revolution the experience in rojava today but also countless processes that latin american peoples have built and build where the participation of those below is decisive for now the mobilizations continue and that process remains open vast experiences and teachings must be taken out of there because a new stage opens we want to express clearly all our support to the comrades of the santiago anarchist federation chile and the libertarian revolution of la paz bolivia who are inserted in the mobilizations and promoting a work orientation in the midst of the struggle the people s time with the people of ecuador and chile a time of people opens in latin america hopefully other towns rebellions events that can enable pre revolutionary situations or pre announce them in each country at its own pace with its idiosyncrasy and according to each specific situation all this in a medium long term perspective with the people of ecuador and chile a time of people opens in latin america hopefully other towns rebellions events that can enable pre revolutionary situations or pre announce them in each country at its own pace with its idiosyncrasy and according to each specific situation all this in a medium long term perspective a cycle of popular struggles against neoliberalism and its consequences opens because this stage of capitalism of crude neoliberalism generates without a doubt more resistance people in the street given so much dispossession and repression the people mobilize it is not an exclusive right cycle as it has been proclaimed surely the progressivities as we met them until 2015 are coming to an end those that last will change by influence of the right the adjustment imposed from above and the economic limits of the system on a world scale they return for total looting but the one below is fermenting their responses and a really popular solution while the levels of repression will increase the teachings left by the ecuadorian and chilean peoples are clear repression including the armed forces with people on the street and practicing direct action at all levels can be overwhelmed as an example in ecuador a tank was put out of combat by the action of the people it is essential to strengthen popular organizations to contribute in the debates about the ways and paths of change to clarify that the paths the system always opens end in a precipice it is from below that strong people and federalism are built the only organizational mode that relies on popular organizations and not on self chosen avant garde and purportedly enlightened there is no possible solution from above in the areas and institutions of the system those spaces can only serve to the bourgeoisie and the empire change comes from the people and what the people can build with its limitations and problems but it will be much richer than the rotten bourgeois institutions institutions of oppression and death the life and construction of a different society is at stake in that fight we are embarked and organized anarchism the specifism has much to say in proposals for authentic emancipation no to the state hit in bolivia long live the resistance of the peoples to strengthen the fight and popular processes for the construction of popular power for socialism and freedom up those who fight arriba los que luchan federación anarquista uruguaya fau

data released last week underscores how vulnerable the australian economy like many around the world is to the fallout from the aggressive economic war launched by washington against its rivals particularly china largely mirroring international trends australia is mired in slump despite record low interest rates and large tax handouts mostly to companies and the wealthy the impact is hitting working class households the hardest corporate profits and share prices have soared in 2019 but at the expense of falling real wages and rising unemployment and under employment combined with widespread nervousness over the global instability this produced the worst retail and car sales and other household consumption statistics since the 2008 09 global financial crisis business investment also fell sharply in the september quarter desperate to provide good news many media outlets and the liberal national government claimed that the results confirmed the reserve bank of australia s rba proclamation of a gentle turning point after months of recessionary conditions however the gross domestic product gdp rose only 0 4 percent in the quarter an annual rate of 1 6 percent the three month result was down from 0 6 percent in the june quarter and 0 5 percent in the march quarter the september quarter result was well short of the government s budget forecasts which were 2 25 percent for 2018 19 and 2 75 percent for 2019 20 the rba has cut interest rates three times in the months after the may federal election to a record low of 0 75 percent and the government paid out nearly 5 billion in income tax rebates yet consumer spending rose just 0 1 percent the poorest result since the 2008 09 meltdown reflecting the nervous mood spending shrank 0 3 percent on discretionary items such as new cars clothing and footwear and cigarettes any growth was concentrated on essentials led by health and rent separately calculated retail figures showed that in the three months to september the volume of goods and services bought fell 0 1 percent that trend continued in october with clothing home wares and department stores sales falling the retail sector had already suffered its worst 12 month period since the 1991 recession in another sign of consumer hardship sales of new cars fell 9 8 percent in november the 20th monthly decline in a row according to the federal chamber of automotive industries suffering one of the highest levels of household debt in the world nearly twice as much debt as income on average many consumers evidently decided to try to reduce their indebtedness over the year to september inflation adjusted spending grew by a mere 1 2 percent also the least since the 2008 09 financial crisis australia s population grew by 1 6 percent in that time meaning the volume of goods and services bought per person went backward a significant economic indicator was a 2 1 percent drop in business investment during the september quarter with mining investment tumbling 7 8 percent non mining investment rose 1 2 percent but was still stuck around 25 year lows these trends point to further contraction ahead profits are being poured into the stock market and other speculative operations not production and research and development in the anxious words of the australian financial review stock exchange indexes have been volatile amid fears that us president donald trump could hit every second nation with tariffs china of course but now argentina and brazil and possibly everyone in nato even so the newspaper warned the benchmark asx 200 index remained about 20 per cent higher for the year to date way out of line with the underlying slump private sector activity consumption and business investment is at recession levels the financial newspaper said only mining exports population growth and government spending were keeping the economy afloat government spending grew 0 9 percent in the quarter and 6 percent over the year mostly on infrastructure projects demanded by big business despite chronic underfunding government outlays also rose on health disability and aged care costs the gdp figures strengthened the betting on the financial markets that the rba will be forced to cut interest rates again at its first meeting for 2020 in february most corporate economists reportedly expect another cut will follow in the ensuing months taking official rates down to 0 25 percent far below the emergency 3 percent level reached in 2009 company profits were up 2 2 percent in the quarter and 12 7 percent over the year average wage and superannuation payments grew at about half those rates 1 2 percent and 5 1 percent and even that statistic covers over the wage cutting that is affecting low paid workers in insecure jobs the only discernible effect of the record low interest rates has been to fuel a new rise in house prices in the two most populous cities sydney and melbourne partially reversing the collapse of the housing bubble that prevented a slide into recession between 2012 and 2018 at the same time insufficient housing is being built for a growing population housing investment was down 1 7 percent over the september quarter and 9 6 percent over the year rising prices has made home ownership impossible for many young people and put upward pressure on rents there was another glaring problem even though profits and stock prices rose gdp per hour worked which is a measure of productivity fell 0 2 percent during the september quarter and 0 2 percent over the year another result of the lack of productive investment extreme weather conditions bound up with climate change also had an impact drought affected farm production fell 2 1 percent over the quarter and 6 1 percent over the year all this means that the jobs situation is likely to deteriorate employment fell by 19 000 jobs in october taking the official jobless rate to 5 3 percent and the underemployment rate to 8 5 per cent as measured by the roy morgan polling company nearly 1 1 million australians were unemployed 7 8 percent with an additional 1 2 million 8 9 percent under employed while the government boasts of creating 1 5 million jobs since 2013 this simply reflects population growth plus a rise in workforce participation as older workers postpone retirement because of mortgage debts low superannuation balances and poor returns on any savings due to ultra low interest rates taken as a whole these results mean that prime minister scott morrison s government is under increasing pressure from the financial elite to cut government spending to avert a budget deficit and mount an offensive against workers conditions in order to drive up the rate of exploitation last month credit ratings agency s p global told the government that any increased spending could threaten the country s triple a rating as the official cash rate in australia moves toward zero there have been growing calls for the government to increase fiscal stimulus including infrastructure spending to stimulate and support the slowing economy it said before warning while spending initiatives are likely to support the economy they re also likely to weaken australia s fiscal flexibility to respond to future unforeseen economic shocks

it was perhaps a less complex world when paul volcker employed his draconian approach to us monetary policy in the early 1980s but some of his principles and values could be usefully applied in this post crisis era of unconventional policies that produce meagre outcomes and plenty of unintended consequences paul volcker was credited with breaking the back of inflation in the us by holding fast to his convictions despite ferocious criticism and abuse credit bloomberg volcker who died aged 92 in new york on sunday was the chairman of the federal reserve board who slew what had been double digit inflation in the us after the two oil crises of the 1970s before succeeding william miller as chair in 1979 volcker famously told then us president jimmy carter pointing to miller that you have to understand if you appoint me i favour a tighter policy than that fellow he quickly followed through on his implicit promise to ratchet up us interest rates with the prime lending rate the rate banks charged their best borrowers hitting 21 5 per cent in 1980
rttnews the major u s index futures have recently turned positive and are currently pointing to a higher open for the markets on tuesday the futures turned positive after a report from the wall street journal said the u s plans to delay imposing additional tariffs on chinese goods citing officials on both sides the journal said negotiators are laying the groundwork for delaying the tariffs set to kick in on december 15th as they continue to haggle over getting china to commit to massive purchases of u s farm products the report from the wsj comes after an earlier report from the south china morning post said a trade deal between the u s and china is unlikely to be completed this week however the scmp said sources close to the talks do not expect the tariffs planned for december 15th to take effect adding to a growing chorus on both sides who expect de escalation this week the uncertainty about the trade deal may still lead to light trading on wall street as traders look ahead to the federal reserve s monetary policy announcement on wednesday after showing a lack of direction early in the session stocks moved moderately lower over the course of the trading day on monday the major averages slid more firmly into negative territory snapping a three day winning streak the major averages saw further downside going into the close ending the session just off their lows of the day the dow slid 105 46 points or 0 4 percent to 27 909 60 the nasdaq fell 34 70 points or 0 4 percent to 8 621 83 and the s p 500 dropped 9 95 points or 0 3 percent to 3 135 96 the weakness that emerged on wall street came as some traders looked to cash in on the recent strength in the markets which helped lift the major averages back within striking distance of the record highs set late last month lingering uncertainty about u s china trade talks also weighed on wall street as new 15 percent tariffs on 165 billion worth of chinese imports are currently still set to take effect this coming sunday the new round of tariffs could throw a wrench into negotiations over a phase on trade deal which is reportedly being held up in part by a dispute over how much to roll back existing tariffs rising tensions between the u s and north korea also led to some caution among traders after north korea conducted a very important test at a long range missile launch site president donald trump warned north korean leader kim jong un risks losing everything if he acts in a hostile way leading a north korean official to describe the president as a heedless and erratic old man nonetheless overall trading activity remained somewhat subdued with traders looking ahead to the federal reserve s monetary policy announcement on wednesday the fed is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged although traders are still likely to pay close attention to the accompanying statement for clues about the outlook for rates a lack of major u s economic data also kept some traders on the sidelines ahead of the release of reports on retail sales and consumer and producer prices in the coming days despite the pullback by the broader markets most of the major sectors finished the session

as supermarkets are set on fire and churches are desecrated chile s recent wave of protests have sullied the otherwise solid image of latin america s most stable democracy since early october protesters have clogged the streets of santiago and other cities railing against recent metro fare hikes while voicing concerns about stagnant wages and a high cost of living some of these grievances behind these protests are valid however the million dollar question surrounding every mass political protest is how will the protesters go about solving these problems the default answer protesters are turning to usually involves having a stronger state presence in the economy recent protests in chile have indicated this in 2012 chileans protested against the nations economic model by singling out chile s education system and deriding the private control of the country s copper industry unsurprisingly they turned to the typical talking points of denouncing inequality and profit seeking to solve the alleged injustices of this system they clamored for free education and the nationalization of the country s copper industry indeed chile s higher education system is heterodox in terms of public and private universities thanks to its nominal market features it quickly became one of latin america s premier university systems from 1992 to 2012 the number of chileans going through secondary education grew from two hundred thousand to 1 2 million nevertheless the protesters insisted the system was unjust and pressed on for more government control if chile took its market ethos seriously the education system should have been liberalized so that chileans have more education options be they luxury or budget at their convenience when sebastian piñera was elected in 2010 marking the first time chile had a democratically elected right wing government in decades people had high expectations for his government there was hope that piñera would bring chile to first world standards despite the hype piñera s administration was quite lackluster it did have some shining moments when piñera s government decided to reduce waiting times for environmental impact studies rolling back unnecessary red tape cutting import tariffs and reducing the amount of time to set up a business however piñera raised corporate taxes from 17 percent to 20 percent in 2013 and he tried to placate the hordes of student protesters by guaranteeing scholarships for the bottom 60 percent of the population and 2 percent real interest rate loans for everyone except the richest 10 percent there was no real effort on piñera s part to continue liberalizing the economy to his credit piñera still maintained a modicum of restraint which allowed chile to coast along and continue growing all things considered piñera s first administration was a disappointment for anyone who believed he could usher in substantial free market reforms when michelle bachelet entered the picture things started to take a negative turn her government hiked corporate tax rates tried to undermine chile s higher education system and used public administration to empower labor unions most importantly however was her use of the bully pulpit to change the overall narrative surrounding chile s political economy not only did she condemn the model for allegedly producing high levels of wealth inequality she took it a step further by suggesting a potential change of the constitutional order via the constituent assembly after chile s economy dragged along during the bachelet years voters decided to pull the lever for piñera again sadly the economy has still lagged and piñera reversed his campaign promise to cut the same corporate taxes that his predecessor raised furthermore he is taking up progressive hobby horses such as enshrining women s rights in the constitution and using state funds to undermine chile s privatized pension system by then free market sympathizers quickly realized that piñera was orchestrating a replay of his milquetoast first term as president with widespread unrest before him the administration is now being forced to traverse uncharted waters piñera is already wavering by promising a new social contract which includes minimum wage hikes tax increases on the country s wealthiest individuals and more state involvement in chile s pension system given how voracious leftist activists in chile have become they will not be satisfied by piñera s concessions in all likelihood piñera may give in to pressure and initiate a constituent assembly which could bring unprecedented levels of institutional instability to chile if there is any flaw with the chilean constitution it s that it doesn t go far enough in creating a genuine separation of economy and state nevertheless it has served as a bulwark of stability in a region noted for its wiki constitutionalism where constitutions are re written virtually every generation just look at countries like venezuela it has had twenty six constitutions in its nearly two hundred years of existence as a nation which may be the most salient institutional factor explaining venezuela s current political calamity chile on the other hand has only had eight constitutions throughout its history the necessity of countries having sound institutional grounding cannot be overstated all changes to the chilean constitution should be done through amendments emphasizing decentralization not the creation of a whole new constitution centralization is a controversial issue in chilean politics there is a common perception among the populace that politics in chile revolves around the capital city of santiago and the other regions are generally ignored the santiago metropolitan region is populated by more than 6 million people about a third of the country s total population additionally almost 90 percent of the population lives within 200 miles of the greater santiago area the organisation for economic co operation and development has also caught on to chile s hyper centralization by observing that the santiago metro area accounted for 40 percent of national gdp growth from 2000 to 2016 similarly subnational governments carried out 12 5 percent of public investment compared to the oecd average of 56 9 percent the current governor of the central bank of chile argued in his previous stint with the oecd that chile s regions are more concerned about obtaining benefits from the central government as opposed to developing their own identities and unveiling innovative policies at the local level say what you want about the oecd s long track record of advocating for higher taxation and social spending they re on the mark regarding chile s excessive centralization instead of going through a constitutional change which will likely move towards a system that emphasizes political centralization and the usurpation of civil liberties chile should give political decentralization a try this will allow for more jurisdictional competition and a more localist approach to the many problems it is facing now the question is will piñera bow down to leftist demands to create a constituent assembly or will he break the mold by offering an innovative model of decentralization it s anyone s guess however the history of latin america is filled with tragic stories of countries reaching great heights argentina and venezuela come to mind and then falling back to mediocrity to keep the chilean success story going piñera will have to take bold action this means ruffling a few of the political class s feathers by gutting the chilean state and bringing power back to the people hopefully piñera comes to his senses and understands what s at stake with the right policy decisions a very predictable political crisis could be avoided

mahreen khan and helen dempster bangladesh provides a significant global public good by hosting over one million rohingya refugees most are living in camps in cox s bazar district where local resources and livelihoods are strained the refugee situation is likely to be protracted and medium term planning is critical cgd has been working with local and international partners to understand what that medium term response could look like this is one of five publications where we outline steps for developing a medium term plan for bangladesh to benefit refugees and their host community alike the other four cover forest and landscape restoration policy priorities trade and private sector investment executive summary cox s bazar one of bangladesh s most climate vulnerable and economically disadvantaged regions is hosting over a million rohingya refugees from neighboring myanmar the vast majority are concentrated in refugee camps in cox s bazar s ukhia and teknaf subdistricts where refugees outnumber the local population nearly three to one in a region where a third of the local population lives below the poverty line the additional pressure of the refugee crisis poses significant economic and social challenges such as increased cost of living labor market effects climate vulnerability competition for limited public resources and security risks while the ultimate goal remains safe voluntary and dignified repatriation of the refugees back to myanmar realistic scenarios for repatriation show significant numbers of rohingya will remain in bangladesh for more than 10 years consequently there is growing interest in trying to move beyond the existing short term aid based solutions to inclusive medium term approaches that include economic environmental and human development in the region this latter set of approaches can serve the interests of both host and refugee communities in cox s bazar while also contributing to bangladesh s long term development agenda in this note we discuss one of these approaches promoting labor mobility agreements with a strong link to employment oriented skills development for bangladeshis and rohingya such interventions can enable the government of bangladesh gob to mitigate the economic stress of the crisis at the local and national level while expanding on mutually beneficial labor migration opportunities which continue to be a focus of bangladesh s national development agenda these approaches will ensure the international community supports bangladesh in addressing the rohingya crisis referred to here as responsibility sharing we present three ways in which labor mobility agreements complemented by employment oriented skills development initiatives could support host communities in cox s bazar rohingya refugees and bangladesh s national development objectives 1 upskill the host community under a global skill partnership model labor mobility opportunities remain underutilized due to a mismatch between demand in countries of destination and the supply of bangladeshi migrant workers with the competencies and experience needed to meet that demand the global skill partnership model addresses this skills mismatch a global skill partnership is a bilateral agreement between a country of origin and a country of destination whereby the latter invests in the training of migrants in the former before they move in targeted skills needed in both countries some trainees remain in the country of origin the home track increasing human capital while others move to the country of destination the away track plugging skills gaps and increasing their incomes a global skill partnership pilot in cox s bazar could train locals and build on existing skill development initiatives funded through bilateral official development assistance oda and negotiated with countries like canada the united kingdom the united states japan south korea and those in the european union eu the model is designed to address specific skill shortages in countries of destination while granting them greater control over the migration process these countries could work with the gob to create special provisions for inclusion of the rohingya community as part of the home track this would allow the refugees to contribute economically to myanmar if repatriated or to bangladesh if temporary work permits can be made available 2 extend labor mobility agreements with gulf cooperation council and east and southeast asian countries international labor migration is an integral part of bangladesh s current and future development and growth strategy initiatives to extend labor mobility agreements can thus serve a dual purpose promoting economic benefits and enhancing responsibility sharing on the first such migration can benefit migrants directly through alternative sources of income while also supporting their families and local economies through remittances and contributing more broadly to bangladesh s foreign exchange reserves on the second improving access to employment abroad may moderately mitigate competition for wages and resources in cox s bazar if locals from that area are preferentially selected more importantly this approach shows solidarity with bangladeshi host communities a narrative that could help ease the recent rise in social tension while this approach is theoretically possible with all the gulf cooperation council gcc and newly industrialized east and southeast asian countries in this note we focus on countries that already have bilateral labor mobility agreements in place with bangladesh have expressed some commitment to responsibility sharing and have demonstrated mutual benefit from such arrangements consequently we focus on the kingdom of saudi arabia ksa united arab emirates uae and qatar among the gcc countries and malaysia south korea japan and hong kong special administrative regime sar in the east and southeast asian region 3 promote limited labor migration opportunities for rohingya refugees in addition to traditional refugee resettlement a final option would be to explore new opportunities for the direct labor migration for the rohingya through programs such as talent beyond boundaries tbb tbb is conducting a pilot for a small number of syrian refugees based in lebanon and jordan matching them with employment opportunities in canada and australia with plans for expansion into the middle east while tbb is still in the initial phases of its operation 10 to 15 families are currently in the program a similar pilot for a small number of applicants could be applied to the rohingya population creating pathways to citizenship and or permanent resettlement in a third country a full mapping of skills as a first step could help identify potential candidates for such a pilot additionally given the low literacy levels among the rohingya a tbb pilot could be linked to local skills training programs helping refugees in the camps develop the necessary profiles over time resettlement initiatives such as this can benefit bangladesh by reducing pressure and increasing remittances all the labor mobility options presented above must account for the rohingya population s preferences for mobility ensure safe working conditions and provide accessible and affordable opportunities through an overhauled intermediation system provided these conditions are met the above options provide a way forward for members of the international community who are committed to share responsibility with

through the successful implementation of the acordionero field wide waterflood and the ongoing positive results achieved with our infill development well program at costayaco we plan to ramp up production at acordionero to over 20 000 bopd during 2020 resulting in strong and stable free cash flow2 in addition we are excited that the development drilling at acordionero has extended the field limits to the south also costayaco drilling has confirmed our reservoir modeling predictions of unswept oil pools within the field and added immediate production and confidence in future development to enhance oil recovery during 2019 our production was temporarily impacted in the southern putumayo region and at the acordionero oil field in the middle magdalena valley basin we believe we have mitigated the risks of these types of disruptions in the future the 2019 production issues at acordionero have been addressed through the expansion of our production facilities significant increase in

current average level of 3 734 bopd average since december 2 2019 cocona 1 exploration well in put 1 block 100 wi this exploration well was spud on november 27 2019 and is currently at 2 015 ft md cocona 1 is expected to reach its planned total depth of approximately 11 000 ft md by the end of 2019 cocona 1 is a multi zone prospect with potential in the n and u sands and the a limestone this well is the first follow up drilled by gran tierra on put 1 since the vonu 1 exploration well which has been gran tierra s most successful a limestone well to date and tests a potentially significant extension of the fracture limestone play fairway the vonu 1 well has produced approximately 857 000 bbls of oil from the a limestone from june 2017 to november 2019 and had initial 30 day average production of 1 758 bopd 30 day average of 30 degree api oil a gor of 407 scf stb and a watercut of less than 1 the well is still producing over 400 bopd with less than1 water cut and a gor of 1 214

the u sand oil production rate was showing signs of stabilizing the costayaco 19 well in the adjacent chaza block has produced approximately 763 000 bbls of oil from the a limestone from may 2016 to november 2019 gran tierra predicts that the cocona 1 well may encounter the same faulted and fractured trend in the a limestone from which the vonu 1 and costayaco 19 wells have produced natural fracturing of the a limestone appears to significantly enhance its oil productivity and expected ultimate recovery if cocona 1 is successful in the a limestone this well may have positive implications for the size of the a limestone s ultimate potential in this region of the northern putumayo basin and the possibility of additional follow up drilling locations on the put 1 block and adjacent chaza

january 29 2020 gary guidry president and chief executive officer of gran tierra further commented our 100 working interest in and operatorship of our major assets gives us the flexibility to pace our 2020 development program with no projected impact on ultimate oil recovery efficiency we are choosing to slow the pace of our infill development drilling programs at acordionero costayaco and moqueta while funding exploration and generating free cash flow2 to strengthen our balance sheet this flexibility also allows us to optimize our programs with changes in oil prices with our 2020 operating expense budget we are targeting decreases in both our unit operating and workover costs per boe compared to 2019 as we utilize past investments in acordionero s expanded production facilities and the reliable and more cost effective power we are now generating from our natural gas production at acordionero and costayaco we believe that gran tierra has a self funding and sustainable business model

natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalent of six to one utilizing a boe conversion ratio of 6 mcf 1 bbl would be misleading as an indication of value this press release contains certain oil and gas metrics including operating netback which do not have standardized meanings or standard methods of calculation and therefore such measures may not be comparable to similar

these non gaap measures do not have a standardized meaning under gaap investors are cautioned that these measures should not be construed as an alternative to net income or loss or other measures of financial performance as determined in accordance with gaap gran tierra s method of calculating these measures may differ from other companies and accordingly it may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies these non gaap financial measures are presented along with the corresponding gaap measure so as to not imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non gaap measure gran tierra is unable to provide forward looking net income and oil and gas sales the gaap measures most directly comparable to the non gaap measures ebitda and operating netback respectively due to the impracticality of quantifying certain components required by gaap as a result of the inherent volatility in the value of certain financial instruments held by the company and the inability to quantify the effectiveness of commodity price derivatives used to manage the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of its oil production and changes in commodity prices

quantities of petroleum estimated as of a given date to be potentially recoverable from undiscovered accumulations by application of future development projects prospective resources have both an associated chance of discovery and a chance of development not all exploration projects will result in discoveries the chance that an exploration project will result in the discovery of petroleum is referred to as the chance of discovery thus for an undiscovered accumulation the chance of commerciality is the product of two risk components the chance of discovery and the chance of development there is no certainty that any portion of the prospective resources will be discovered if discovered there is no certainty that it will be commercially viable to produce any portion of the prospective resources unless otherwise specified estimates of the company s prospective resources are based upon the gte mcdaniel prospective resources report the estimates of prospective resources provided in this press release are estimates only and there is no guarantee that the estimated prospective resources will be recovered actual resources may be greater than or less than the estimates provided in this in this press release and the differences may be material there is no assurance that the forecast price and cost assumptions applied by mcdaniel in evaluating gran tierra s prospective resources will be attained and variances could be material there is no uncertainty that any portion of the prospective resources will be discovered if discovered there is no certainty that it will be commercially viable to produce any portion of the prospective resources estimates of prospective resources are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved reserves and would require substantial capital spending over a significant number of years to implement recovery actual locations drilled and quantities that may be ultimately recovered from our properties will differ substantially in addition we have made no commitment to drill and likely will not drill all of the drilling locations that have been attributable to these quantities the following classification of prospective resources is used in this press release low estimate means there is at least a 90 percent probability p90 that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the low estimate best estimate means there is at least a 50 percent probability p50 that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the best estimate high estimate means there is at least a 10 percent probability p10 that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the high estimate mean estimate represents the arithmetic average of the expected recoverable volume it is the most accurate single point representation of the volume distribution ayombero prospective resources estimates of the company s prospective resources in the ayombero prospect are prepared by mcdaniel in accordance with ni 51 101 and cogeh as of july 31 2018 prospective resources within the ayombero prospect are estimated based on 3d seismic and the drilling of the ayombero 1 well as well as production from the chuira field prospective resources have been assigned to three horizons within the la luna formation the galembo the pujamana and the salada positive factors for the ayombero prospective resources include thick good quality reservoir exists within the la luna formation based on testing of the ayombero 1 well to date gran tierra is currently producing oil from the galembo member the ayombero 1 well is believed to be producing from the same structure as the wells in the chuira field from which gran tierra has existing production negative factors for the ayombero prospective resources include the structure is complex with potential seal risks in certain areas poor quality of data obtained in 3d seismic shoots to date chance of discovery development through an evaluation of the risks that are relevant to the ayombero prospective resources which are described herein mcdaniel has determined that the overall chance of discovery is 51 the corresponding chance of development is 90 prospect maturity the prospective resources associated with the ayombero structure have been sub classified as a prospect cogeh defines prospect as a potential accumulation within a play that is sufficiently well defined to present a viable drilling target other information given the uncertainty of discovery associated with such prospective resources costs and timelines to production as well as recovery technologies cannot be determined at this time disclosure of reserve information and cautionary note to u s investors in this press release the company uses the term prospective resources the sec

it was perhaps a less complex world when paul volcker employed his draconian approach to us monetary policy in the early 1980s but some of his principles and values could be usefully applied in this post crisis era of unconventional policies that produce meagre outcomes and plenty of unintended consequences paul volcker was credited with breaking the back of inflation in the us by holding fast to his convictions despite ferocious criticism and abuse credit bloomberg volcker who died aged 92 in new york on sunday was the chairman of the federal reserve board who slew what had been double digit inflation in the us after the two oil crises of the 1970s before succeeding william miller as chair in 1979 volcker famously told then us president jimmy carter pointing to miller that you have to understand if you appoint me i favour a tighter policy than that fellow he quickly followed through on his implicit promise to ratchet up us interest rates with the prime lending rate the rate banks charged their best borrowers hitting 21 5 per cent in 1980

said since october 2019 we have increased the company s total production by approximately 10 or 3 000 boepd to a current average level of over 35 000 boepd we are delivering this resumption of production growth through the successful implementation of the acordionero field wide waterflood and the ongoing positive results achieved with our infill development well program at costayaco we plan to ramp up production at acordionero to over 20 000 bopd during 2020 resulting in strong and stable free cash flow2 in addition we are excited that the development drilling at acordionero has extended the field limits to the south also costayaco drilling has confirmed our reservoir modeling predictions of unswept oil pools within the field and added immediate production and confidence in future development to enhance oil recovery during 2019 our production was temporarily impacted in the southern putumayo region and at the acordionero oil field in the middle magdalena valley basin we believe we have mitigated the risks of these types of disruptions in the future the 2019 production issues at acordionero have been addressed through the expansion of our production facilities significant increase in water injection and installation of gas to power turbines which are delivering cheaper and more reliable power we continue to see no issues with the long term reservoir performance in our main fields at acordionero costayaco moqueta and cohembi our 2020 capital budget is a balanced returns focused program which prioritizes free cash flow2 generation over the rate of development and production growth we plan to direct free cash flow2 to debt reduction and share buybacks with priority given to debt reduction we still see material upside in our exploration portfolio located in highly prospective geological trends in colombia and ecuador we have budgeted a measured yet robust high impact exploration campaign mostly directed at our large landholdings in the putumayo basin of colombia and oriente basin of ecuador our 2020 plans are also aligned with gran tierra s beyond compliance policy which focuses on our commitments to environmental social and governance excellence

january 29 2020 gary guidry president and chief executive officer of gran tierra further commented our 100 working interest in and operatorship of our major assets gives us the flexibility to pace our 2020 development program with no projected impact on ultimate oil recovery efficiency we are choosing to slow the pace of our infill development drilling programs at acordionero costayaco and moqueta while funding exploration and generating free cash flow2 to strengthen our balance sheet this flexibility also allows us to optimize our programs with changes in oil prices with our 2020 operating expense budget we are targeting decreases in both our unit operating and workover costs per boe compared to 2019 as we utilize past investments in acordionero s expanded production facilities and the reliable and more cost effective power we are now generating from our natural gas production at acordionero and costayaco we believe that gran tierra has a self funding and sustainable business model with an excellent colombian and ecuadorian portfolio to generate ongoing growth on a per share basis in terms of net asset value production reserves and cash flow1 we are currently evaluating

looking gaap measure because management cannot reliably predict certain of the necessary components of such forward looking gaap measure prospective resources prospective resources are those quantities of petroleum estimated as of a given date to be potentially recoverable from undiscovered accumulations by application of future development projects prospective resources have both an associated chance of discovery and a chance of development not all exploration projects will result in discoveries the chance that an exploration project will result in the discovery of petroleum is referred to as the chance of discovery thus for an undiscovered accumulation the chance of commerciality is the product of two risk components the chance of discovery and the chance of development there is no certainty that any portion of the prospective resources will be discovered if discovered there is no certainty that it will be commercially viable to produce any portion of the prospective resources unless otherwise specified estimates of the company s prospective resources are based upon the gte mcdaniel prospective resources report the estimates of prospective resources provided in this press release are estimates only and there is no guarantee that the estimated prospective resources will be recovered actual resources may be greater than or less than the estimates provided in this in this press release and the differences may be material there is no assurance that the forecast price and cost assumptions applied by mcdaniel in evaluating gran tierra s prospective resources will be attained and variances could be material there is no uncertainty that any portion of the prospective resources will be discovered if discovered there is no certainty that it will be commercially viable to produce any portion of the prospective resources estimates of prospective resources are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved reserves and would require substantial capital spending over a significant number of years to implement recovery actual locations drilled and quantities that may be ultimately recovered from our properties will differ substantially in addition we have made no commitment to drill and likely will not drill all of the drilling locations that have been attributable to these quantities the following classification of prospective resources is used in this press release low estimate means there is at least a 90 percent probability p90 that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the low estimate best estimate means there is at least a 50 percent probability p50 that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the best estimate high estimate means there is at least a 10 percent probability p10 that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the high estimate mean estimate represents the arithmetic average of the expected recoverable volume it is the most accurate single point representation of the volume distribution ayombero prospective resources estimates of the company s prospective resources in the ayombero prospect are prepared by mcdaniel in accordance with ni 51 101 and cogeh as of july 31 2018 prospective resources within the ayombero prospect are estimated based on 3d seismic and the drilling of the ayombero 1 well as well as production from the chuira field prospective resources have been assigned to three horizons within the la luna formation the galembo the pujamana and the salada positive factors for the ayombero prospective resources include thick good quality reservoir exists within the la luna formation based on testing of the ayombero 1 well to date gran tierra is currently producing oil from the galembo member the ayombero 1 well is believed to be producing from the same structure as the wells in the chuira field from which gran tierra has existing production negative factors for the ayombero prospective resources include the structure is complex with potential seal risks in certain areas poor quality of data obtained in 3d seismic shoots to date chance of discovery development through an evaluation of the risks that are relevant to the ayombero prospective resources which are described herein mcdaniel has determined that the overall chance of discovery is 51 the corresponding chance of development is 90 prospect maturity the prospective resources associated with the ayombero structure have been sub classified as a prospect cogeh defines prospect as a potential accumulation within a play that is sufficiently well defined to present a viable drilling target other information given the uncertainty of discovery associated with such prospective resources costs and timelines to production as well as recovery

vail resorts inc nyse mtn q1 2020 earnings call 5 00 p m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks operator good day and welcome to the vail resorts first quarter fiscal 2020 earnings conference call today s conference is being recorded at this time i d like to turn the conference over to mr katz please go ahead sir robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer thank you good afternoon everyone welcome to our fiscal 2020 first quarterearnings conference call joining me on the call this afternoon is michael barkin our chief financial officer before we begin let me remind you that some information provided during this call may include forward looking statements that are based on certain assumptions and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties as described in our sec filings and actual future results may vary materially forward looking statements in our press release issued this afternoon along with our remarks on this call are made as of today december 9 2019 and we undertake no duty to update them as actual events unfold today s remarks also include certain non gaap financial measures reconciliations of these measures are provided in the tables included with our press release which along with our quarterly report on form 10 q were filed this afternoon with the sec and are also available on the investor relations section of our website www vailresorts com so with that said let s turn to our fiscal 2020 first quarter results overall we are pleased with our results in the first fiscal quarter our australian resorts delivered a strong performance with another record year at perisher on an australian dollar basis and very strong results in our first year of operations in falls creek and hotham our strong epic australia pass sales good conditions and the addition of the leichhardt chairlift at perisher supported our continued momentum in the australian market our consolidated results from perisher were negatively impacted by the strong us dollar which created an approximate 2 million resort reported ebitda headwind from currency translation in the quarter relative to the prior year results whistler blackcomb s summer business performed very well with strong performance in its world class mountain biking operations and sightseeing supported by the addition of the new cloudraker skybridge our us epic discovery business continues to grow and generate strong financial returns our lodging business experienced mixed results with continued success from our properties at grand teton lodge company partially offset by softer results at our colorado properties in part due to weaker group demand in comparison to the prior year period turning now to our 2019 2020 north american pass sales for our resorts and early season indicators as we approach the end of our selling period season pass sales for the north american ski season are up approximately 17 in sales dollars and approximately 22 in units through december 2 2019 compared to the prior year period ended december 3 2018 the results include military pass sales and peak resorts pass sales in both periods and are adjusted to eliminate the impact of foreign currency by applying an exchange rate of 0 75 between the canadian dollar and us dollar in both periods for whistler blackcomb pass sales excluding sales of military passes season pass sales increased approximately 16 in sales dollars and approximately 22 in units over the comparable prior year period as we expected growth in sales dollars was lower than our unit growth primarily from the inclusion of our epic day pass products we are very pleased to see the strong sales growth in our season pass program that exceeded our expectations we continue to see very strong growth in our northeast markets which are benefiting from the first full year of pass sales with unlimited access at stowe okemo and mount sunapee the recent addition of peak resorts and the improved impact of the expanded guest data and insight we now have in that region our destination markets outside of the north east also saw very strong growth and continue to perform well through our enhanced ability to reach destination guests with our data driven marketing and the introduction of the epic day pass our local markets continue to show solid overall growth driven by favorable results among our local guests in the whistler blackcomb region with particular strength in seattle from the first full pass sales season with access to stevens pass we are also seeing strong results from our northern california and utah guests sales in our colorado local market were softer with solid results in our epic products offset with declines in certain regional products which was expected without arapahoe basin on those passes those declines will be more than offset by lower partnership payments the majority of our sales growth came from our epic and epic local products where we saw solid growth in new pass holders and renewing pass holders with less trade down to epic day pass than we were expecting epic day pass was a strong success in its first year with an expanded product offering and was a significant contributor to our overall growth and exceeded our expectations particularly in the epic two and three day products we believe this bodes very well for the long term opportunity of epic day pass as we begin to highlight the incredible value to lower frequency guests importantly the vast majority of epic day pass sales came from new pass holders with particular success in destination markets our military program delivered strong growth with the program continuing to generate strong renewal rates while also adding new pass holders we expect that the total number of guests on all advanced purchase passes this year will exceed 1 2 million including all us canadian and australian passes and epic day pass representing an incredible group of highly loyal and passionate guests overall lodging bookings for the season are largely in line with prior year bookings based on historical averages around half of the bookings for the winter season have been made by this time though it is important to note that our lodging bookings represent a small portion of the overall lodging inventory around our resorts the early season experience at our resorts has been encouraging with strong conditions across our colorado tahoe and northeastern resorts both keystone and vail have benefited from early snow and our recent snowmaking investments which allowed keystone to open on october 12 and vail to open on october 15 and deliver a much improved experience to guests over thanksgiving our resorts in tahoe and utah have opened with typical conditions for this time of year and our northeast resorts have started strong with certain resorts opening weeks earlier than in prior years we are thrilled to welcome guests to all of our resorts as the 2019 2020 north american ski season kicks off with several transformational enhancements to the guest experience at our resorts in colorado we have made significant investments in our snowmaking systems that have transformed the early season terrain experience at vail keystone and beaver creek as a result of these investments keystone experienced it s earliest opening in more than 20 years and vail opened earlier than usual with an improved terrain offering available at opening elevating the experience for our guests at park city we transformed the tombstone express area with a new permanent tombstone barbecue restaurant and the new four person over and out lift that provides a quicker more direct route for skiers and riders to access canyons village from the center of the resort in addition we completed a full renovation of the beaver creek children s ski school facilities and improvements to the peak 8 base area at breckenridge with new ski school and child care facilities as well as an improved ticket and retail and rental experience we remain highly focused on investments that will substantially improve the guest experience across our resorts and implemented a new mobile lift ticket fulfillment technology that eliminates the ticket window for guests who purchase their tickets in advance we also completed one of the final stages of our point of sale modernization project and invested in technology to automate our data driven marketing efforts we completed significant one time investments across the acquired resorts of crested butte okemo and stevens pass which included replacing and upgrading the daisy and brooks lifts at stevens pass and the teocalli lift at crested butte as well as on mountain restaurant upgrades at okemo now i would like to turn the call over to michael to further discuss our financial results and our fiscal 2020 outlook michael z barkin executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks rob and good afternoon everyone as rob mentioned we are pleased with our first quarter performance resort net revenue was 263 6 million in the first fiscal quarter an increase of 43 7 million compared to the prior year resort reported ebitda was a loss of 76 7 million in the first fiscal quarter which compares to a resort reported ebitda loss of 72 5 million in the same period in the prior year fiscal 2020 first quarter resort reported ebitda included 9 million of acquisition and integration related expenses and approximately 2 million of unfavorability from currency translation which the company calculated on a constant currency basis by applying current period foreign exchange rates to the prior period results net loss attributable to vail resorts was 106 5 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 or a loss of 2 64 per diluted share as compared to a net loss of 107 8 million or a loss of 2 66 per diluted share for the same period in the prior year the net loss for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 included the after tax effect of acquisition and integration related expenses of 6 8 million and approximately 1 million of unfavorability from currency translation which the company calculated on a constant currency basis by applying current period foreign exchange rates to the prior period results our balance sheet at quarter end remains strong we ended the quarter with 136 3 million of cash on hand and 1 9 billion of net debt as part of the peak resorts acquisition we expanded our existing term loan facility by approximately 336 million and assumed a portion of peak resorts debt our net debt was 2 8 times trailing 12 months total reported ebitda though it is important to note that this ratio only includes peak resorts results for the loss period between closing and quarter end and we do expect that ratio to decline as we incorporate the full season of peak resorts results i m also very pleased to announce that our board of directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend on vail resorts common stock of 1 76 per share payable on january 9 2020 to shareholders of record on december 26 2019 additionally the company repurchased approximately 21 4 million of stock during the quarter at an average price of 224 28 now turning to our outlook for fiscal 2020 given our first quarter results and the indicators we are seeing for the upcoming season we are reiterating our resort reported ebitda guidance for fiscal 2020 that was included in our september earnings release which is based on the assumptions incorporated at that time including foreign currency exchange rates while pass sales results to date have been encouraging it is important to remember that the north american ski season has just begun with our primary earnings period still in front of us as always the upcoming holiday period is a key period of the ski season and we plan to publicly report certain ski certain season to date ski season metrics on january 17 2020 i ll now turn the call back to rob robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer thanks michael we remain committed to reinvesting in our resorts creating an experience of a lifetime for our guests and generating strong returns for our shareholders we will announce our complete capital plan for calendar year 2020 in march 2020 but we are pleased to announce our signature investments plan for 2020 2021 season we are excited to announce a 250 acre lift served terrain expansion in the signature mccoy park area of beaver creek this new lift accessed beginner and intermediate experience is a rare opportunity to expand with highly accessible terrain in one of the most idyllic settings in colorado and we ll further differentiate the high end family focused experience at beaver creek at breckenridge we plan to install a new four person high speed lift to serve the popular peak 7 this additional lift will further enhance the guest experience at the most visited resort in the us and will significantly increase guest access and circulation for the intermediate terrain on peaks 6 and 7 subject to government approvals at keystone we plan to replace the four person peru lift with a six person high speed chairlift in order to increase capacity out of a key base area of the resort and improved guest access circulation and the experience and one of the top performing resorts in the us the whistler blackcomb we intend to significantly increase the seating capacity at the rendezvous lodge restaurant on blackcomb mountain the expansion will add 250 seats at a critical on mountain restaurant further enhancing the experience at north america s largest resort our capital plan includes several key investments that will continue to further our companywide data driven approach we are now in the second phase of implementing our automated digital marketing platform that will allow us to aggregate a more holistic view of the guest that will drive improvements in personalization and engagement across all lines of business including ski school and rentals we will also be investing to completely revamp and upgrade our digital ski rental online platforms to provide a more seamless advanced purchasing process and to allow more dynamic pricing and discounting to broaden access during off peak times finally we will be launching a completely revamped epicmix mobile app that will offer new functionality and an improved user experience we will continue to invest in corporate infrastructure and technology to improve our

a four person to a six person high speed chairlift relocating the existing four person quantum lift to replace the green ridge three person fixed grip chairlift and improving the base area experience through a renovation of the base 68 restaurant expansion and renovation of the children ski school facility and enhancement of the guest arrival experience we plan to spend approximately 24 million on integration activities primarily related to peak resorts our capital plan for calendar 2020 includes one time real estate investments of approximately 3 million which are related to and funded by land sales completed in calendar 2019 with third party developers at the keystone one river run site and breckenridge east peak 8 site while we expect these projects to occur in calendar 2020 these investments remains subject to municipal approvals of those development projects creating timing uncertainty our capital plan for calendar 2020 will be approximately 155 million to 160 million

like to thank all of our employees for their passion hard work and commitment to creating the experience of a lifetime for our guests which has always lies at the center of our success we hope that you all enjoy a fun and safe season ahead at this time michael and i would be happy to answer your questions operator we are now ready for questions questions and answers operator thank you we ll take our first question today from felicia hendrix with barclays felicia hendrix barclays capital analyst hi good afternoon and thank you and so your season pass sales were great congratulations on a strong year there wondering if by any chance you guys to help us understand what percentage of the peak folks converted to epic and considering that i don t really think you re going to answer that question maybe that you can kind of frame it in was it kind of better in line or worse than what you expected robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer yeah i would say we re not sharing that for two reasons one we typically don t share that kind of detail but also we re just in the process of actually bringing the two databases together and so at this point we couldn t even say because we haven t had a chance to really fully look at the results from that just ended a little while ago i would say yeah i think we ve been quite pleased with the results from peak obviously including peak s program obviously just because they have a base of passes that most of you could see in their public results from us here obviously that depresses our growth rate modestly but then obviously there s an incremental opportunity by having peak in the program both in terms of the people who might convert or upgrade over to our passes but also obviously new people coming in from the different destinations where peak has a resort so we feel very good about it again in the first year we haven t had a full opportunity yet to really market to those guests to do all of our data collection and capture so we believe there is still a very strong opportunity on that front for next year and i think we are also quite pleased that a lot of the strong trends that we saw on the destination side in the northeast we saw across our network so just i think felt very confident in everything that we laid out for the season pass out for this year and seeing it come to fruition including peak felicia hendrix barclays capital analyst that s really helpful and then you did mention both in the press release and in your prepared remarks that you didn t see much trading down and you did see new entrants to the program so i was just wondering why you didn t see as much trade down as you expected kind of maybe you can give a little bit more color on the complexion of the sales there and then can you also tell us if you re able to recapture folks who are on epic in the past but let the program because it didn t suit their needs and now they re coming back robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer yeah i think on the trade down what i would say broadly i think one there is a lot of loyalty obviously to our epic and epic local pass holders into those products a lot of loyalty from even the epic 4 and epic 7 holders in that in those higher volume products and i think obviously as we offered broad and kind of the number of options at lower price points we assumed we might see a little bit more trade down which didn t happen which i think speaks very well for the kind of connection that we have to those guests i think it s also it s a program that will take time over time to just like when we first introduced the epic pass one of the things that was our biggest challenge was just convincing people who didn t live near the ski resort that a season pass it was a potential option for them now i think we re really on a new journey which is convincing these one two three four day skiers that actually a pass product is right for them gives them a great discount the economics makes sense clearly but obviously getting that message out takes a number of years and all the marketing effort that we put into it so i think that in our minds is still kind of lies ahead i think for the overall program and the opportunity with epic day pass yeah i can t really comment on the specifics of that in terms of some of the trading but we absolutely saw i think a benefit in terms of both bringing people back into the program but most importantly introducing new people to the program so that was the predominant i think success that we saw with epic day pass both in terms of people who were previously on lift tickets and prospects people who were not necessarily in our database before so i think all of those are good signs for the future felicia hendrix barclays capital analyst that s very helpful thank you and then just my final question is just on whistler i think some folks are concerned that whistler is getting slow starts how are you thinking about the demand patterns that you re seeing there robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer yeah i think conditions at whistler are definitely more challenging than probably anywhere else in our network and i think obviously we re hopeful that we re going to see that turnaround obviously before the key christmas holiday i think certainly the data points on whistler i think generally look fine again largely in line with what we would expect but obviously in part that s going to some of our results will depend of course upon the actual conditions when people come certainly for the holidays and beyond i think one of the good things about whistler obviously is that you have a lot of people who book with longer lead times and so i think so long as kind of conditions comp before the holidays i think that still gives us a good opportunity to essentially have i think still a strong holiday period but that said obviously yeah some of this is still going to be dependent on what the conditions are at the time felicia hendrix barclays capital analyst great thank you so much robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer yeah absolutely operator next we ll hear from shaun kelley with bank of america shaun kelley bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi good afternoon everyone rob or michael maybe just to start kind of talking about the day pass in a different variety can you maybe help us just think about how the launch has gone off relative to some of the initial results you either saw from the epic four day product or the military product i think from the outside perspective military was kind of huge adoption upfront and pretty close to like 100 000 units day past or the four day took it was an introduction but probably more incremental and took some time to build maybe without giving specifics because i know you won t maybe give us just some color about how relative to those products what kind of behaviors you saw with the day pass robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer yeah i would say definitely more in line with the four day i mean just broadly not specific by specific but more broadly definitely different than military obviously military was a product that was discounted very very significantly and it really changed kind of how we provided access to those who served in the armed forces so i would say that was obviously a much more quick adoption but i certainly think we mentioned in our remarks we re quite pleased to see the results in the second year and seeing both the loyalty and there s improvement obviously in the revenue from the program i think on epic day pass my belief is that it will take a number of years to continue to broaden i think especially in those lower frequency pass products and that is where i think we said that it certainly exceeded our expectations in part because it s a little unclear to us as we when we launched and design the product how long it would take us to begin to get adoption on that and so we re very pleased that to start off on such a strong foot but like epic 4 and 7 it will take a number of years i m sure for us to come close to where the maturity could be for that product shaun kelley bank of america merrill lynch analyst great thanks and you noted both throughout i think a lot of the commentary as the strength in destination and then also obviously seeing new guest and i think there were some ski toward destination markets even for new sign ups around the day pass why are we seeing like a similar movement on the lodging side i know the lodging business is going to depend probably more market to market and maybe a little bit lumpier but i would think if you re seeing such great activity from destination they are likely to have longer lead times that might be like what you see in lodging so just any kind of observation on why that may not why that pattern maybe a little different robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer well i think you re looking at different dynamics that are going on i think if we re talking about quote lodging bookings into the season if that s what we re looking at then i think obviously although we re making great strides on the epic day pass still obviously doesn t represent a huge percentage of the total right in terms of how many people ultimately come to the resort and i think we feel good about where we see lodging bookings and obviously feel like they support our overall guidance for the year and the over delivery on epic day pass i think certainly builds confidence but i don t know that it s yet enough to that it would really change the total lodging drivers for any of our resorts and again especially a lot of our lodging bookings that we re talking about in the release speak to our owned and operated managed properties that right is also a smaller percentage right of the overall market shaun kelley bank of america merrill lynch analyst right okay thanks for that and then last question for me would be just i think you may have alluded to this and answered to felicia s question but just when we think about the contribution from peak overall and again i apologize if i missed it did peak what was the overall impact to growth rate now that we put it in the base was the core peak trend accretive to the total growth kind of in line with that it move it at all or was it less than that or did it sort of dilute the total growth rate as you think about what you saw overall robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer yeah i think again it s hard for us to be precise around that because there are some of the different things happening at the same time when you include peak and we can t track any of them necessarily with precision so obviously including peak in our program pulls down the growth rate because it increases the base then you have people who actually moved from peak passes to epic passes and as i mentioned we feel good about that but we haven t been able to do all the analysis to kind of a bump those two databases piece by piece but then there is in every pass program certainly for peak certainly for us there is there are people who come in and out every year and so it s a little bit hard for us to fully understand right when we see pickup in markets around peak is that people who were going to peak is it because of peak is that were they on the verge of buying before and peak just pushed them over the edge i mean all of those things i think we re trying to assess now overall i think we feel like absolutely peak was a positive not the primary driver of our results by any stretch but absolutely a positive for this year and i think our first step in the kind of impact that i think peak can make again i think we think we ll see a bigger impact next year so i think in line and kind of largely to what we expected but it s unfortunately not possible to truly parse it out shaun kelley bank of america merrill lynch analyst thank you very much robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer thank you operator we ll now hear from david baron with baron capital david baron baron capital analyst no i didn t dial in sorry operator mr baron did you have a question david baron baron capital analyst no i did not i did not bring a question sorry operator okay thank you we will hear from alex maroccia with berenberg alex maroccia berenberg analyst hey good afternoon guys just one for me i m looking at some of the political unrest down in south america right now i m just wondering what you re seeing year over year in the early buys and season pass sales to some of those international customers robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer yeah i don t i think at this point obviously mexico is a very important market for us i think outside of mexico the other markets in latin america are a little bit less important especially over the last couple of years because brazil has become a little less important some of the other countries have receded a bit both with the strong us dollar and some of the challenges i think that we ve seen in those economies over the last couple of years so we don t i don t think outside of mexico i don t think we see some of those other countries is being overall material at this point to present a trend so we re watching the same thing but a little bit of a smaller impact probably to the company in the upcoming year alex maroccia berenberg analyst got it all right that was it from me thanks operator we ll now hear from brett andress with keybanc capital markets brett andress keybanc capital markets analyst hi good afternoon just a quick question for me on the december period the one that caught most of us off guard last year do you have any leading indicators that give you confidence that the early holiday period this year could improve if not stabilize versus last year robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer yeah i think obviously we stare at that and obviously include whatever indicators we have on that certainly in the decision we make about reaffirming guidance but at the same time i would say we don t have perfect information as we said we have different lodging indicators but in some cases they don t represent the totality of by any stretch of the market obviously the pass sale piece we certainly feel good about and on conditions we feel good but those are always going to be variable so what i d say is yeah we obviously have taken the experience from last year and incorporated that in our thinking as we put our reaffirmed guidance this year but of course there is always going to be uncertainty no matter what brett andress keybanc capital markets analyst all right thank you robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer thanks operator next we ll hear from patrick scholes with suntrust patrick scholes suntrust analyst hi good evening rob and michael robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer good evening michael z barkin executive vice president and chief financial officer good evening patrick scholes suntrust analyst just a point of or question on clarification you talked about overall lodging bookings for the season coming up are largely in line with prior year bookings to be specific is that just the occupancy on the books and how does room rate adr book for those bookings robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer so yeah that comment is just about occupancy and room nights on the books and does not we re not commenting on rate patrick scholes suntrust analyst okay i ll ok thank you that s it robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer thanks operator our next question will come from david katz with jefferies david katz jefferies analyst good evening everyone and congrats on the quarter robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer thanks david katz jefferies analyst i wanted to ask about kind of a longer term growth we have many discussions about what s what lies ahead on the m a front in particular and we ve talked in the past about may be europe and asia and we ve seen the acquisitions that you ve made very productively in the domestic market where is your focus in terms of m a going forward robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer yeah well what i just would add i think not only i think have we ve been successful with our acquisitions domestically in north america but i think we ve been very successful with the acquisitions in australia you know that have been huge contributors i think to incremental growth certainly in the summer months and i think the past opportunity in australia has also been quite strong i think there are going to be select opportunities in north america where we feel like we can continue to bolster the network and then i think we are focused in asia particularly in japan and certainly in europe and i think we ve been quite open that those are obviously tougher markets obviously to enter into and we ll probably have to ultimately be more flexible in terms of our approach but we also feel like there are both short term and long term opportunities in those markets from passes from using data in a better way from collaboration and partnership that i think we could bring to any of the resorts in those markets so no doubt it takes longer and no doubt also we ve been pre occupied with a lot of things that we ve been doing in north america over the last number of years but as we look to the future we certainly see more ultimately on the opportunity front coming from outside north america david katz jefferies analyst got it and i did not intend to suggest that the international acquisitions haven t been all of the acquisitions have been very very productive rob the last quarter we went through the transcript as i recall and counted references to the economy irrespective and not asking you for a broad call on the economy but what are your perceptions from what you re seeing in vail s business in terms of just consumer appetite strength weakness versus where it was 90 days ago robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer i don t know i think in the us i m not sure we re seeing a discernible change i mean i think that inside our business obviously i m reading the same stories and research reports that everybody is but in terms of inside our business i m not sure that we ve seen necessarily a discernible change and i still think we feel certainly quite good about the trends that we re seeing in the us i think on the international front it s a little tougher obviously with stronger us dollar with some instability in terms of what was mentioned earlier elsewhere in europe so on that front i think a little bit more unclear but certainly are not seeing i think a big enough change since the september call that that it has affected our outlook for the season david katz jefferies analyst got it thanks very much robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer thanks operator next we ll hear from ryan sundby with william blair ryan sundby william blair analyst yeah hi thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer thanks ryan sundby william blair analyst rob i guess as you ve kind of doubled your pass base it feels like over the last handful of years or so are you starting to see any kind of on mountain or maybe it s even off mountain capacity constraints that are kind of prohibiting from selling more passes going forward and then i guess second when you look at kind of pass sales exceeding expectations for the year could you maybe just point out to what you thought was maybe the biggest upside driver or maybe one or two biggest upside drivers for the where that upside came from that would be great thanks q robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer sure we re not seeing capacity constraints i think in terms of on mountain i think there are only a handful of days typically in any year that we feel like we run into true capacity issues and often especially on the destination side really the capacity limiter is lodging and places for people to stay and so at the moment i m not we re not concerned about that being something that would constrict our growth in the short term on the capacity side i do think though obviously that having dramatically grown the pass program has really added tremendous stability and loyalty to our company and that s something that i think bodes quite well for the long term on the biggest upside driver i would say probably two different pieces one i think we ve already talked about which is we certainly saw great strength on the epic two and epic three day particularly obviously later in the selling cycle which we knew was the potential opportunity i think a lot of new people both new to the pass program prospects coming into the program all of that was quite positive and i think the other piece was real strength in the epic and epic local products so the fact that we saw both of those do quite well this year yeah again i think speaks volumes to both the experience we offer the design of the product and how we market it and communicate with our guests about it so yeah all of those were strong positive this year ryan sundby william blair analyst great thanks robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer thanks operator our final question will come from marc torrente with wells fargo marc torrente wells fargo analyst hey guys thanks for taking our questions congrats on the quarter robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer thanks marc torrente wells fargo analyst with epic day any more detail you can provide on the makeup of those product sales maybe base purchase local versus destination consumer type compared to your expectations originally and then are you able to tell of those who previously purchased lift tickets are they buying more days on that product since it s more affordable robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer yeah i would say on mostly aligned with what i ve been sharing earlier i think that the that obviously the in terms of versus our expectation i would say pleasantly surprised by just the strength of the prospect market for that product obviously you just don t know when you go out the new product how many people will come in who you don t have currently in your database so i think between that people who are again just new to the pass program all of that was a real positive the strength of epic day pass is very much in the destination markets much more so than in the local markets i think that that may represent an opportunity as we go forward and again as we continue to craft our marketing approach but right now it s very much a destination product which is good because that s exactly where it was targeted toward and we are seeing increases but hard to say i think we ll kind of probably have better insight on kind of the overall frequency improvement as we see the season play out but right now again feeling good about the opportunity that we ve provided people and the opportunity that it s given the company marc torrente wells fargo analyst okay great and then just one more now that you ve owned peak for a few additional months what have you learned in terms of their strength weaknesses needs their pass program data etc robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer i think we ve been one really impressed with the people i think they ve got a terrific employee base incredibly passionate very committed obviously it s a big big challenge to go through a transition like this and i think they ve been totally committed to the experience on the mountain and the guests so i think that was great to see their operations right their snowmaking expertise is also quite strong obviously very critical for many of their resorts and so no surprise they have a real strength there and i think absolutely opportunities around data i think they are had a very good first couple of years with their new pass program but obviously they re still early in that effort and so i think that s an opportunity especially for us for next year as we can use a little bit of our tools that we have at our disposal and the team that we have here to use data better capture data on a much more rigorous basis and really broaden the kind of impact that they can have in the local markets that they serve so i think very much aligned with our expectations good resorts run well i think that they ll be a great addition to our broader mountain team and then a real opportunity for us to use a little bit more sophisticated approaches on the data marketing and many of the corporate functions obviously we just have just a little bit more history right behind us that we think can help to drive value marc torrente wells fargo analyst okay great thank you robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer thank you operator that will conclude today s question and answer session i will now turn the conference over to mr katz for any

saskatoon the eurozone is in a bind despite successive doses of monetary stimulus by the european central bank ecb inflation remains stubbornly below target conventional monetary policy and even quantitative easing evidently have limited potency when interest rates are at or near zero monetary skeptics worry moreover that lowering rates further will damage europe s banks additional asset purchases beyond the monthly level of 20 billion euros 22 billion already agreed they warn will impair the liquidity of financial markets by pushing up asset prices the ecb could expose the financial system to stability risks when those lofty prices return to earth the obvious event precipitating this return would be a recession and when this downturn materialises the ecb will have limited room for offsetting action again because interest rates are already low the solution to this conundrum suggested by ecb president christine lagarde is greater reliance on fiscal policy by purchasing government bonds bearing negative interest rates investors are literally begging european governments to borrow so long as growth rates remain stuck at low levels because of anemic private spending a bit of additional public spending is just what the doctor ordered if the economy nonetheless sinks into recession fiscal stimulus can be ramped up still further the problem is that national policymakers in a number of eurozone countries starting with germany are dead set against fiscal expansion believing that they are being asked to encumber their children with debt in order to provide the stimulus that countries like italy are unable to deliver they happily invoke the eu s fiscal rules to justify not running budget deficits this impasse has prompted suggestions that the ecb should pursue fiscal policy by stealth for example it could adopt a policy of dual interest rates it could pay positive rates when taking deposits from commercial banks cushioning the banks profitability it could then lend to those same banks at sharply negative rates giving them money on such concessional terms that they would find lending it irresistible the ecb has experimented with these policies on a small scale under its so called tltro ii program but by expanding a policy under which it paid more on its liabilities than it charged on its assets the ecb would incur losses and erode its capital to be sure central banks can operate with negative capital financing themselves by printing money but the longer they do so the more observers anticipating ongoing money creation will come to doubt the credibility of monetary policy the ecb s shareholders meaning european governments might then feel compelled to recapitalise it at a significant cost to themselves critics in germany and elsewhere will therefore challenge the legality of such policies citing the strict separation between monetary and fiscal policy in the european treaties one response is who cares treaty provisions can be creatively reinterpreted when exigent circumstances require this has happened more than once in the euro s two decades but the legitimacy of the ecb depends on more than legal formalities fundamentally it derives from public support and public opinion toward quasi fiscal measures by the ecb would be strongly negative in countries like germany the german government channeling this popular indignation could protest in a variety of ways such as refusing to participate in eu decision making processes requiring unanimous consent anyone familiar with the empty chair crisis of 1965 when france refused to occupy its seat in the council of ministers over a dispute about the common agricultural policy will appreciate how disruptive such a protest can be rather than attempting to circumvent the intent of the ecb s statute the resources of the european investment bank should be enlisted the eib has 70 billion euros of paid in capital and reserves and 222 billion euros of callable capital it has a board of directors from all 28 eu member states limiting the danger of capture its charge is to fund sustainable investment projects and it is empowered to borrow for that purpose because it is required to place its bonds with private investors it is subject to market discipline and it earns positive returns on its investments ramping up its borrowing and spending would be entirely consistent with its mandate eib lending is limited to 250 per cent of the capital subscribed by its shareholders to make a difference now much less in a recession this capacity would have to be scaled up significantly to be sure proposals for doing so will meet with political resistance from those who fear that a larger eib would be a loss making eib but significant losses are unlikely in an environment where borrowing costs are only a fraction of the return on equity investment this in any case is the debate europe should be having tackling the stimulus issue head on is more likely to succeed than proceeding by subterfuge barry eichengreen is professor of economics at the university of california berkeley and a former senior policy adviser at the international monetary fund his

the theme of a modern day robin hood has resonated with international audiences who are increasingly cynical and angry about banks and the entire economic order they represent since late november colombia has seen unprecedented mass protests the longest since 1977 and illustrates the awakening of a muffled civil society protests in colombia are part of a latin american spring demonstrations have since september swept across haiti mexico nicaragua venezuela panama uruguay peru ecuador bolivia and chile but colombia s protests are not merely following a regional trend nor can they be attributed to a single ideological leaning who is protesting and why colombians are protesting against inequality because the country has the most unequal society among the 36 organisation for economic co operation and development oecd countries in addition recent government measures such as cuts in taxes to wealthy investors and an increase in taxes for the middle classes have generated a significant backlash in a failed attempt to implement trickle down economics though the colombian economy has experienced resilient economic growth despite the fall in commodity prices there is little to no redistribution taking place the richest 1 of the population captures more than 20 of the total labour income because measures recently adopted by the government probably exacerbate inequalities peasants student urbanites labour unions and indigenous groups have taken to the streets their grievances might differ but the persistence of inequality has led to a reduction of their tolerance to measures that maintain the status quo protesters are demanding the implementation of the provisions signed in the 2016 revolutionary armed forces of colombia people s army colombian government peace agreement for some factions in the government demanding the fulfilment of the promises of a constitution and demanding peace is seen as a subversive act yet colombians are not demanding a revolution they are demanding the right to a dignifying life and the fulfilment of the promises made by the government in a country that in an armed conflict and is home to one of the highest shares of internally displaced populations in the world the dismissal of protesters grievances constitutes a threat to civil society and democracy the number of assassinated social and indigenous leaders and activists illustrate these risks the motivation for protests relates to the deepening of inequalities and levels of precarity in terms of access to education health and social protection and the weariness of armed conflict the strength of the protests can be explained as the result of the transition of the colombia society towards peace the peace accords with paramilitaries in 2006 and guerrillas in 2016 opened different venues for political participation and the strengthening of social movements government s response the response from the government of iván duque has been one of denials accusations and failed attempts to regain control over public discourse he took office thanks to the political backing of politicians and sectors in society who opposed the peace negotiations with guerrillas and the state reforms taking place since 2010 once in power duque found himself having to comply with state policies his support base did not agree with but these groups do not represent the majority of the population because of this duque faces a 70 disapproval rate and only 24 approval rate according to a recent gallup poll this also means he has no control over the congress posing a dilemma to his government either duque tries to clear his policies to receive the broader support of society and face the alienation of his core supporters or he loses the capacity to lead the country because of this media such as the economist have depicted duque as a president without direction given this limited political space the government attempted a propaganda campaign that tried to cast protesters as not contributing to the development of the country and drove duque to plan the first meeting after the national strike with the industrials and business people rather than with the protestors this illustrates that the government cannot see that the protests span across race location and class protests have brought together diverse actors that have found in the streets a space of encounter social groups are refusing government measures concerning social security pensions and labour reforms because they would have a pervasive effect on the livelihoods of the majority of the population as such these protests are an important signal about the demands of 74 of the population the disconnection between self interested elites and the rest of society is evident the proposal for a tax break such as allowing consumption without value added tax for three days a year and an extended black friday as a solution to the protests illustrate how little the government understands its citizens initiatives such as these reflect the aloofness of maria antoinette a let them eat cake response economists have opposed other proposals tabled by the government as lacking any technical basis populist economic measures aim to increase the acceptability of duque s government but can drive inequality and further grievances the elimination of a 2 tax for buying houses worth more than 260 000 shows that the government is not undertaking reforms to improve the livelihood of the majority of colombians neither are improving state revenues policy challenges the debate can be framed about the availability of public resources and how to spend these but data shows that the country is growing faster than any other oecd country nevertheless the gains of growth are not evenly distributed because the cost of living for the middle class is growing faster than their incomes the state is facing a long standing problem of export dependent economies as the global economy cools down the demand for colombian exports has declined in response to an imminent trade deficit the state must increase its revenues but is afraid of taxing the wealthy its remaining support base this scenario takes place in a country in which informal employment is rising and the size of industrial production is declining the country is also going through a demographic transition with an ageing population adding pressure to the pension system as the population grows older fewer contributors can sustain the social security system and the costs for public health and pension fees increase one of the government proposals was to reduce employment costs and make youth employment flexible driving the most significant segment of the population into precariousness cannot be sound politics or economics especially if the government is thinking about financing the pension system for future generations duque s government praises the discourse of innovation and entrepreneurship but it should consider that people in insecure employment are less likely to take risks and innovate policies need to tackle the sources of inequality in colombia and work to the benefit of the growing youth and middle class the policy dilemma the government has is either to increase taxes to the bulk of the population or reduce exemptions to wealthy citizens given the little political capital that the government has increasing taxes to the wealthy might mean the government could run out of support but failing to create the fiscal space that could sustain the economy and redistribute income might exacerbate inequalities in the future moving towards an equal society is not only an ethical response to the grievances of diverse social groups but also a necessary condition for accelerating economic growth structural changes should be considered the government should shift its attention towards innovation and industrial policies that can internalise and disseminate technological gains while driving domestic demand towards the local industry redistributive reforms are a prerequisite for progress because they help to close structural gaps and lead to higher levels of productivity full use of capacities and resources a fairer distribution of income and wealth and provide all citizens with the right to embark on the plans that they consider worthwhile transition from violence protests remain spaces of uncertainty and crisis but they also are spaces of representation democracy and opportunity protesters bypass the structures of representation and send signals to institutions when they do not work furthermore they allow governments to hear different voices and provide valuable feedback on the workings of the economy yet privileged actors invest energy and resources in preventing positive dissent and protecting the status quo inequality and precariousness hinder economic growth and social cohesion the mass protests in the colombian case not only demonstrate how public voice emerges when violence is declining but also how inequalities can be exposed once violence decreases because people demand basic rights for the losers of development processes as the country tries to leave violence behind the nature of the conversations changed from armed conflict to citizens rights nevertheless colombia is a country that remains in fear of

this sunday december 15 we have a deadline coming up on the dec 15 for another tranche of tariffs i do not believe those will be implemented and i think we may see some backing away perdue said at a conference in indianapolis indiana he added that trump didn t want to implement the new tariffs but there s got to be some movement on their china s part to encourage him not to do that and hopefully the signal that they sent over soy and pork reduction might be that signal in that way perdue also pointed out the main difficulty regarding enforcement the challenge is we are used to dealing in contracts here we are using to fulling contracts one party contracts with another and we fulfill that we have arbitration when that doesn t happen he said between nations there s not a lot of arbitration and that s the challenge if china signs a deal and a contract what are the enforceability measures of that that s really what we are dealing with right now australia business conditions

at the root of educational inequality the rich and poor districts that keep education segregated here are the three reforms we need to truly understand what s wrong with piedmont unified school district in the hills a few miles from san francisco bay you have to pull up from a municipality so wealthy that it was dubbed the city of millionaires in the roaring 20s up high enough to notice that after the district border ambles along park boulevard and then moves counterclockwise to encompass the mansions and art centers and swimming pools it finally returns to exactly where it started piedmont school district looks like an island specifically an island of rich white people sitting above and entirely surrounded by the much larger district of mostly not rich and not white people in oakland california then you need to look at the long history of how much money piedmont raises every year in local property taxes thousands more for each student than is raised in oakland see how those numbers jump back up in the berkeley school district to the north home of the famous university and drop back down in san leandro a racially diverse community to the south put the numbers and the maps together and you realize that piedmont isn t an island after all it s a fortress a place where the wealthy and powerful huddle to keep their resources for themselves piedmont s negative image is in reading pennsylvania a worn down city of nonmillionaires that emerged from the last decennial census with the single highest poverty rate in america the wealthier whiter areas surrounding reading are split into seven districts instead of one but the effect is the same reading students who are 93 percent nonwhite and 31 percent below the federal poverty line get 5 000 less per year than those in neighboring schuylkill which is 86 percent white and 5 percent poor reading isn t an island either it s a prison a place designed to keep the poor in their place the whole of american education works this way our nation has been chopped to pieces by tens of thousands of borders that citizens are forbidden to cross under threat of incarceration parents who enroll their children in nearby districts face fines and even jail the walls have been there for so long that people largely just accept them as an unalterable part of the landscape like cliffs and rivers that can be built around and occasionally bridged at great expense but never truly changed for the better part of the last century activists and policymakers have been trying to build a more just and effective system of public schooling their efforts have been laudable often heroic and have produced many lasting benefits but they have also fallen far short of their own ambitions american education today remains segregated and unequal with millions of students disproportionately poor and of color failing to learn what they need to know as a result k 12 education has fallen by the wayside as a priority for progressive leaders in a wide open primary for the 2020 democratic presidential nomination candidates have put forth astonishingly ambitious proposals to reshape health care higher education environmental protection financial regulation early childhood and much more yet their k 12 proposals have been largely perfunctory reasonable enough plans to spend more money on existing programs and systems without changing the underlying structure in any meaningful way only senator elizabeth warren s plan begins to tackle the underlying structures of discrimination and even it does not go nearly far enough it s time for the next generation of policymakers to see k 12 school districts as a corrupt system that needs to be ripped out root and branch american schoolchildren deserve more it s time for the next generation of activists and policymakers to see k 12 school districts in the same way that they see extraction based energy production employer provided health insurance and loan financed college as a corrupt and irredeemable system that needs to be ripped out root and branch and replaced with something better this is the case against school districts and what to build in their place how school districts came to be the u s constitution does not include the word education an omission that led to significant later confusion but national investment in public schooling actually predates the republic the land act of 1785 was designed to guide and encourage settlement of the continent settlers wanted to be sure they would have access to critical public services including education so when the act created a standard six mile by six mile township for new settlements divided into 36 sections it set aside the sixteenth section near the center to support public schools congress further emphasized the importance of school two years later in the northwest ordinance that law said religion morality and knowledge being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged the eighteenth century logistics of time and distance are important because they shaped everything that followed the economy was overwhelmingly agricultural then people came to america from europe so they could have their own land to farm rather than replicate the cramped old country life of villages near small tenant farms american settlers claimed larger parcels that were by definition farther away from one another then as now their children needed to travel to school and back home again in a single day so while income from sixteenth section lands was used to support education townships often built multiple schools almost all one room within child walking distance of farms there was unfortunately a flaw in the system sometimes the sixteenth section would happen to encompass rich productive land sufficient to fund the schools but sometimes it would fall on a pile of rocks or a swamp lawmakers responded in a way that made some sense at the time but would have far reaching consequences they allowed schools to charge parents tuition for extra education and they allowed sub sections around one room schools to raise additional property tax funds because it advantaged wealthy communities horace mann the strongest claimant to being father of american public education called a 1789 massachusetts version of such a policy a most unfortunate law mann and others set about to reform these systems by abolishing tuition and moving toward integrated grade level education they were in many ways incredibly successful relatively quickly every state adopted constitutional language resonant of the northwest ordinance supposedly guaranteeing all children access to free public schools but in the creation of those first small taxing districts the foundations of school district walls had been laid and they would prove remarkably difficult to remove the pure visions of free state supported public education embodied in state constitutions were often contradicted by facts on the ground namely that much of the country was still agricultural and thus chained to the time and travel logistics of one room schools that state legislatures did not actually want to spend the money necessary to provide universal education and that universal didn t apply to among others enslaved people and their descendants the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries saw industrial revolution and waves of immigration flow into ports cities and towns america took on the prodigious task of educating all those new entrants and became the first country to make high school graduation the standard expectation for most students at their best public schools were engines of assimilation and shared opportunity evolving into systems of age graded elementary middle and secondary schools that prepared students for work and college the one room schoolhouse became obsolete but as late as the beginning of world war ii there were still almost 120 000 separate school districts serving about 25 million students what followed was a period of massive district consolidation the number of districts plummeted to 84 000 by 1950 40 000 by 1960 and 18 000 by 1970 the way consolidation happened was crucial the process was generally unguided by egalitarian ideals instead districts merged when it suited their self interest rich districts were generally open to consolidation with neighboring districts that had similar wealth and demographics and not to those that did not places like piedmont stuck with their fortresses of money and privilege because why do anything else that was the pattern in the northeast midwest and part of the west the south was different the present day map of roughly 14 000 school districts is striking in that there is a clear pattern that exactly follows the mason dixon line above it there are thousands of geographically small school districts 500 in pennsylvania 620 in ohio 294 in indiana 854 in illinois below it there are far fewer because southern districts are contiguous with southern counties florida the third most populous state and one of the largest geographically east of the mississippi has only 67 districts as dartmouth economist william fischel has argued this happened for the obvious reason racism after the civil war many black communities in the south were big enough to create in theory black governed school districts the overriding goal of the white power structure was to continue slavery by other means violence terrorism and denial of legal rights and services including education so education authority was consolidated up to white controlled counties in the first half of the twentieth century after plessy v ferguson southern states had to at least make a show of providing separate schools for black children that meant districts big and dense enough to simultaneously support two segregated school systems this too required county level geographic size in the northern states by contrast segregation was being prosecuted via redlining federal housing policy white flight and many other forms of institutional racism that while not quite as overt as southern segregation had similar effects when the great school district consolidation wrapped up in the early 1970s leaving the district maps that we still for the most part have today many metro areas had evolved into deeply segregated central city districts surrounded by wealthier whiter suburban schools similar patterns existed with different racial and economic admixtures nationwide about 120 000 districts riven by class and race had consolidated into 15 000 districts divided on the same lines states had gradually pumped more funding into their school systems to the point where the average district received as much funding from state appropriations as from local property taxes but the state money was seldom enough to make up the difference between rich and poor the resulting massive inequality and deep segregation shocked the conscience and so building on the great victory of brown v board civil rights leaders brought two cases to the supreme court they lost them both in ways that fatally narrowed the grounds for education reform supreme court to poor districts drop dead the first case was filed in 1968 on behalf of students living in edgewood independent school district on the west side of san antonio for decades the city had systematically discriminated against mexican americans in wealthy alamo heights on the north side of town housing covenants barred any race or nationality other than the caucasian race from owning homes federal housing policies used redlining to further the same goal having limited hispanic citizens to one place the city then denied that place basic water and sewer services leading to devastating outbreaks of tuberculosis economic development lagged and the housing stock lost value public housing projects didn t pay taxes there was therefore little property tax revenue for public schools edgewood tried to solve this problem by joining the wave of school district consolidation it failed as far back as 1921 the texas state school superintendent declared that the principal obstacles to school consolidation are to be found in local prejudices local jealousies and real estate considerations by 1947 texas still had 4 500 districts and the state pushed for more mergers but edgewood was poor indebted and in the hispanic part of town by 1968 it was still alone that year a u s commission on civil rights investigation found that edgewood students 90 percent of whom were mexican american were routinely beaten by teachers and administrators for speaking spanish their attorneys had reason for optimism the year before their case was filed brown s lead attorney thurgood marshall became the supreme court s first african american justice but by the time the lawsuit made its way through the system richard nixon had been elected president and had appointed four new justices they wanted to stop what marshall had started san antonio independent school district v rodriguez was decided in march 1973 the facts weren t in dispute edgewood had the highest property tax rate in the city but because it had little wealth to tax it raised only 26 per student alamo heights with a lower rate 0 85 per 100 of property valuation compared to 1 05 in edgewood raised 333 per student state funding didn t come close to making up the difference in fact alamo heights got more money from the state than edgewood because alamo heights was able to attract more experienced and better educated teachers which guaranteed them higher salaries producing more revenue from the state formula the system was the majority conceded chaotic and unjust the justices just didn t care they believed that students living in property poor districts weren t a legally protected class in the same way as the students of color in brown even though nearly all of the property poor edgewood students were of color yes of course public education is of grave significance and plays a vital role in our free society the court said but it s not mentioned in the constitution and if we guarantee all children an equal education what s to stop them for asking for things like the basics of decent food and shelter plus will better funded schools really help all of those mexican american children experts disagree in a 5 to 4 vote the court decided that rich school districts could keep all of the money they had hoarded behind district walls even if the walls were deliberately built to keep out low income and minority children that still left another option by the early 1970s some cities were using bussing programs to promote school integration minority children were often sent to majority white schools with more resources in other words if money couldn t be brought to the students students could be brought to the money a year after rodriguez the same five justices struck that idea down too building on brown v board civil rights leaders brought two cases to the supreme court they lost both in ways fatal to education reform the students in milliken v bradley were mostly black instead of hispanic and lived in detroit instead of san antonio but otherwise the facts were depressingly similar decades of redlining restrictive housing covenants and structural racism had created a deeply segregated and viciously unequal school system in greater detroit black families were systematically excluded from neighboring suburbs like grosse pointe and its affluent schools in 1968 three weeks before his assassination the rev martin luther king jr gave a speech at grosse pointe high school as white protestors jeered king said every city in our country has this kind of dualism this schizophrenia split at so many parts and so every city ends up being two cities rather than one there are two americas in this other america thousands of young people are deprived of an opportunity to get an adequate education every year thousands finish high school reading at a seventh eighth and sometimes ninth grade level not because they re dumb not because they don t have the native intelligence but because the schools are so inadequate so overcrowded so devoid of quality so segregated if you will that the best in these minds can never come out in 1970 the naacp filed suit a federal judge ruled that given the degree of segregation between the detroit district and others the only way to desegregate was to move students throughout the greater metro area between districts school district lines he wrote may not be used to deny constitutional rights the five justice supreme court majority disagreed it once again conceded a host of damning facts about inequality segregation and racial discrimination but because the school district lines had not been explicitly drawn for racist reasons the court ruled they were inviolate because the neighboring majority white districts in the specific sense of the people running them were not responsible for the federal housing administration redlining and the real estate eligibility point system that gave 100 points to anglo saxons and scandinavians 85 to jews 55 to poles and zero to negroes and orientals those districts could not be obligated to help right those wrongs thurgood marshall was 66 years old when milliken v bradley was decided a hero and an icon at the height of his wisdom and intellectual powers in the space of little more than a year he had to watch his fellow justices destroy much of his life s work marshall understood exactly what was at stake and was unsparing in dissent there is a restrained fury in his dismantling of the rodriguez decision the idea that the edgewood students were best left to the same political forces that had deliberately conspired against them that equal protection somehow only meant arguably minimally good enough and not equal that there was some doubt about the value of money in education despite the strenuous efforts by rich districts to keep all of their money in brown marshall noted the court held that education is a right which must be made available to all on equal terms rodriguez broke that promise fundamentally the decision required enormous deference to the principle of local control in education but the issue at hand huge disparities in local property tax wealth was one over which school officials had no control at all milliken was even worse justice douglas put it plainly today s decision given rodriguez means that there is no violation of the equal protection clause though the schools are segregated by race and though the black schools are not only separate but inferior marshall called the decision a giant step backwards and an emasculation of the fourteenth amendment the state had done nothing marshall noted when school officials deliberately bussed black students away from nearby white schools the claim that school district boundaries were sacrosanct was a farce like other states michigan had reduced the number of districts ten fold in previous decades erasing thousands of boundary lines indisputably negro children in detroit had been confined by intentional acts of segregation to a growing core of negro schools surrounded by a receding ring of white schools he was right to put it that way the only difference between a fortress and a prison is which side of the walls the guards are standing on marshall saw the future clearly school district lines however innocently drawn will surely be perceived as fences to separate the races he wrote in the short run it may seem to be the easier course to allow our great metropolitan areas to be divided up each into two cities one white the other black but it is a course i predict our people will ultimately regret everything thurgood marshall feared came true detroit public schools have been perpetually wracked by crisis and decay the wealth disparity along the grosse pointe border is so stark you can see it through google s satellite images on one side of alter road dense and prosperous neighborhoods on the other hundreds of vacant lots meanwhile in san antonio the alamo heights school district today receives more than 19 000 per student in state and local funds most of its students are white edgewood still alone gets less than 10 000 ninety seven percent of its students are hispanic the bigots who wrote the restrictive covenants into alamo heights property deeds all those decades ago were fighting a war for power and opportunity in the coming century they won since the 80s going backwards fast looking back the early 1970s was the moment when american education turned most decisively toward the path on which it remains today together rodriguez and milliken were like the so called compromise of 1877 a devastating capitulation to white supremacy school district consolidation slowed to a crawl desegregation leveled off and then reversed the percent of black children attending schools with a 90 percent black population began increasing in the 1980s and continued to grow in a number of states legal strategists turned to the education clauses in state constitutions that horace mann and his allies had pushed for in the nineteenth century many state lawmakers didn t like being held accountable for obligations like a uniform system of free common schools and they fought back sometimes the plaintiffs won and school funding systems were overhauled in ways that mitigated or erased property based wealth disparities between districts sometimes the plaintiffs lost and the unfair system remained sometimes the plaintiffs won but the legislature defied the courts and the unfair system remained funding disparities between districts were compounded by even larger disparities between states which vary greatly in wealth per capita income in connecticut is roughly double that of mississippi president lyndon johnson s great society program included new federal funds for high poverty schools but federal funding would only ever be a small portion usually less than 10 percent of k 12 funding it was never close to enough to give students in poor states and districts an equal opportunity bussing meanwhile became widely seen as a cautionary tale of pushing white voters too far joe biden who began his career as a liberal advocate of desegregation reacted to widespread discontent among white voters by becoming a staunch opponent of court ordered bussing many other politicians followed similar paths the next big moment in public education came nine years after milliken with the 1983 a nation at risk report from ronald reagan s secretary of education terrel bell the report s apocalyptic language struck a nerve with a public anxious about economic and geopolitical threats like japan and the soviet union public schools were being eroded by a rising tide of mediocrity the report said if an unfriendly foreign power had attempted to impose on america the mediocre educational performance that exists today we might well have viewed it as an act of war in response in the late 1980s a bipartisan group of governors pushed a policy framework that would dominate the next 30 years of education policy standards testing and accountability the drive for educational standards reflected another deep flaw in the decentralized american school system in addition to paying for themselves all of those tens of thousands of small local school districts had been left to make their own decisions about what children should learn how they should be taught and how much learning was good enough often they chose badly or even if their choices were defensible they were different and uncoordinated a huge problem in an increasingly interconnected society by giving all schoolchildren the same test aligned to the standards and publishing the results policymakers could see which schools and students were falling short then schools and districts were held accountable through a combination of sticks and carrots to motivate performance and regulatory interventions when performance fell short the accountability regimes particularly those implemented under the no child left behind act of 2001 were never as onerous as media coverage suggested but nclb became wildly unpopular anyway because the whole idea of accountability struck many people especially teachers as fundamentally unfair accountability systems require consent and legitimacy if the people being held accountable think the terms are unreasonable the system won t work and many people did think that for a very good reason the accountability regime was draped on top of the grossly inequitable system of local finance and impermeable district boundaries that the supreme court ratified in rodriguez and milliken educators in underfunded states and districts serving economically and socially isolated communities were told that they ultimately had to meet the same performance standards as educators sitting inside the money fortress up on the hill it seemed wrong and it was meanwhile the school district system was having a secondary and in many ways even more profound effect on american society the early 1970s also marked the end of the post world war ii era of shared prosperity from 1948 to 1973 economic productivity and worker s compensation rose in virtual lockstep nearly doubling in real terms but then things changed drastically inflation and deindustrialization both hit hard in the 1970s and from 1974 to the present day productivity continued climbing while wages flattened out the difference went into the pockets of the rich in 1963 the top 1 percent of households had about 1 5 million in today s dollars by 2016 their wealth had grown to 10 4 million at the same time wealth in the bottom 10 percent declined the rich used the money to get all the stuff rich people like to buy most of those things cars clothes jewelry bigger houses you can get anywhere there was one major exception schools specifically good schools i e expensive schools full of other rich people there were pricey private schools in a few places but for most people on the fortunate side of the great economic schism the only way to buy a good school was to walk up the hill and purchase property inside the walls that in turn concentrated social and financial capital among the children of privilege who took it with them into college and the workplace met and married one another and started families of their own duly enrolling their students in expensive school districts and starting the cycle all over again this was harder to do in the south with its county wide districts some of which used the lack of internal divisions to implement admirable desegregation policies jefferson county kentucky for example educates almost 100 000 k 12 students including those in the city of louisville the district deliberately manages a system of school assignment and parental choice to maintain school level racial and economic diversity in a district that is 46 percent white and 37 percent black the system has been in place for decades and enjoys strong public support but in a number of southern jurisdictions white people turned to an idea that still runs hot in their blood secession since 2000 more than 100 communities have tried to secede into new districts most successfully and they aren t shy about why the mayor of majority white gardendale alabama explained it s keeping our tax dollars here with our kids rather than sharing them with kids all over jefferson county a recent study of district secession by kendra taylor erica frankenberg and genevieve siegel hawley found that it works racial segregation increased after the new districts were formed that was true both for where students go to school and for where people with and without school age children reside the causality is important school segregation is often dismissed as an unavoidable consequence of where people choose to live the research suggests school district boundaries are the reason people choose where to live even white people who didn t have children were attracted to living in the new racially defined districts the non profit group edbuild found that there are nearly 1 000 district borders in america where the difference in per student funding is greater than 10 percent and the difference in the percent of nonwhite students is greater than 25 percent producing an average disparity of 4 207 per student with that much money at stake plus the force multiplier of social capital district lines are protected with the full force of the law schools hire private detectives and set up anonymous tip lines to ferret out families who live in one district and send their children to school in another violators can face hundreds of thousands of dollars in penalties and felony charges even prison time america s social and economic vitality has long benefitted from our commitment to openness no tariffs on goods crossing state lines no limits on where citizens are allowed to travel and roam somehow the most violently contested borders in our entire society at least until donald trump started caging children have been erected to prevent children from going to school the three reforms we need the current school district system needs to be replaced three policies will get us there redistricting national funding and decriminalization redistricting in his dissent in milliken thurgood marshall noted that there was already plenty of precedent for requiring states to change local boundaries less than a decade before the court had required states to redraw their voting districts to ensure equal representation the court has long recognized that racist gerrymandering is unconstitutional even the current conservative court believes this unanimously ruling against a racially motivated north carolina apportionment in 2017 marshall went on to suggest a solution local autonomy over school affairs in the sense of the community s participation in the decisions affecting the education of its children is of course an important interest but presently constituted school district lines do not delimit fixed and unchangeable areas of a local educational community if restructuring is required to meet constitutional requirements local authority may simply be redefined in terms of whatever configuration is adopted with the parents of the children attending schools in the newly demarcated district or attendance zone continuing their participation in the policy management of the schools with which they are concerned most directly in other words school redistricting states should be required to redraw their school district boundaries every ten years following the census just as they redraw their congressional districts there s plenty of precedent for how to accomplish this administratively in the past waves of consolidation and ironically the current trend of secession the boundaries should be determined by a bipartisan commission and be drawn to maximize racial and economic integration the commissions should make districts big enough to achieve administrative economies of scale freeing up resources for teaching and learning and to allow for school level desegregation policies like those in jefferson county kentucky some people would find themselves voting for a new school board and living in a new school district both completely normal everyday occurrences the fact that states have now adopted essentially interchangeable grade level academic standards will minimize the frictions of change national funding there s a strong argument that states should be obligated to conduct school redistricting under the fourteenth amendment but incentives always help and while redistricting would start to even out extreme variations in wealth between districts it wouldn t eliminate them nor would redistricting change the fact that some states are much richer than others of all the indispensable public services k 12 education is by far the most rooted in local wealth and poverty it s time for the national government to step forward and fix this problem with conditions states would need to adopt decennial school redistricting they would also need to adhere to basic principles of fair school funding while state school funding schemes are often arcane in their details the principles of fair funding are simple determine how much money each district needs by counting the number of students and funding them equally with extra money for students who need extra services such as students with disabilities and those from socio economically disadvantaged backgrounds 2 set a uniform property tax rate for each district 3 give each district enough money from state revenues to make up the difference between what s required by 1 and raised by 2 these principles aren t a secret many states have already adopted them often in response to court decisions even california has taken steps in recent years to start evening out disparities between districts like piedmont and oakland a major school finance restructuring signed by governor jerry brown in 2013 has steadily lifted oakland s funding by thousands of dollars per student earlier this year a bipartisan deal was struck in texas to shift school funding away from local property taxes expand preschool and increase overall financial support for schools the rest of the states should get on board states would also have to keep their total state and local k 12 spending above a certain level with wealthier states providing proportionately more in exchange the federal government should give school districts enough money to provide equal educational opportunities nationwide how much money that would cost is substantially a function of ambition the current system has produced disparities so wide that it s essentially impossible to level up funding to what s currently being spent in the few outlier districts at the very top but we can go a long way in that direction bringing every district up to the current 85th percentile of state and local funding weighted by the number of students would cost 250 billion a year that s a lot of money but to put it in perspective the 2017 tax reforms are costing the federal government about 200 billion a year in other words nearly all we need to do to help the large majority of american school districts receive the fair funding their children need and deserve is return to the level of federal tax revenue we had only three years ago decriminalization the final condition for receiving national funding should be decriminalization arresting or suing parents for sending their children to public school is obscene anyone should be able to enroll their children in any school district if there s not enough room in a given school districts should use a lottery system conclusion in his milliken dissent thurgood marshall wrote our nation i fear will be ill served by the court s refusal to remedy separate and unequal education for unless our children begin to learn together there is little hope that our people will ever learn to live together marshall s fears were a prophecy our people today are not doing well at living together and the school district system has played a critical role in those divisions it s easy enough to condemn people like the gardendale secessionists or urban professionals with exquisite liberal sensibilities who nonetheless immediately head for the barricades when someone suggests rezoning their local elementary school to include more black and brown children but the school district system is more insidious than that it envelops us all in a series of structured choices where to work who to know how to live that leads unavoidably toward crushing injustice people broadly support providing all children with a good public education they also intensely want what s best for their own children the only reason rich people don t buy their way into an extra great public child healthcare district is that no such districts exist but we shouldn t blame parents for wanting what s best for their kids instead we need to change the way people are able to act on that desire in a way that better promotes the common good the combination of redistricting national funding and decriminalization would mean that buying an expensive home would no longer guarantee an inalienable right to send your children to a public school with the most educational resources and social capital that money can buy you can t build a fortress on foundation lines that change every ten years national funding tied to state school finance reform would take away the financial advantage of living among other rich people at least from a public school perspective because property rich districts and property poor districts would be treated equally decriminalization would further prevent people from sequestering themselves in privileged schools these policies would create the conditions for implementing true school desegregation to finally meet the unkept promise of brown v board they would also create a foundation of legitimacy on which authentic school accountability could be built leveling the k 12 playing field won t solve everything people will still be able to send their children to private schools public schools still need to be well managed as well as well funded there is a great deal of work to be done to improve housing poverty health care criminal justice and much more but tearing down the school district system is a critical step toward building a more just society while there would still be government units called school districts they would no longer mean what they mean today this kind of fundamental restructuring and redistribution goes well beyond the kind of safely virtuous programs that don t hit college educated liberals where it hurts that s exactly why it must be done

operator good day and welcome to the vail resorts first quarter fiscal 2020 earnings conference call today s conference is being recorded at this time i d like to turn the conference over to mr katz please go ahead sir robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer thank you good afternoon everyone welcome to our fiscal 2020 first quarter earnings conference call joining me on the call this afternoon is michael barkin our chief financial officer before we begin let me remind you that some information provided during this call may include forward looking statements that are based on certain assumptions and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties as described in our sec filings and actual future results may vary materially forward looking statements in our press release issued this afternoon along with our remarks on this call are made as of today december 9 2019 and we undertake no duty to update them as actual events unfold today s remarks also include certain non gaap financial measures reconciliations of these measures are provided in the tables included with our press release which along with our quarterly report on form 10 q were filed this afternoon with the sec and are also available on the investor relations section of our website www vailresorts com so with that said let s turn to our fiscal 2020 first quarter results overall we are pleased with our results in the first fiscal quarter our australian resorts delivered a strong performance with another record year at perisher on an australian dollar basis and very strong results in our first year of operations in falls creek and hotham our strong epic australia pass sales good conditions and the addition of the leichhardt chairlift at perisher supported our continued momentum in the australian market our consolidated results from perisher were negatively impacted by the strong us dollar which created an approximate 2 million resort reported ebitda headwind from currency translation in the quarter relative to the prior year results whistler blackcomb s summer business performed very well with strong performance in its world class mountain biking operations and sightseeing supported by the addition of the new cloudraker skybridge our us epic discovery business continues to grow and generate strong financial returns our lodging business experienced mixed results with continued success from our properties at grand teton lodge company partially offset by softer results at our colorado properties in part due to weaker group demand in comparison to the prior year period turning now to our 2019 2020 north american pass sales for our resorts and early season indicators as we approach the end of our selling period season pass sales for the north american ski season are up approximately 17 in sales dollars and approximately 22 in units through december 2 2019 compared to the prior year period ended december 3 2018 the results include military pass sales and peak resorts pass sales in both periods and are adjusted to eliminate the impact of foreign currency by applying an exchange rate of 0 75 between the canadian dollar and us dollar in both periods for whistler blackcomb pass sales excluding sales of military passes season pass sales increased approximately 16 in sales dollars and approximately 22 in units over the comparable prior year period as we expected growth in sales dollars was lower than our unit growth primarily from the inclusion of our epic day pass products we are very pleased to see the strong sales growth in our season pass program that exceeded our expectations we continue to see very strong growth in our northeast markets which are benefiting from the first full year of pass sales with unlimited access at stowe okemo and mount sunapee the recent addition of peak resorts and the improved impact of the expanded guest data and insight we now have in that region our destination markets outside of the north east also saw very strong growth and continue to perform well through our enhanced ability to reach destination guests with our data driven marketing and the introduction of the epic day pass our local markets continue to show solid overall growth driven by favorable results among our local guests in the whistler blackcomb region with particular strength in seattle from the first full pass sales season with access to stevens pass we are also seeing strong results from our northern california and utah guests sales in our colorado local market were softer with solid results in our epic products offset with declines in certain regional products which was expected without arapahoe basin on those passes those declines will be more than offset by lower partnership payments the majority of our sales growth came from our epic and epic local products where we saw solid growth in new pass holders and renewing pass holders with less trade down to epic day pass than we were expecting epic day pass was a strong success in its first year with an expanded product offering and was a significant contributor to our overall growth and exceeded our expectations particularly in the epic two and three day products we believe this bodes very well for the long term opportunity of epic day pass as we begin to highlight the incredible value to lower frequency guests importantly the vast majority of epic day pass sales came from new pass holders with particular success in destination markets our military program delivered strong growth with the program continuing to generate strong renewal rates while also adding new pass holders we expect that the total number of guests on all advanced purchase passes this year will exceed 1 2 million including all us canadian and australian passes and epic day pass representing an incredible group of highly loyal and passionate guests overall lodging bookings for the season are largely in line with prior year bookings based on historical averages around half of the bookings for the winter season have been made by this time though it is important to note that our lodging bookings represent a small portion of the overall lodging inventory around our resorts the early season experience at our resorts has been encouraging with strong conditions across our colorado tahoe and northeastern resorts both keystone and vail have benefited from early snow and our recent snowmaking investments which allowed keystone to open on october 12 and vail to open on october 15 and deliver a much improved experience to guests over thanksgiving our resorts in tahoe and utah have opened with typical conditions for this time of year and our northeast resorts have started strong with certain resorts opening weeks earlier than in prior years we are thrilled to welcome guests to all of our resorts as the 2019 2020 north american ski season kicks off with several transformational enhancements to the guest experience at our resorts in colorado we have made significant investments in our snowmaking systems that have transformed the early season terrain experience at vail keystone and beaver creek as a result of these investments keystone experienced it s earliest opening in more than 20 years and vail opened earlier than usual with an improved terrain offering available at opening elevating the experience for our guests at park city we transformed the tombstone express area with a new permanent tombstone barbecue restaurant and the new four person over and out lift that provides a quicker more direct route for skiers and riders to access canyons village from the center of the resort in addition we completed a full renovation of the beaver creek children s ski school facilities and improvements to the peak 8 base area at breckenridge with new ski school and child care facilities as well as an improved ticket and retail and rental experience we remain highly focused on investments that will substantially improve the guest experience across our resorts and implemented a new mobile lift ticket fulfillment technology that eliminates the ticket window for guests who purchase their tickets in advance we also completed one of the final stages of our point of sale modernization project and invested in technology to automate our data driven marketing efforts we completed significant one time investments across the acquired resorts of crested butte okemo and stevens pass which included replacing and upgrading the daisy and brooks lifts at stevens pass and the teocalli lift at crested butte as well as on mountain restaurant upgrades at okemo now i would like to turn the call over to michael to further discuss our financial results and our fiscal 2020 outlook michael z barkin executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks rob and good afternoon everyone as rob mentioned we are pleased with our first quarter performance resort net revenue was 263 6 million in the first fiscal quarter an increase of 43 7 million compared to the prior year resort reported ebitda was a loss of 76 7 million in the first fiscal quarter which compares to a resort reported ebitda loss of 72 5 million in the same period in the prior year fiscal 2020 first quarter resort reported ebitda included 9 million of acquisition and integration related expenses and approximately 2 million of unfavorability from currency translation which the company calculated on a constant currency basis by applying current period foreign exchange rates to the prior period results net loss attributable to vail resorts was 106 5 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 or a loss of 2 64 per diluted share as compared to a net loss of 107 8 million or a loss of 2 66 per diluted share for the same period in the prior year the net loss for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 included the after tax effect of acquisition and integration related expenses of 6 8 million and approximately 1 million of unfavorability from currency translation which the company calculated on a constant currency basis by applying current period foreign exchange rates to the prior period results our balance sheet at quarter end remains strong we ended the quarter with 136 3 million of cash on hand and 1 9 billion of net debt as part of the peak resorts acquisition we expanded our existing term loan facility by approximately 336 million and assumed a portion of peak resorts debt our net debt was 2 8 times trailing 12 months total reported ebitda though it is important to note that this ratio only includes peak resorts results for the loss period between closing and quarter end and we do expect that ratio to decline as we incorporate the full season of peak resorts results i m also very pleased to announce that our board of directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend on vail resorts common stock of 1 76 per share payable on january 9 2020 to shareholders of record on december 26 2019 additionally the company repurchased approximately 21 4 million of stock during the quarter at an average price of 224 28 now turning to our outlook for fiscal 2020 given our first quarter results and the indicators we are seeing for the upcoming season we are reiterating our resort reported ebitda guidance for fiscal 2020 that was included in our september earnings release which is based on the assumptions incorporated at that time including foreign currency exchange rates while pass sales results to date have been encouraging it is important to remember that the north american ski season has just begun with our primary earnings period still in front of us as always the upcoming holiday period is a key period of the ski season and we plan to publicly report certain ski certain season to date ski season metrics on january 17 2020 i ll now turn the call back to rob robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer thanks michael we remain committed to reinvesting in our resorts creating an experience of a lifetime for our guests and generating strong returns for our shareholders we will announce our complete capital plan for calendar year 2020 in march 2020 but we are pleased to announce our signature investments plan for 2020 2021 season we are excited to announce a 250 acre lift served terrain expansion in the signature mccoy park area of beaver creek this new lift accessed beginner and intermediate experience is a rare opportunity to expand with highly accessible terrain in one of the most idyllic settings in colorado and we ll further differentiate the high end family focused experience at beaver creek at breckenridge we plan to install a new four person high speed lift to serve the popular peak 7 this additional lift will further enhance the guest experience at the most visited resort in the us and will significantly increase guest access and circulation for the intermediate terrain on peaks 6 and 7 subject to government approvals at keystone we plan to replace the four person peru lift with a six person high speed chairlift in order to increase capacity out of a key base area of the resort and improved guest access circulation and the experience and one of the top performing resorts in the us the whistler blackcomb we intend to significantly increase the seating capacity at the rendezvous lodge restaurant on blackcomb mountain the expansion will add 250 seats at a critical on mountain restaurant further enhancing the experience at north america s largest resort our capital plan includes several key investments that will continue to further our companywide data driven approach we are now in the second phase of implementing our automated digital marketing platform that will allow us to aggregate a more holistic view of the guest that will drive improvements in personalization and engagement across all lines of business including ski school and rentals we will also be investing to completely revamp and upgrade our digital ski rental online platforms to provide a more seamless advanced purchasing process and to allow more dynamic pricing and discounting to broaden access during off peak times finally we will be launching a completely revamped epicmix mobile app that will offer new functionality and an improved user experience we will continue to invest in corporate infrastructure and technology to improve our scalability and efficiency as we work to optimize our processes business analytics and cost discipline across our network

transformational investment at okemo including upgrading the quantum lift from a four person to a six person high speed chairlift relocating the existing four person quantum lift to replace the green ridge three person fixed grip chairlift and improving the base area experience through a renovation of the base 68 restaurant expansion and renovation of the children ski school facility and enhancement of the guest arrival experience we plan to spend approximately 24 million on integration activities primarily related to peak resorts our capital plan for calendar 2020 includes one time real estate investments of approximately 3 million which are related to and funded by land sales completed in calendar 2019 with third party developers at the keystone one river run site and breckenridge east peak 8 site while we expect these projects to occur in calendar 2020 these investments remains subject to municipal approvals of those development projects creating timing uncertainty our capital plan for calendar 2020 will be approximately 155 million to 160 million excluding one time items associated with integrations the one time triple peaks and stevens pass

lifetime for our guests which has always lies at the center of our success we hope that you all enjoy a fun and safe season ahead at this time michael and i would be happy to answer your questions operator we are now ready for questions questions and answers operator thank you we ll take our first question today from felicia hendrix with barclays felicia hendrix barclays capital analyst hi good afternoon and thank you and so your season pass sales were great congratulations on a strong year there wondering if by any chance you guys to help us understand what percentage of the peak folks converted to epic and considering that i don t really think you re going to answer that question maybe that you can kind of frame it in was it kind of better in line or worse than what you expected robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer yeah i would say we re not sharing that for two reasons one we typically don t share that kind of detail but also we re just in the process of actually bringing the two databases together and so at this point we couldn t even say because we haven t had a chance to really fully look at the results from that just ended a little while ago i would say yeah i think we ve been quite pleased with the results from peak obviously including peak s program obviously just because they have a base of passes that most of you could see in their public results from us here obviously that depresses our growth rate modestly but then obviously there s an incremental opportunity by having peak in the program both in terms of the people who might convert or upgrade over to our passes but also obviously new people coming in from the different destinations where peak has a resort so we feel very good about it again in the first year we haven t had a full opportunity yet to really market to those guests to do all of our data collection and capture so we believe there is still a very strong opportunity on that front for next year and i think we are also quite pleased that a lot of the strong trends that we saw on the destination side in the northeast we saw across our network so just i think felt very confident in everything that we laid out for the season pass out for this year and seeing it come to fruition including peak felicia hendrix barclays capital analyst that s really helpful and then you did mention both in the press release and in your prepared remarks that you didn t see much trading down and you did see new entrants to the program so i was just wondering why you didn t see as much trade down as you expected kind of maybe you can give a little bit more color on the complexion of the sales there and then can you also tell us if you re able to recapture folks who are on epic in the past but let the program because it didn t suit their needs and now they re coming back robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer yeah i think on the trade down what i would say broadly i think one there is a lot of loyalty obviously to our epic and epic local pass holders into those products a lot of loyalty from even the epic 4 and epic 7 holders in that in those higher volume products and i think obviously as we offered broad and kind of the number of options at lower price points we assumed we might see a little bit more trade down which didn t happen which i think speaks very well for the kind of connection that we have to those guests i think it s also it s a program that will take time over time to just like when we first introduced the epic pass one of the things that was our biggest challenge was just convincing people who didn t live near the ski resort that a season pass it was a potential option for them now i think we re really on a new journey which is convincing these one two three four day skiers that actually a pass product is right for them gives them a great discount the economics makes sense clearly but obviously getting that message out takes a number of years and all the marketing effort that we put into it so i think that in our minds is still kind of lies ahead i think for the overall program and the opportunity with epic day pass yeah i can t really comment on the specifics of that in terms of some of the trading but we absolutely saw i think a benefit in terms of both bringing people back into the program but most importantly introducing new people to the program so that was the predominant i think success that we saw with epic day pass both in terms of people who were previously on lift tickets and prospects people who were not necessarily in our database before so i think all of those are good signs for the future felicia hendrix barclays capital analyst that s very helpful thank you and then just my final question is just on whistler i think some folks are concerned that whistler is getting slow starts how are you thinking about the demand patterns that you re seeing there robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer yeah i think conditions at whistler are definitely more challenging than probably anywhere else in our network and i think obviously we re hopeful that we re going to see that turnaround obviously before the key christmas holiday i think certainly the data points on whistler i think generally look fine again largely in line with what we would expect but obviously in part that s going to some of our results will depend of course upon the actual conditions when people come certainly for the holidays and beyond i think one of the good things about whistler obviously is that you have a lot of people who book with longer lead times and so i think so long as kind of conditions comp before the holidays i think that still gives us a good opportunity to essentially have i think still a strong holiday period but that said obviously yeah some of this is still going to be dependent on what the conditions are at the time felicia hendrix barclays capital analyst great thank you so much robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer yeah absolutely operator next we ll hear from shaun kelley with bank of america shaun kelley bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi good afternoon everyone rob or michael maybe just to start kind of talking about the day pass in a different variety can you maybe help us just think about how the launch has gone off relative to some of the initial results you either saw from the epic four day product or the military product i think from the outside perspective military was kind of huge adoption upfront and pretty close to like 100 000 units day past or the four day took it was an introduction but probably more incremental and took some time to build maybe without giving specifics because i know you won t maybe give us just some color about how relative to those products what kind of behaviors you saw with the day pass robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer yeah i would say definitely more in line with the four day i mean just broadly not specific by specific but more broadly definitely different than military obviously military was a product that was discounted very very significantly and it really changed kind of how we provided access to those who served in the armed forces so i would say that was obviously a much more quick adoption but i certainly think we mentioned in our remarks we re quite pleased to see the results in the second year and seeing both the loyalty and there s improvement obviously in the revenue from the program i think on epic day pass my belief is that it will take a number of years to continue to broaden i think especially in those lower frequency pass products and that is where i think we said that it certainly exceeded our expectations in part because it s a little unclear to us as we when we launched and design the product how long it would take us to begin to get adoption on that and so we re very pleased that to start off on such a strong foot but like epic 4 and 7 it will take a number of years i m sure for us to come close to where the maturity could be for that product shaun kelley bank of america merrill lynch analyst great thanks and you noted both throughout i think a lot of the commentary as the strength in destination and then also obviously seeing new guest and i think there were some ski toward destination markets even for new sign ups around the day pass why are we seeing like a similar movement on the lodging side i know the lodging business is going to depend probably more market to market and maybe a little bit lumpier but i would think if you re seeing such great activity from destination they are likely to have longer lead times that might be like what you see in lodging so just any kind of observation on why that may not why that pattern maybe a little different robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer well i think you re looking at different dynamics that are going on i think if we re talking about quote lodging bookings into the season if that s what we re looking at then i think obviously although we re making great strides on the epic day pass still obviously doesn t represent a huge percentage of the total right in terms of how many people ultimately come to the resort and i think we feel good about where we see lodging bookings and obviously feel like they support our overall guidance for the year and the over delivery on epic day pass i think certainly builds confidence but i don t know that it s yet enough to that it would really change the total lodging drivers for any of our resorts and again especially a lot of our lodging bookings that we re talking about in the release speak to our owned and operated managed properties that right is also a smaller percentage right of the overall market shaun kelley bank of america merrill lynch analyst right okay thanks for that and then last question for me would be just i think you may have alluded to this and answered to felicia s question but just when we think about the contribution from peak overall and again i apologize if i missed it did peak what was the overall impact to growth rate now that we put it in the base was the core peak trend accretive to the total growth kind of in line with that it move it at all or was it less than that or did it sort of dilute the total growth rate as you think about what you saw overall robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer yeah i think again it s hard for us to be precise around that because there are some of the different things happening at the same time when you include peak and we can t track any of them necessarily with precision so obviously including peak in our program pulls down the growth rate because it increases the base then you have people who actually moved from peak passes to epic passes and as i mentioned we feel good about that but we haven t been able to do all the analysis to kind of a bump those two databases piece by piece but then there is in every pass program certainly for peak certainly for us there is there are people who come in and out every year and so it s a little bit hard for us to fully understand right when we see pickup in markets around peak is that people who were going to peak is it because of peak is that were they on the verge of buying before and peak just pushed them over the edge i mean all of those things i think we re trying to assess now overall i think we feel like absolutely peak was a positive not the primary driver of our results by any stretch but absolutely a positive for this year and i think our first step in the kind of impact that i think peak can make again i think we think we ll see a bigger impact next year so i think in line and kind of largely to what we expected but it s unfortunately not possible to truly parse it out shaun kelley bank of america merrill lynch analyst thank you very much robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer thank you operator we ll now hear from david baron with baron capital david baron baron capital analyst no i didn t dial in sorry operator mr baron did you have a question david baron baron capital analyst no i did not i did not bring a question sorry operator okay thank you we will hear from alex maroccia with berenberg alex maroccia berenberg analyst hey good afternoon guys just one for me i m looking at some of the political unrest down in south america right now i m just wondering what you re seeing year over year in the early buys and season pass sales to some of those international customers robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer yeah i don t i think at this point obviously mexico is a very important market for us i think outside of mexico the other markets in latin america are a little bit less important especially over the last couple of years because brazil has become a little less important some of the other countries have receded a bit both with the strong us dollar and some of the challenges i think that we ve seen in those economies over the last couple of years so we don t i don t think outside of mexico i don t think we see some of those other countries is being overall material at this point to present a trend so we re watching the same thing but a little bit of a smaller impact probably to the company in the upcoming year alex maroccia berenberg analyst got it all right that was it from me thanks operator we ll now hear from brett andress with keybanc capital markets brett andress keybanc capital markets analyst hi good afternoon just a quick question for me on the december period the one that caught most of us off guard last year do you have any leading indicators that give you confidence that the early holiday period this year could improve if not stabilize versus last year robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer yeah i think obviously we stare at that and obviously include whatever indicators we have on that certainly in the decision we make about reaffirming guidance but at the same time i would say we don t have perfect information as we said we have different lodging indicators but in some cases they don t represent the totality of by any stretch of the market obviously the pass sale piece we certainly feel good about and on conditions we feel good but those are always going to be variable so what i d say is yeah we obviously have taken the experience from last year and incorporated that in our thinking as we put our reaffirmed guidance this year but of course there is always going to be uncertainty no matter what brett andress keybanc capital markets analyst all right thank you robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer thanks operator next we ll hear from patrick scholes with suntrust patrick scholes suntrust analyst hi good evening rob and michael robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer good evening michael z barkin executive vice president and chief financial officer good evening patrick scholes suntrust analyst just a point of or question on clarification you talked about overall lodging bookings for the season coming up are largely in line with prior year bookings to be specific is that just the occupancy on the books and how does room rate adr book for those bookings robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer so yeah that comment is just about occupancy and room nights on the books and does not we re not commenting on rate patrick scholes suntrust analyst okay i ll ok thank you that s it robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer thanks operator our next question will come from david katz with jefferies david katz jefferies analyst good evening everyone and congrats on the quarter robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer thanks david katz jefferies analyst i wanted to ask about kind of a longer term growth we have many discussions about what s what lies ahead on the m a front in particular and we ve talked in the past about may be europe and asia and we ve seen the acquisitions that you ve made very productively in the domestic market where is your focus in terms of m a going forward robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer yeah well what i just would add i think not only i think have we ve been successful with our acquisitions domestically in north america but i think we ve been very successful with the acquisitions in australia you know that have been huge contributors i think to incremental growth certainly in the summer months and i think the past opportunity in australia has also been quite strong i think there are going to be select opportunities in north america where we feel like we can continue to bolster the network and then i think we are focused in asia particularly in japan and certainly in europe and i think we ve been quite open that those are obviously tougher markets obviously to enter into and we ll probably have to ultimately be more flexible in terms of our approach but we also feel like there are both short term and long term opportunities in those markets from passes from using data in a better way from collaboration and partnership that i think we could bring to any of the resorts in those markets so no doubt it takes longer and no doubt also we ve been pre occupied with a lot of things that we ve been doing in north america over the last number of years but as we look to the future we certainly see more ultimately on the opportunity front coming from outside north america david katz jefferies analyst got it and i did not intend to suggest that the international acquisitions haven t been all of the acquisitions have been very very productive rob the last quarter we went through the transcript as i recall and counted references to the economy irrespective and not asking you for a broad call on the economy but what are your perceptions from what you re seeing in vail s business in terms of just consumer appetite strength weakness versus where it was 90 days ago robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer i don t know i think in the us i m not sure we re seeing a discernible change i mean i think that inside our business obviously i m reading the same stories and research reports that everybody is but in terms of inside our business i m not sure that we ve seen necessarily a discernible change and i still think we feel certainly quite good about the trends that we re seeing in the us i think on the international front it s a little tougher obviously with stronger us dollar with some instability in terms of what was mentioned earlier elsewhere in europe so on that front i think a little bit more unclear but certainly are not seeing i think a big enough change since the september call that that it has affected our outlook for the season david katz jefferies analyst got it thanks very much robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer thanks operator next we ll hear from ryan sundby with william blair ryan sundby william blair analyst yeah hi thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer thanks ryan sundby william blair analyst rob i guess as you ve kind of doubled your pass base it feels like over the last handful of years or so are you starting to see any kind of on mountain or maybe it s even off mountain capacity constraints that are kind of prohibiting from selling more passes going forward and then i guess second when you look at kind of pass sales exceeding expectations for the year could you maybe just point out to what you thought was maybe the biggest upside driver or maybe one or two biggest upside drivers for the where that upside came from that would be great thanks q robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer sure we re not seeing capacity constraints i think in terms of on mountain i think there are only a handful of days typically in any year that we feel like we run into true capacity issues and often especially on the destination side really the capacity limiter is lodging and places for people to stay and so at the moment i m not we re not concerned about that being something that would constrict our growth in the short term on the capacity side i do think though obviously that having dramatically grown the pass program has really added tremendous stability and loyalty to our company and that s something that i think bodes quite well for the long term on the biggest upside driver i would say probably two different pieces one i think we ve already talked about which is we certainly saw great strength on the epic two and epic three day particularly obviously later in the selling cycle which we knew was the potential opportunity i think a lot of new people both new to the pass program prospects coming into the program all of that was quite positive and i think the other piece was real strength in the epic and epic local products so the fact that we saw both of those do quite well this year yeah again i think speaks volumes to both the experience we offer the design of the product and how we market it and communicate with our guests about it so yeah all of those were strong positive this year ryan sundby william blair analyst great thanks robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer thanks operator our final question will come from marc torrente with wells fargo marc torrente wells fargo analyst hey guys thanks for taking our questions congrats on the quarter robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer thanks marc torrente wells fargo analyst with epic day any more detail you can provide on the makeup of those product sales maybe base purchase local versus destination consumer type compared to your expectations originally and then are you able to tell of those who previously purchased lift tickets are they buying more days on that product since it s more affordable robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer yeah i would say on mostly aligned with what i ve been sharing earlier i think that the that obviously the in terms of versus our expectation i would say pleasantly surprised by just the strength of the prospect market for that product obviously you just don t know when you go out the new product how many people will come in who you don t have currently in your database so i think between that people who are again just new to the pass program all of that was a real positive the strength of epic day pass is very much in the destination markets much more so than in the local markets i think that that may represent an opportunity as we go forward and again as we continue to craft our marketing approach but right now it s very much a destination product which is good because that s exactly where it was targeted toward and we are seeing increases but hard to say i think we ll kind of probably have better insight on kind of the overall frequency improvement as we see the season play out but right now again feeling good about the opportunity that we ve provided people and the opportunity that it s given the company marc torrente wells fargo analyst okay great and then just one more now that you ve owned peak for a few additional months what have you learned in terms of their strength weaknesses needs their pass program data etc robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer i think we ve been one really impressed with the people i think they ve got a terrific employee base incredibly passionate very committed obviously it s a big big challenge to go through a transition like this and i think they ve been totally committed to the experience on the mountain and the guests so i think that was great to see their operations right their snowmaking expertise is also quite strong obviously very critical for many of their resorts and so no surprise they have a real strength there and i think absolutely opportunities around data i think they are had a very good first couple of years with their new pass program but obviously they re still early in that effort and so i think that s an opportunity especially for us for next year as we can use a little bit of our tools that we have at our disposal and the team that we have here to use data better capture data on a much more rigorous basis and really broaden the kind of impact that they can have in the local markets that they serve so i think very much aligned with our expectations good resorts run well i think that they ll be a great addition to our broader mountain team and then a real opportunity for us to use a little bit more sophisticated approaches on the data marketing and many of the corporate functions obviously we just have just a little bit more history right behind us that we think can help to drive value marc torrente wells fargo analyst okay great thank you robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer thank you operator that will conclude today s question and answer session i will now turn the conference over to mr katz for any additional closing remarks robert a katz chairman of the board of directors and chief

if you woke up this morning to see some premarket jitters it might have been due to a report by the south china morning post stating it s increasingly unlikely that a u s china deal will get done this week as u s officials focus on a trade pact between the united states mexico and canada but a subsequent report by the wall street journal said the two nations are working on a possible delay of the dec 15 tariffs equity index futures erased early losses to move into the green by the opening bell a postponement or cancelation of those duties would likely please stock market participants at least if the two sides can t reach an interim deal before then the world s two largest economies have been trying to hammer out a deal for some time now and uncertainty surrounding the trade situation has been the biggest headwind facing wall street but recently excitement about a partial trade deal getting done soon has helped push the market to record highs in november optimism around trade as well as better than expected earnings helped spur td ameritrade clients to increase exposure to the market and end the month as net buyers of equities according to the investor movement index imxsm the imx is td ameritrade s proprietary behavior based index aggregating main street investor positions and activity to measure what investors actually were doing and how they were positioned in the markets td ameritrade clients continued to slowly up exposure with the index increasing to 5 17 up 6 8 from october although still lower than historic averages investors continued to be net buyers of walt disney co dis and microsoft corporation msft and they bought mcdonald s corp mcd seeing a bargain opportunity after the stock lost value they were net sellers of bank of america corp bac citigroup inc c and tesla inc tsla after those stocks had runups in corporate news toll brothers inc tol reported revenue and earnings that beat expectations and forecast above consensus home deliveries for this quarter the optimistic outlook bodes well for that portion of the housing market adding to the narrative that the u s economy is still chugging along despite the ongoing trade angst market still looking for a us china deal on monday the market pulled back as investor nervousness appeared to ratchet up ahead of a host of factors that could influence trading for the remainder of december but despite a rise in the cboe volatility index see more below and some treasury buying it didn t seem like the selling in equities was anything out of the ordinary after last week s gains some investors and traders may have wanted to start the week off with some profit taking fresh numbers from china that showed a drop in november exports indicated that the trade war continues to be a drag on its economy while that doesn t bode well for oil demand the numbers helped pressure crude prices on monday it could end up being a positive for the global economy if it ends up pressuring china to get a deal done sooner rather than later to stave off more economic harm as you might expect when trade jitters ratchet up the information technology sector was one of the weaker spots in the market monday trade sensitive apple inc aapl lost 1 4 while the phlx semiconductor index sox also lost ground monetary policy on both sides of the pond meanwhile across the pond investors are eyeing an election this week in the united kingdom and a european central bank meeting while it doesn t seem like the ecb will issue any major shift in monetary policy the uk election will determine who controls britain s exit from the european union brexit has been another big source of uncertainty for the market as it s unknown exactly how the unprecedented divorce will affect the european and global economies the ecb isn t the only monetary policy setting body meeting this week the federal reserve starts its meeting today with a policy announcement expected wednesday the central bank is also expected to release a new dot plot showing where the federal open market committee members expect rates to go over the next couple of years as of late monday the futures market was pricing in a near certainty that the fed will leave its key short term interest rate unchanged even though it doesn t seem like the fed will alter rates at this week s meeting it could still be interesting to see whether policy makers weigh in on last week s bumper jobs report and if the language accompanying wednesday s rate decision gets interpreted by the market as more hawkish as a result chart of the day juggling the news on a day when stocks drifted lower the s p 500 fell about 0 3 it might be a bit of a head turner to see the cboe volatility index vix jump 16 perhaps it s a reflection of the number of economic balls in the air right now that investors are trying to juggle still there wasn t a sense that anybody was running for the exits as the vix was still below its long term average around 18 purple line data source cboe global markets chart source the thinkorswim platform from td ameritrade for illustrative purposes only past performance does not guarantee future results hearing from the new ecb president even though the ecb isn t expected to change its monetary policy stance at its meeting this week ing s chief economist in germany doesn t think the meeting will be boring of note is that the meeting will be christine lagarde s first policy setting meeting after replacing mario draghi as the central bank s president the excitement to the run up doesn t really stem from possible policy changes but rather

looking for any changes in style and language in the q a session european growth lagging lagarde takes the helm of the ecb at a time when according to ing the eurozone economy is somewhat stabilizing

respectively if anything a slightly weaker euro exchange rate and somewhat higher oil prices could lead to a very minor upward revision of the 2020 inflation forecasts brzeski wrote at the same time with the lack of clear indications for a rebound in manufacturing and the rather optimistic growth profile for 2020 in september another smaller downward revision of the growth projections looks likely u s economy growing faster even though the u s economy isn t going gangbusters it s still performing better than europe s and is expected to continue that trend in 2020 the jobs report last

westpac wbk ceo brian hartzer resigned on monday after regulators sued the bank for 23 million alleged breaches of counter terrorism and money laundering laws many of which involve child exploitation to understand the gravity of the situation each of those 23 million violations carries a maximum penalty of 14m usd 21m aud giving a theoretical total of 322 trillion usd which is about as much all of the debt and equity of the entire world public and private unfortunately money laundering is not new to australia s banking system last year commonwealth bank otcpk cbauf paid 700m last year for 53 700 alleged breaches of a similar nature to westpac s which equates to 13k per violation even at that far lower fine per violation this would amount to 300b in penalties by legal precedent remember westpac s equity value is only 57b in all likelihood westpac will be deemed too big to fail and despite egregious alleged behavior will not be fined into bankruptcy that said westpac s greed seemingly extends beyond these violations i do not believe they have broken any rules nor am i implying they have but they have taken on very significant exposure to australia s highly indebted mortgage market now that property prices are beginning to fall and delinquencies are rising they are just beginning to suffer the consequences overview of australia s housing bubble australia s current housing bubble appears to be bigger than the u s 2008 bubble it has led to very high prices huge household debt buildup and a general decrease in lending standards since 2000 the cpi adjusted price of a home in australia has risen 122 while only 37 in the united states data by ycharts according to numbeo the average price to income ratio of a home in australia is currently 7 7x which is significantly higher than the u s high of 5x in 2007 of course global mortgage rates are lower today so higher home prices are justifiable but it is still the case that 58 of the average australian s salary goes to their mortgage about 26 in the u s today the bubble has been caused by many many factors chiefly due to high and until recently growing export demand from china the australian economy has gone decades without a recession second there has been a huge real estate bid from investors in china looking for cheaper property than they find at home and likely to keep some backup money abroad of course this is not to say that chinese investment is the sole cause of high home prices but that because chinese investors are willing to pay much more than australians they have become the price controlling marginal buyer i would argue that this effect has helped prop up property prices across the pacific rim i e including california and vancouver this is supported by the fact that government tax hikes on foreign home purchasing in both australia and canada have precipitated falling home prices third is simply household debt buildup the country s households have seen huge increases in mortgage debt in order to compete to buy homes take a look at household debt to gdp for australia vs the u s federal reserve as you can see the debt leverage level is significantly higher than that of the u s at the peak of the bubble now take a look at loans to assets for wbk note the striking similarity between it and australia s household debt to gdp data by ycharts of course westpac is australia s number one mortgage lender they are ground zero to the many risks associated with the country s falling home prices like the fed in 2007 the rba has been aggressively cutting interest rates to try to keep property prices rising this effort did result in a price rise over the past few months and another wave of increasing home prices is possible but solving a debt problem with more debt is the road to ruin inevitably the rapidly slowing chinese property development economy will directly impact australia because australia has been the major supplier of goods used for buildings the bubble will pop it has already begun and a slight increase in negative economic factors will easily override the rba s efforts westpac s huge exposure to the mortgage crisis while having a decent common tier 1 capital ratio of 10 westpac has significant loan exposure with loans to deposits of 127 most u s banks have similar tier 1 capital but loans to deposits usually about half that of westpac most alarmingly housing loans make up 55 of westpac s total assets on their q3 balance sheet they reported a total of 906b in assets compared to 841b in liabilities of that 906b in assets 714b are in loans of which 450b are in australian housing and 51b in new zealand housing which is in the same situation as australia s this should be a major red flag to investors as it would not take a major rise in mortgage delinquencies to jeopardize the bank s equity value of course given that we lack knowledge of their derivatives position it is difficult to know with certainty but they do own about a quarter of the australian mortgage market as australian property prices fall and the country is on the edge of its first recession in decades delinquencies are on the rise take a look at westpac s recent figures westpac q3 presentation to date these rising delinquencies have not resulted in a major increase to impaired asset charges but given the fact that the bubble has barely begun to pop it can get much worse take a look below westpac q3 presentation this has created a situation where westpac has the highest figure of loan delinquencies in red but a relatively small number of impaired assets westpac q3 presentation to me this implies that the bank will have a significant increase in impairment charges over the coming year particularly if delinquencies continue to rise at the current rate their mortgage portfolio is on the riskier side too currently about a third 34 8 of their australian loans are interest only 77 are variable rate 40 are investment property loans and 70 have an ltv about 70 at origination weighted average 74 the currency problem given such a high proportion of interest only and variable rate loans the country s discount rate will be important most of their own stress testing assumes that the rba will bring the discount rate to zero and keep it there however inflation is actually seemingly rising in australia due to significant currency weakness so the rba may actually need to raise rates in order to save their fx reserves currency stability take a look at australia s inflation rate left axis vs discount rate right axis trading economics the current risk free real yield on the australian market is 0 75 1 75 or 1 which is about as bad as in europe if you look at the currency exchange rate below you can see that this has and will continue to lead to a weakness for the australian dollar trading economics if this continues the royal bank of australia will have no choice but to raise rates or else risk a massive spike in dangerous supply side monetary inflation that stems from a currency crash of course because wbk is an adr the stock has extra high exposure to the australian dollar the bottom line put simply without a miraculous rise in australian real wages it appears that westpac is stuck between a rock and a hard place if the rba continues to try to keep its flailing mortgage housing market alive with rate cuts it will put the currency in jeopardy and devalue the adr lowering rates further may also harm deposits and profitability if they keep rates where they re at or raise them to keep the currency strong and in doing so halt inflation the housing bubble will likely pop and westpac will be left with higher asset charges than they currently estimate of course add on the huge risk of a multi billion dollar penalty for their alleged behavior and it is difficult to see a future where today s investors in the bank come out with a positive return the bank is not even that cheap with a ttm p e of 12 5x and a p b ratio of 1 35x much higher quality and cheaper banks can be found in europe and the united states while they may dodge these many bullets seemingly of their own creation i doubt they will come out strong given their alleged actions and the impact it already had on australian citizens i have a hard time believing that the australian government will act kindly to the bank nor bail them out if they get into the mortgage trouble i expect i can t imagine the situation will be good for employee morale either wbk is a clear sell i am not currently short wbk but may short the stock at any time over the coming days or weeks if i do i d give the adr a price target of 9 25 which would give the bank a more appropriate price to book ratio of 0 75x given their expected asset charges though if it seems the worst case scenario will occur i may be willing to lower the target even to zero because it is an adr i would also change the target with changes in the aud usd rate
federal reserve chairman jerome powell said wednesday that the fed is likely to keep its benchmark short term interest rate unchanged in the coming months unless the economy shows signs of worsening but for now in testimony before a congressional panel powell expressed optimism about the u s economy and said he expects it will grow at a solid pace though it still faces risks from slower growth overseas and trade tensions looking ahead my colleagues and i see a sustained expansion of economic activity a strong labor market and inflation near our symmetric 2 objective as most likely powell said before congress joint economic committee fed policymakers are unlikely to cut rates powell said unless the economy slows enough to cause them to make a material reassessment of their outlook the fed cut short term rates last month for the third time this year to a range of 1 5 to 1 75 it now looks increasingly likely that the fed will move to the sidelines for an extended period said andrew hunter an economist at capital economics a forecasting firm still when asked if he expected rates to remain unchanged over the next year powell said i wouldn t say that at all powell s testimony comes a day after president donald trump took credit for an economic boom and attacked the fed for not cutting interest rates further powell and other fed officials however argue that their rate cuts by lowering borrowing costs on mortgages and other loans have spurred home sales and boosted the economy powell was asked about negative interest rates which trump also called for tuesday and responded that they would certainly not be appropriate in the current environment negative rates occur at times when growth is quite low and inflation is quite low and you really don t see that here powell said other fed officials have also questioned whether cutting rates below zero has actually succeeded in boosting growth in places like europe and japan where central banks have pushed rates into negative territory despite trump s attacks both republican and democratic lawmakers took a largely respectful approach to powell several complimented him for the fed listens events the central bank has held around the country which have sought input from a range of groups including unions and nonprofits on ways the fed could update its monetary policy framework powell repeatedly demurred when sen ted cruz r texas pressed him on how higher tax rates would affect the economy including wealth taxes that have been proposed by democratic presidential candidates elizabeth warren and bernie sanders but powell did concede under questioning from cruz that a ban on fracking would not be a good thing for the economy some democrats have called for a fracking ban over environmental concerns about the controversial method for drilling for oil and gas recent data suggests that growth remains solid if not spectacular the economy expanded at a 1 9 annual rate in the july september quarter down from 3 1 in the first three months of the year the unemployment rate is near a 50 year low of 3 6 and hiring is strong enough to potentially push the rate even lower inflation according to the fed s preferred gauge is just 1 3 though it has been held down in recent months by lower energy costs and most fed officials expect it to move higher in the coming months yet powell reiterated that higher tariffs from the trump administration s trade war with china and uncertainty over potential future duties have caused many businesses to delay or cut back on their spending on large equipment and buildings that has slowed economic growth powell also urged congress to lower the federal budget deficit so that lawmakers would have more flexibility to cut taxes or boost spending to counter a future recession other fed officials have voiced similar concerns patrick harker president of the federal reserve bank of philadelphia said tuesday that the large deficit and the constraints it imposes on congress in the event of a recession is one of the things i do lose sleep over powell also noted that with the fed s benchmark rate at historically low levels the central bank is considering whether it needs new tools to help boost growth whenever the next downturn arrives central banks around the world are going to have less room to cut in this new normal of low rates and low inflation he said the fed is exploring an alternative policy framework powell said that it hopes will provide more flexibility in typical recessions the fed cuts short term rates by roughly 5 percentage points powell reiterated that the fed believes the unemployment rate could fall further without necessarily pushing inflation higher a view that suggests the central bank is a long way off from hiking rates the data is not sending any signal that the labor market is so hot or that inflation is moving up he said in response to a question from new york rep carolyn maloney a democrat and vice chair of the joint economic committee what we have learned is that the u s economy can operate at a much lower level of unemployment than many thought historically super low unemployment has been seen as likely to push up inflation as workers push for higher pay and companies offer greater salaries to find and keep workers most analysts forecast that the fed will hold rates steady when it meets next month but some economists expect growth will slow in the coming months and the fed will likely have to cut again next year

it was perhaps a less complex world when paul volcker employed his draconian approach to us monetary policy in the early 1980s but some of his principles and values could be usefully applied in this post crisis era of unconventional policies that produce meagre outcomes and plenty of unintended consequences paul volcker was credited with breaking the back of inflation in the us by holding fast to his convictions despite ferocious criticism and abuse credit bloomberg volcker who died aged 92 in new york on sunday was the chairman of the federal reserve board who slew what had been double digit inflation in the us after the two oil crises of the 1970s before succeeding william miller as chair in 1979 volcker famously told then us president jimmy carter pointing to miller that you have to understand if you appoint me i favour a tighter policy than that fellow he quickly followed through on his implicit promise to ratchet up us interest rates with the prime lending rate the rate banks charged their best borrowers hitting 21 5 per cent in 1980

expectations and trends based on current assumptions and opinions of the company s management future results performance and events may differ materially from those expressed herein which do not constitute projections actual results performances or events may differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward looking statements as a result of several factors such as general and economic conditions in brazil and other countries interest rates and exchange rate levels future rescheduling or prepayment of foreign currencies pegged protectionist measures in the us brazil and other countries changes in laws and regulations and general competitive factors at global regional or national basis we ll now turn the floor over to mr marcelo cunha ribeiro the investor relations executive officer who will present the company s operating and financial highlights for the period you have the floor mr ribeiro you may proceed marcelo cunha ribeiro chief financial and investor relations officer first of all a good morning to all of you and thank you very much for your presence especially those who are here with us during this quarter we have changed our format making it more interactive we do apologize due to the logistic complexity which you may face but it is for a good reason most of the market participants are here face to face and we also thank those participating through the conference call we ll as usual make an initial presentation which we hope to keep very brief signaling the highlights for the period our cfo and chairman of the board will join us make his comments on the period on the company s strategies and ensuing this we ll open the floor for your questions and of course we ll answer all the necessary questions and we thank all of you for your patience we may begin with the presentation therefore for those who are accompanying us through the webcast we begin with the highlights of this period on page number two where we present to you the different fronts where we ve focused our efforts that is to say operational results and acceleration of deleveraging and financial liabilities now this was a transitional quarter we ve brl1 6 billion although we have gone through the most acute phase of a very important event at the company which was the blast furnace number three maintenance with an impact not only on steel but mining because of unsold products and cement because of the higher costs now despite having had the mining prices impacted by these one time factors and increase in freight and others despite all of this we did have a strong ebitda of brl1 6 million but we were affected by the foreign exchange variation our debt had an increase and also by very timely events now what has happened to our results increasing our debt is now returning once again this has been a quarter of transition we acknowledge this but we ve achieved good results another highlight besides the lengthening of the debt is this new bond that we have issued with the support of capital markets to support the quality of our debt as we ll see in the presentation we have several other initiatives under way and in the third place we are also with several initiatives under way to reduce the size of our debt this quarter what we delivered was one more pre payment from glencore but we have also focused on other initiatives the sale of assets as well as other more structured financial initiatives to reduce the dimension of our debt once again these are the highlights of the quarter we now go on to the main financial and operational indicators on page number four with greater detail in terms of our ebitda which is the most significant or visible financial indicator in perspective you will see the sequence of our results this quarter vis a vis the second quarter well we may call it a certain disappointment because the second quarter was the best in the year all of the stars lined up in mining we also had very good results in the steel industry we had an exceptionally low freight very high volumes which means that everything contributed to this it was a true flyer now during this quarter as you can see some factors were against us hampering our performance but despite this we delivered this brl1 6 million with a 25 margin very similar to what we have delivered in the past and that enable us to foresee for the year an ebitda of brl7 5 million which is part of our guidance and is an expectation for a better fourth quarter by doing our calculations we do hope that part of these effects that have hampered the steel industry and mining will be reverted and we hope the fourth quarter will be even better when we compare this to the second quarter we ll see what happened business by business and steel in the internal market everything remained the same cost margin and volumes and what made the difference were the volumes in the foreign market as we will see further on that is why we had a drop in our ebitda in mining we ve said and will continue to reiterate the realization of prices and volume when we look at the business unit separately we did not sell 700 tons of iron ore and of course this also had an impact on mining and they should be reverted in the fourth quarter in other businesses we have both positive and negative aspects in cement a new drop in ebitda what is relevant is that we had a great reaction in terms of volume the civil construction market has presented us with good news we have had a double digit growth the result was not stronger simply because the cost of cement was impacted by the cost of service we have now a more expensive processing and this has affected our results despite this we got to that brl1 6 million we hope this will be the prelude for even better figures in the fourth quarter on page number five you will see the capex our cash flow capex is quite in aligned with what we have planned a peak in this quarter of brl600 million because of the efforts devoted to the maintenance of the blast furnace number three it involves other areas such as sintering and this represents disbursements and services that attained brl603 million in accordance with our guidance that is approximately brl2 billion this capex is extremely welcome it will allow us to have a cost of slab that will be brl300 lower per ton already in the fourth quarter after the renovation of the blast furnace and the production volumes as well by the pre renovation we had a bottleneck we were limited to a production of 330 million 340 million tons of steel with this renovation we should be able to reach 400 million tons and this is a peak but the pay back will take place in some months and once again this is higher because of the filtering dam projects that are doing very well thank you we already have the results and the record in mining production as we will see that is why we have attained those brl2 billion the coming year the capex should be somewhat lower we continue on with working capital this was a quarter for normalization we have gone back to the 51 days in the second quarter we had higher stocks and higher periods for trace receivables and a concentration of sales at the end of the quarter now all of this has been normalized in this third quarter as the platts price was more stable and we have not had a concentration of sales trade receivables have dropped and as planned our inventories were reduced as we roll the slabs spot from third parties along with our management of suppliers we had a reduction in these three items suppliers and others of brl1 2 billion quite significant to show you the cash flow that is positive in brl389 million it hasn t been stronger because we had a significant cash disbursement in terms of income tax it was a effect lagging after the second quarter and of course there all of this has been offset we have a cash flow of brl389 million if we look going forward with our profitability normalized the cash flow for the fourth quarter will be much greater we continue on to page number six now this cash was important but insufficient to avoid an increase in our debt the indebtedness reached brl26 million and the great villain here is the foreign exchange devaluation representing brl1 3 billion increase in our debt our debt is 60 pegged to the dollar which is very good for us because of our sale abroad now this was the main effect and another effect was the payout of dividends we now have a policy of paying our dividends every quarter always in line with a minimum mandatory amount of 25 for the period this was done this quarter and because of the dividends of minority shares this amounted to brl603 million because of this the net debt did not drop and the net debt ebitda ratio stood at 3 8 and the comment here is that we are very confident that we will attain our goal of 3 times net debt ebitda at the end of the year very close to that and in the medium term we will have a net debt of brl20 million once again none of this has stopped being a priority for the company and a cash flow with the sale of assets will enable us to attain what we have informed the market on page number seven the other dimension of our efforts in term of the balance which is the quality of our debt the average term that has been addressed not only through the capital market this quarter we had one more emission of the 2023 retap lengthening our bond for 2019 this was paid on september 2019 and have lengthened the debt for another four years this with the support of significant foreign banks like the bank of china and local banks such as bradesco that have extended our debt for a period going beyond four years and the focus of course is the capital market if we compare our balance with other companies in the sector we have a very strong concentration on banks and we would like to diversify avoiding the well taking advantage of the low interest rate and our next incursion will be in debentures taking advantage of improvements in our rating as well to continue on with the highlights we go on to page number nine that refers to our steel performance once again this was a atypical quarter where steel represented a very low amount of our total ebitda and we are the national steel company the national mining company and steel has always represented 60 of our results therefore this quarter is abnormal repeating what happened in the second quarter with a very low ebitda the volumes were very similar in the domestic market because of slabs at a price brl300 more per ton by looking forward we think we have we ll have an enhancement in all fronts there should be a resumption of volumes there is good news from civil construction and packaging capital goods and other sectors and with this economic recovery perhaps we will no longer have discounts on imported products now both of these elements should help but especially the costs after the maintenance of the blast furnace the cost per slab should drop and this will represent brl100 million per month in terms of costs when we return to normalcy what was different this quarter was a weaker foreign sector once again due to seasonality the blast furnace in germany with a stop down of course these are not fully comparable but in the us and portugal we had lower prices for briquette and we held back our sales this is what has led to having lower results in the foreign market it has been a transitional quarter we hope to redress this in the fourth quarter in terms of the mining performance on page 10 we look at the results the second best in history vis a vis the second quarter of 19 this is an excellent moment for mining we can celebrate some of our figures such as the production volume which has been a historical record it shows that we were right in investing in filtering and dry stacking however this semester this has not translated into larger sales because we sold a lower amount to opb because of the blast furnace and of course this has also helped us to reduce our revenues and that is why the results are different from the second quarter the main reason that we see in the last page on page number 11 was the price the pricing the revenues had a drop due to volumes but mainly because of prices now the explanation here is the platts as an average index remained stable or dropped two but our realization dropped 13 now where does this drop come from first of all due to the basket of quotation periods these are sales that we carry out through a provision based on the spot price of platts now when the iron ore gets to china this price may have either increased or decreased in july for example the prices were extremely steep but there was a big drop in august because of this we had a provision of quotation periods with an impact of 8 vis a vis the reference while we are aware of what happened with quality this is a one time issue and this has nothing to do with the granulated ore and others and this also refers to the offers of concentrated products in china where we will see a reduction in coming months and the use of these low contaminant iron ores all of this has had an impact but we think that this will be temporary what is also temporary is the freight that reached 29 almost 30 we are now returning to 18 or 19 in terms of price realization this has an impact and it should be mitigated in the fourth quarter and this explains the reduction of revenue in mining with this we get to the end of the presentation and i d like to offer the floor to our ceo and chairman benjamin steinbruch before we go on to the questions benjamin steinbruch president chairman and chief executive officer a good morning to all of you and thank you very much for the presence of analysts i d like to begin by stating that i don t want to sound overly positive but the results of the third quarter were good and all of the drops can be justified they re not abstract conceptual issues they are simply numerical issues and you and the investors can come to their own conclusion it was to be a much better quarter to continue on with what we had shown you in the previous quarters were it not for those highly justifiable events or factors from the viewpoint of commitment to reduce our debt the commitment remains unaltered we did have the impact because of the blast furnace number three we had an impact in the purchase of slabs we paid at 30 days our cycle is normally 180 days and in december we should be able to recompose our cash we have the payout of dividends as you know the depreciation of the real that was quite strong with a one time impact this is diluted through time but it does have an impact and that issue in mining as we sold two thirds going forward and one third in the past the sales of the consortium and the sale of iron ore to japan and korea are based on the previous quarter and two third refer to spot sales to china and they re carried out with the prices open for the coming month we benefited from the increase of the sale of these two thirds of our volume when we are when there was a reduction of price we were hampered of course this was the impact of the previous quarter and as of this moment we have the advantage of the one third and there is no longer a penalty because the price has already been updated with the two third that we sell in the spot market in the future markets for sale to china along with this the price of freight reached 29 we are back to 19 we purchased freight month after month and the average price was very competitive this year we got it right in future sales in freight this adjustment had to take place it did we are now closing freight deals for the end of the year at 18 or 19 and we believe we will be at 90 and with this we will end the year in mining that will be exceptional we will sell 40 million tons 33 million tons we ll produce ourselves at a competitive price and with the right quality so our mining business has been structured for the good times and the bad times as well we are covered when it comes to dams environmentally we re fully updated and we are aware of all of our dams and what is happening we have been living and working with them for the last 30 40 years there are no novelties we think that we have full control over this and when it comes to the cost structure we re ever more competitive in terms of iron ore we have equalized the quality and with a good market we will gain a great deal with a bad market we will also gain in steel we have that problem with blast furnace number three this is the heart of steel and not being able to produce slabs has led us to buy slabs from third parties at more than brl500 nowadays we purchase slabs at brl360 and we are going to go in with a good average price for the fourth quarter when it comes to slabs and once the blast furnace is operational we have resolved the problem of costs we think that the market allows us to be optimistic it hasn t been easy it is difficult but we see market enhancements and i m going to pressure martinez to end the year without an inventory we do observe a resumption in terms of civil construction the fgts the 13 salary the decrease in interest rate allow us to think that we will have a good fourth quarter in terms of consumption and this will enable us to have a good replenishment of inventory in the first quarter 2020 despite all of the difficulties we look upon the brazilian economy with optimism now the issue of interest the drop in interest rate has been very positive for us we ve plans for the domestic market and foreign market we are expecting a revaluation of rating companies we had dropped seven levels in six months and in the last two years we have been able to recover three of these levels as always the rating agencies allow you to drop a great deal but the return to normalcy is difficult and we are waiting for this before issuing our debentures we have the debentures for energy for the ports and we are going to use that artifice of incentivated debentures to obtain better rates and the issue of cement will improve because of the resumption of civil construction and we are betting on the following that everything has been done when i say that the results of the third quarter are good it is because we don t need to change anything everything is doing well we had those one time issues that can easily be explained but our direction or path is the same the decisions are the same they have been made and as part of what we offered in terms of commitment we have the debt reduction and a great part of this will be attained in the fourth quarter with or without the sale of assets this is a priority one of our greatest concerns if i have to pay sell part of the mining to reach a more comfortable position i ll do this 8 will be readily available for sales and this is one of my desires it s not the market it s not due to analysts or otherwise it is a desire that i have it is not because of 8 of mining that i will not be able to have that tranquility and begin to go on perennially this is a minor effort compared to all of the gains that we will have and this will be done one way or another notwithstanding this i hope to live very long and i know that everything has a right time and we re waiting for that right time to come about but csn from the business viewpoint has done very well we have nothing that we would like to change i do believe we are on the right path we are going to deliver what we have promised i m very insistent in terms of this and the fourth quarter will have to be much better and recover part of what happened in the third quarter we are optimistic and we believe that the fourth quarter 19 will mirror or achieve everything we did not achieve in the third quarter and we are prepared to continue on with our commitments in the year 2020 we want to have a more deleveraged company with the benefit of that potential for growth which means we can grow in steel in mining in cements and infrastructure as well as in energy we are prepared for this we haven t done so yet because we have that commitment of delevering as soon as we attain an adequate level once more we will be prepared to resume our growth the lengthening of the debt has been done in the holding as well as in the company and the dividends were significant because of this we could not have a company with a lengthening of debt and feel pressure at the holding this was a sacrifice that we did because we did analyze this we were able to lengthen both we are in a more comfortable position at present we should have greater ease going forward this is what i wanted to mention and we now offer you the floor all of the executive directors are at your disposal including myself i do highlight once again that the events in the third quarter are easily justifiable the impact on prices for an extremely short period of time we will recover in the fourth quarter and present better results thank you very much we will now go on to the question and answer session for investors and analysts questions and answers operator our first question will be in english and comes from carlos de alba from morgan stanley carlos de alba morgan stanley analyst hello good morning everyone thank you very much the first question is on iron ore sales could you help me understand why we saw a drop in volumes i understand the comments that marcelo made regarding the fact that you sold less to volta redonda but the maintenance or the stoppage of the blast furnace have been scheduled for some time and presumably the company would have planned this ahead of time and still be able to sell those volumes to third parties so could you please help us understand if there was any issues with availability of ships or something at the port or just that the market wasn t there for the company to keep the 10 1 or 10 point something million tons of shipments in the quarter and second if i may ask just on the progression of the lower steel cost i think marcelo mentioned the expectation of a brl300 per ton decline in slab cost is this something that you expect to see already in the third quarter or is going to sorry in the fourth quarter or it s going to be a smooth delivery of this lower cost and then finally if i may what are the trends that you expect on working capital we saw a big decline in receivables in the third quarter inventories remain high i suppose that inventories will decline in the fourth quarter just as the normalization of the steel business takes place but what about receivables a huge benefit in the third quarter how do you see that going forward thank you very much eneas garcia diniz executive officer carlos good morning and thank you very much for your questions this is eneas allow me to explain what happens in terms of production and volume this is a quarter where we had strong production we used 500 million tons to 600 million tons we reduced our purchase volumes as a result we had 600 million tons which is a challenge that will be transferred to the fourth quarter now the result of this level of operations is due to timely logistic problems and the market volatility and because of this we re not able to sell out this product and this will be done with greater challenges in the fourth quarter to confirm our expectation of 40 million tons in sales the fourth quarter will offset the lower sales volume in the third quarter we d like to clarify that we have had no problems in selling iron ore the demand exists it is a commodity we always have a market for it it is simply a price and availability issue we are going into the fourth quarter with a very good inventory we are going to pressure luis martinez to deliver zero inventory and ons will also have to deliver a zero inventory we have orders we have the port the product has been stopped so we should have an excellent fourth quarter when it comes to our profit and because of the inventories that will enable us to offset the third quarter pedro gutemberg quariguasi netto executive officer a question about the cost of slabs this is pedro gutemberg carlos thank you for the question we think the cost of slab will be brl300 lower vis a vis this last quarter and this is the price of iron ore brl1 100 and some per ton this is a preliminary estimate that will be confirmed with the data from our input eneas garcia diniz executive officer and pedro gutemberg knows we are buying slab at 340 we re not traders we are an industry this is the market benchmark and dr gutemberg will have to make efforts to get to that price in terms of cost we simply have to comply with this he refers the brl300 we are going to pressure to obtain more than brl300 and the market serves as a guidance for us and as part of that guidance and effective purchasing prices in one way or another we have to get to that reality we cannot buy at a lower price than we produce and so we re going to try to achieve this level discounting the fiscal credits that some brazilian plants benefit from another important issue to enable you to produce your models let us imagine a cost of slab at brl1 850 a conversion cost of 60 from bq to slab we will get to 520 with bq the average price without pis cofins is 615 615 minus 520 will be 95 per ton in the bq which is not bad at all and this will put us back at a reasonable level if we do not have a price correction now a better scenario the other half that i sell are coated products 63 of our portfolio and we have average prices of three 550 pre painted tin plate zinced with 321 without pis cofins it would represent 805 net minus 660 which is the cost for the galvanized product i have 150 150 plus the 95 of the bq gives us 136 per ton versus 300 000 per month 40 million times four 160 million which would be the results we are projecting for the quarter now this account now these are expectations not projections no this is not a projection this is the reality i can guarantee the price at a cost of brl1 850 there is not very much we can do the price of bq has hit rock bottom and we are going to guarantee facts and data 95 in the bq and in other products where we have 53 our margin is 200 higher by giving the right cost and by working with production levels that are 10 or 15 greater we are going to be delivering 160 million this is not a forecast it s an exercise that we re working on altogether and this would also extend to the coming year 2020 when we will capture some of these benefits well martinez will be the phoenix of csn he will arise from the ashes now simply to complement what was said by martinez with the renovation of the blast furnace we will have a significant increase in production 20 to 30 in 2020 this is why we renovated the blast furnace and this will recompose the steel ebitda another question from carlos refers to working capital and trade receivables in the fourth quarter we expect stability and the effort of course is to increase sales our inventory will help our working capital and possible strategies to offset this when it comes to slab what we see is an upside risk when it comes to cash generation carlos de alba morgan stanley analyst thank you operator our next question will be in portuguese and it comes from thiago lofiego from bradesco bbi you may proceed thiago lofiego bradesco bbi analyst good morning to all and thank you for the call i have two questions we go back to the leveraging cash generations brl380 million normalizing this is a simple account even with the iron ore price quite steep at 100 which will be the evolution of your cash generation ex sale of assets and the leverage of iron ore at lower prices which is the operational variable where you can have an enhancement to sustain cash generation and deleveraging will capex be sufficient or will you work on another variable and as part of this question if you could also refer to your investments more specifically what is happening with wt working capital and if you could speak about the steel market in brazil martinez what have you seen in terms of demand if there is any room to improve the price and what you foresee for the very short term or the next year in terms of price increases and of course there has been a retraction in china which is a reason of concern eneas garcia diniz executive officer martinez would you like to begin luis fernando barbosa martinez commercial officer thiago when it comes to the premium simply to review this if you want to show the graph we are beginning from a very adverse situation of chinese via bq of 450 via bf 290 and there is a curve a price curve that was never that low we are getting to a negative peak when it comes to market prices now if we base ourselves on those prices and think about the prices in the domestic market the premium for bf and bq is approximately 2 for galvanized raw products 11 and for other coated products varying between 8 and 10 there is no possibility in my understanding of importing products with a lower added value and it is not about imports imports have dropped but have had an increase in the galvanized products and we need to be careful with that now when it comes to the csn price strategy we are imagining that until the end of the year the scenario will be of price stability now theoretically there would be room for a price hike but i would prefer to say that we are going to work with a stable scenario until the end of the year when it comes to costs we ve hit rock bottom once again we are ready for a resumption we are going to work at full steam and as benjamin mentioned this is what we are doing we are destocking and we are going to go through the end of the year with the lowest inventory level of finished products at csn in the last five years now our inventory with added value is very strong 53 we continue to have 6 000 clients in our customer base we don t have all of our eggs in the same basket we are working with assembly plants and other industries and there are some scenarios such as civil construction and cement our cement business grew 12 in volume in the third quarter vis a vis the second quarter which clearly shows a resumption in the civil construction segment very shy when compared with the potential that we will see with other concessions and infrastructure construction now if we look at what is happening at present there is a drop in automotive industries and in the truck industry at the beginning of the year it was positive for the year 2020 if the gdp reaches 2 53 there should be a growth of 7 to 8 our scenario as a whole therefore is positive i think there is a general confusion around the world in terms of the price of scrap and iron ore from china and the usa and the trend is for stabilization and this will favor csn we will be able to compete on equal footing when it comes to cash flow we are not expecting too many changes this of course has been a special year with a very robust ebitda but the steel industry is an anchor once the steel industry enhances the ebitda will not change very much we ll have a positive evolution in capex and lower interest rates this will generate a 1 5 cash flow and this is what we are hoping for and what we delivered last year and this year thiago lofiego bradesco bbi analyst at which price level marcelo marcelo cunha ribeiro chief financial and investor relations officer well there is a consensus when it comes to platts the platts will be at approximately 80 for the year 2020 this is what we have established through a consensus thiago when it comes to volumes it is obvious that the volumes we are producing are not the ones we are used to producing they should be higher now another important side of this coin that refers to the market simply to give you an idea of what this quarter was and this year was we bought from usiminas 160 000 tons i don t know if you re aware of this from arcelor bq 40 and 600 000 tons of slab now besides maintaining our market share we practically did not lose market share i feel then the pockets of competitors which is not desirable we are not used to doing this we are going to recover this we are going to bring everything in house it makes no sense to buy so much material to service the market and when this stops we will go back to our previous results i believe there was a question on wt swt when it comes to swt we can say that the business is still alive and kicking moving forward and one step ahead we cannot say more than this these m a issues well we never know about the timing and the possibilities for success we ve been discussing this for mostly a year and this is a serious business it is moving forward this is all we can say at present eneas garcia diniz executive officer thank you martinez thank you for your responses thank you we are now going to go on for the question and answer session for the analysts present at the call now please give us your name and company before posing the question and speak very close to the microphone to guarantee optimum sound quality please wait while we pool our questions leonardo correa btg pactual analyst yeah good morning and thank you i m leonardo correa from btg pactual the first question to martinez an easier question there is a thesis of a struggle for market share specifically in the fourth quarter the blast furnace coming back into operation and there is a thesis that competition will become harsher and there will be a price drop you spoke about stability but i d like you to speak about the competitive scenario which is still very difficult with a scenario of compressed demand and the expectation is that everything will improve in the first quarter or second quarter of 2020 the rest of my questions are to benjamin we have seen csn with an evolution in terms of ebitda for two years a net debt coming to a halt the csn has had difficulties in deleveraging net debt and has been paying dividends this is challenging you were quite assertive at the beginning about the positive sale of casa de pedra 8 of mining are there any conversations under way anything on the radar or is this something that could come about in 2020 the second question we understand the issue of the holding the holding is leveraged and you also have a leveraging at the operating plant my question is if you would consider selling a part of csn to pay the debt of the holding so you don t depend so much on the flow of dividends from the operating company to the holding would you sell part of the share of csn and perhaps suspend the payout of dividends for two or three years eneas garcia diniz executive officer leo this it is not very simple in a very whole style scenario and with a blast furnace under renovation when you buy material from third parties it is not simple to maintain your prices and what you are looking on is what happened with prices on the average but we don t live only from the market of low added value in packaging based on 2018 we re at 114 for packaging in the industry we were at 100 in 2014 we are at 104 and there s a minor correction in the distribution market we have to make this restatement of correction there will not be that price struggle because we have reached a very low point nobody is making money and the blast furnaces of our competitors are also attempting to optimize cost and for this they reduce production they use less pellets to maximize costs not output this is a given and the outlook for prices that we ve for 2020 imagining that the market will have a slight resumption is a recovery already in the first quarter i truly thanks to our portfolio in this fourth quarter do not think of a harsher competition december is a seasonable seasonal month there is no price flexibility and we will have equivalent volumes so i believe the scenario will be stability we will work ever more on a stronger portfolio in the galvanized products our project that has been mentioned frequently is working full steam we are going to create that galvanization line in sao paulo with an investment of brl2 5 billion presently we are defining the location and value to paraiba very close to the markets and we will have a csn portfolio going from 51 52 to 63 of coated products for the coming two years perhaps in the short term and when it comes to the premiums it is important to observe that the price in china at present if you look at the cost of raw material coke and others the chinese and the steel mills that you accompany have a negative ebitda i don t believe that the situation will be maintained for very long and the usa is going through typical moments due to the scrap prices that had a higher drop than iron ore it is below 200 or less and as the market resumes we should have a better point of balance this is what i believe will happen to prices for the end of the year and for the year 2020 leo thank you for what you did last night and i d like to say that you re going to be happier and work more in this coming quarter now to respond to your question objectively we re negotiating the assets in germany it s simply an issue of price now if we have had a year of negotiation it is because there is interest on the part of the buyer side as well as on ours the seller side there is interest and the difficulties will converge and we are reaching the final stages now surprisingly we could sell this in a week or two weeks or not have any business at all we are now at a very conclusive stage when it comes to the possibility of selling off our asset in germany this is what is happening regarding those 8 for mining we have 88 the asian consortium has 12 as you know during the entire year we negotiated the streaming we came very close to working on an operation that was 5 equivalent to the sale of a streaming operation now because of the novelty in terms of iron ore this was lengthened and the operation still has not come out we are also interested in mining it is not difficult to sell a good asset with a high ebitda now this is the crux of the issue you have to do your accounts the market demands from us a mobilization but well what we have in europe could represent brl60 million ebitda or in euros and this is significant because of the business in itself it is a positive business with a positive ebitda it is not difficult to manage and it does contribute to results and we could do the same when it comes to mining mining will give us brl6 billion in terms of ebitda this year or something very close to that so if you do your accounts with this 8 of the brl6 5 billion you will be servicing deleveraging but you will be giving away significant ebitda and this will be sustainable through time as we discussed here as part of this curve we are not doing any miracles in terms of prices it could be 80 or more for the forecast of 2020 80 90 but with 80 we will have a very strong ebitda and we also believe that ebitda will come back constantly in accordance to what we have always delivered csn has always been a company known for its very high ebitdas and we would like to go back to an increase of 30 we cannot work with less than an ebitda of 30 and this is what we are seeking and we will attain that figure and i feel somewhat comfortable in terms of our deleveraging because of ebitda i m not a dreamer we are going to deliver brl7 5 billion or brl8 billion in ebitda something that is very consistent few brazilian and non brazilian companies are able to deliver such a positive ebitda in the unstable situation we see throughout the world and in brazil therefore csn speaks for itself if you compare what the market most values nowadays compared with csn none will deliver the ebitda we will deliver and we are still being strongly penalized because of the past but not because of the present and not because of the future a company with the ebitda that csn has had constantly and because of the assets we may have a drop in mining but an increase in steel and cement so we have diversity of very good assets that can present good figures and they enable us to have the stability this constancy in terms of our ebitda i understand i do not agree with this but i have thought that idea of the market of deleveraging this is a commitment we have made and we are going to honor it if we have to sell those 8 of mining considering the proportionality of ebitda it will simply be to offer me some comfort to be able to work with a less leveraged company as an entrepreneur as a businessman and as i have always done i began by owing everything that i bought from csn we bought 7 from csn leveraged and we have gotten to that 60 at present deleveraged i could say now you have expressed the concern with the holding now the csn dividends policy is regardless of the holding we are going to deliver the minimum dividends every quarter constantly now the issue of the holding and the lengthening of our maturities we are going to resolve with an increase in our price share my challenge is to increase the share of csn not to pay dividends and i believe we can do this in the short term a great deal of what csn suffered was due to its high indebtedness now with the reduction this appreciation in the share will come very speedily i do not believe that we have to sell the share of the holding this is not necessary if we ve to reduce it we have a great deal of room to do this by selling shares from csn and once again we have to do this calculation see if it is worthwhile of course indebtedness is no longer attractive i am 66 years old i do not want to die indebted i do not want to die at all but certainly not as an indebted person but i am fully convinced as i said that this year we would reduce the net debt ebitda ratio to less than 3 times we will only not comply with this if something happens such as foreign exchange or something different otherwise we will be delivering these results and in the year 2020 we will deleverage down to 2 times without taking into account the sale of assets and the keeping in mind the price curve once again prices of iron ore and steel based on what the market wants so despite seeming to be a high leverage and although this seems to be an immediate necessity everything is given as i mentioned formerly we have a delivery of results out of the curve an outlier because of practical results that are well known we can detail them and you will be able to calculate this in the fourth quarter we are going to revert what happened in the third quarter and our commitment and our delivery will be toward a deleveraging for a net debt ebitda ratio of 3 times or below and with this dividend policy being a given we are not going to stop paying the 25 mandatory minimum but we are not going to pay over this either daniel sasson itau bba analyst good morning and thank you for the question daniel sasson from itau bba when it comes to the net debt ebitda of 3 times at the end of the year and ebitda at brl7 5 billion you would have to reduce your debt by almost brl5 million between the third and fourth quarter what are you expecting in terms of sale of assets cash generation and reduction of debt thanks to foreign exchange appreciation as part of this question for benjamin if the end of the year will be a 3 times net debt ebitda ratio which will be the level of tranquility that you mentioned at the beginning of your address the second question referring to csn investments if we could have more color and a ranking of priorities martinez referred to your new galvanized line the expansion of mining what is it that the company will do first or can you do all of this simultaneously has the line of galvanized products been approved at board level and which is the status and the timing that we could work with in terms of these investments thank you benjamin steinbruch president chairman and chief executive officer we will begin with the ratio we expect brl3 billion from financial initiatives m as and or new iron ore deals brl500 million of reduction based on foreign exchange the rest will come from the business now which are the investments which is a very broad question in mining there is an expansion project that has been approved and is under way with 10 million tons that will begin to be built in 2020 and of course this is different from the plant of galvanized products the governments in the state of rio and sao paulo are supporting us in sao paulo we have a memorandum of understanding that is quite advanced but we need to be able to reach the right conditions in terms of funding but we do have support for this what is sustainable what is comfortable because of our type of business would be 2 times net debt ebitda less than this would not be very intelligent i find this comfortable ebitda of 3 5 times net debt ratio is comfortable because of the capital intensive activity that we have and the diversification of commodities and products i have already mentioned this i went abroad and i was surprised with the market demand and the lack of stability now this account of 3 5 times for a stable or predictable market would be comfortable but because of what we see worldwide in terms of political economic instability and because of those sudden oscillations make people request a lower indebtedness a lower ratio that is why i have made a commitment to deliver this reduction 3 times this year and the coming year 2 times and ensuing that we will have a certain comfort it would not be intelligent on our part to abuse the market and another trend that we are working on is to move away from bank credits and obtain this from the market now if we do this abroad or locally the terms will be much longer therefore when i speak about this net debt ebitda ratio of 2 times this will be with a lengthened period which gives us even greater comfort and moving away from commercial bank loans in the short term this is what we are working toward and i believe we can comply with this strategy at the end of the year 2020 gabriela cortez bb banco de investimento analyst good morning gabriela from bank of brazil martinez i have a question regarding the price scenario for the coming year you re pointing to a scenario that is somewhat discrepant toward what we have we have a global de acceleration and we think this will have an impact on demand and prices you have proven to be more positive so what is it that you are thinking about these two factors now for eneas in terms of the pricing of iron ore from csn what do you expect for the fourth quarter are you expecting a discount for silica lower freights what is it that we can expect in terms of prices benjamin steinbruch president chairman and chief executive officer benjamin well we had somebody that was 93 years old this year so you do have a great deal of time simply to conclude and the issue of investment is important for analysts and for the market csn has investments under way that are investments that will bring a significant return in a very short term operational adjustment and all of this has been done and we analyze them in terms of the return for the company we are always attentive to opportunities any large investment that you do in steel in mining or cement in the best of hypothesis if everything works out you have 18 or 24 months for approval so when we speak about a possible new galvanized plant or a new cement plant if we speak about the expansion of casa de pedra to be able to do this environmentally and in fiscal terms we cannot make this happen before those 18 months or 24 months and this is something i would like to clarify my sister for example who is a shareholder called me yesterday it was said in the newspapers in aracaju that we were investing in a cement plant because there was a public hearing for the environment and i called her back and i said in the best of hypothesis if everything works out it will take us 18 months or 24 months to begin and of course in that case if we deliver what we have committed to this year and the coming year csn in 2021 will have that net debt ebitda ratio of 2 times allowing us to begin moving forward now we have to begin doing all of this before and you should know that nothing expressive will be happening before that 18 month period production adjustments intelligent investments with a large return that yes we will continue doing but nothing that may cause a concern financially gabriela to speak about the prices from now on to the end of the year a scenario of stability we are beginning to negotiate a price increase for automotive assembly plants for 2020 we are renegotiating all of the contracts of car parts the automobile industry and some companies where we have six month contracts the white appliances some industrial sectors where we maintain our prices for specific periods for the year 2020 we will be able to capture increases and the enhancement of the results in csn will come from cost and not due to a recomposition of price as happened in 2018 if we look at the sector as a whole if you look at the balance of distributors we could not live in a sector without profitability as a whole not either the plant or the distributors are making money and we have lost the market logic everything is wrong we seem to resume toward something that is more coherent something with reasonable profit profitability and a more sustainable value chain therefore prices can no longer drop the coming year there will be a positive trend in industry and distribution that buys a great deal of bq and bf the premium is negative we have never had a negative premium perhaps 17 years ago it was much lower as a premium nowadays and theoretically we should be at 5 no longer 20 as we had in the past 5 would be reasonable it will depend on demand on the exchange rate and on the performance of industrial chains but i think that the greatest profitability leverage for csn will be the cost and we will do whatever possible in this field now the composition of cost at csn is important which is our basket for sales 20 for europe 20 japan and korea with a semester lagging and 60 to china on the date of arrival of the ship we had a drop of 30 in iron ore and this impacted us on this third quarter and freight we had freight of 29 30 while the expectation is to have a reduction in freight for the fourth quarter we expect a platts with an increase in prices possibly why iron ore at 120 has motivated several plants to go back to production in china all of the iron ore companies have a loss so there is a trend for an adjustment a flat price with a lower freight cost premiums coming back this is what we hope for the fourth quarter a large volume of sales this is a challenge so the expectation within the scenario is to have better results in terms of prices caio ribeiro credit suisse analyst good morning caio ribeiro from credit suisse i have two short questions the first referring to investments and the investments which will be the timing and the execution of your sale of stake at usiminas and what is happening in terms of your project and which are the necessary disbursements for csn the second question goes to benjamin you mentioned that you have rolled the holding debt i would like to know what this represents because year after year you have been rolling the amortization of the debentures and i d like to know if this debt rolling means a better negotiation or if you are postponing these installments for the coming year for 2020 thank you eneas garcia diniz executive officer regarding usiminas there are no secrets it is a market issue and the market isn t there so this will not be happening in the short term but it is there as an asset that we would like to sell off and it will help us in the deleveraging in terms of the nordestina product it is a commitment of csn through a constructive negotiation with the government we plan to reinitiate works create employment and services with an investment of brl250 million and csn is ensuring that this will happen in the short term to be able to reestablish public funding that up to recently had come to a standstill but what csn did was this gesture to reestablish the funding that had already been contracted and had come to a standstill this is what we have negotiated with the government in terms of the holding well marcello referred to usiminas i would love to sell usiminas unfortunately i have to await the right price the same with germany if we get the right price we will sell it and usiminas is no longer part of the company s strategy at the right time we will dispose of this asset when it comes to the holding marcos is here we have lengthened this for 22 23 or 21 22 what happened there seven years two of grace period five of principal and semestral payments to pay the interest rates for those who did not hear this that debenture is a debenture that in its emission works with rieke it s on the site iaco com this is where you will be able to find all of the details on this debenture it is a definite lengthened debenture with an interest rate grace period of two years now from the viewpoint of the holding this was something definite when i said that we had resolved the situation because this separates anything from the holding the controlling company and the controlled company and transnordestina we are putting forward this gesture of goodwill we would like to reinitiate the works we have offered 2 million to get to paes landim in piaui where regardless of going forward we would already be able to obtain cargo in paes landim in piaui and we will conclude that stretch to piaui and then begin to work on that stretch to ceara and up to fortaleza once again this is a gesture of goodwill and we have the commitment of the government from sudene and the bank of the northeast to make allocations in this work site and we will hold this conversation in a timely way with the government once again to work with our resources and those coming from the government as well antonio neto bank of merrill lynch analyst antonio heluany from bank of america the first question to marcelo in the last quarter you had some questions from the analysts when it comes to your cash reconciliations you had additional costs and some questions on your cash generation and the question in terms of your capex for 2020 if you could give us more color what do you have budgeted what will come from steel from mining and expansion and the last question to pedro regarding the blast furnace renovation which were the surprises when you began on this work and which will be the blast furnace ramp up going forward marcelo cunha ribeiro chief financial and investor relations officer in terms of the difference we have a definition of working capital associated to the business which is inventory suppliers and trade receivables and a broader line at csn that involves all of the current asset lights the first had a gain of brl1 2 billion especially trade receivables with a drop in inventory what impacted cash was brl400 million lower brl750 million approximately now this difference can be explained by two lines brl150 million an amortization of the prepayment deliveries that we do to glencore where we have already received the cash in the past i pause here because this is temporary because new prepayment operations will be done in the core short term and brl150 million are taxation credits temporary differences for example for the acquisition of slabs that we bought in the local market with our credit of icms there is a balance that will be subsequently consumed these are the main differences in terms of working capital now it is premature to speak about the capex for 2020 it will be 10 or 15 below the one of this year we still do not have a complete breakdown for this pedro gutemberg quariguasi netto executive officer antonio good morning regarding the blast furnace question when you carry out renovations in the blast furnace you have some alternatives one of them is when you have the outflow of the pit iron in the blast furnace and you have this alternative what happened is that we had a higher volume of residues and it was more difficult to carry out the cleaning to be able to reconstruct this area our decision therefore when faced with this decision was to transform a threat into an opportunity we saw that this blast furnace would have a delay in maintenance we made the most of the opportunity carried out other low cost works that were very important in our sintering machines and in the steel mill and the greatest cost was the cost of opportunity of not having production i think this was the decision that we took when we discovered that there were more residues than expected in the blast furnace regarding the ramp up if everything goes according to plans between sunday and monday we will restart the blast furnace there is a 10 day curve where we have an increase of production a gradual and controlled increase we have to be very cautious with this and on november 10 or 15 we do believe we will return to a normal production a higher production as mentioned than the one we had before the blast furnace stoppage now this is what we have planned for the start up again of this blast furnace number 3 operator thank you as we have no further questions we would like to return the floor to mr ribeiro the cfo and iro officer for his final remarks i give the floor to our chairman for closing remarks marcelo cunha ribeiro chief financial and investor relations officer i would like to thank all of you we will repeat this model which we think is very propitious it enables us to meet to speak prior and subsequently to the call perhaps at a different schedule 8 30 9 00 you can have breakfast with us we can hold a conversation present results and everybody can return to work at 10 30 this is the ideal model and with excellent figures i truly hope to be here i ll be here to present what we have set forth to present annually and for the quarter we are on the right path we have taken the right decisions you always have difficulties one time problems and we need to resolve them and continue moving forward our intention is to have a modern and transparent company with state of the art technology producing diversified added value products this is our quest this is our day to day to guarantee that all of our directors and employees are working in an attuned way csn sets itself aside in the market we should have a profit of brl26 billion with an ebitda between brl7 5 billion and brl8 billion and i think this speaks for itself everything that might seem somewhat hyperbolic or overly optimistic we are delivering if you look at the billing of csn it has always grown in the last few years we work fully we do not have lay offs we have continued to work despite the market difficulties and difficulties in working capital paying the expressive interest rates at brazil we have never laid off employees we have had consistent ebitda this is what motivates us and propels us forward so that we can have a more streamlined company geared to the market to favor both its shareholders and employees thank you very much and until january of 2020 or perhaps february or march well the better the results the sooner our call next year thank you very much operator duration 94

saskatoon the eurozone is in a bind despite successive doses of monetary stimulus by the european central bank ecb inflation remains stubbornly below target conventional monetary policy and even quantitative easing evidently have limited potency when interest rates are at or near zero monetary skeptics worry moreover that lowering rates further will damage europe s banks additional asset purchases beyond the monthly level of 20 billion euros 22 billion already agreed they warn will impair the liquidity of financial markets by pushing up asset prices the ecb could expose the financial system to stability risks when those lofty prices return to earth the obvious event precipitating this return would be a recession and when this downturn materialises the ecb will have limited room for offsetting action again because interest rates are already low the solution to this conundrum suggested by ecb president christine lagarde is greater reliance on fiscal policy by purchasing government bonds bearing negative interest rates investors are literally begging european governments to borrow so long as growth rates remain stuck at low levels because of anemic private spending a bit of additional public spending is just what the doctor ordered if the economy nonetheless sinks into recession fiscal stimulus can be ramped up still further the problem is that national policymakers in a number of eurozone countries starting with germany are dead set against fiscal expansion believing that they are being asked to encumber their children with debt in order to provide the stimulus that countries like italy are unable to deliver they happily invoke the eu s fiscal rules to justify not running budget deficits this impasse has prompted suggestions that the ecb should pursue fiscal policy by stealth for example it could adopt a policy of dual interest rates it could pay positive rates when taking deposits from commercial banks cushioning the banks profitability it could then lend to those same banks at sharply negative rates giving them money on such concessional terms that they would find lending it irresistible the ecb has experimented with these policies on a small scale under its so called tltro ii program but by expanding a policy under which it paid more on its liabilities than it charged on its assets the ecb would incur losses and erode its capital to be sure central banks can operate with negative capital financing themselves by printing money but the longer they do so the more observers anticipating ongoing money creation will come to doubt the credibility of monetary policy the ecb s shareholders meaning european governments might then feel compelled to recapitalise it at a significant cost to themselves critics in germany and elsewhere will therefore challenge the legality of such policies citing the strict separation between monetary and fiscal policy in the european treaties one response is who cares treaty provisions can be creatively reinterpreted when exigent circumstances require this has happened more than once in the euro s two decades but the legitimacy of the ecb depends on more than legal formalities fundamentally it derives from public support and public opinion toward quasi fiscal measures by the ecb would be strongly negative in countries like germany the german government channeling this popular indignation could protest in a variety of ways such as refusing to participate in eu decision making processes requiring unanimous consent anyone familiar with the empty chair crisis of 1965 when france refused to occupy its seat in the council of ministers over a dispute about the common agricultural policy will appreciate how disruptive such a protest can be rather than attempting to circumvent the intent of the ecb s statute the resources of the european investment bank should be enlisted the eib has 70 billion euros of paid in capital and reserves and 222 billion euros of callable capital it has a board of directors from all 28 eu member states limiting the danger of capture its charge is to fund sustainable investment projects and it is empowered to borrow for that purpose because it is required to place its bonds with private investors it is subject to market discipline and it earns positive returns on its investments ramping up its borrowing and spending would be entirely consistent with its mandate eib lending is limited to 250 per cent of the capital subscribed by its shareholders to make a difference now much less in a recession this capacity would have to be scaled up significantly to be sure proposals for doing so will meet with political resistance from those who fear that a larger eib would be a loss making eib but significant losses are unlikely in an environment where borrowing costs are only a fraction of the return on equity investment this in any case is the debate europe should be having tackling the stimulus issue head on is more likely

see some premarket jitters it might have been due to a report by the south china morning post stating it s increasingly unlikely that a u s china deal will get done this week as u s officials focus on a trade pact between the united states mexico and canada but a subsequent report by the wall street journal said the two nations are working on a possible delay of the dec 15 tariffs equity index

an interim deal before then the world s two largest economies have been trying to hammer out a deal for some time now and uncertainty surrounding the trade situation has been the biggest headwind facing wall street but recently excitement about a partial trade deal getting done soon has helped push the market to record highs in november optimism around trade as well as better than expected

this week the federal reserve starts its meeting today with a policy announcement expected wednesday the central bank is also expected to release a new dot plot showing where the federal open market committee members expect rates to go over the next couple of years as of late monday the futures market was pricing in a near certainty that the fed will leave its key short term interest rate unchanged even though it doesn t seem like the fed will alter rates at this week s meeting it could still be interesting to see whether policy makers weigh in on last week s bumper jobs report and if the language accompanying wednesday s rate decision gets interpreted by the market as more hawkish as a result chart of the day juggling the news on a day when stocks drifted lower the s p 500 fell

image reuters amol agrawal the year 2019 has seen deaths of quite a few economists and policymakers martin feldstein martin weitzman alan krueger and subir gokarn my tribute paul volcker former chairperson of the us federal reserve joins this unfortunate list as he passed away on december 8 2019 story continues below advertisement remove ad his death saw immediate tributes from jerome powell current chair of the fed and congresswoman maxine waters d ca chairwoman of the house committee on financial services in these times when there is so much mistrust between the government and economic policymakers any such tribute is great and also tells you the respect volcker enjoyed across generations of economists and policymakers in an earlier review on tenure of mario draghi i wrote draghi has established a new standard replacing greenspan i was wrong as volcker is perhaps the only standard for central bankers volcker has left an indelible mark in macroeconomics and central banking in 1970s the us along with major economies was struggling with high inflation the high inflation was a result of loose monetary policy in the 1960s which in turn was based on the belief in philips curve the curve implied that there was a trade off between inflation and unemployment this led the us polity trading off lower unemployment that led to higher inflation the higher inflation in turn sparked higher inflation expectations and the likes of milton friedman and edmund phelps did warn against this trade off business but they were ignored the higher expectations stoked much higher inflation and along with oil shocks inflation hovered around 15 percent by 1980s enter volcker who was appointed head of the federal reserve in august 1979 interestingly volcker s undergraduate thesis was titled the problems of federal reserve policy since world war ii where he criticised fed s policies to stabilise inflation in ww ii volcker shocked the system by tightening monetary policy significantly to lower inflation even at the cost of pushing us economy into a recession this approach to monetary policy that too in the world s biggest economy was obviously not going to be ignored and became an immediate legend no macroeconomics course can be complete without mentioning the legacy of volcker there are famous tales of agriculturists and businesses protesting against these rate increases even making the whole decision a stuff of animated discussion us inflation declined by 1983 and has remained under control ever since he showed in practice the importance of keeping inflation expectations under control and these lessons were then not lost out to subsequent central bankers the monetary frameworks changed from monetary targeting to inflation targeting but the basic idea of keeping inflation expectations anchored remained the impact of volcker at the federal reserve was so great that he has been engaged in some public service or the other in 2009 president obama appointed volcker to chair the president s economic recovery advisory board more famously he was the architect of volcker rules to restore confidence in the us financial system the volcker rules build a chinese wall between banking and investment banking activity it prohibited banks from engaging in proprietary trading and from acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in or sponsoring a hedge fund or private equity fund these rules were later incorporated in the dodd frank act which made sweeping and burdensome regulations for the us financial sector story continues below advertisement remove ad with every praise there should be criticism as well some will argue that the volcker era also led to the development of cult image of central bankers this made central bankers and central banking look larger than life volcker was really tall which added to the overall aura as well this image was further enhanced by greenspan only to be shattered by the 2008 crisis however there have been others who joined the race such as draghi and even raghuram rajan who have been seen as central bankers who could do no wrong this makes jobs of their successors really difficult and leads to unrealistic expectations from central banks reading a bit about volcker one is sure he himself would not be happy about this development in another criticism jerome roos of the lse london school of economics recently tweeted how volcker s monetary policy resulted in a debt crisis in latin america and was responsible for the socio economic crisis in the region these economies had borrowed money in us dollars the higher us interest rates not just raised interest payments but also led to depreciation in latin american countries further fuelling the debt crisis roos adds that president ronald reagan deployed the imf international monetary fund as a lender of last resort to ensure wall street bankers were paid in full but should this criticism apply to volcker alone as he was simply trying to control inflation and tighter monetary policy was the way to do it in fact the central lesson of any development is not to be greedy and overborrow however latin american countries have repeated these mistakes throughout their history overall volcker not just entered macroeconomics hall of fame but made a permanent place for himself former fed chair ben bernanke paid tributes to friedman on his 90th birthday saying i would like to say to milton and anna regarding the great depression you re right we did it we re very sorry but thanks to you we won t do it again on volcker s death taking a cue from bernanke s words all the central bankers in the world past and present can give a joint statement we would like to say to paul regarding cause of inflation you re right we did it we re very sorry but thanks to you we will try our best not to do it again amol agrawal is faculty at ahmedabad university views are personal

after paul volcker retired from the federal reserve a friend dropped by his office in new york he began to regale volcker with tales of how his son who worked for a hedge fund was making big money and living lavishly volcker shot back i have something he doesn t have the friend puzzled asked what it was volcker answered in one word enough volcker who died dec 8 at 92 should be remembered for saying enough to two u s presidents two treasury chiefs his fellow democrats in congress and to wall street in the process volcker saved the u s dollar and preserved the idea of independent professionalism

inflation troubling industrial democracies he meant that political pressure for cheap money was too powerful to resist and for burns it had been advertisement when president richard nixon appointed burns in 1969 he called him in for a chat and bluntly told him you see to it no recession nixon was worried that high interest rates would torpedo his chances for reelection and made a sneering crack to burns about the myth of the autonomous fed burns complied with nixon s directive and ran an expansionary monetary policy nixon won reelection in a landslide but by the mid 70s inflation seemed uncontrollable chronic even during periods of slow growth a scary phenomenon known as stagflation for which central bankers didn t have a solution then came volcker six days after burns s address volcker announced that instead of directly targeting interest rates the fed would target the volume of bank reserves in the system and it would allow the federal funds rate to go as high as needed to reduce reserves by making the level of interest rates a dependent variable volcker bought himself a little political cover he wasn t the one raising rates he was just following a formula advertisement but he knew that the financial system was awash in excess credit and he knew that his approach would lead to sharply higher rates when volcker took over the fed funds rate was just under 11 percent by june 1981 it was over 19 percent share this article share think of paying 18 percent for a mortgage or an auto loan and you will understand the distress of ordinary americans volcker s remedy engineered not one severe recession but two of them back to back construction executives sent two by fours to volcker in a menacing protest congress was furious rep henry gonzález a texas democrat threatened to impeach him carter a democrat lost the white house partly because of volcker s policies his successor ronald reagan who was of course a republican praised volcker in public but quietly worked to undermine him appointing governors to the federal reserve board that voted against him reagan s secretary of treasury don regan openly lambasted his policies advertisement volcker didn t back down in congressional hearings he was just as brusque as he was in private even after inflation had peaked he refused to lower interest rates as quickly as reagan wanted and when reagan offered to visit the fed volcker said no thanks it would cast a dubious light on the fed s independence of course the fed wasn t entirely independent congress created the fed and ultimately holds the reins sarah binder co author of a book on the fed says volcker s independence was built on his appreciation of the need to develop an initial base of support volcker was a civil servant inspired by his father a town official in teaneck n j who insisted on a sufficient distance from elected officials to pursue the public interest in my experience he was gruff because he was shy slightly uncomfortable his brusqueness was a shield he deployed to resist political pressure as well as public opinion stock market traders included his politics were less partisan than was sometimes assumed his dedication to a sound dollar earned him the enmity of many democrats later in his career his revulsion for speculative trading turned him into a regulatory hawk and a scourge of wall street obituaries citing his frugal lifestyle cheap cigars ill fitting suits write of his disdain for bankers advertisement the truth was more complicated he did live modestly as a public servant but he was a banker before and after various stints in government in his later years as chief executive of wolfensohn co he became wealthy he was a good fed chair not because he disliked bankers but because he was a banker of the old school profit and loss variety as early as 1960 as a banker at chase manhattan he was monitoring the london gold price and worrying about a jittery dollar a decade later he was undersecretary for monetary affairs and warned the nixon administration it had only two years to save the dollar in short volcker was a practitioner expert today fed officials tend to be economists and academics most have never written a loan volcker represented the triumph of the bureaucrat professional exactly what president trump is bent on destroying advertisement volcker used the independence he created for himself to prescribe painful economic medicine in the quest of longer term stability and the greater good that took guts

capitalism rules the world with only the most minor exceptions the entire globe now organizes economic production the same way labor is voluntary capital is mostly in private hands and production is coordinated in a decentralized way and motivated by profit there is no historical precedent for this triumph in the past capitalism whether in mesopotamia in the sixth century bc the roman empire italian city states in the middle ages or the low countries in the early modern era had to coexist with other ways of organizing production these alternatives included hunting and gathering small scale farming by free peasants serfdom and slavery even as recently as 100 years ago when the first form of globalized capitalism appeared with the advent of large scale industrial production and global trade many of these other modes of production still existed then following the russian revolution in 1917 capitalism shared the world with communism which reigned in countries that together contained about one third of the human population now however capitalism is the sole remaining mode of production it s increasingly common to hear commentators in the west describe the current order as late capitalism as if the economic system were on the verge of disappearing others suggest that capitalism is facing a revived threat from socialism but the ineluctable truth is that capitalism is here to stay and has no competitor societies around the world have embraced the competitive and acquisitive spirit hardwired into capitalism without which incomes decline poverty increases and technological progress slows instead the real battle is within capitalism between two models that jostle against each other often in human history the triumph of one system or religion is soon followed by a schism between different variants of the same credo after christianity spread across the mediterranean and the middle east it was riven by ferocious ideological disputes which eventually produced the first big fissure in the religion between the eastern and western churches so too with islam which after its dizzying expansion swiftly divided into shiite and sunni branches and communism capitalism s twentieth century rival did not long remain a monolith splitting into soviet and maoist versions in this respect capitalism is no different two models now hold sway differing in their political economic and social aspects in the states of western europe and north america and a number of other countries such as india indonesia and japan a liberal meritocratic form of capitalism dominates a system that concentrates the vast majority of production in the private sector ostensibly allows talent to rise and tries to guarantee opportunity for all through measures such as free schooling and inheritance taxes alongside that system stands the state led political model of capitalism which is exemplified by china but also surfaces in other parts of asia myanmar singapore vietnam in europe azerbaijan russia and in africa algeria ethiopia rwanda this system privileges high economic growth and limits individual political and civic rights these two types of capitalism with the united states and china respectively as their leading examples invariably compete with each other because they are so intertwined asia western europe and north america which together are home to 70 percent of the world s population and 80 percent of its economic output are in constant contact through trade investment the movement of people the transfer of technology and the exchange of ideas those connections and collisions have bred a competition between the west and parts of asia that is made more intense by the differences in their respective models of capitalism and it is this competition not a contest between capitalism and some alternative economic system that will shape the future of the global economy in 1978 almost 100 percent of china s economic output came from the public sector that figure has now dropped to less than 20 percent in modern china as in the more traditionally capitalist countries of the west the means of production are mostly in private hands the state doesn t impose decisions about production and pricing on companies and most workers are wage laborers china scores as positively capitalistic on all three counts capitalism now has no rival but these two models offer significantly different ways of structuring political and economic power in a society political capitalism gives greater autonomy to political elites while promising high growth rates to ordinary people china s economic success undermines the west s claim that there is a necessary link between capitalism and liberal democracy capitalism has no rival but its two variants offer significantly different ways of structuring political and economic power liberal capitalism has many well known advantages the most important being democracy and the rule of law these two features are virtues in themselves and both can be credited with encouraging faster economic development by promoting innovation and social mobility yet this system faces an enormous challenge the emergence of a self perpetuating upper class coupled with growing inequality this now represents the gravest threat to liberal capitalism s long term viability at the same time china s government and those of other political capitalist states need to constantly generate economic growth to legitimize their rule a compulsion that might become harder and harder to fulfill political capitalist states must also try to limit corruption which is inherent to the system and its complement galloping inequality the test of their model will be its ability to restrain a growing capitalist class that often chafes against the overweening power of the state bureaucracy as other parts of the world notably african countries attempt to transform their economies and jump start growth the tensions between the two models will come into sharper focus the rivalry between china and the united states is often presented in simply geopolitical terms but at its core it is like the grinding of two tectonic plates whose friction will define how capitalism evolves in this century liberal capitalism the global dominance of capitalism is one of two epochal changes that the world is living through the other is the rebalancing of economic power between the west and asia for the first time since the industrial revolution incomes in asia are edging closer to those in western europe and north america in 1970 the west produced 56 percent of world economic output and asia including japan produced only 19 percent today only three generations later those proportions have shifted to 37 percent and 43 percent thanks in large part to the staggering economic growth of countries such as china and india capitalism in the west generated the information and communications technologies that enabled a new wave of globalization in the late twentieth century the period when asia began to narrow the gap with the global north anchored initially in the wealth of western economies globalization led to an overhaul of moribund structures and huge growth in many asian countries global income inequality has dropped significantly from what it was in the 1990s when the global gini coefficient a measure of income distribution with zero representing perfect equality and one representing perfect inequality was 0 70 today it is roughly 0 60 it will drop further as incomes continue to rise in asia although inequality between countries has lessened inequality within countries especially those in the west has grown the united states gini coefficient has risen from 0 35 in 1979 to about 0 45 today this increase in inequality within countries is in large part a product of globalization and its effects on the more developed economies in the west the weakening of trade unions the flight of manufacturing jobs and wage stagnation liberal meritocratic capitalism came into being in the last 40 years it can be best understood in comparison to two other variants classical capitalism which was predominant in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and social democratic capitalism which defined the welfare states in western europe and north america from world war ii to the early 1980s although inequality between countries has lessened inequality within countries has grown unlike in the classical capitalism of the nineteenth century when fortunes were to be made from owning not working rich individuals in the present system tend to be both capital rich and labor rich that is they generate their income both from investments and from work they also tend to marry and make families with partners of similar educational and financial backgrounds a phenomenon sociologists call assortative mating whereas the people at the top of the income distribution under classical capitalism were often financiers today many of those at the top are highly paid managers web designers physicians investment bankers and other elite professionals these people work in order to earn their large salaries but whether through an inheritance or their own savings they also draw a great deal of income from their financial assets in liberal meritocratic capitalism societies are more equal than they were during the phase of classical capitalism women and ethnic minorities are more empowered to enter the workforce and welfare provisions and social transfers paid out of taxes are employed in an attempt to mitigate the worst ravages of acute concentrations of wealth and privilege liberal meritocratic capitalism inherited those last measures from its direct predecessor social democratic capitalism that model was structured around industrial labor and featured the strong presence of unions which played a huge role in shrinking inequality social democratic capitalism presided over an era that saw measures such as the gi bill and the 1950 treaty of detroit a sweeping union negotiated contract for autoworkers in the united states and economic booms in france and germany where incomes rose growth was distributed fairly evenly populations benefited from better access to health care housing and inexpensive education and more families could climb up the economic ladder but the nature of work has changed significantly under globalization and liberal meritocratic capitalism especially with the winnowing away of the industrial working class and the weakening of labor unions since the late twentieth century the share of capital income in total income has been rising that is an increasing portion of gdp belongs to the profits made by big corporations and the already wealthy this tendency has been quite strong in the united states but it has also been documented in most other countries whether developing or developed a rising share of capital income in total income implies that capital and capitalists are becoming more important than labor and workers and so they acquire more economic and political power it also means an increase in inequality because those who draw a large share of their income from capital tend to be rich malaise in the west while the current system has produced a more diverse elite in terms of both gender and race the setup of liberal capitalism has the consequence of at once deepening inequality and screening that inequality behind the veil of merit more plausibly than their predecessors in the gilded age the wealthiest today can claim that their standing derives from the virtue of their work obscuring the advantages they have gained from a system and from social trends that make economic mobility harder and harder the last 40 years have seen the growth of a semipermanent upper class that is increasingly isolated from the rest of society in the united states the top ten percent of wealth holders own more than 90 percent of the financial assets the ruling class is highly educated many of its members work and their income from that labor tends to be high they tend to believe that they deserve their high standing these elites invest heavily both in their progeny and in establishing political control by investing in their children s education those at the top enable future generations of their kind to maintain high labor income and the elite status that is traditionally associated with knowledge and education by investing in political influence in elections think tanks universities and so on they ensure that they are the ones who determine the rules of inheritance so that financial capital is easily transferred to the next generation the two together acquired education and transmitted capital lead to the reproduction of the ruling class the formation of a durable upper class is impossible unless that class exerts political control in the past this happened naturally the political class came mostly from the rich and so there was a certain commonality of views and shared interests between politicians and the rest of the rich that is no longer the case politicians come from various social classes and backgrounds and many of them share sociologically very little if anything with the rich presidents bill clinton and barack obama in the united states and prime ministers margaret thatcher and john major in the united kingdom all came from modest backgrounds but quite effectively supported the interests of the one percent in a modern democracy the rich use their political contributions and the funding or direct ownership of think tanks and media outlets to purchase economic policies that benefit them lower taxes on high incomes bigger tax deductions higher capital gains through tax cuts to the corporate sector fewer regulations and so on these policies in turn increase the likelihood that the rich will stay on top and they form the ultimate link in the chain that runs from the higher share of capital in a country s net income to the creation of a self serving upper class if the upper class did not try to co opt politics it would still enjoy a very strong position when it spends on electoral processes and builds its own civil society institutions the position of the upper class becomes all but unassailable as the elites in liberal meritocratic capitalist systems become more cordoned off the rest of society grows resentful malaise in the west about globalization is largely caused by the gap between the small number of elites and the masses who have seen little benefit from globalization and accurately or not regard global trade and immigration as the cause of their ills this situation eerily resembles what used to be called the disarticulation of third world societies in the 1970s such as was seen in brazil nigeria and turkey as their bourgeoisies were plugged into the global economic system most of the hinterland was left behind the disease that was supposed to affect only developing countries seems to have hit the global north workers at a s teel production plant in jilin province china 2006 ian teh panos pictures redux china s political capitalism in asia globalization doesn t have that same reputation according to polls 91 percent of people in vietnam for instance think globalization is a force for good ironically it was communism in countries such as china and vietnam that laid the groundwork for their eventual capitalist transformation the chinese communist party came to power in 1949 by prosecuting both a national revolution against foreign domination and a social revolution against feudalism which allowed it to sweep away all ideologies and customs that were seen as slowing economic development and creating artificial class divisions the much less radical indian independence struggle in contrast never succeeded in erasing the caste system these two simultaneous revolutions were a precondition over the long term for the creation of an indigenous capitalist class that would pull the economy forward the communist revolutions in china and vietnam played functionally the same role as the rise of the bourgeoisie in nineteenth century europe in china the transformation from quasi feudalism to capitalism took place swiftly under the control of an extremely powerful state in europe where feudal structures were eradicated slowly over centuries the state played a far less important role in the shift to capitalism given this history then it is no surprise that capitalism in china vietnam and elsewhere in the region has so often had an authoritarian edge the system of political capitalism has three defining features first the state is run by a technocratic bureaucracy which owes its legitimacy to economic growth second although the state has laws these are applied arbitrarily much to the benefit of elites who can decline to apply the law when it is inconvenient or apply it with full force to punish opponents the arbitrariness of the rule of law in these societies feeds into political capitalism s third defining feature the necessary autonomy of the state in order for the state to act decisively it needs to be free from legal constraints the tension between the first and second principles between technocratic bureaucracy and the loose application of the law produces corruption which is an integral part of the way the political capitalist system is set up not an anomaly the flip side of china s astronomic growth has been its massive increase in inequality since the end of the cold war these characteristics have helped supercharge the growth of ostensibly communist countries in asia over a 27 year period ending in 2017 china s growth rate averaged about eight percent and vietnam s averaged around six percent compared with just two percent in the united states the flip side of china s astronomic growth has been its massive increase in inequality from 1985 to 2010 the country s gini coefficient leapt from 0 30 to around 0 50 higher than that of the united states and closer to the levels found in latin america inequality in china has risen starkly within both rural and urban areas and it has risen even more so in the country as a whole because of the increasing gap between those areas that growing inequality is evident in every divide between rich and poor provinces high skilled workers and low skilled workers men and women and the private sector and the state sector notably there has also been an increase in china in the share of income from privately owned capital which seems to be as concentrated there as in the advanced market economies of the west a new capitalist elite has formed in china in 1988 skilled and unskilled industrial workers clerical staff and government officials accounted for 80 percent of those in the top five percent of income earners by 2013 their share had fallen by almost half and business owners 20 percent and professionals 33 percent had become dominant a remarkable feature of the new capitalist class in china is that it has emerged from the soil so to speak as almost four fifths of its members report having had fathers who were either farmers or manual laborers this intergenerational mobility is not surprising in view of the nearly complete obliteration of the capitalist class after the communists victory in 1949 and then again during the cultural revolution in the 1960s but that mobility may not continue in the future when given the concentration of ownership of capital the rising costs of education and the importance of family connections the intergenerational transmission of wealth and power should begin to mirror what is observed in the west compared with its western counterparts however this new capitalist class in china may be more of a class by itself than a class for itself china s many byzantine forms of ownership which at the local and national levels blur the lines between public and private allow the political elite to restrain the power of the new capitalist economic elite for millennia china has been home to strong fairly centralized states that have always prevented the merchant class from becoming an independent center of power according to the french scholar jacques gernet wealthy merchants under the song dynasty in the thirteenth century never succeeded in creating a self conscious class with shared interests because the state was always there ready to check their power although merchants continued to prosper as individuals as the new capitalists largely do nowadays in china they never formed a coherent class with its own political and economic agenda or with interests that were forcefully defended and propagated this scenario according to gernet differed markedly from the situation around the same time in italian merchant republics and the low countries this pattern of capitalists enriching themselves without exercising political power will likely continue in china and in other political capitalist countries as well a clash of systems as china expands its role on the international stage its form of capitalism is invariably coming into conflict with the liberal meritocratic capitalism of the west political capitalism might supplant the western model in many countries around the world the advantage of liberal capitalism resides in its political system of democracy democracy is desirable in itself of course but it also has an instrumental advantage by requiring constant consultation of the population democracy provides a powerful corrective to economic and social trends that may be detrimental to the common good even if people s decisions sometimes result in policies that reduce the rate of economic growth increase pollution or lower life expectancy democratic decision making should within a relatively limited time period correct such developments political capitalism for its part promises much more efficient management of the economy and higher growth rates the fact that china has been by far the most economically successful country in the past half century places it in a position to legitimately try to export its economic and political institutions it is doing that most prominently through the belt and road initiative an ambitious project to link several continents through improved chinese financed infrastructure the initiative represents an ideological challenge to the way the west has been handling economic development around the world whereas the west focuses on building institutions china is pouring money into building physical things the bri will link partnered countries into a chinese sphere of influence beijing even has plans to handle future investment disputes under the jurisdiction of a chinese created court quite a reversal for a country whose century of humiliation in the nineteenth century was capped by americans and europeans in china refusing to be subject to chinese laws many countries may welcome being part of the bri chinese investment will bring roads harbors railways and other badly needed infrastructure and without the type of conditions that often accompany western investment china has no interest in the domestic policies of recipient nations instead it emphasizes equality in the treatment of all countries this is an approach that many officials in smaller countries find particularly attractive china is also seeking to build international institutions such as the asian infrastructure investment bank following the playbook of the united states after world war ii when washington spearheaded the creation of the world bank and the international monetary fund beijing has another reason to be more active on the international stage if china refused to advertise its own institutions while the west continued to advance the values of liberal capitalism in china large swaths of the chinese population could become more attracted to western institutions the current disturbances in hong kong have failed to spread anywhere else in china but they do illustrate real discontent with the arbitrary application of the law discontent that may not be confined to the former british colony the blatant censorship of the internet is also deeply unpopular among the young and educated by projecting the advantages of its political capitalism abroad china will reduce the appeal of the western liberal model to its own citizens its international activities are essentially matters of domestic survival whatever formal or informal arrangement beijing reaches with states that embrace political capitalism china is bound to exercise increasing influence on international institutions which in the past two centuries have been built exclusively by western states to serve western interests a chinese construction worker in colombo sri lanka june 2018 adam dean the new york times redux the future of capitalism john rawls the consummate philosopher of modern liberalism argued that a good society ought to give absolute priority to basic liberties over wealth and income experience shows however that many people are willing to trade democratic rights for greater income one need simply observe that within companies production is generally organized in the most hierarchical fashion not the most democratic workers do not vote on the products they would like to produce or on how they would like to produce them hierarchy produces greater efficiency and higher wages technique is the boundary of democracy the french philosopher jacques ellul wrote more than half a century ago what technique wins democracy loses if we had engineers who were popular with the workers they would be ignorant of machinery the same analogy can be extended to society as a whole democratic rights can be and have been given up willingly for higher incomes in today s commercialized and hectic world citizens rarely have the time the knowledge or the desire to get involved in civic matters unless the issues directly concern them it is telling that in the united states one of the oldest democracies in the world the election of a president who in many respects in the american system has the prerogatives of an elected king is not judged of sufficient importance to bestir more than half the electorate to go to the polls in this respect political capitalism asserts its superiority the problem however is that in order to prove its superiority and ward off a liberal challenge political capitalism needs to constantly deliver high rates of growth so while liberal capitalism s advantages are natural in that they are built into the setup of the system the advantages of political capitalism are instrumental they must be constantly demonstrated political capitalism starts with the handicap of needing to prove its superiority empirically it faces two further problems as well relative to liberal capitalism political capitalism has a greater tendency to generate bad policies and bad social outcomes that are difficult to reverse because those in power do not have an incentive to change course it can also easily engender popular dissatisfaction because of its systemic corruption in the absence of a clear rule of law unlike liberal capitalism political capitalism must be permanently on its toes political capitalism needs to sell itself on the grounds of providing better societal management higher rates of growth and more efficient administration including the administration of justice unlike liberal capitalism which can take a more relaxed attitude toward temporary problems political capitalism must be permanently on its toes this may however be seen as an advantage from a social darwinist point of view because of the constant pressure to deliver more to its constituents political capitalism might hone its ability to manage the economic sphere and to keep on delivering year in year out more goods and services than its liberal counterpart what appears at first as a defect may prove to be an advantage but will china s new capitalists forever acquiesce to a status quo in which their formal rights can be limited or revoked at any moment and in which they are under the constant tutelage of the state or as they become stronger and more numerous will they organize influence the state and finally take it over as happened in the united states and europe the western path as sketched by karl marx seems to have an ironclad logic economic power tends to emancipate itself and to look after or impose its own interests but the track record of nearly 2 000 years of an unequal partnership between the chinese state and chinese business presents a major obstacle to china s following the same path as the west the key question is whether china s capitalists will come to control the state and if in order to do so they will use representative democracy in the united states and europe capitalists used that cure very carefully administering it in homeopathic doses as the franchise slowly expanded and withholding it whenever there was a potential threat to the property owning classes as in great britain after the french revolution when the right to vote became even more tightly restricted chinese democracy if it comes will likely resemble democracy in the rest of the world today in the legal sense of mandating one vote per person yet given the weight of history and the precarious nature and still limited size of china s propertied classes it is not certain that rule by the middle class could be maintained in china it failed in the first part of the twentieth century under the republic of china which held sway over much of the mainland from 1912 to 1949 only with great difficulty will it be reestablished with greater success 100 years later plutocratic convergence what does the future hold for western capitalist societies the answer hinges on whether liberal meritocratic capitalism will be able to move toward a more advanced stage what might be called people s capitalism in which income from both factors of production capital and labor would be more equally distributed this would require broadening meaningful capital ownership way beyond the current top ten percent of the population and making access to the top schools and the best paying jobs independent of one s family background to achieve greater equality countries should develop tax incentives to encourage the middle class to hold more financial assets implement higher inheritance taxes for the very rich improve free public education and establish publicly funded electoral campaigns the cumulative effect of these measures would be to make more diffuse the ownership of capital and skills in society people s capitalism would be similar to social democratic capitalism in its concern with inequality but it would aspire to a different kind of equality instead of focusing on redistributing income this model would seek greater equality in assets both financial and in terms of skills unlike social democratic capitalism it would require only modest redistributive policies such as food stamps and housing benefits because it would have already achieved a greater baseline of equality if they fail to address the problem of growing inequality liberal meritocratic capitalist systems risk journeying down another path not toward socialism but toward a convergence with political capitalism the economic elite in the west will become more insulated wielding more untrammeled power over ostensibly democratic societies much in the same way that the political elite in china lords over that country the more that economic and political power in liberal capitalist systems become fused together the more liberal capitalism will become plutocratic taking on some features of political capitalism in the latter model politics is the way to win economic benefits in plutocratic formerly liberal meritocratic capitalism economic power will conquer politics the endpoint of the two systems will be the same the closing ranks of a privileged few and the reproduction of that elite indefinitely into the future

involves additional risks including limited diversification the fund may invest in small capitalization and mid capitalization companies such companies may experience greater price volatility than larger more established companies the fund may be a constituent of one or more indices as a result the fund may be included in one or more index tracking exchange traded funds or mutual funds being a component security of such a vehicle could greatly affect the trading activity involving the fund s shares the size of the fund and the market volatility of the fund an investment in a fund containing securities of non u s issuers is subject to additional risks including currency uctuations political risks withholding the lack of adequate nancial information and exchange control restrictions impacting non u s issuers changes in currency exchange rates and the relative value of non us currencies may affect the value of a fund s investments and the value of a fund s shares these risks may be heightened for securities of companies located in or with signi cant operations in emerging market countries the fund may invest in depositary receipts which may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market the fund is subject to certain risks specifically associated with investments in the securities of asian issuers many asian economies have experienced rapid growth and industrialization and there is no assurance that this growth rate will be maintained some asian economies are highly dependent on trade and economic conditions in other countries within and outside asia can impact these economies the economy of china differs often unfavorably from the u s economy in such respects as structure general development government involvement wealth distribution rate of in ation growth rate allocation of resources and capital reinvestment among others the central government has historically exercised substantial control over virtually every sector of the chinese economy through administrative regulation and or state ownership actions of the chinese central and local government authorities continue to have a substantial effect on economic conditions in china furthermore china s economy is dependent on the economies of other asian countries and can be signi cantly affected by currency uctuations and increasing competition from asia s other emerging economies the fund is subject to certain risks associated speci cally with hong kong including hong kong s political and economic environment and the volatility of and the concentration of real estate companies listed on the hong kong stock exchange because of hong kong s reversion to china any increase in uncertainty as to the economic and political status of hong kong or a deterioration of the relationship between china and the u s could have negative implications on stocks listed on the hong kong stock exchange securities prices on the hong kong stock exchange can be highly volatile and are sensitive to developments in hong kong and china as well as other world markets a significant number of countries in europe are member states in the european union and the member states no longer control their own monetary policies in these member states the authority to direct monetary policies including money supply and official interest rates for the euro is exercised by the european central bank although the long term effects of the united kingdom s referendum on june 23 2016 to leave the eu known as brexit are difficult to gauge and cannot be fully known they could have wide ranging implications for the united kingdom s economy the stocks of companies that have recently conducted an initial public offering are often subject to price volatility and speculative trading these stocks may have exhibited above average price appreciation in connection with the initial public offering prior to inclusion in the fund the price of stocks included in the fund may not continue to appreciate and their performance may not replicate the performance exhibited in the past as the use of internet technology has become more prevalent in the course of business the fund has become more susceptible to potential operational risks through breaches in cyber security the fund is classified as non diversified and may invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in a limited number of issuers as a result the fund may be more susceptible to a single adverse economic or regulatory occurrence affecting one or more of these issuers experience increased volatility and be

the rise of populist movements and street protests from chile to france has made inequality a high priority for politicians of all stripes in the world s rich democracies but a fundamental question has received relatively little attention what type of inequality should policymakers tackle cambridge inequality looms larger on policymakers agenda today than it has in a long time with the political and social backlash against the established economic order fueling the rise of populist movements and street protests from chile to france politicians of all stripes have made the issue an urgent priority and whereas economists used to fret about the adverse effects of egalitarian policies on market incentives or the fiscal balance now they worry that too much inequality fosters monopolistic behavior and undermines technological progress and economic growth the good news is that we have no shortage of policy tools with which to respond to rising inequality at a recent conference i organized with olivier blanchard a former chief economist of the international monetary fund a group of economists advanced a wide range of proposals covering all three dimensions of an economy pre production production and post production important pre production interventions are educational health and financial policies that shape the endowments with which individuals enter markets tax and transfer policies that redistribute market income fall within the post production category the remaining category production stage interventions includes perhaps the most pioneering ideas policies in this category directly target firms employment investment and innovation decisions by shaping relative prices the bargaining environment between claimants to output workers and suppliers in particular and the regulatory context examples are minimum wages labor relations rules employment friendly innovation policies place based policies and other types of industrial policies and anti trust enforcement some policies such as early childhood interventions workforce development programs and public funding of tertiary education are well tested and there is evidence that they work others such as a wealth tax remain controversial or as with place based policies are accompanied by considerable uncertainty regarding their optimal design nonetheless there is a growing consensus that some policy experimentation is desirable and necessary but a fundamental question has received relatively little attention what type of inequality should these measures tackle policies to address inequality typically focus either on reducing incomes at the top as with progressive income taxation or on lifting the incomes of the poor through say cash grants to families below a poverty line subscribe to ps digital subscribe to ps digital access every new ps commentary our entire on point suite of subscriber exclusive content including longer reads insider interviews big picture big question and say more and the full ps archive subscribe now such policies should be expanded especially in a country like the united states where existing efforts are insufficient but today s inequality also calls for a different approach that focuses on the economic insecurities and anxieties of groups at the middle of the income distribution our democracies can minimize the threats of social strife nativism and authoritarianism only by boosting the economic wellbeing and social status of middle and lower middle class workers the need for such an approach is reflected in the fact that conventional indicators of inequality are a poor predictor of economic and political discontent in democracies in france for example the far right has made large gains and social protests by so called yellow vests have been pervasive yet inequality as measured by the gini coefficient or top income shares has not increased much unlike in most other rich democracies likewise current street protests in chile come after two decades of significant reduction in income inequality us president donald trump s election in 2016 was rooted not in the poorest states but in those where economic opportunity and employment creation lagged behind the rest of the country clearly the discontent stems from inequality of a different kind affecting mostly the middle of the income distribution a key part of the problem is the disappearance and relative scarcity of good stable jobs deindustrialization has laid to waste many manufacturing centers a process aggravated by economic globalization and competition from countries such as china technological changes have had particularly adverse consequences for jobs in the middle of the skill distribution affecting millions of production clerical and sales workers the decline of labor unions and policies to increase the flexibility of labor markets has further contributed to the casualization of employment another part of the story not reflected in conventional measures of inequality is the increasing geographical social and cultural separation between large segments of the working class and the elites this is reflected most immediately in spatial segmentation between prosperous cosmopolitan urban centers and lagging rural communities smaller towns and outlying urban areas these spatial gaps drive and are reinforced by broader social cleavages professional metropolitan elites are plugged in to global networks and are highly mobile this makes their influence on governments all the stronger while distancing them from the values and priorities of their less fortunate compatriots who become estranged and resentful of an economic political system that apparently neither works nor cares for them the inequality manifests itself in the form of a perceived loss of dignity and social status on the part of less educated workers and other outsiders economists are coming to recognize that combating the resulting polarization depends in large part on reinvigorating the economy s capacity to generate good jobs there is no shortage of ideas here either labor market institutions and global trade rules need to be reformed to strengthen the bargaining power of labor vis à vis globally mobile employers firms themselves must take on bigger responsibilities for their local communities employers and suppliers government support of innovation must be directed toward explicitly employment friendly technologies we can envisage an entirely new regime of public private collaboration in the service of building a good jobs economy many of these ideas are untested but new challenges require new remedies if we are not ready to be bold and imaginative in the service of creating inclusive economies we will cede the ground to hawkers of old tested and disastrous ideas

that takes us back in ages we long passed said emmanuel mahlangu zicom s president we recommend institutional deliveries the risk of childbirth going wrong any minute is too high the leading cause of deaths worldwide is bleeding during childbirth labor taking too long and rupture of the woman s uterus specialists battle with such risks every day there is a risk of infections from the use of traditional herbs and dirty equipment in a dirty environment it s a definite no for non institutional deliveries related hospitals on venezuela border turning into cemeteries for migrants mahlangu said 85 of pregnancies are normal and can be managed by midwives but doctors are critical for complicated pregnancies about 10 of pregnancies need specialist obstetrician care following complications in pregnancy such cases are managed at referral hospitals the absence of doctors and specialists at such hospitals is detrimental to the provision of care he said the southern african nation s maternal mortality rate is estimated to stand at 651 deaths per 100 000 live births according to the zimbabwe demographic health survey united nations population fund unfpa states that even though the trend in the last 5 10 years shows a decline the ratio is still unacceptably high dr fortune nyasha nyamande spokesperson for the zimbabwe association of doctors for human rights said the strike poses an existential threat to the health of pregnant women and it disrupts access to antenatal delivery and postnatal care with huge implications on morbidity and mortality rates related to maternal health nyamande said maternal health interventions such as early antenatal appointments prevention of parent to child transmission programs deliveries supervised by qualified health personnel and post natal care and monitoring are all rendered unavailable by the continued failure to meet the demands of doctors and nurses related mothers and babies lack basic needs in greek refugee camps skilled care before during and after childbirth can save the lives of women and newborns said itai rusike executive director of the community working group on health he said poor quality of care remains an issue for maternal and child health services in the public health institutions during the strike he worries that the prolonged impasse may result in the reversal and erosion of gains achieved in the elimination of mother to child transmission of hiv and syphilis zimbabwe is committed to eliminating mother to child transmission of hiv and syphilis by 2022 the targets set in the plan are to attain 95 antenatal and neonatal care attendance 95 antenatal care testing for both hiv and syphilis and to reach 95 of hiv positive pregnant women with antiretroviral therapy and treat 95 of syphilis

group had been pursuing the best means of bringing massawa discovered by its legacy company randgold resources 10 years ago to account for the full benefit of all stakeholders the agreement with teranga which will realise the full value of this asset and create a substantial new west african gold mining company with significant african ownership is the outcome of this process teranga has the appropriate infrastructure and processing facilities approximately 25 kilometres away from massawa and combining the orebodies and the geological prospectivity will add further benefits bristow said the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020 and is subject to receipt of the massawa exploitation license and residual exploration license from the government of senegal as well as certain other acknowledgments and approvals from the government of senegal including teranga s integration plans for the sabodala massawa complex the transaction is also conditional upon the closing of teranga s concurrent debt financing prospectus financing and private placement financing each of which are also inter conditional as well as other customary closing conditions for a transaction of this kind massawa massawa was discovered by randgold resources limited which merged with barrick effective january 1 2019 on july 23 2019 barrick voluntarily filed a technical report under national instrument 43 101 standards of disclosure for mineral projects ni 43 101 on the feasibility study of the massawa gold project senegal the massawa feasibility study the massawa feasibility study disclosed mineral resource statements as well as mineral reserve estimates as of december 31 2018 which remain current for barrick as of the date hereof as the mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates pre date teranga s agreement to acquire massawa teranga is treating them as historical estimates under ni 43 101 but they remain relevant as the most recent mineral resource and reserves estimates for massawa further drilling and resource modelling would be required to upgrade or verify these historical estimates as current mineral resources or reserves for the combined sabodala massawa complex and accordingly they should be relied upon only as a historical resource and reserve estimate of barrick which pre dates teranga s agreement to acquire massawa a teranga qualified person under 43 101 has not done sufficient work to classify the historical estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves for the combined sabodala massawa complex and teranga is not treating the historical estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves massawa contains 2 6 million ounces of proven and probable historical mineral gold reserves calculated at a gold price of 1 200 oz approximately 80 of the ore is expected to be processed through whole ore leach carbon in leach cil with the balance processed through a biox circuit the massawa feasibility study envisioned building all phase 1 and phase 2 infrastructure for approximately 333 million and later adding a biox circuit to process refractory ores in the later stages of the mine life for an additional 80 million for a total capital cost of 413 million the massawa standalone operation was expected to produce an average of approximately 200 000 ounces of gold per year over the first 10 years 5 sabodala massawa complex massawa s permits and the sabodala mine license are contiguous with each other see appendix figure 1 massawa hosts historical mineral reserves of 2 6moz from 20 9mt at 3 94 g t au 6 and sabodala s mineral reserves are 2 4moz from 55 7mt at 1 35 g t au 7 sabodala currently mines between 35 and 40 million tonnes of material and processes over 4 million tonnes of ore per year teranga plans to integrate the high grade ore from the massawa deposits into an optimized combined mine plan for sabodala leveraging its existing infrastructure plant mobile equipment and personnel minimal changes are required to sabodala s existing cil plant and infrastructure to process free milling ore from the massawa project this reduces the initial phases of capital costs included in the massawa feasibility study teranga is targeting to commence processing free milling ore from the massawa deposits at its existing cil plant in the second half of 2020 teranga intends to mine and process massawa s high grade reserves on a priority basis and it is anticipated that by 2021 more than half of the ore processed through the sabodala plant could potentially be sourced from the massawa deposits based on the massawa feasibility study and sabodala s current mine plan the sabodala massawa complex is expected to increase sabodala s existing gold production profile teranga and barrick have invested significant resources in due diligence to gain a better understanding of the technical details of the massawa orebodies to help teranga develop an optimized integrated mine plan for the two properties this includes detailed resource modelling for the mineralogical characterization the chronology of metallurgical test work to determine biox as the process of choice for the refractory ore in a retrofitted sabodala plant and a revised life of mine plan that optimizes the timing of the sabodala and massawa orebodies for processing as well as annual operating and capital costs this detailed due diligence work will form a basis for initiating a pre feasibility study the combined pfs that the company plans to complete for the integrated sabodala massawa complex within six months of closing of the transaction the combined pfs will target the mining of the massawa deposits beginning in the second half of 2020 as currently targeted by teranga in advance of an integrated definitive feasibility study the company will embark on a drill program to expand the resource base of the massawa project the definitive feasibility study which is expected to be completed in 2021 will assess the optimal size of the retrofit and the timing of implementation for processing of the refractory components of the massawa ore the streaming agreement in place with franco nevada barbados corporation franco nevada dated december 12 2013 as amended the fn stream entitles franco nevada to 6 of sabodala s future gold production the fn stream does not extend to the massawa gold project area however pursuant to the fn stream teranga must ensure franco nevada is not disadvantaged as a result of the displacement of sabodala ore and therefore teranga will continue to deliver the anticipated ounces based on sabodala s most current standalone life of mine operating plan financing the transaction funding the upfront consideration the upfront consideration totals 380 million and consists of approximately 300 million in cash and an aggregate of approximately 80 million in teranga shares issued to barrick and csttao in total 225 million of the upfront consideration will be

the dollar and yen mostly held the safe haven high ground on tuesday with investors wary of a looming deadline for u s tariffs on china the british election and upcoming federal reserve and european central bank meetings front of mind is whether washington will go ahead with a fresh round of tariffs on sunday or whether a deal with china can be reached before then white house economic adviser larry kudlow said on friday that the dec 15 deadline is still in place but agriculture secretary sonny perdue on monday raised the possibility the tariffs are not imposed there s risks both ways said westpac fx analyst imre speizer trade s still the flip floppy factor but i think markets are still reasonably upbeat about risk seeking all these little movements are only smoke and noise and don t really tell you what s going on cautiously positive would be the overall mood soaring inflation in china ahead even of lofty expectations had little effect on a market waiting for trade news against the japanese yen the greenback found support after last week s declines steadying at 108 62 yen the dollar dipped slightly against the euro to 1 1066 and was steady against a basket of currencies at 97 623 the new zealand dollar rallied as bears trimmed short bets following a slew of recent upbeat economic data rising 0 2 to 0 6560 and dragging the australian dollar higher with it to 0 6828 the u s dollar s recovery after weakness last week has been supported by a surge in hiring in november that has investors almost certain that the u s federal reserve will hold rates steady when their two day meeting concludes on wednesday increasing investors focus on the outlook and on finding a trade war truce china said on monday it hoped to make a trade deal with the united states as soon as possible though gave no new details or insight into the progress of the talks we expect regional currencies to stay moribund as we await news on the trade front said oanda analyst jeffrey halley elsewhere the european central bank is likewise expected to keep interest rates steady while the pound s fate is in the hands of voters at thursday s british election sterling nudged higher to 1 3150 just below a seven month high hit last week as polls pointed to a conservative victory decisive enough to secure a parliamentary majority growth data due at 0930 gmt followed by a yougov poll due at 2200 gmt will offer the latest updates on economics and politics if the uk bookies prices are a reasonable guide to market expectations for thursday s election it is hard to see much more upside for gbp on the outcome said adam cole chief currency strategist at rbc capital markets despite the confidence with which markets predict a conservative victory there are still several major uncertainties he added pointing to unpredictable turnout and polling showing a sizeable chunk of undecided voters source reuters by tom westbrook
